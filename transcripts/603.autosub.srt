My break but I mean look

9
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,920
It's going to be counted in sort of a negative

10
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:26,528
Right

11
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,832
Monday's episode

12
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,856
Load of people

13
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,672
Saying such positive things about the

14
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,232
And like that is really nice although it is

15
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
Very hard for me to deal with

16
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,608
Not having the brain that I have

17
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
It's as if I'm being

18
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,912
Given

19
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:47,264
Terrible feedback if I were a normal person

20
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,312
But it's kind of immersion therapy

21
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,360
Lots of compliments and positive

22
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,712
Stop it I appreciate that I appreciate that

23
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,248
Well I mean you're built like a balloon

24
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,064
You can handle a certain amount

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
Papa

26
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,904
But go too far and that sucker is going to pop

27
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:10,816
That was a flood of positive stuff could only handle a tiny bit

28
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,632
You're very small balloon I did I was trying to be really nice

29
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:19,264
I'm a balloon that functions Vasquez about

30
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,544
Empty

31
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,664
Remaining Luftballons

32
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
Something

33
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,504
Been trying to to get better at

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,528
Like accepting posit

35
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
Dolphin

36
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088
I definitely

37
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,416
Definitely appreciate it I was happy with the episode

38
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,440
Yeah that's okay

39
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,464
Is fantastic

40
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,792
Edwards

41
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,120
What about you

42
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,240
I feel like whatever I say after that is going to be real late.

43
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:56,640
But it's my partner's birthday coming up soon happy birthday and I have decided at this point

44
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,968
I used to go out like four or five nights a week

45
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,992
For a decade

46
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:07,392
Get out of doing, and then in the past 3 years it's just doing the down to almost nothing like I just stay

47
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,744
So we're going to start doing just weird random stuff

48
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,304
And so for her birthday this year

49
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,096
We have decided to go to a casino

50
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,400
Neither of us Gamble

51
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,472
Nearest like to gamble going to be overwhelmed

52
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,288
It's basically a spin the wheel and we'll just

53
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:30,688
Go you guys are going to be so overwhelmed

54
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,224
I think you understand the

55
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
Type of

56
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,904
The cross-section you get when they're go to the casino people just sitting there at the slots just endlessly bully

57
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,952
I've been to Vegas twice

58
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,232
And it was the worst

59
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:49,632
Both times this one I think is going to be in either Indiana or Michigan or Wisconsin

60
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,776
Gostica fair but I can't wait to put it on the list man

61
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:01,664
Well that sounds depressing but one fun thing that a friend and his wife

62
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,760
They would go and they would choose a random.

63
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,832
I don't usually go on

64
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,624
And just get off

65
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,720
And spend the day around that L stop to fantastic idea

66
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,024
Has like some kind of

67
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,423
Excitement Randomness culture

68
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:28,287
City that you f****** love so much somehow I we just do not see it

69
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,103
Beyond your normal beaten path Lane

Missouri

71
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:44,415
There is a riverboat casino that was a good like half hour drive maybe 45 minute drive from

00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183

73
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,743

Savannah Burger

75
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:54,143
I think some other people like to go to but those are the two buddies that I remember who like

76
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679
He would go to the Sea do

77
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,215
Go to the casino

78
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,031
And we we spent some time down there wasted

79
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
And

80
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
I don't know how this happened

81
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,455
Okay that's a good start

82
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,991
But I think Nick

83
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,527

00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,591

By default

108
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247

Giving someone life is giving someone dead

You can say that

141
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
Life is death

146
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
Obviously not good

147
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,279
But he he knows that there's a difference but

148
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,071
Emotional reaction

149
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
And thought-out

00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
Somebody's got to.

152
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,079
We really should all just sit back

153
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
For a moment

154
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
Take a deep breath

155
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,943
Cogitate

156
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
Or meditate

157
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
Georgia stats

158
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807

Tom Leander

160
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,439
So stop meditate

161
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
Cerebral level

162
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
And then we have to make

163
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,351
Decisions that a cerebro Bible and then emotionally

164
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
Amway

165
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,239
Use the emotions the good lord gave us

166
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,799
Very aggressively power

167
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
Against the globalist

169
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455

That neck

176
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,047
Quickly and easily

177
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607

Historical metaphor that is

180
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,543
Historically

181
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,943
As as we all know you must calmly decide to do something and then let your emotions take over

182
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
Whereas you killed

183
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
That was a that was an adventure

184
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,855
Does adventure of like Haley's cogitate

Heritage Square

00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,471
Take the emotion part out of it okay

191
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239
If you just

192
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:22,335
Let's go on emotions right you will be able to achieve your goal or whatever

193
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,383
No problem.

194
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:29,247
Hey I'm going to tear your head off

195
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,575
Focus Laika is it is in state

196
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,671
And get your resolve ready and know that your goal is to

197
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:42,559
Twist-off desperate head paint myself like the wall of a bank and then when a despot walks

198
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Biology

199
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,351
Just appear in

00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
Marillion

Yubin

203
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,751
Cogitate

204
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,615
So visit no-man's-land about them

205
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
Cuz a little bit into the show we get a guest

206
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,247
I'll give you one clue about who he is

207
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
Either Health right

208
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,319
If my got them

209
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,903
Great job reporting a story that broke

210
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
Thursday evening

211
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,511
Angle 2 and angle of a ipower

212
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
DOD data analysis program

213
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,863
Project solace

214
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,911
Chatters official vaccine narrative

215
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,471
Accelerating in the fully

216
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
Lady is the big one

217
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,663
Saw this and didn't follow the links

218
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,735
I have a whole stack of Articles here

219
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
First

220
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,343
This is from mainstream news

221
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,047
Almost 5.6 million Medicare beneficiaries

222
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,607
55 years and older this is a particular

223
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,887
September 28th

224
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911
2021

225
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,495
Discovered by a lawyer

226
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:02,687
So first of all it's important to note that this is Project Salas not project Solus

227
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:06,271
Project Solus is a 2d platformer you can buy on Steam

228
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,599
This is an AI initiative that's run by the department

229
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
That's fair enough

230
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,183
The jaico projects

231
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,231
That's something else entirely

232
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:20,351
The jic or the joint Artificial Intelligence Center launch project salad

233
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
In March

234
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,911
2020s quote

235
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:27,263
A predictive tool to help identify where critical supply chain shortages were occurring

236
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,287
During the pandemic

237
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,359
Essentially it compiled a ton of data together and use it to make

238
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,919
Predictions about where resources should be allocated

239
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
This document that Alex's.

240
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
Think about that Mike Adams

241
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,807
Apparently reported on is a PowerPoint presentation that was

242
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
Put together by

243
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
Humetrix

244
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
Say medical app

245
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,135
Developer

246
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,927
Who was seeking to answer some questions like

247
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,975
Consulting data from Project Salas

248
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
Eccentric

249
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,559
They were concerned with had to do with vaccine effective

250
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,351
And whether or not it waned over

251
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,423
They were further interested in reduced Effectiveness with

252
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,751
Delta variant and among people in subpopulations

253
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
Within the data

254
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:04,383
Information that it would be hard to just compiled and analyzed on your own yes

255
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:08,223
Essentially they found that there may be some concern about waning effectiveness of

256
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:12,319
MRNA vaccines but there's some huge caveat to have to get window

257
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
Discussing this PowerPoint presentation

258
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,671
The first thing is that the data that they're using

259
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,207
Only covers people six

260
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
55 and older

261
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,023
It's not necessarily something you can

262
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
Extrapolate

263
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
The entire population

264
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,143
Also is very important point is that this is a

265
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,935
PowerPoint presentation

266
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
If you're looking at the slide you can

267
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,775
Computer basically the visual aids

268
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,079
Did someone is put together to help them in giving a lecture

269
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,383
You're missing the essential context

270
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,431
Of the person's actual presentation

271
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,479
Which isn't being captured in the PowerPoint

272
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,039
Mason point to slide number 9

273
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
They were looking at vaccine vaccine effectiveness

274
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
Endive

275
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
Three to four months

276
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,463
Post vaccination. And 5 to 6 month

277
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
Supposed

278
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,815
This slide shows that their age distribution is heavily skewed

279
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,863
With people 85 and older making up

280
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,911
43% of the folks at the five

281
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
26-month group

282
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,495
But only 14% at least three to four

283
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,799
Okay conversely people aged

284
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,591
65 to 74

285
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,895
51% of the 324 month group

286
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,943
And only 24% of these five

287
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
The six-month

288
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:18,367
The fact that the 52 six-month groups use much older is more complicated

289
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
And as such the slide included

290
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,695
Discussion question on the sidebar

291
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:27,071
Could higher proportion of 85 years and older members in the first vaccinated group

292
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,375
Explain reduced vaccine effective

293
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,495
If you only have the PowerPoint to go off of you have this discussion question but you don't have the discussion

294
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,567
Also none of the stuff that Alex is saying about this having to do with it

295
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,103
Lady Is Real at all

296
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,663
It's just made up explanations for data that they do

297
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
Care to try to

298
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,015
The bunch of bulshit they're going up a PowerPoint presentation

299
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
I am creating

300
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
The fun conspiracy

301
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,367
Yeah could

302
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:56,255
A large number of people who six months

303
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,303
After anything might be

304
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,863
Askew

305
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,703
This isn't even about this is about breakthrough

306
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,751
Breakthrough infection

307
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,287
I mean obviously

308
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,103
There's no way that that can't have some effect

309
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,943
What's the date of it being presented

310
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
Ed in this PowerPoint presentation

311
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Presentation

312
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,015
If everything

313
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
King is

314
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,087
Aboveboard and everything is accurate

315
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,415
It does introduce some interesting questions for people to look into it

316
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,695
Does not introduce conclusion

317
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
It's 88

318
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
They're being unfair

319
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:35,935
I don't know if my cat is gets his hand on a PowerPoint presentation that's all I need to hear

320
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,471
What I needed to know

321
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,031
Mike the dramatic Ranger is

322
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
Is over

323
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
Freaky

324
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
Website

325
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,943
It was still live on there I don't know if it's there now

326
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
But this is DOD

327
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,271
This is their jic

328
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,111
So

329
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,159
Some secret Source somewhere this is open-source until

330
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
What it shows a couple

331
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,231
Very

332
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:00,767
One is that

333
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
The

334
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
Negative side

335
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Text

336
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,375
The vaccine

337
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,191
Get worse over time with each pass

338
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,519
And so the

339
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,079
Hospitalizations and ice

340
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
I see you

341
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
As well as deaths

342
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
It's very bad

343
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
At 3 to 4 months

344
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,479
Roughly doubles in about

345
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
6 months

346
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,111
So this presentation is nothing to do with negative side effects of the vaccine

347
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:34,047
Is he trying to say that when you get the vaccine you have negative side effects that only continue to get worse apparently

348
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:39,167
This document is entirely about the efficacy overtime of the vaccine factoring in age group as a very

349
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:46,079
Well that was totally made-up it's fair to say that this live show does seem to indicate that there is an increase in breakthrough cases at the

350
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,407
Does a decrease in vaccine efficacy between e324 month

351
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
N52 6-month group

352
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,479
Mike is ignoring all the

353
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:56,575
The context and the suggestions of possible explanations for the data presented because

354
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,367
He has his own explanation that he was once

355
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,391
Jamdown the audience

356
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
Throat

357
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
Also

358
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:07,583
On flight 68 literally says that the rate of hospitalization drop by a third comparing breakthrough cases to

359
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
People in the same age group

360
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,887
Who just got covid

361
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,935
Before the vaccines World out in March

362
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
December twenty

363
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
Reported

364
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Not only that

365
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,823
In breakthrough infections there was a 2.1% death rate

366
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
Among people aged 65 and up

367
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,199
Compared to a 12% death rate in that same.

368
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,479
Between March and December

369
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
For 2020

370
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,831
Mike is entirely misrepresenting his PowerPoint presentation in order to make a

371
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,879
The fraudulent argument against vaccination

372
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,743
I said it before and I'll say it again every time he's on this is surprisingly weak stuff

373
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,559
From the health Ranger I'm underwhelmed

374
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,351
You know I

375
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
Since I was grown

376
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,191
I always sell Rangers

377
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
As like

378
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,519
Ballon like no

379
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
Erica

380
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,943
You know what I'm saying something about Strider

381
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,527
Is exiled used to be a king or whatever solving problem

382
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,063
And this man

383
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,599
Is no Aragorn

384
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
Answer

385
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
No Aragorn that's all

386
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:11,327
I would love for you to slap Mike Adams Piccolo's

387
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,935
Not only is michaelmas

388
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:22,335
Representing and misusing The Zeta he just decides that he can do whatever he wants with it

389
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
There's no rules

390
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,479
Looks like a flatline projection so if we continue to project this

391
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,783
To let's say 9 months

392
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,831
My switch is coming up in

393
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
Immediate future

394
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
Looks like this is going to

395
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
And it looks

396
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,655
We're going to see probably

397
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,447
This is my estimation this another

398
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,007
Estimation we're going to see Millions

399
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
Of Americans

400
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,847
Suffering severe hospitalizations and deaths

401
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
Vaccines

402
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,711
So that's where we are

403
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
So like making all that up

404
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,039
What are you saying is that he looked

405
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,111
At this graph any decided to draw what do you want

406
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
What's after the pain to stop

407
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,415
I was going to say

408
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:12,511
That look I mean that's all he's doing

409
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
Norbert

410
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
On the 1st

411
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,959
Sinbad Shawarma was waiting off and he hit a homerun

412
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:27,359
This would be exactly like my cat was like well obviously he's going to hit 162 this year

413
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:33,759
Game that's one everyday not only that but every at-bat

414
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,063
A homerun

415
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,415
Just based on the information in this PowerPoint presentation are very strong indication

416
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,719
Is that Mike will be totally wrong with his predict

417
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:47,839
For one thing he seems to be ignoring that this data is just a group of people 65 and older

418
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:53,471
Secondly because the age distribution in the 3-2 four-month group and the 52 6-month group is so different

419
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,799
There's not necessarily going to be this straight-line phenomenon like is

420
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,567
Predicting

421
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,639
As time goes on the average age of people getting vaccinated

422
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,175
Depends to go down

423
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,759
Because the elderly were top priority and initially for

424
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:12,671
The proportion of the people aged 85 and older goes way down in the 324 month group and also the vaccine efficacy number

425
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
Numbers go up

426
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,743
It's entirely possible that there's some relation

427
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,839
Between age and mRNA vaccine efficacy that we are yet to discover

428
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,911
The point is that there's a lot of possible explanations for the data

429
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,703
In this PowerPoint slide it like

430
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
Is it making s*** up

431
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,287
So you can act like a dramatic little baby talk about Millions dead

432
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,847
On Alex cuz that's how they have fun

433
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
And make money

434
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
It's real sad

435
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,175
It's real sad

436
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
Like I mean

437
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,783
To take something that so obviously shows

438
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,623
Massive improvement over not getting a vaccine and then being like

439
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,415
See I bet after

440
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:48,255
Three months it's four times as bad as it was after today but

441
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,047
You know but you know what like if

442
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
The numbers

443
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,351
Do

444
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,935
Show that there's like a four times higher after 9 months

445
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,215
That will just

446
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,007
Be those people

447
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,591
That all that will be is an indication that it's even lower numbers

448
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,407
For the people in the earlier

449
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,687
Bellator cohort

450
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
Exactly

451
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,271
Exhaust insane

452
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:13,087
So there is one piece of

453
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,879
Information that is in this

454
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,672
This PowerPoint presentation

455
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,744
That Mike

456
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,048
The other major finding of this route

457
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
The number one most

458
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,704
Reduced serious combat

459
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
Quotations over time

460
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,264
Was to have a

461
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,800
Play previous covid-19

462
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
This

463
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,456
Natural immunity is the number one best

464
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
Active effects

465
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
Following vaccination

466
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,136
Cuz I know it sounds odd

467
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,976
A lot of people are taking the vaccines even though they've already

468
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Had

469
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,536
The oldest and been sick

470
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,864
Finding as people that naturally already had it

471
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,168
Even though this injection is compromised them

472
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704
4 deaths

473
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,752
Body is so smart at able to figure it out

474
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,800
It's already been in contact with it

475
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,360
Because it's the vaccine itself cream in the body is that right

476
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,408
Is that right

477
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,712
Is that part of it

478
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:20,416
So it makes sense that having had covid previously would give you a leg up

479
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
Open terms of immune

480
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,000
Why do scientist been totally clear on the

481
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:29,376
Exact extent to which people become immune and approval covid after they get it but there is some effect

482
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,168
And I will know more later

483
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:36,032
Again though I need to stress that this data said is entirely comprised of individuals aged

484
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,824
65 and older and it's not sensible

485
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,128
Will The Big Biscuit be applied to the general population

486
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:47,040
I was confused himself there because the narrative on Infowars up to this point is that the MRNA vaccines train your body to attack

487
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:47,808
Itself

488
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:52,160
And Alex has been very clear that he believes that if you get the vaccine after having covid your is

489
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
Good as dead

490
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,952
Going to f******

491
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,976
Kill you

492
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:01,376
This larger the mic is covering shows some indications to the contrary to dance around that in a tunnel

493
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:05,216
Words spoken that the audience doesn't realize this is the exact opposite of what he's been

494
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,032
Been saying for months I mean it's just a f******

495
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:12,384
Word salad he threw out there to avoid a very obvious

496
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,456
I mean it's all God has its Direct

497
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,248
Lee County directory

498
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,272
God that's so

499
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,576
You're so stupid

500
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,904
That here's where things get a little bit dicey

501
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
Just here

502
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,488
A lot of places but this one

503
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,304
B b in the road

504
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,376
When my comes on there's usually something that's like

505
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:37,728
Oh boy at 121 be today

506
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
Get vaccinated

507
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,080
According to these

508
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,152
The number one thing that you can do

509
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,944
Who survived the vaccine

510
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
You take the vaccine

511
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,040
That's in the date

512
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,232
Could I have lower

513
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,536
Outcomes

514
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
Just people who never had any

515
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,752
Adapt

516
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,312
I go into the 80

517
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:21,760
I appreciate the restraint but I mean like the implication that he's giving is like if you're going to get the vaccine go get your

518
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Yes

519
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,600
Yeah this is like

520
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:30,208
This is getting dangerously close to him saying like you should infect yourself on purpose

521
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,280
The number one thing you can do

522
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:39,680
The vax to survive a bullet wound is to have it not hit you in the head or the

523
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
Okay

524
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:44,544
So the number one way to survive the vaccine is to not be

525
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,360
Be killed by covid-19 way or the other

526
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
Yes

527
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,920
Yeah I mean I think

528
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,480
This is dangerous advice or number

529
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
A lot of read

530
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:58,112
Do you put people around you at greater risk

531
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,160
You could have severe complications

532
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,440
You could die

533
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:05,536
Yeah this is this is supposed to be the health Ranger

534
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:10,912
Yeah I think well I mean he did try and give everybody a bowl of that one time I was in the name of

535
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,008
For somebody who doesn't believe in vaccines

536
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,544
Bigelow Paula

537
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,568
But you put some vodka

538
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,128
I don't have a good time

539
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,432
Just want to make sure it's disinfected

540
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
I mean

541
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:30,112
The thing that I sing that weirdly got me there

542
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
Is this

543
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,672
Only way

544
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,720
That they can get

545
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,536
People to justify getting the vaccine

546
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,632
Because I'm sure most of his audience is already had covid

547
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,192
They haven't been being safe whatsoever

548
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:47,264
Oh man angle that they're doing of like

549
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,288
Listen

550
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:53,152
They're making you get the vaccine now we got all these vaccine mandates but

551
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,176
Guess what

552
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,968
If you've already had covid

553
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:02,368
You're actually going to be fine with this vaccine I know I've been telling you that the vaccine is going to murder

554
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:07,488
Family and your children and everyone you've ever met it might be a way to backdoor like a narrative

555
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,560
Later for like a vaccine not killing everybody exactly

556
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:15,680
Nike be like well you actually had covid before you been up to

557
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,472
I think that's probably

558
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,496
Productive for that

559
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:22,592
I think that would be that would be a way around this but functionally

560
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
As it stands

561
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
He's also

562
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,920
Basically saying you should go

563
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,736
Which sucks

564
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:33,088
Absolutely it's like hey going but you know how kids

565
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,648
Go to one of those

566
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,952
And I mean one out of every what

567
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,744
10 years old

568
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,024
No big deal

569
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,048
So anyway

570
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:47,168
Michael misuses some more of this data in order to claim that this is a snake biome

571
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,776
Also notice the last slide of the slides

572
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,824
The ethnic groups

573
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
Most effect

574
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,664
By this

575
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,224
Native Americans have the highest rate

576
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
Increase

577
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
Negative

578
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,832
American

579
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
Higher-risk

580
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,976
Text compared to

581
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,536
If you're Hispanic

582
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,560
1.3 to 1

583
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,840
4 times greater odds

584
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
It's something more like

585
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
1.25 ruffian

586
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
This

587
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,152
People out there

588
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,736
Biological weapon

589
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,808
This is not a responsible reading of this graph at all

590
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,624
There is a higher risk of hospitalization in break

591
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,928
Cases among people of Native American population

592
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,744
But this light alone is not enough to demonstrate that there is a

593
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,768
A causal relation

594
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
Kinship

595
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,584
Throughout the pandemic if you care to listen

596
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
Some people were talking about about this

597
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,168
Proportionately High rates of infection and death

598
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,448
Among native community

599
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:58,080
This is part of a long-standing conversation and there are number of hypotheses given for the numbers

600
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,152
Including a higher rate of Sheridan intergenerational housing

601
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:05,760
Decreased access to healthcare and higher prevalence of covid-19 comorbidities

602
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,808
Like heart disease diabetes and smoking

603
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,856
This is something relevant

604
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,160
For sure and it's something that researchers are

605
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,184
Keeping an eye on and

606
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,208
Discussing

607
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,000
Play the bikes talking about this stuff is

608
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:16,768
Just not

609
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:23,168
It's not connected to reality does sound like he's literally saying that once again smallpox

610
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,448
Blankets are

611
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,776
Roaming across this land tearing everybody to pieces

612
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,824
I mean

613
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
Not terribly

614
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,408
Wrong

615
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,456
In this next clip

616
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,224
When I think of

617
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,248
Is

618
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
Just

619
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808
Spectacular

620
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,856
Is that everything that Alex says

621
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:42,880
Is made of

622
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:47,744
Everything

623
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:53,376
AI program

624
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,168
And they just put out a report

625
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
What it does

626
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,728
And they're honest about it

627
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,776
But no political statements are in it

628
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,568
And it says

629
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,640
That you're way more likely to die if you had the shot

630
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:08,736
Erasing your regular immune system in it

631
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,552
The way up though if it comes into contact

632
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,344
With a similar virus

633
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,160
I'm not just covid but any other coronavirus I mean

634
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,512
None of this isn't the primary sourcing that there

635
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,584
They're providing what is the pentagon's main

636
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,352
AI

637
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,912
You know what I'm saying like which is the main one

638
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,704
How

639
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,520
Are they still using how I guess

640
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,824
I don't know I would hope for a way pass out

641
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,664
I have

642
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
By now

643
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
Albert

644
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
Albert

645
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,808
Halliburton holyshit

646
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:49,696
Crack the code

647
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,256
Okay alright

648
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,304
Mike believes

649
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,584
Without any kind of

650
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
Proof

651
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,472
That they're spraying cities with covid

652
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,264
And then Alex hasn't it

653
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,056
Rejoinder

654
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,872
Do air supplies releases of these toxic

655
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,896
Nanoparticles

656
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,432
This coming winter

657
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,712
Could they release this

658
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,480
United States

659
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,368
Personally this is my opinion

660
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,720
And I think they're planning to do so again and I think

661
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,256
We are going to continue

662
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,792
Genocide

663
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,560
Against

664
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,912
How to drive people to the vaccines

665
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,192
Crashing

666
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,264
Restitution

667
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,336
As we said 20 months ago here on air

668
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,664
Blame the unvaccinated for the vaccine

669
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
Others and almost killed him

670
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,392
So apparently Alex's dad got spray

671
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:56,512
It is easier to say that your dad got sprayed then to take responsibility for almost

672
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:02,144
Healing your dad Alex you almost killed your dad that you personally

673
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:08,032
Killed your dad maybe not personally but his behavior was such

674
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,872
They put his dad at

675
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,432
But it's better if his dad was sprayed

676
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,968
Other than saying that

677
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:22,368
As a direct result of everything Alex believes dad almost

678
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:28,768
Just came up with like a little flower on his lapel

679
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:34,912
Alter bottle Seltzer bottles good if you are if you are putting it in a pie I think you've gone too far

680
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
Yes

681
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:40,800
A crew that I it's just a lot

682
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336
Subordinate

683
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,176
Yes good boy you can transmit covid via pie to the face

684
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:49,504
Well I'm getting your nose there is a meringue-based

685
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
But is boss

686
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,416
I mean it is October obviously there's going to

687
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,440
Maybe some pumpkin covid

688
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,744
Play pumpkin spice

689
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,024
So

690
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:06,656
2 years ago or so little bit less like Adams appeared on the show and declared that it was over

691
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,448
Humanity that would only be Lone Survivor

692
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,984
And he was right

693
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
Yes

694
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,544
So now here's his new dramatic pretty

695
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,896
My prediction is people going to see troops on the streets

696
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,688
Christmas and they're going to Cebu

697
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,992
In certain areas

698
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
Of course with a fall

699
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,136
This is the winter die off

700
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,160
This is the

701
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,440
Sort of soft

702
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,744
Military replacement

703
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,536
Of the infrastructure of

704
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,840
Medical workers

705
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
And even

706
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,912
You may have even at some point

707
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,680
Troops

708
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,704
In certain areas

709
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,008
Grocery stores checking your vaccine

710
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,056
How to come in and Shop

711
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,872
For food so by Christmas

712
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,432
Like in two months two and a half months

713
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:55,296
We're going to have military on the street Garden grocery stores bodies piling up everywhere

714
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
Okay

715
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,624
That seems

716
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
So I'm likely

717
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
That's

718
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:05,280
An upgrade still over it's over for Humanity there will only be Lone Survivor

719
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,840
He's not going to compete with that

720
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,912
Okay you can't get more apocalyptic

721
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,472
Premium Dave over there against

722
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,496
No one

723
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,056
Right

724
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,128
They shot their shot too early

725
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:20,896
I mean

726
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:27,296
It's over for Humanity DeLonghi lone survivors of the way too early I'm going to eat my neighbors thing

727
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,320
Totally that's like

728
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
That's where you

729
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,136
You should do that

730
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,208
When you've got the lights what someone is giving you the light

731
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,768
That's your neighbors

732
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:43,168
You don't have another place to go after that they got stir crazy because they assumed that the

733
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:46,752
The cover thing wouldn't last as long so they thought it would be fun

734
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:53,408
To say to scare like a comic who got overexcited and did their closer 3 minute

735
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,944
It's into their sack

736
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,224
Too bad

737
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,552
Oh no I did

738
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,088
Not have 20

739
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:07,488
Enter the rest of the site is going to just end up being ranting about how you need to get right With God all over and over again

740
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,632
Everybody knows it's the end everybody understands this

741
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,984
Hey they say you lost your lawsuit

742
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:21,824
You don't get a jury trial doing that's unconstitutional 7th Amendment

743
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:26,688
Holden told the country

744
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,552
Everybody in the system is served it is going down as well

745
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,904
Dying in math

746
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,696
From the injections

747
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,720
This is

748
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,256
God

749
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
Going down

750
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,936
Are we God

751
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
That's not going

752
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
To happen though

753
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,264
It's just a lot of buffering

754
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,056
Killing time with you

755
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:53,824
Assertive

756
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:58,944
Meaningless platitudes I was really kind of hoping for her maybe a Barnes

757
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:03,296
I was kind of thinking that a Barnes would show up to let us know that it's actually

758
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:08,160
He actually won the lawsuit somehow and there's a secret double powerful

759
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,208
Amendment that we're going to

760
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,512
Have I feel like if your barn

761
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
Sore no more

762
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,560
And you're smart

763
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,096
You stay awake

764
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,912
You're out of the country

765
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,448
E-girl

766
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:24,800
Time in Brazil

767
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,592
That's what I'm doing

768
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:33,248
Respond to little bit more to the Sandy Hooks up on Monday because this is

769
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,296
This is mostly about Mike Adams is

770
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:39,136
Seems to have paid for some time on the propane

771
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,696
Aaron Paul

772
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,744
Alex loves

773
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,048
You walked Abate you refuse to debate me

774
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,072
Still

775
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:47,840
He is

776
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:48,864
He's acting like

777
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
It's normal.

778
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,936
Normal now but it's not

779
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,216
No it's not

780
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,008
The Democrats are going to be dead

781
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,776
Right

782
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:00,128
What can the average person do to lessen the blow what can Congress do

783
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,016
Fauci he's

784
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,320
Talking about illegal spying and

785
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,112
But they're still operating from there

786
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
Coon

787
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,184
Like everything's okay but it's not okay

788
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,744
Everything's falling apart

789
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,304
And in the hospital they're not full of the vaccinated

790
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,328
You are seriously ill

791
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,936
I'm not sure they realize how close we are to the end of the American Empire

792
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
.

793
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,520
Once you see

794
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,896
Is bribing all of the

795
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,712
Craft breww City carryout more voter fraud

796
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,480
Is there

797
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,856
Covid stimulus

798
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,376
Play ever been in power

799
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,704
Catastrophic for the nation

800
00:36:59,264 --> 00:36:59,776
Man

801
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,384
Do the Democrats in power

802
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,920
I just think that these

803
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
Villains

804
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,224
With these dudes have

805
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,016
They're spreading themselves too thin

806
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,344
Yeah I like those too many plans it just makes no sense

807
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,136
Why do I have to do all these things

808
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,952
Tori Kelly

809
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
Alright

810
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:23,584
The most successful plans are simple they strike the enemy's weak point

811
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,912
And then they are done it is a quick

812
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,472
Effective and immediate solution

813
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:34,592
All other plans are Rube Goldberg machines that make us look like we're idiots

814
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,128
I like say

815
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:39,200
I don't know starting a war in Iraq or something

816
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,272
Dumb short small quick

817
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:46,368
When you're the devil you don't want to have different teams working on goals

818
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,648
Those that are completely at

819
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:50,464
Sabbatical to each other and have nothing to do with the

820
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,744
Larger objective

821
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,096
They seem that seems to be how the organizational chart

822
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,656
Works here's what I'm thinking

823
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,936
Alex

824
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,704
If I'm the Dead

825
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,032
I have all these people that are working

826
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,312
Looking for me but I'm like

827
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,336
I'm the f****** devil

828
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:09,152
I don't care about who pay them in Devil ducks

829
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:15,552
The only way you can afford it is my money printed right

830
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,368
Stimulus

831
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,976
BB goes to hell then it's all tied up in the courts of Heaven

832
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,768
Pork I'm just saying

833
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,352
I would want to torture the people who love

834
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,120
Me

835
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
Bayou

836
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,192
Having them work against

837
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,472
Me

838
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,544
See I'm working at cross-purposes

839
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,080
To them so they are fuc

840
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,872
Picking up my plan but actually

841
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
My plan is to

842
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,664
To torture them

843
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,456
By making them fail forever

844
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:48,064
No I'm thinking like the devil's there

845
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,672
Yeah yeah I guess that makes sense

846
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,744
I guess that makes sense

847
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,144
5 that's as good as it's going to get on anything else that's the point at which I have to give up

848
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:08,544
Oh wait so you're fighting the devil who's playing is to have his followers fight against himself

849
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,104
In order to torture them eternally because

850
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
The plan donut

851
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,152
Right I got to go by

852
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:16,480
I have other things I need to do

853
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,528
You need to stay in here this cuz it makes

854
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,368
So there's a lot of plan disasters Coronavirus

855
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,184
But you won't give a time frame for it although it

856
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
Listening

857
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,744
Pretty gave a bit of a Time

858
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,048
Baa

859
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,608
Situation

860
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:39,264
The energy resulting in at least Regional power options

861
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,664
They're going to cause an economic

862
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,688
Catastrophe

863
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
Maybe

864
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,736
Holidays

865
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,272
It may eventually be

866
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,064
The actual class of a dollar

867
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,624
Prediction for this

868
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,928
We know that inevitable

869
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,208
It's going to happen

870
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,512
You don't need all this s***

871
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,792
You don't need all those things

872
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:03,840
Also

873
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
I mean

874
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,936
All of those things have already happened in my life

875
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,728
And we

876
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,848
We've still not collapse the dollar like we had the financial collapse in 2008

877
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,664
We had this f****** the endemic we've had

878
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,528
So many power outages in the past year that it did people are shiting in the streets

879
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,088
We're fine the reason

880
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,880
That Mike does stuff like this

881
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,904
Scattershot

882
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,184
There's so many different things

883
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,208
Just make no sense

884
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,768
Why someone would have all of these plans operating

885
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,424
Is because like let's say that there is a famine that he can be like I called that totally hidden let's say that all the other stuff

886
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,472
Come to pass but

887
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,496
There you go

888
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,800
I called this I know what I'm talking about

889
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,616
Or there is some kind of a financial downturn

890
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,408
This is what I was talking about

891
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,992
As long as you make a hundred predictions people ignore

892
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,552
That you got 98 wrong if to happened

893
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,576
Beef close

894
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,600
To what ends up happening

895
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,136
And the weirdest part is

896
00:40:59,392 --> 00:40:59,904
Is 2 mi

897
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,696
The weirdest part of all of them

898
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
Is that

899
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,256
Those things

900
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,560
Or all the inevitable

901
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,376
Hendersonville

902
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,912
Of all of the p

903
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,216
People that he's ever supported getting power

904
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,336
Like all of those things just happen because of the people that you want in power

905
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,616
That's how it work

906
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,408
There's an irony to that so

907
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:24,480
Wouldn't you be better predicting it

908
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,808
You're making it happen essentially

909
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,648
You don't want to be too obvious about it

910
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,672
So

911
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:36,512
Do you know Alex lost these the Sandy Hook cases and

912
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,048
If it turns out there's a reason

913
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,072
For that

914
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,632
I made some people would say that the reason is

915
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
Because he

916
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,936
Flagrantly abused

917
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:46,752
Is the Discovery process and was being a total baby

918
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,128
Thanks salt like thinks there was a moor

919
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,407
Sinister reason they lost

920
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,431
These cases

921
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,247
So bad

922
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,159
The reason to come after Infowars with the the judgement

923
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,327
Is going to be

924
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,631
AA secession of nullification

925
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,167
We're going to have the Republic of Texas

926
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:18,495
Infowars is going to be the news

927
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,311
Texas which is why you need to survive

928
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,783
Remove one judge for the new one in and she said I'm

929
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,551
First hearing

930
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,831
First

931
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,623
Document

932
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,183
It's stunning

933
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,463
Oh man starting

934

00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,631
Yeah that's great

936
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,935
Not great

937
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,983
Are not a friend

938
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:50,751
Self

939
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:54,079
They all declare themselves president

940
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:59,199
You know what I say this is actually a great idea let's do the number though

941
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,247
Biggest experiment of its kind

942
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,015
Alright

943
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,039
We give

944
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:07,647
Conservatives the Republic of Texas and Alex is their main news source

945
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,439
Everybody else just watches

946
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,975
Let's see what happens

947
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,767
Will have definitive proof

948
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,791
On what

949
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,583
Could country would be

950
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:19,679
This is Alex's Madness is a dangerous experiment

951
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:24,287
The dangerous experiment Mexico

952
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
No

953
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,383
Alone

954
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,151
End of the world

955
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:33,247
Continuing as it is what you think is going to happen to the average life.

956
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,903
Be murdered by the devil or the vaccine or we're going to

957
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,207
To kill all the Republicans

958
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,743
This is the average

959
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,767
Divers left

960
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:54,239
What are all the letters February about

961
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:56,799
They're going to try

962
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,871
Drugs and food that they want

963
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:03,711
But they have both of them will be killed themselves

964
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,783
Are you going to die

965
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
Muslim

966
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,575
Going to die

967
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,391
As the only

968
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:17,791
People who have gone on air and said I will murder people hit the Apocalypse

969
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:23,679
Immediately Murder My Neighbors in the apocalypse obviously the first thing the average leftist

970
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,447
This is going to do

971
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,007
Is the thing that I have said that I will do

972
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,823
And I'm judging them for it

973
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,615
They're so immoral

974
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:34,943
I know that I have some friends who would probably classify themselves as leftist

975
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,735
And I do

976
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,039
Constantly find myself

977
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,831
Sitting around with them and they just

978
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:45,183
Bucking won't stop talking about how much they love not being prepared

979
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:51,071
Just like a constant Obsession for people on the left

980
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:54,655
I do I don't go anywhere I'm not prepared for

981
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,703
What if what if the door is locked

982
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
Not prepared

983
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:05,407
I even know some people who like if they accidentally find themselves in a position where they are prepared well

984
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,271
Wearing shoes for this race that I'm about to run

985
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,575
Better light about fire they're opposed to

986
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:17,695
Cooking because that's a preparation of food if you want to eat food you eat the seed

987
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,535
You just eat dirt

988
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,071
So I thought this was a

989
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:23,839
Dumb

990
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,375
Dumb dumb dumb dumb show

991
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,655

1013
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,351

B cells

1039
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,911
Maybe bad food

1040
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,727
It's like the rebel base in Star Wars

1041
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,031
We need to be on

1042
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,823
When they take everything

1043
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,615
And a Batman the enemy

Satellite relays that means their own power supplies of that mean

1046
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:54,111
Microwave relays I mean you you name it we got

00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,815
Are you taking all this

1049
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,631
I know it's going down

1050
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:10,751
Who knows it could be your last chance any day

1051
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,031
Delta 12

1052
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,823

Might be your last chance

1056
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,135
Get a t-shirt

1057
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:32,767
So I don't know if down-and-out is the best name for your sleeping

1058
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,399
A depressing name

1059
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:41,215
He's he's really not feeling that great

1060
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:47,103
Give him some down-and-out and we'll deal with them later we get a new sleep aid called f****** depressed

1061
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,831
Can't get out of bed

1062
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:00,927
We've got a new product it's just called despair

1063
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:03,999
Sleep buddy

1064
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:07,839
You can't get out of bed with a mood stabilizer called all week

1065
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:14,751
Esprit de corps

1066
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:21,151
The highs and lows

1067
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,967
Mildly annoyed empty on the inside

1068
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:29,855
Staring for between glass I'd given another pass on that name I think that might

1069
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,487
Tige just does these plugs

1070
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:40,351
Until Harrison comes there but he has a couple of new stories that he didn't have time to cover

1071
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,727
Where the heck Congressional

1072
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,287
Individual over the spending package says

1073
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,055
Weekend quotes

1074
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,431
He actually said we can spend

1075
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,967
Unlimited amount

1076
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,783
Yeah

1077
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,063
It's imagine

1078
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,903
Get the money first one has value

1079
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,791
And we all get handed the debt

1080
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,071
Inflation

1081
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,095
Turn the hell I

1082
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,399
Problem

1083
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,959
Global screwing assault

1084
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:20,031
Haley Wilde

1085
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:24,639
It's accelerating your in World War 3

1086
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,087
What happened

1087
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,879
We know what we're talkin about

1088
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,583
That was a very fake

1089
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,143
Dramatic

1090
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:48,191
Acceptable

1091
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:54,591
That one was very clearly like he was like oh no I've still got 3 seconds I better try I got to stretch

1092
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,639
I got a I got to stretch

1093
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:59,199
He is basically the

1094
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:03,551
Assertive radio equivalent to somebody who has an awesome booster

1095
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:06,111
You know like you can hit that switch

1096
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,463
Set final it's a final quarter second but

1097
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,047
I mean he is too soon a lot of the time too early

1098
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:21,215
So what are you talkin about there about the budget thing there's about representative John yarmuth who gave a speech back in June at a rotary

1099
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:24,543
Free club and we don't actually have to pay off the national

1100
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,847
Then I guess people are mad

1101
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:27,615
About this

1102
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,639
Now even though he was

1103
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,407
Was back in June

1104
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:34,783
He's playing pretty well but Alex didn't have time to get it today before he left work early so

1105
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,367
I guess I'll wait till he covers this given to him about it

1106
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,135
What a dick

1107
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,439
Oh man

1108
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,487
It is

1109
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,767
It is funny you just

1110
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,327
Watching this whole Dead Sea like they just being like

1111
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,863
This is all made up

1112
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:53,215
Imaginary what are you people doing why am I reading about it why are you

1113
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,519
You doing this this is all pretend

1114
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:56,799
Please don't make

1115
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:00,127
We pretend to care about 4:10

1116
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,687
What are we doing

1117
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,735
So we get to the

1118
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:08,831
And this will always be remembered as the day that face

1119
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,671
Yes and we will deal with that in the middle of this episode

1120
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,695
However

1121
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,023
Alex is back from

1122
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:17,791
Sunday

1123
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,375
I don't know what the f*** is going on on Sunday cuz he just seemed to

1124
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:24,191
Talk to Mike Adams for about an hour and a half and then

1125
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,239
I don't know what's going on

1126
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,775
But there's an actual audience

1127
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,799
Maybe

1128
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:32,639
For his Monday showed like the weekday show

1129
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,687
So we get to talkin about a little bit of

1130
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,455
The Sandy Hook Bay

1131
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,735
And look

1132
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,527
When Alex is in trouble

1133
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
South America

1134
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:48,255
Has always been the canary in the coal mine

1135
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:52,351
When you know Infowars in trouble you know the country

1136
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,655
Is on its knees

1137
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:58,751
Willfully sticking its head into the chopping block

1138
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,591
Thank you so much for joining us

1139
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,127
Well

1140
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,663
We been at the top

1141
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,223
Twitter all weekend since last Thursday

1142
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,271
Alex Jones

1143
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,623
Jury finds Jones guilty of defamation must

1144
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:19,231
Name the man that they say kill those children

1145
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,511
Sandy Hook Beach

1146
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,279
Beyond

1147
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,047
Drug addict

1148
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,375
Don't know his name

1149
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,399
My name now

1150
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,191
Is the corporate media

1151
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:31,519
Constantly attaches me to a shooting at half

1152
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:35,359
Almost 10 years ago

1153
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,383
You're so much.

1154
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,151
Stage

1155
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,175
A couple of kickball

1156
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:41,759
I want people do remember Adam Lanza

1157
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:47,391
I would say that Alex has more name recognition than Adam Lanza cuz he has a

1158
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,927
F****** talk show

1159
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,487
And is there somebody who constantly

1160
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:54,047
Trolling for attention

1161
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:57,887
And then also if you listen carefully that clip it kind of sounds like Alex

1162
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:01,983
Might still think Lanza didn't do it I am pretty sure he is

1163
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:08,383
Describing this in a way that suggests he is still denying Sandy Hook

1164
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,991
Are we still doing this

1165
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,527
Is this possible

1166
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:17,087
Are you help himself

1167
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:23,487
Yeah why even bother with a default judgement he's just admitted all of this s*** yet again please apply

1168
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,791
At least implied that his mind is still there

1169
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:28,351
Well there's a

1170
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,119
Jammed up

1171
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,703
I mean again I watch

1172
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,007
And it's all him

1173
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,031
It's all him

1174
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,055
Democrat judge

1175
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:38,847
Him

1176
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,383
Doing himself a pineapple

1177
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,431
Petard of his own bill

1178
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,223
Temperature

1179
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,503
But yeah

1180
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,039
Here

1181
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:51,135
They don't tell you that I judge says

1182
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,231
Block the

1183
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:09,055
Just retired

1184
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,591
The second hearing

1185
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:14,175
And you didn't give them anything and you and mr. Jones

1186
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:18,527
You said there's a kangaroo trial on your show she said the ruling a month ago

1187
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:23,903
Exactly what was you says the show trial I said when she said a month ago

1188
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,231
The second hearing

1189
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,959
Yes it did

1190
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:39,519
Yeah and and also the day before you were saying it was

1191
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,567
The first hearing and now it's the second.

1192
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,871
Stories a little janky

1193
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,687
See I don't know by any of this

1194
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,455
This is pretty soft

1195
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,991
So she said

1196
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:55,135
She said that I said that what I actually said was this thing and she said something different

1197
00:55:55,391 --> 00:56:00,511
And I know you read what she said and she said this but what she actually said is what I say she said

1198
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,327
This is a very productive way to describe

1199
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,167
Definitely

1200
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,959
The depositions and everything like

1201
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,239
Very believable

1202
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:13,055
Straight like Alex has a lot of credibility on the subject

1203
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,359
You comported himself with

1204
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,383
Total glass

1205
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,967
All I'm saying is that when that

1206
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:22,015
Batman defines reality

1207
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:27,391
You know reality has been defiant Define corporate representative

1208
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:30,463
So yeah I mean really one of the only things

1209
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,487
To fall back on his

1210
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,791
Every attack on me is an attack on you

1211
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,815
You have to re-up

1212
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,351
To personalize an app

1213
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,655
Experience this as an attack on yourself

1214
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,679
Because I need

1215
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,447
You to give me

1216
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:51,967
You don't have Jerry's anymore and then

1217
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:55,551
Is Rachel Maddow get thrown out when she says things way more

1218
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,599
You know I do

1219
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,671
Don't

1220
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:06,559
What things has Rachel Maddow said those gorgeous amatory and things

1221
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,911
He doesn't give any specifics

1222
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,727
I don't love Rachel Maddow but like

1223
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,007
I don't think

1224
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,311
But you said more defamatory

1225
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,127
I am I'm going to go way out of the way

1226
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:26,783
Because I don't know if I can back this up but I'm going to say Alex is probably within the top 10 all times

1227
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:27,551
Famers

1228
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,575
Of every any

1229
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,623
I think he probably is

1230
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,159
Have you considered that

1231
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,207
Like the reach of his program

1232
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:34,975
The

1233
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:41,119
Factories been on air daily 427

1234
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,679
You got William Randolph Hearst I assume

1235
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:46,751
Was William Randolph Hearst doing

1236
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:47,519
Kim cell

1237
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:54,431
He was very clear about directing public opinion through lies

1238
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,199
But then like

1239
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,991
Ghetto is News Corp

1240
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,319
You can't consider like

1241
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:06,463
Entities

1242
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,999
Speaking Direct

1243
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,303
Man I don't know it's going to be tough to be

1244
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,351
Alex is up there but apparently Rachel Maddow

1245
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:16,447
Anyway look he lost in court so that means it's time to buy truck

1246
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:19,775
I don't

1247
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:20,799
I do

1248
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:28,223
How much

1249
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:32,319
I discovered you getting something that's nothing to do with what this case is

1250
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:39,999
His face

1251
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:48,703
Tell you that we need your financial support

1252
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,495
I tell you then

1253
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:56,127
Lot of folks out there to make sure they're serious

1254
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:57,919
Money

1255
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,711
To fight this war

1256
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:03,295
Sterilizer

1257
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,623
But I need your financial support someone tell you right now

1258
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:09,951
Your last chance today to get it in Fort Worth

1259
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:13,023
Take a lot of money for me to

1260
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:15,327
Pay my vehicle

1261
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,351
Ridiculous

1262
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:18,655
I am so transparent

1263
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:19,679
Just

1264
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:23,519
Just the Staggering amount of it's already over

1265
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,543
We're all dead

1266
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,335
The Empire is collapse

1267
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,103
Right

1268
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,175
Good soldiers in front of grocery stores

1269
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:30,943
Bought

1270
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:38,367
Please buy a T-shirt If You by itself Infowars can protect the 7th Amendment or something

1271
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,647
Do you buy a t-shirt

1272
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:45,023
We can stay on Aaron defeat the globalist that look we're all going to be dead

1273
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:47,583
I've got to go to a waterpark

1274
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:53,983
Alex wants to be able to pay

1275
00:59:54,239 --> 01:00:00,383
Show me you failed all over and that everything that you've done up to this point is meeting I haven't checked

1276
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:06,783
I get on Owens crowdfunding think will you please people for like a quarter billion dollars on that b*******

1277
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,343
Alex is probably just trying to do the same thing

1278
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,951
The audience to pay for his bad behaviors that he's now facing the consequences

1279
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,487
I mean

1280
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:19,839
It's an alright business model of your s*** head I am asking you

1281
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:20,863
The people

1282
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,655
To once again protect

1283
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:29,055
Direct me from feeling any negative effects right for all the Behavior I've done because if things look bad

1284
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:32,639
For me it's over for Humanity even though it's already

1285
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:39,039
7th Amendment says quote in suits at common law

1286
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:41,343
Is the right of trial by jury shall be preserved

1287
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:46,463
And no fact Tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States

1288
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,511
According to the rules

1289
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,791
Of the common law

1290
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,583
This would be relevant

1291
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,631
Except this only applies to federal courts

1292
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,911
And very specifically not

1293
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,447
Civil case is being heard in state

1294
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:57,983
The Supreme Court

1295
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,263
Is Thrice a firm that

1296
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,799
State courts have no obligations

1297
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:07,199
To provide trials for civil cases but many do anyway malady

1298
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,503
Violated all he does not know what's 7 / 2

1299
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:14,623
I do love I do love sometimes you really you know like I know that

1300
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,903
Do you know the stuff is in

1301
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:18,207
But then you go back and you actually

1302
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:18,975
Hear it

1303
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:21,791
And you read it again and again and you're like wait a second

1304
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,095
We're still listening to a con

1305
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:24,863
Constitution

1306
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,703
That has a 7th amendment that includes a dollar amount in it

1307
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:31,263
Like a 1776

1308
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,287
Dollar amount

1309
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,055
You know what

1310
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,591
$20 being like

1311
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:40,735
Holyshit this is worth $1000000 in today's money I don't know for certain

1312
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,783
I would bet that has been

1313
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,391
But it is like water we do

1314
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,183
Rewrite the fuc

1315
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,999
Live in the future

1316
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,279
$20

1317
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,327
Party.

1318
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:59,423
How bad is it for 1950

1319
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,703
So

1320
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,239
The point is that Alex has been

1321
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,007
Smeared

1322
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:07,103
I want to show you some of these news articles

1323
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:13,759
I want to show TV viewers radio station.

1324
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,063
The Associated Press

1325
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,903
The most respected publication in the world

1326
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:23,743
Years ago in 2019

1327
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,399
Father of Sandy Hook

1328
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:34,751
Conspiracy driven Infowars website

1329
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,591
That's the fam

1330
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,151
He did not write that

1331
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:42,943
Not in the book

1332
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:47,295
Call The Wall Street Journal also publishes

1333
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:52,415
And then about a month later they took away my perfect

1334
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,767
What's the suit

1335
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,815
And you said to charge us more

1336
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:01,119
Credit card

1337
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,471
That's probably not true but we've covered this

1338
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:07,775
Before anyone's forgotten

1339
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:09,311
Alex has a good

1340
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,615
It's not against the Associated Press

1341
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,175
The headline that I was reading is from MarketWatch

1342
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:18,015
Watch someone who works there definitely f*****-up and attributed the writing of that book.

1343
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,135
The MarketWatch page is just an article that the reposted from the Associated Press

1344
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:25,695
Who were the new headline that MarketWatch Road

1345
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:28,767
Which does not appear in the original AP story

1346
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:33,631
How many AP website the headline is quote Newtown parents Corwin and growing fight against

1347
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,399
Hoaxers

1348
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:36,703
And it's never claimed that Alex wrote feathers book

1349
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:43,103
That's for the Wall Street Journal I can't find that article posted on their site but this is an important to understand

1350
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,919
Alex can threaten to sue the apple-1

1351
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,199
They didn't do anything

1352
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,991
His beef is with MarketWatch

1353
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,271
And I've never heard him

1354
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,295
Complain about them

1355
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,087
I think that this is intentional

1356
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,927
I'm sure that Alex knows that if he just contacted MarketWatch

1357
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:57,951
Complained about the

1358
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:00,255
Is very demonstrable enochtrue claim

1359
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,791
They would immediately retract

1360
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,839
And probably even issue an apology which

1361
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,119
Doesn't work for Al

1362
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:11,519
No that's no good blaming the wrong

1363
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:14,079
Tone up to something they didn't

1364
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:18,943
It's just a stupid game but he's my buddy

1365
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:22,527
So smeared what you do is you point to this

1366
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,807
This headline

1367
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:29,951
And you use it to imply that all the headlines about you now or not true

1368
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:33,535
Several other thousand are probably

1369
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,863
Lost

1370
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,911
Lost

1371
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,871
Sandy Hook

1372
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:52,479
Loses case over Hoekstra Marshall

1373
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:59,647
Two more

1374
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:15,263
Iraq

1375
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:20,639
The reason there are multiple cases isn't because lawyers are filing Wild

1376
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:23,199
Plaintiffs who have different

1377
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,479
Complaints about the

1378
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:27,295
Things you said about their kids whenever you sue somebody

1379
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,319
You get a lawfirm

1380
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:33,951
Write all of those lawyers each bring their own individual suits rat makes

1381
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:34,975
Pics and specs Howard law

1382
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:40,351
Alex just have to find a way to make this about a fight between him and lawyers as opposed to

1383
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,631
Wayback

1384
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:44,703
The people behind it who the real victim

1385
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:49,823
Except that because he's the real victim according to him

1386
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:51,871
Really sad

1387
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:57,503
Yeah I mean I'm waiting for you might as well have a you can't handle the truth moment where he's like

1388
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:03,903
It look I'm obviously the real victim because nobody died there and then everybody's like Steve we f****** told you

1389
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,183
This is what it was

1390
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:05,951
Yeah

1391
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,743
That's Jesus yeah

1392
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:10,559
Every headline about himself

1393
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:11,839
You got time to fill

1394
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:14,655
Yeah

1395
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,959
Alex Jones fumes a judge rules

1396
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:23,615
She lies

1397
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,639
Witches Caroline

1398
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,943
Giving him nothing

1399
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,991
And then she goes and he says

1400
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,527
This is a show trial

1401
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,159
81000 pages

1402
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,975
Two depositions with myself and my whole crew

1403
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,279
Because we don't have what you claim we have

1404
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:47,935
Battle plan to say Sandy Hook was a hoax famous years ago

1405
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,287
Do they say give me the smoking

1406
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:56,895
Don't have you don't get a drink

1407
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:57,663
Okay

1408
01:06:59,455 --> 01:06:59,967
I guess

1409
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:01,503
Give me the smoking

1410
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,807
Wow

1411
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:10,207
Nothing we can do that I guess we'll have to guess we have to get a default

1412
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:15,071
You didn't give us the Smoking Gun so also like

1413
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:19,679
Really really heavily implies an accusation of collaboration

1414
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,447
Between

1415
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,727
The plaintiff's and

1416
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:27,871
In order for Alex's argument to make any sense that has to be a United

1417
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,151
Conspiracy

1418
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,967
I didn't become like a nice fun joke

1419
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:32,735
Amongst

1420
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:35,039
People that they could get their Soros check

1421
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,599
Sure you know there's protesters

1422
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,647
Everybody loves it again are Soros checks

1423
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,487
I regret to inform you

1424
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,279
That Soros is actually involved

1425
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,047
With this plot

1426
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,839
Against Alex

1427
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:50,143
Ergo

1428
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,191
Lawyer

1429
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:54,239
She is known as a

1430
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:56,031
Absolute

1431
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:04,991
Soros

1432
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,295
Offended her

1433
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,415
You doing this to me

1434
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,231
That is just like

1435
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,279
I mean it's parody

1436
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:20,607
Yeah so Rose is doing this to me and he's going to do it

1437
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:27,007
I mean this guy is really you kind of have to think he's playing with house money right now

1438
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,799
Because he's about to be like

1439
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:33,919
And I think we should put a million dollars out for anybody who takes care of this judge for me like you so close

1440
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,711
Well I think he learned his lesson

1441
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:42,111
About that when you do stuff like that you end up paying $100,000 in

1442
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,415
Judge Campbell actually on

1443
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,439
Unopposed

1444
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:47,487
For this

1445
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,511
59th

1446
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,535
Courts

1447
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,559
Weekend 2018

1448
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,095
There's probably a dump

1449
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:54,911
How to money in there to make sure she beat the lack of a

1450
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,191
Proponent she was up against

1451
01:08:56,703 --> 01:09:00,799
Well I mean the lack of opponent has so much more name recognition right out of the gate

1452
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,591
You know everybody knows no one

1453
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:03,871
True

1454
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,687
So all Alex really has to go on

1455
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:10,527
Is just pointing to this MarketWatch headline over and over again

1456
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,551
Sort of imply

1457
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,599
There any stories about him now or not

1458
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:24,351
Call AP up

1459
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,559
I was walking on the building I just told somebody that

1460
01:09:57,631 --> 01:10:00,191
How did you know could it be because you are told

1461
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,727
Repeatedly

1462
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:07,871
Constant war is your behavior was going to precipitate

1463
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,663
Dreams to figure this one out no

1464
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,943
It also that

1465
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:15,551
MarketWatch headline at nothing to do with creating the illusion of Alex's guilty doll

1466
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:16,319
His actions

1467
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,879
Took this case

1468
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:20,671
Obviously

1469
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,695
Alex needs money

1470
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,255
He doesn't want you to think

1471
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,279
But this is the biggest

1472
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,047
Is this you

1473
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,351
Mike down for this don't got this Clippers

1474
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,119
Is f***** up

1475
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,799
My mom wants to people I know

1476
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,103
I mean Fox

1477
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,183
So

1478
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,975
This stuff is nothing

1479
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,023
The globalist

1480
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,047
Who killed some of Alex

1481
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,071
His family members

1482
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:04,447
I'd like some specifics on this

1483
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:06,495
Is method of death

1484
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:10,079
Until 4 and why you're not.

1485
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:10,847
Totally

1486
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,639
You could only if like some kind of

1487
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:15,455
Giant Mafia cartel Syndicate or whatever

1488
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:18,015
Write somebody as a warning to somebody else

1489
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,319
When they don't back down at that point

1490
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,087
They could kill

1491
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:24,415
Cuz the warning the warning is before you kill

1492
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:26,207
Warning is a murder

1493
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,791
And then the follow-through is more murder

1494
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:32,863
But your pot committed once you've already committed the murder

1495
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,191
You're not going back. Why would you

1496
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:39,775
Exactly

1497
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:41,823
Boy

1498
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:44,127
They are bad at what they do

1499
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,711
I don't believe any of this

1500
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,479
Oaks

1501
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,039
Folks

1502
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:54,367
It just made me think of Tommy Mac

1503
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:56,159
Comedian fluffy

1504
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:56,927
Since that day

1505
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:06,911
Alex

1506
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:16,127
Violated

1507
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,671
Unwillingly

1508
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:30,975
This is from the 7th Amendment

1509
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:33,023
Common law

1510
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:36,095
You have

1511
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,151
Black total violation

1512
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,455
According to the rules of common law

1513
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:54,015
1250

1514
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:58,367
Total violation of that violates the six of them as well

1515
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:03,743
Your rights being stolen that's your Birthright being stolen

1516
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:09,375
How to setup the amendment rights don't apply the state court so this argument sucks but his claim that his sixth amendment right

1517
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:11,167
It's been violated or even sillier

1518
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:16,543
So the first four words in the sixth amendment are quote in all criminal prosecution

1519
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,079
Already

1520
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:21,151
This just doesn't apply to

1521
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,175
Okay okay

1522
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,455
Now I get it

1523
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:26,015
Those two amendments that don't apply

1524
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:29,599
Tell me where the Magna Carta does not protect

1525
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:34,207
Because under the Magna Carta which is I remember it 12:15

1526
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,999
Maintain

1527
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,023
It's Addison

1528
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,815
Forever law right

1529
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:43,423
I'm not sure that Alex really has a really good grasp on this Constitution and Bill of Rights

1530
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:47,263
But you love so much because it prevents bites at this apple

1531
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,567
And both are errata

1532
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:53,919
No as I've stated 10 million times the people who have a pocket cost

1533
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,711
Institution understand it not at all

1534
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:56,479
Right

1535
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,503
As a prop

1536
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,551
100%

1537
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:01,599
Anyway of you as being taken over

1538
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,391
Ian Holm

1539
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:08,255
Globalist again

1540
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:12,095
Is in the process of being looted and absorbed

1541
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:25,151
We'll be right back with the design collaboration

1542
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:27,967
I said it earlier

1543
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,759
I just I kept having this feeling

1544
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:31,807
Global stuff too many f****** plan

1545
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:34,111
Why do they need all of these plans

1546
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:37,695
Like no evil organization would do this to themselves cuz so much of it just

1547
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,719
Doesn't matter

1548
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:39,743
Like what

1549
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:45,119
What is the US economy collapsing matter if 90% of the population is killed off by a vaccine bioweapon

1550
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:47,423
That will happen on its own

1551
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:53,055
None of this makes sense because Alex is just making it up as he goes along you don't need a race war

1552
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:58,431
To cover up the collapsing economy or whatever let's just get this real

1553
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:00,479
They do not need to

1554
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,503
To cover up any

1555
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:06,111
Because we just saw the Pandora papers come and go

1556
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:06,879
Sofa

1557
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,927
Right we know

1558
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:12,767
We saw it all we got it all written down and we still do

1559
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:13,535
I think

1560
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,583
People were more interested in how much

1561
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:19,423
Twitch streamers made a hundred percent correct

1562
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:22,751
Yeah it's doing is basically

1563
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:24,543
Bigoted narcissistic paranoid

1564
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,311
Jazz

1565
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:31,711
But he has the skeleton of these ideas in place and he just kind of rips out about whatever he's feeling on these established themes

1566
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:35,295
That's why you'll get like the global Staffing 100 different plan

1567
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,087
Odds with each other

1568
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,623
Completely contradictory or

1569
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:41,183
Seem to be working toward

1570
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:44,767
Different goals it's because I was just making it up

1571
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,535
Based on his feeling

1572
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:49,631
Yeah I'm really amazed that you can even try the cover it though

1573
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,679
Need to cover up what they're doing

1574
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:52,703
No

1575
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:57,055
No it's covering it up it's all very obvious WeChat you look at this

1576
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:03,455
Okay this Saturday received $100,000 from this company and now they vote differently

1577
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:06,527
Yeah no s*** they're not covering it up at all it's obvious

1578
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,807
You pay for loss

1579
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,111
We all get

1580
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:12,415
Not find its Superbad

1581
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,439
But it said we live

1582
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,231
So

1583
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:17,535
Supply chains are broken down my friend

1584
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,559
Yeah that's true

1585
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,631
And basically what this amounts to is that Alex needs money

1586
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:28,287
Country in the world is in cardiac arrest

1587
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:34,687
And then we're sitting here running out of our supply chain

1588
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,991
Running on a product even find ourselves

1589
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,063
Everybody to go to infowars.com

1590
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:47,487
He's never needed your support now that we needed here to tonight

1591
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,047
Expand

1592
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:58,495
Dot-com

1593
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:03,103
Donation donation

1594
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:06,943
Long-term donation

1595
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:13,087
The funds to fight that he lost a bunch of cases and now he's

1596
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:18,719
Mysteriously at a point where he desperately need he the van Spotlight the globalist

1597
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:19,487
He needs

1598
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:24,095
Needs to expand home and there can't possibly be a one-to-one parallel here

1599
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,887
Now that I am on the hook

1600
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:30,239
Look for a almost about to be astronomical amount of money

1601
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,263
Knowing about

1602
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:32,799
They could be a disaster

1603
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:39,199
Time for me to expand my operation and I need your money together and I also not going to

1604
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:41,503
Tell you the things that I'm going to do

1605
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:48,159
That would give them too much right it's going to be paying off my legal fee and also did you

1606
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:54,559
Read the Pandora papers it is very easy to Offshore your money and they won't get it the globalist hated if I could pay my

1607
01:17:58,911 --> 01:17:59,679
Help me

1608
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:05,567
It'll come as a shock to them I'm not even going to tell them what my plans were this money of yours is

1609
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:07,359
And when I pay off my lawyer

1610
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,151
They will be blown away

1611
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:11,455
Global

1612
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,735
So Alex

1613
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,575
He's very afraid of

1614
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:18,623
Any lies about it a little bit ago

1615
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:20,671
I'm looking for the book out here it is

1616
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:22,975
The great reset

1617
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:25,791
Ashwaubenon advertising is book

1618
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:32,703
About here right now but

1619
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:39,103
Stoke Les Schwab's book The Great reset was released in July 2020 which is a little bit more than a month after the cove

1620
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:39,871
The crisis start

1621
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:42,431
Alex is lying about the book's release date

1622
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,991
Because if it came out a month after covid showed up

1623
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:48,575
That makes it slightly more believable that he wrote it prior to

1624
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:49,343
The pandemic

1625
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:55,999
And Alex get you closer to that idea he's tricked you into getting closer to accepting the conclusion that the entire pandemic

1626
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,559
This is progress

1627
01:18:58,815 --> 01:18:59,327
Towards

1628
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:01,887
You using things that seem

1629
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,423
Like trivial facts

1630
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:07,007
Accept them will bring you closer to accepting his

1631
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:09,311
Completely nonsensical conclusion

1632
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,079
Totally

1633
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,615
It's a it's a manipulation

1634
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,383
Strategy

1635
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:14,175
And also it's just kind of

1636
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,711
It's very fun big

1637
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,247
Can just be like

1638
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,015
See

1639
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,807
There's no way anyone could write a book

1640
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:21,599
A month that's not possible

1641
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:23,391
I've never heard of Isaac Asimov

1642
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,671
F*** all of you

1643
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:25,695
I have no idea

1644
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:29,791
You could write a book in a month first of all second of all

1645
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:30,559
It.

1646
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,351
It's not even about

1647
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:33,631
Facts about making the

1648
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:36,959
Ultimate conclusion slightly mobile

1649
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:39,519
Trapping you in

1650
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:41,055
Acceptable

1651
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,079
Rat distortion

1652
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:42,847
ShopRite

1653
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,895
There's a Polish journalist

1654
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,175
Who was not allowed

1655
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,199
Going to the United

1656
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:49,247
The kingdom analysis mad about that okay

1657
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,039
The social credit scores here

1658
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:54,111
Homeless journalist denied entry the UK over his

1659
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:56,415
Opinions

1660
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,839
Criticizing

1661
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,887
You can come here

1662
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:08,703
News about a man named roof Falls in Kauai

1663
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:11,007
If you're wondering he wasn't bar for my

1664
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,543
Turn UK because of Youth

1665
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:15,104
Views on globalism or the lockdowns

1666
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,920
Turns out he's one of the very Fortune

1667
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:21,504
Folks to be on the home office's list of people who are such s*** heads

1668
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,784
That they can't answer the

1669
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:26,368
This illustrious list includes Americans like Fred Phelps

1670
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,904
Of the Westboro Baptist Church

1671
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,952
And Alex is Buddy Michael Savage

1672
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,744
Typically these are people who are big

1673
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,048
And they have a history of agitating

1674
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:38,656
And I guess the UK government is smart enough to just say we don't want that kind of bulshit over here

1675
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,680
You cannot come

1676
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,448
There is

1677
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:44,288
There is something nice about being a Sovereign Nation that can just say

1678
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:45,824
You're a

1679
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,104
Dick

1680
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,408
Come your values are antithetical

1681
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:52,224
That what we believe in and

1682
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:52,992
You have a

1683
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,808
Proven track record of educated people and causing

1684
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:56,832
A public nuisance

1685
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,112
But it's the UK

1686
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:04,512
I mean you know they got Nigel farage they've got all those people that got enough but it's like you're at

1687
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:11,424
Yeah we can kick Nigel farage out cannot let you in

1688
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,192
Exactly

1689
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:14,752
No Bart

1690
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:21,664
Plural as for this guy Rafal he's a bigot mostly the anti-semitic islamophobic and homophobic

1691
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,432
Variety

1692
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:25,504
The reality is that he's someone who's called the Holocaust a myth

1693
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:30,368
And Alex is trying to whitewash away these details and only presenting as a Polish journalist debate

1694
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,648
That's what he does

1695
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:37,536
If you have

1696
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:40,096
People telling you that you

1697
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:40,864
You shouldn't

1698
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:42,144
Say the n word

1699
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,704
It's a slippery slope

1700
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,496
I'm going to go

1701
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:47,520
Way pass

1702
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:49,824
You shouldn't even need to

1703
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:50,592
Right

1704
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,128
I agree with you but

1705
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:54,432
I think it's Eddie Galaxy thinks it's a slippery slope

1706
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,928
What I say

1707
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:11,840
Mother father

1708
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:17,216
I'm sorry do that okay

1709
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,104
Don't use the word manhole

1710
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,272
Infowars.com

1711
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:33,344
And says that white people are inherently bad

1712
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:36,416
Parasites in our evil mutants

1713
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,488
Article

1714
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,536
Infowars.com

1715
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:44,864
Where We Are

1716
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:48,960
So first of all none of the words Alex's singer band are actually band at all

1717
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:51,520
You can say the n-word if you want there just might be

1718
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,312
For doing so

1719
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:58,944
You can say mother and father all you want they were just conversations about making turns used on official documents

1720
01:22:59,200 --> 01:22:59,968
Gender-neutral

1721
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:01,504
So as not to stigmatize seems

1722
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,272
Sex parents

1723
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,832
Houses rambling about nothing in a Canada

1724
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:06,624
Just feels like he wants to say the n word

1725
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:09,440
Just what it feels like to be that way

1726
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:11,744
Time for that thing about white people being mutant

1727
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,560
This is one of Alex's big headlines for the day

1728
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:18,144
The left didn't say that it was just one person named Frances Cress welsing

1729
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:24,032
Wilson was an Afrocentric activist and I think it might be fair to describe her beliefs as being

1730
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:24,800
Black Supremacy

1731
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:29,152
Haha I'm not sure what site people are referring to but you can find a number a message

1732
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:31,456
Bored posts by people who are very mad

1733
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,224
Today quote

1734
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,528
Black History Month website quoted her

1735
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,368
I have no idea what's going on and I can't find a link to the site in question and

1736
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:40,416
Even if you assume it's all true Alex's

1737
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:41,184
Presentation

1738
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:41,952

1739
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:42,976
Yeah

1740
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:48,864
I didn't I didn't even cut this clip out but it one point in the in the

1741
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,144
The episode Alex is like

1742
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,168
Yeah you know what

1743
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,960
We are all mutants

1744
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,264
Okay okay

1745
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,080
Great then you retract your complaints

1746
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,360
Because you're fine

1747
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:02,432
So look too late for them wo

To say the n word

1754
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:12,672
True

1755
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,976
And destroyed journalism

1756
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,000
It's too late for that

1757
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:17,536
Because Alex

1758
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,584
Is to Credible

1759
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,376

They don't want it

1763
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:38,784
That was up on it

1764
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:43,136
You're not going well

1765
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:45,440
Stalling

1766
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:46,720

1767
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:49,536
Too late everybody knows I'm right now

1768
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:54,144

Scott McKay better-known is Patriot Street Fighter the high-octane Full Throttle truth

1771
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:22,048
I don't really care to respond to Alex's claims that he's too credible to be allowed on are just to let that sit there

1772
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:24,352
Yeah that commercial sounded weird though

1773
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,888
That was a

1774
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,424
It's too late

1775
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,192
It's too late

1776
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:31,520
Hi everybody we're going to have a good time

1777
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:37,920
The Patriot Street Fighter the truth Hammer what is this local market ass commercial doing it

1778
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,968
Alex's big-time important

1779
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:46,112
If you could Putin cares about the Streetfighter Patriot nonsense

1780
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:50,208
So I decided to learn a little bit more about who this guy is and I found his Twitter

1781
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,488
This guy named Scott

1782
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:53,280

Patriot street fight

1790
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:11,200
Immediately drop that part off for the commercial

1791
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:16,576
Seems like you say it seems like anyone

1792
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:17,856
He doesn't give a

1793
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,392
F*** man you called

1794
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:24,000
Q&A globalist deep State set up and here he is taking add money to promote the cube

1795

1796
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:32,704
Lita fight these f****** lawsuit I guess so

1797
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,800
I scroll down a little bit on his Twitter page and I saw a picture of him and I immediately realized

1798
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,848
He's a dude that I've seen as a guest on

1799
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:39,616
Camelot

1800
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:46,016
And we might have actually talked about him on the podcast

1801
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:53,440
So also like atoms with a guest on his show back in August so I guess this dude is another Direct

1802
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:57,280
Connection between Infowars and Project Camelot World on real fun

1803
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,304
Just everywhere

1804
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,608
Here's a couple of bad signs about his tour

1805
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:05,984
The first is that tonight when this episode comes out he's speaking at the farm boy garage

1806
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,032
Which is a car restoration shop

1807
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:12,384
Wow this is being billed as a pre-show for the Trump rally with no suribeats

1808
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,408
Spectacular

1809
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:14,176
Small

1810
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:15,456
Probably more troubling

1811
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:19,552
Is that he has dates listed on his website from October 16th to December 4th

1812
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,856
With specific cities on

1813
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:22,880
On specific dates

1814
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:26,720
But the venue for all of them is DVD

1815
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:29,792
The page says quote

1816
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,328
Site has not been determined

1817
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:37,728
And if you know of potential location on Texas page

1818
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:38,496
Communication

1819
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:41,312
It's not how you plan a tour

1820
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:42,592
This is not going to go well

1821
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:48,992
Just want to let everybody know we'll be doing the knowledge fight theater tour across the United States are going to be doing

1822
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:49,760
20 days

1823
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,528
Next year

1824
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:56,928
If you know any theaters and can feel them for a Jiffy Lube Jiffy Lube

1825
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,464
About a follow-up

1826
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,512
Whoa

1827
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:04,864
Oh boy I think this is this is maybe putting the cart before the horse a little bit

1828
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,424
But it's good that he'd instead of finding

1829
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,192
Venues

1830
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:10,496
In advance to promote

1831
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,592
Buying an ad on Super Bowl

1832
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:15,360
First

1833
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:17,152
And then you get the infrastructure

1834
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:23,808
Right that's how it's always worked that's how it always will work I've been in the entertainment business for a long time

1835
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:26,368
I love that Alex is willing to promote it

1836
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,696
Legit not happy

1837
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:32,768
Ohio State's might not happen or they might happen

1838
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:33,792
Interpark

1839
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:36,608
I promoted my first appear and I remember this

1840
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:38,400
I remember promoting

1841
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:40,704
The first time I was going to be on cysk

1842
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,752
And it was about

1843
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:43,776
8 month

1844
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:46,080
Listen to when I started doing stand-up

1845
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:49,152
And then about six years later I did it

1846
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,480
I promoted the s*** out of it and then

1847
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,760
6 years later in half

1848
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:56,320
Storyworks

1849
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,880
I know that sometimes

1850
01:28:59,392 --> 01:28:59,904
Dunno

1851
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:00,928
This happened

1852
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:02,464
Independent

1853
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,488
Touring get out like

1854
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:06,048
Maybe you have nine out of 10 Dates

1855
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:08,096
You have a venue and you like well

1856
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:10,144
Will be between these two cities

1857
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:14,752
We can fit in another date there we'd like to hit this other City

1858
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:16,032
That happens sometimes

1859
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:21,408
But this is two months of no venue say if you got if you got 10 Dates

1860
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,480
And then all the sudden one of your venues drops out

1861
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:29,344
They double-booked second do something anything along those something else came up that's not the

1862
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,112
CBD

1863
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,392
This is

1864
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:34,208
I'm going to your city and I'm going to start talking

1865
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:35,232
In some way somehow

1866
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:36,768
Somewhere Bakery

1867
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:37,792
Don't care

1868
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:39,072
Next

1869
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:39,840
Starbucks

1870
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,936
Globalist

1871
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:44,704
Truth ever

1872
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,032
So damn good

1873
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:51,360
Distracted by a weird commercial on Alex's show portion

1874
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:56,480
Facebook is down

1875
01:29:56,992 --> 01:30:00,064
Okay obviously this started happening about an hour ago Facebook

1876
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,880
WhatsApp Messenger

1877
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:04,928
Oculus VR

1878
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:20,032
Eonline

1879
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:22,080
Offline

1880
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:24,640
Probably going on there I figure that out real quick

1881
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:27,456
That was fast

1882
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,248
Almost like you too

1883
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,784
Made it up.

1884
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:33,344
Maybe you just heard and then made it up

1885
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,672
Great I promise to say about that

1886
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:38,976
This one I've been waiting for

1887
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,256
Alex

1888
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:43,584
Completely whips on this one minute acular fashion

1889
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:46,912
What's going on is biting it made some comments

1890
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,448
About protesters

1891
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,984
Following Cinema

1892
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,776
And

1893
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:54,336
Alex is trying to

1894
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:55,616
Sort of Defense

1895
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:57,664
Cinema and also attack biting

1896
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:59,456
In this all boy

1897
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:00,480
This is just

1898
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,016
Incoherent

1899
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,552
A little baby

1900
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:04,320
It's more in bear

1901
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,648
Biden

1902
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:10,208
Pissed off

1903
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:13,536
And that's something that's up in the line but it's

1904
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:18,144
Civil disobedience

1905
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:25,824
I need the people in the back so

1906
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:29,408
Buildings as mostly peaceful

1907
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,224
I didn't go into the u.s.

1908
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:32,992
Capital

1909
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,016
Owen Shroyer

1910
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,600
Also I hear Shelbina

1911
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:44,000
4th democratic

1912
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:51,424
I've been over the weekend by a mannequin head people on high actually

1913
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:57,824
Into a restroom

1914
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:02,176
I don't think they're appropriate axis pain happens to everybody

1915
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,016
Happen to people

1916
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:08,320
Who have Secret Service standing around

1917
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:17,536
What part of the process process to have one of your supporters go shoot a bunch of people are trying to

1918
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:21,888
Michigan independent

1919
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,936
That's just embarrassing

1920
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:26,240
One thing you cover this

1921
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:31,104
Times did not say that the school shooting was a good thing or defended it

1922
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,664
This is something completely fabricated in his

1923
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:34,944
Portable shed

1924
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:41,344
Also it's really fun how that dude who did the shooting was a Bernie Sanders supporter literally every time it's

1925
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,112
Come up

1926
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,392
But now I guess he was in Dubai

1927
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:46,464
Fools like Alex is making s*** up as he goes along.

1928
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:50,048
So what happened here is the Alex thought he had a point

1929
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,840
He was going to be able to score on by

1930
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:58,496
The idea was that Biden was endorsing the protesters following Cinema into a bathroom which I guess proves Alex

1931
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:01,568
Suspiria that there's different treatment for left and right leading protests

1932
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:04,384
Did the capitol get arrested

1933
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,152
GolfNow

1934
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:05,920
So

1935
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:06,944
Clip Alex

1936
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:07,712
Plays

1937
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:11,040
It doesn't say what Alex

1938
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:17,184
Said he was in a real unfortunate that it doesn't say that explicitly says that he didn't think that those are appropriate Act

1939
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,976
Alex set up his cloak

1940
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:20,000
Completely wrong and

1941
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:21,792
Painfully obvious as it's playing

1942
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:22,560
2 in the morning

1943
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:23,840
But you have to find a way to ship

1944
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:24,864
Detention is soon as the

1945
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,632
The clip is over

1946
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:29,472
The magically the guy who shot scalise is Valerie Biden supporter

1947
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:33,056
This is a rhetorical version of Alex waving a red flag at a bull

1948
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:34,848
And I suppose in this metaphor the

1949
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:37,664
The bull is the consequences of his lack of preparation

1950
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:40,224
Maybe I'm not sure I've lost track of the metaphor but

1951
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:42,528
Yeah that one might have

1952
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,064
What is it to distract

1953
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:47,392
Compactor Galaxy's engaging ideas no relation

1954
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,416
A reality

1955
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:51,744
And also what weird thing

1956
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:54,048
Leave that one alone

1957
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,608
That's such a weird one to even try and bring up

1958
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:03,776
I think it shouldn't he be fine with it I think that enough people were talking about it and he figured it was away could score a point on bike

1959
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:05,056
Probably hadn't walked

1960
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:10,432
Watch the clip and just had a sense of it maybe a few things

1961
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:11,968
Here's how I minute dunk on

1962
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:16,576
This in order to weave it into all of my narratives about right-wing aggrievement

1963
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:18,880
Yeah like we repress today

1964
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:19,904
I'd like these

1965
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:23,744
These liberal protesters can get away with anything they changed the bathrooms

1966
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,024
Bam

1967
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,048
And it just doesn't work

1968
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:27,072
It it's not

1969
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,096
Yeah it doesn't play

1970
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:28,864
Yeah

1971
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:29,888
I mean

1972
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:31,424
I would have been just like

1973
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:37,568
I would have assumed he would have gone like a vet that's all they're doing and they're all complaining about it that's

1974
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,616
That's the angle

1975
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:46,784
I also think if you're listening to that clip of Biden you see a bit of self-effacing this

1976
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:50,368
Only time they don't do that is very secret service around here

1977
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:54,464
I'm not subjected to this kind of thing

1978
01:34:54,720 --> 01:35:00,352
The implication is when I was a senator

1979
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:01,888
Not that this is okay it's

1980
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:02,656
It's not a good time

1981
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,424
Toxic

1982
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,216
But it is something that people deal with

1983
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:08,544
Edwin more fun if he was like no of course I don't support

1984
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:11,360
That what should happen is every time she wears

1985
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,128
Clean clothes

1986
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:13,152
Somebody throws up

1987
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,432
The fake blood on Earth

1988
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:17,248
And then the moment she changes her clothes

1989
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:19,296
Another one

1990
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:20,320
Another one

1991
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:21,344
So the globalist

1992
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,648
So they're spreading new viruses around

1993
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:25,696
And this is big news for Alec

1994
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,976
But there might be something big

1995
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:34,144
This is the real globalist attacks they intend to hide claiming a new virus has been released which they're already claiming new variants

1996
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:36,960
Because you're releasing

1997
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:41,568
Sales of our history

1998
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:42,336
Today

1999
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:46,432
We need fines

2000
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:50,016
Keep this operation on here

2001
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:52,320
But to stay on air and

2002
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:54,112
Continue on in the future

2003
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,208
And we need funding now to do this okay almost like you had some

2004
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:00,000
Expenses pop up

2005
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:03,840
Some things that you didn't maybe budget for for this quarter

2006
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:11,008
Dumbass we need money completely unrelated to those lawsuits that I lost which are totally unconscious

2007
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:17,408
Do so I'm sure I'll be able to challenge entire court

2008
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,176
Lot of money

2009
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:20,736
Very quick so much

2010
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:21,504
Sale

2011
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,808
I am getting rid of everything

2012
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:30,208
Because when they lay that judgment down they're going to liquidate it anyways and I've worn out anybody giving a

2013
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:34,560
S*** about you saying that there's a money boss that again

2014
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,584

Thomas wren

2016
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:43,264
Who's a lawyer apparently and got and

2017
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:45,312
Yeah this guy's this guy's a weirdo

2018
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:47,104
Give some information about covid

2019
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:47,872
That's not good

2020
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:53,248
And that information showed and it's incontrovertible straight from the CMS servers

2021
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,784
That there

2022
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,344
Thousands and thousands dying with this vaccine

2023
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:02,720
48,000 dad within 14 days

2024
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:07,072
If you're within 14 days

2025
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:09,632
Perfectly healthy you go get the shot

2026
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:12,448
Three days later your dad you're not a vaccine.

2027
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:16,032
48000

2028
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:18,336
I'm not sure this guy knows what Within Me

2029
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:21,408
Within 14 days includes

2030
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:22,176
Three days off

2031
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:23,968
No

2032
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:25,248
Yes that's up

2033
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,344
In the set of whole numbers

2034
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,648
Between 1 and 14

2035
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:32,928
Right Within

2036
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:33,696
No

2037
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:41,376
This is a Thomas Ren's first made these claims in a speech he gave it a Colorado Springs stop on The Reawakening

2038
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,144
America Tour

2039
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:48,544
TBD that venue

2040
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,872
Out of idiots on the panel with the headliner being General Flynn

2041
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:55,968
He also had Stella Immanuel talked about on the show Patcher

2042
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:57,504
Woodburn is also come up on the show

2043
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,808
Alex's favorite grocer alfio

2044
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:00,832
Skater speed

2045
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:02,880
And what's this ovacue Patriots

2046
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:07,488
Street Fighter Scott

2047
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,256
Of course he was

2048
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:12,608
Reduce the data he's playing this comes from it's all very suspicious

2049
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:16,192
The most likely explanation for what's going on is that he's just trying to repack

2050
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:19,008
Get to the old conspiracies about vaccine deaths that people took

2051
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:20,032
Coronavirus data

2052
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,872
Going back to July rent was serving as the lawyer for America

2053
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:24,896
Does Frontline doctors

2054
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:28,224
The wacko group of doctors who love hydroxychloroquine

2055
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:31,808
Lawsuit on their behalf against the Secretary of Defense

2056
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:33,600
Department of Health and Human Services

2057
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:37,440
And in that filing he included a section about some alleged whistleblower

2058
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:38,208
Testimony

2059
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:43,840
Getting expert Jane Doe who is a computer programmer who had access to Medicare and Medicaid data

2060
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:45,120
From the lawsuit

2061
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:48,704
Quote in her expert opinion varies under-reported deaths

2062
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,800
Caused by the vaccines by a conservative factor of at least five

2063
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:59,712
As of July 9th 2021 various reported 9048 deaths associated with the vaccine

2064
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:03,808
Dana from CMS medical claims

2065
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:08,160
And has determined that the number of deaths occurred within 3 days of injection with a vaccine

2066
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:11,488
Exceeds those reported by a by a factor of at least five

2067
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,512
Indicating

2068
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:16,096
That the true number of deaths caused by the vaccines at least

2069
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:17,888
At this point

2070
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,192
There was this 45,000

2071
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:25,568
Configure which is based on Anonymous expert witness who is guessing that you can multiply the Thursday to buy 5

2072
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,104
To get the true vaccine death

2073
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:29,152
This is absolute garbage

2074
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:30,176
Anna means nothing

2075
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:36,832
She didn't get to this conclusion by way of data or death records she was just gassing and multiplying and then rinse put that into his wall

2076
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:39,648
I'm not impressed by any of this and it's

2077
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:42,976
Clearly him trying to just sort of redo the same hostel

2078
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:44,512
This is

2079
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:49,888
Until that he's bringing about is based on whistleblower information involving Medicare and Medicaid date

2080
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:51,680
Yeah this is this is all just

2081
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:52,448
3pac

2082
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:53,216
Get depressed

2083
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:55,776
Rims of the 44-year old dude who quote

2084
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:59,104
Pass the Ohio bar exam in November 2019 on his

2085
01:39:59,360 --> 01:39:59,872
Fifth attempt

2086
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:04,224
And his limited litigation experience according to a Washington Post examination of a

2087
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:04,992
His career

2088
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:06,784
You just found a Grifton

2089
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:10,112
He's going with it he's running with it.

2090
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:13,184
Yeah I mean you know

2091
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:19,584
You can't say you can't say that the headliner that bill is doing anything different than that I mean it's basically the same s***

2092
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:25,984
Some random person send them some random b******* and they drift off of it until they can you pass the bar

2093
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:32,128
Couple months ago and you're like hey holyshit here's a career I'll make my career by being this guy

2094
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:36,224
Yep and it worked there will never be any negative consequences in the

2095
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,248
Future

2096
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:40,576
You've got some other whistleblower document

2097
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:42,880
That show that if you get vaccinated

2098
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:44,416
More like

2099
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,488
That doesn't make sense

2100
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:53,120
That's Observatory

2101
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:55,680
This is a direct quote

2102
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,944
This is an exact quote

2103
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:08,224
Document

2104
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:11,552
Is it right

2105
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:13,344
Exercise

2106
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:16,928
An additional analysis appears to indicate

2107
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:20,000
Incidence of covid-19

2108
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:22,048
Increased

2109
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,144
In each group of study participants

2110
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:28,704
With increasing time Posto's to

2111
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:30,496
Well

2112
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:35,616
So does that mean that

2113
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:38,432
Are you ask

2114
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:40,480
Sing me it's supposed to be your information

2115
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:44,832
I found this presentation on his website he has the slides up and it's really fun

2116
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,904
The first slide is so f****** cock

2117
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,184
Quote

2118
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:54,816
Fact-checkers please post all apologies for misleading the American public on Facebook and Twitter

2119
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:59,680
They will be censured shortly thereafter you could join the rest of us in social media jail

2120
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:01,984
At no point in time

2121
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,032
Look

2122
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:08,384
If there's anything that we should Hammer into first graders this is

2123
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:10,176
Before we get to arithmetic

2124
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:11,968
The definition of

2125
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,760
And ways to avoid

2126
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:14,528
Hubris

2127
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:19,136
That is all we need to start with that's a fundamental education

2128
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:20,672
Avoid hubris

2129
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:23,232
The story of Icarus is relevant

2130
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:29,632
So I scroll down the to the page that ranz is talking about apparently and FDA briefing document from the vaccine

2131
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:31,680
Seems unrelated biological product

2132
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:32,960
Advisory committee meeting

2133
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:34,496
From September 17th

2134
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:35,520
21

2135
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:40,128
This page on his presentation includes the heading of it and then a random

2136
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:41,152
Paragraph from

2137
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:41,920
The document

2138
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:47,296
This is an easily accessible document you can find the whole thing you did not need a whistleblower to get to it

2139
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:52,928
I'm packed I found it and what's going on is that the line that he read theirs being taken

2140
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:53,952
Completely out of con

2141
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:56,768
It does say that quote

2142
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:02,144
An additional analysis appears to indicate that incidence of covid-19 generally increased

2143
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,936
In each group of study participants

2144
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:06,496
Fence with increasing time post dos2

2145
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,776
At the start of the analysis

2146
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:08,544
Suspiria

2147
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,312
That is

2148
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:10,080
Gotcha

2149
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:14,432
Because rent is PowerPoint presentation just drop this paragraph out of the text

2150
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:18,016
You wouldn't know what this is referring to or even what's being analyzed

2151
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:19,552
Seems like that would be important

2152
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:20,576
Information that is

2153
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:24,416
This is a study that Pfizer carried out and it was meant to quote

2154
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:26,464
Compare rates of covid-19 among

2155
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,232
Participants

2156
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:29,792
Completed the two-dose primary series early in the

2157
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:30,560
The study

2158
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:34,656
I either those were originally randomized into the experimental group

2159
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:36,960
Versus those who were who

2160
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:39,008
Completed the two-dose primary series

2161
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:40,288
Later in the study

2162
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:43,360
I either those were originally randomized to placebo

2163
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:45,920
And then crossed over to the experimental group

2164
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:50,528
There is not an unvaccinated group that these people are being compared to these specific

2165
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:51,296
Appointed to study

2166
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:57,696
Was just a test to see if there's a waning efficacy of the vaccine and if so was it something that should be addressed by boo

2167
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:03,840
In the paragraph that rents uses they do say that people who got the shot earlier had 70 points

2168
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:04,608
Three cases

2169
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:05,632
/ 1000

2170
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:06,912
Person years

2171
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:09,472
Compare to 51.6 cases

2172
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:12,032
For the group that was vaccinated more recently

2173
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:13,056
In the same

2174
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:13,824
1000

2175
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:14,592
Person years

2176
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:16,640
That would tend to support Rent-A-Center

2177
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:19,456
Or at least implied that vaccine efficacy could

2178
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,224
Drop off a bit

2179
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:20,992
Sure

2180
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:21,760
However

2181
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:24,832
Wren's very clearly intentionally ignored v-neck

2182
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:26,112
Paragraph

2183
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:27,648
Quote

2184
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:29,952
In contrast during the Blind and placebo

2185
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:32,000
Controlled follow-up. Of the study

2186
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:34,560
The data cutoff March 13th 2021

2187
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:36,096
Prior to the Delta Varian

2188
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:37,376
Answer the internet

2189
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:38,656
It's of covid-19 in a month

2190
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:40,448
Recipients in the valuable

2191
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:43,520
Valuable efficacy population

2192
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:47,616
Nearly 60% of whom had four months or more of blinded follow-up

2193
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:48,640
Post dos2

2194
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:51,968
Was 12.6 cases per 1000 person

2195
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:53,760
This observation

2196
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:56,064
Suggest that while waiting immunity is 1 / 2

2197
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:59,648
Cancel factor that may have contributed to the higher incidence breakthrough cases

2198
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:01,184
During the Delta variance search

2199
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:03,232
It's possible that other factors

2200
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,000
EG

2201
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:08,608
Dynamics of the Delta variant transmission and potential differences

2202
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:10,144
In vaccine effectiveness

2203
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,704
Cancel Delta variant versus strain circulated during the

2204
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:13,984
Sibo control portion

2205
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:14,752
How's the trial

2206
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,288
May also have

2207
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:17,056
Contributed

2208
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:21,408
This isn't saying that the vaccine will make you more likely to get

2209
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:22,176
Covid

2210
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:28,576
The part that rents his using is saying that one dataset showed some indications of people who got vaccinated more recent

2211
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:32,160
May have better protection than those people were vaccinated longer ago

2212
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:34,208
But there's also dated

2213
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:35,744
It seems to indicate that conclusion

2214
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,024
Might not be so certain

2215
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:38,560
Other factors

2216
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:39,840
Could be involved

2217
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:41,120
Adidas ignore that

2218
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:46,752
Anyway Thomas Renzo just cherry-picking bullshittin pretending credible whistleblowers are involved needs

2219
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:47,776
Rightly

2220
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:49,568
Figure it out all this stuff

2221
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:54,688
Only thing that he's figured out is that there's a lot of money to be made in being a lawyer for these right-wing s*******

2222
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:57,248
Just keep doing the dude

2223
01:45:57,504 --> 01:46:00,832
Yeah I mean in this situation this is one of those like

2224
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:03,392
Do you not know how to read

2225
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:08,512
Do you not know how to read and comprehend or are you reading comprehending in line

2226
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:09,280
Beatbox

2227
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:12,608
I don't like if you pass the bar even on your 5th try

2228
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:13,888
You can read and comprehend

2229
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:16,704
Yeah you can sing or you memorize the answers to

2230
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:22,336
It does tend to em all the surrounding context would lead somebody to a reasonable

2231
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:24,384
Conclusion that he's intentionally ignoring

2232
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:31,040
The other part and the context that makes this line make sense that does sound scary out of contacts

2233
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:37,952
Much like the Seventh Amendment does sound like Alex got screwed out of context

2234
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:40,768
But you need to know the context or else you just have

2235
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,048
The alignment

2236
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:46,656
It does seem like their entire job

2237
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:48,192
Is turning something

2238
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:49,216
Android

2239
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:50,240
God

2240
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:55,616
Look at this this is so unreasonable a reasonable person would never allow this to happen

2241
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:57,408
And then not going

2242
01:46:58,176 --> 01:46:59,200
Well there is a reason

2243
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:01,760
In for it

2244
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:05,344
Also the

2245
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:10,208
This guy apparently was the guy who found the

2246
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:12,000
Not that Mike Adams he's reporting on

2247
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:13,280
What is eBay

2248
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:20,960
Roof doing a lot of work has got it all there's something going on

2249
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:22,752
Institutions are under attack

2250
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:27,872
Yeah meanwhile you look across our nation and all the other institutions

2251
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:30,944
Raucous

2252
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:36,576
Chords to default judgments on me when I gave them

2253
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:37,344
Everything

2254
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:40,928
Assigned a new judge in the second hearing I just said default

2255
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:42,976
Cuz I've lost and

2256
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:47,584
Every

2257
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,888
The Bedrock is

2258
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:53,984
Yeah it really is and I'm going to tell you Alex

2259
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:59,872
We want to be peaceful

2260
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:06,528
Freedom you've lost it

2261
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:07,296
Air Bud

2262
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:10,112
Just say you want to kill people Jesus Christ

2263
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,136
Hey

2264
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:13,184
We want to do this peacefully

2265
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:17,536
But if we don't say I'm now then we won't be able to stay in later so the obvious

2266
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:19,584
Distinction that I'm making is

2267
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:20,608
We should be

2268
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:21,632
Violet now

2269
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:26,752
I listen to this and I checked in on some of these documents I found some

2270
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:28,288
Suspicious

2271
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:30,080
Presentation issues

2272
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:32,896
Next up is really funny

2273
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:38,528
I also have a bunch more information that I'm going to be breaking here coming up as soon as I can get it all analyzed

2274
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:41,088
We always double-check our work before we say anything

2275
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:44,416
Because you know we can't afford to lose our credibility

2276
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:45,696
That's going to be tough

2277
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:46,720
Wow

2278
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:48,512
Just wow

2279
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,304
Just wow

2280
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:53,120
I can't afford to lose my credibility so I'm going to go talk to

2281
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:54,400
Alex Jones

2282
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:56,192
This is the thing

2283
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:59,776
This is why I can never be in charge because this type of s***

2284
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:04,896
This is cartoonish and it requires cartoon based Solutions like this is when

2285
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:06,432
If somebody does that

2286
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:07,968
In my government

2287
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:09,504
We drop an anvil on your head

2288
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:17,696
Play this is a cartoon there's no reason to treat you like you're a real person or rang based solution

2289
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:18,720
This is

2290
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:20,256
How dare you

2291
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:26,912
Clown so anyway these documents then

2292
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:29,728
Document citrins has

2293
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:31,776
However some of the documents that Alex has

2294
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:33,056
And these are the reasons

2295
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:34,592
He is under attack

2296
01:49:34,848 --> 01:49:35,872
And that's why you need to give him

2297
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:36,896
Walking money

2298
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:43,808
What you see on the news

2299
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:45,088
All that

2300
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:46,112
Online

2301
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:49,696
Asian gentleman

2302
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:52,768
If you support us and spread the word about the articles

2303
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:55,584
Videos of rally behind

2304
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:58,144
How to post on Twitter to Facebook

2305
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:09,664
So much

2306
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:13,248
I got to say

2307
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:15,808
I know it's probably

2308
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,088
Obvious

2309
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,368
But his bike

2310
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:19,648
Financial stuff is

2311
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:20,416
Acute

2312
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:22,208
Are not in this episode

2313
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,488
It's it's

2314
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:25,024
I fix that

2315
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,048
He's he's

2316
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:26,816
Very

2317
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:27,584
Very

2318
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:28,608
Worry very much

2319
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:33,728
For the third hour on Monday he has Wayne Allyn root

2320
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:37,056
On the show who's a trumpy talk show host guy

2321
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:40,128
I also made a name for himself originally in like

2322
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:41,408
Sports gambling

2323
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:42,944
Cool yeah

2324
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:45,504
You suck

2325
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,808
But he is on because he has

2326
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:49,088
Apparently written an article

2327
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:50,880
And maybe even a full book

2328
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:52,416
About the necessity

2329
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:54,208
Civil disobedience

2330
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:59,584
I think he wants to bring himself something of a Gandhi for the Trump era describe

2331
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:02,656
I mean look

2332
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:04,448
Violet resist

2333
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:05,984
Going to get you to the top

2334
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:08,032
In today's conservative climate

2335
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:13,920
No at the same time a lot of this is just him

2336
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:15,200
Kind of

2337
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:16,480
Discovering

2338
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:19,808
Elementary ideas about organization

2339
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:20,832
I like

2340
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:23,136
A Grassroots activist

2341
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:28,000
Conservatives kind of hint from him all these years

2342
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:31,072
In the book

2343
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:33,120
The whole book is about one way of a tie

2344
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:36,448
Which is the way Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton

2345
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:37,728
The last four decades

2346
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:40,288
They intimidate Corporate America

2347
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,848
I'm a Believer Alex that nothing happens

2348
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:44,384
On the politicians

2349
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,920
A bunch of nobodies right

2350
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:48,224
The money is what allows them

2351
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,272
To be important to make policy

2352
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:51,808
Giroud our country

2353
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:54,368
Politicians in my opinion

2354
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:56,672
The most important ones are owned by China

2355
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:58,464
Either owned or blackmailed

2356
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:02,048
Even if we are the majority

2357
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:03,584
And we've been the silence

2358
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:04,608
Majority

2359
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:07,168
My book The Great Patriot protest a boycott book

2360
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:08,448
Is all about making us

2361
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:10,240
The loud majority

2362
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:11,776
We got to be loud

2363
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:14,592
We got to tell Corporate America all the checks

2364
01:52:14,848 --> 01:52:16,640
And actually politician

2365
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:19,968
Not with $10

2366
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:22,272
Or a hundred dollars $4,000

2367
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:23,808
P.y.t. million-dollar

2368
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:28,160
So the politicians listen to them

2369
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:30,464
And we got to bring to their knees and starved

2370
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:35,072
Elementary level putting Financial pressure on businesses

2371
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:35,840
This is

2372
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:36,864
Ineffective

2373
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:38,144
Organizing

2374
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:39,424
Strategy

2375
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:45,056
But unfortunately one of the things that he's going to quickly learn is that a lot of these same people that he would like to

2376
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:49,408
The pressure also fund all of the information space

2377
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:50,688
And the politician

2378
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,992
That he supports there is that problem

2379
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:55,296
Yeah it's kind of going to end up being shooting yourself in the

2380
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:56,576
The foot now what

2381
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:57,856
He doesn't understand

2382
01:52:58,624 --> 01:52:59,392
Because he can't take

2383
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:00,928
Get that next step further

2384
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,464
Is that this is an

2385
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,512
Endemic to the entire cyst

2386
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:08,608
And any idea of him being on the right side is quite left

2387
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:10,144
Yeah but

2388
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:13,216
Discovering

2389
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:15,264
Something that everyone is already aware of

2390
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,288
For a long time

2391
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:17,056
But it's cute

2392
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,336
Pisa do you know what

2393
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:19,360
The management is

2394
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:20,128
Has really taken

2395
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:22,944
Taking advantage of the workers

2396
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:25,760
And I just don't think we're being paid well

2397
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:32,160
And there's just no way to negotiate them with by myself because they can just fire me and I know I don't have any protection

2398
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:33,184
Law doesn't protect

2399
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,464
Text me this is a free market

2400
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:39,072
Consists of the only ways the only way is if we all come together

2401
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:40,352
And do something like with

2402
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:44,448
Hold something from these corporate power Brokers

2403
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:46,496
It's all how could we do that

2404
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:51,872
Probably probably not all the way no way there's just no way I found a way

2405
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:55,200
This is so sad

2406
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:58,528
I hired a team of telemarketers

2407
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:01,088
Dialed 116

2408
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:02,880
Most liberal

2409
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:04,416
Companies in America

2410
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:06,720
Marseilles

2411
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:09,280
We conservatives Christians and Patriots

2412
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:11,328
Are the ones buying their products

2413
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,120
But they're spitting in our face

2414
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:18,240
Identified what I think of that

2415
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:20,032
116

2416
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:21,824
Coca-Cola AT&T

2417
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,128
Ben & Jerry's

2418
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:25,920
Victoria's Secret

2419
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:28,480
And we can bring them to their knees

2420
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:30,784
Do I have the telemarketers find out what

2421
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:32,320
102 phone calls

2422
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:33,856
Pushing pushing pushing

2423
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:35,648
What's the phone number to CL

2424
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:37,696
What's the email for the co

2425
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:39,232
What's this social media account

2426
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:41,024
What's the website

2427
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,328
What is the physical mailing address

2428
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:46,144
I got the board of directors names

2429
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:47,936
And the CEOs names

2430
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:49,728
So now you just open the book

2431
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:51,008
And you dial

2432
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:57,664
Discipline implies that it's not his grassroot is who is he wants to sort of imagining me I had to hire a team of telemarketers to harass

2433
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:59,200
Quite literally

2434
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:00,736
They are paid protesters

2435
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,368
Fun stupid

2436
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:12,768
What's the recent like story about how AT&T

2437
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:20,960
Company you know that company that is essentially built a trust

2438
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:26,080
Is unwilling to budge on coverage or anything like that big

2439
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:28,128
Think of Lila Kedrova

2440
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:30,176
Telemarketer

2441
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:30,944
So woke

2442
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:33,248
Eddie paid them

2443
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:34,784
Define theory

2444
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:36,320
Contact information

2445
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:37,600
A CEO's

2446
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:40,416
Stop this book so you can harass them

2447
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:41,696
You know what

2448
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:42,976
I'm fine with that

2449
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:44,256
Because one

2450
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:45,024
1

2451
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:46,560
I think it's hilarious

2452
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:49,120
It's fine if that's how you get to Corporation

2453
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:50,912
By picking the most woke ones

2454
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:53,216
Fine you win

2455
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:57,568
I got the most woke corporations you're not going to like the outcome

2456
01:55:57,824 --> 01:55:59,616
Exactly

2457
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:04,480
Are not served by these corporations

2458
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:09,856
When you say whatever Powers right now or liberal

2459
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:12,928
But whatever it is you need to hate those Corporation

2460
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:14,208
I'm fine with it

2461
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:14,976
God bless

2462
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:17,792
Yeah I think I think that if

2463
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:19,072
Some kind of

2464
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:20,096
The quote on quote

2465
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:21,632
FIFA groupware

2466
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:23,424
Finding CEOs of

2467
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,448
Right-leaning

2468
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:26,496
Companies like Hobby Lobby

2469
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:31,872
Or whatever it posted their contact information

2470
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:35,968
No also I think is an antifa group

2471
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:38,528
The most right leading Corporation

2472
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:39,296
It would be

2473
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:45,440
The Identical f****** list but this a****** I bet there would be over

2474
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:46,208
So

2475
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:47,488
I look Wayne

2476
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:49,024
Good good on you I guess

2477
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:51,328
I only like if you're posting like

2478
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:53,632
Ways to get in contact with

2479
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:55,168
Decision maker

2480
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:56,192
4 carburetor

2481
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:57,984
I don't know if that's bad

2482
01:56:58,496 --> 01:57:02,336
But if you're putting like home addresses or phone numbers are dachshund people

2483
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:04,384
I think that's still maybe like

2484
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:07,456
I don't know if I add at school I'm not sure what

2485
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:11,296
It might just be a corporate email address that's in his book

2486
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:13,344
There's a tale of

2487
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:15,648
Victory that Wayne has got his

2488
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:17,952
Saddest f****** thing I've ever heard

2489
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:21,280
And what just one person upon my book one

2490
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:22,816
On the first day came out

2491
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:24,864
Set me an email and said Wayne

2492
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:27,168
I sent an email to the head of Nordstrom's

2493
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:29,472
Costco

2494
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:33,312
Roketsan why are you boycotting

2495
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:35,616
Don't do this. What can I do to make you happy

2496
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:39,456
I was one can you imagine if we got 100,000

2497
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:40,992
4 million Patriots

2498
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:42,784
I do this every day

2499
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:45,344
Five minutes adjacent 3 out tomorrow

2500
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:46,624
A new three the next

2501
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:52,256
So you hit this guy got like

2502
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:56,608
Customer service emails

2503
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,448
We're going to take this country back

2504
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:04,800
Huh

2505
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:07,616
No way they'll figure out how to organize their inbox

2506
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:11,456
Here I Am the CEO of Costco I got 100,000

2507
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:12,224
Emails

2508
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:14,528
Saying if people were going to boycott us but

2509
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:16,832
Our numbers are unaffected

2510
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:22,464
I'll ignore these emails

2511
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:23,488
2%

2512
01:58:23,744 --> 01:58:26,816
Maybe whenever these emails come in

2513
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:31,168
Formal response so no I'm so sorry oh my God

2514
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:32,448
An email campaign

2515
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:34,240
Huh boy

2516
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:38,848
You know I was just thinking about that woman's marching of the 22 million

2517
01:58:39,104 --> 01:58:42,688
Walking through the streets and how effective that was Buttman

2518
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:47,296
That did everything I can't believe what would have happened if they had run an email camp

2519
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:53,184
I can't count the number of times where like you know I've had something that didn't get delivered or something they like

2520
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,976
I ordered a A-Frame

2521
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:56,000
From Wayfair

2522
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:57,792
Didn't,

2523
01:58:58,304 --> 01:59:00,352
You know like a little kid

2524
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:03,936
Email about how like you this sucks

2525
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:05,216
I got a response

2526
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:08,800
I'm so sorry

2527
01:59:09,056 --> 01:59:09,824
Yeah everyday

2528
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:16,736
To pay their workers more

2529
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:19,040
That one they they did a little while

2530
01:59:19,296 --> 01:59:20,064
Quiet

2531
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:23,392
So we're unlikely.

2532
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:25,440
Is not good

2533
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:29,280
And I'll tell you I'm not the most religious person in the entire

2534
01:59:29,536 --> 01:59:31,840
But I do believe this is the devil

2535
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:34,656
Rules for Radicals is there Bible the left

2536
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:36,704
Dedicated to Lucifer

2537
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:39,776
And it's not a coincidence that the other day said

2538
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:41,824
Well we haven't passed my agenda yet

2539
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:43,872
Play 3.5 trillion dollar bill

2540
01:59:47,712 --> 01:59:48,480
6

2541
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:50,016
6

2542
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:51,808
Why did he say it that way

2543
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:53,088
Cheer chants

2544
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:54,880
York weather sending out

2545
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:57,184
Dammit sending out devil codes

2546
01:59:57,952 --> 02:00:00,512
There's nothing I can do for you sir

2547
02:00:00,768 --> 02:00:01,280
Sir

2548
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:05,376
I'm going to have to ask you to leave

2549
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:08,448
Six week six months

2550
02:00:08,704 --> 02:00:12,544
That's the devil is obviously the devil

2551
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:13,568
Boy

2552
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:17,920

02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:20,480
Response and you know obviously Alex is in

02:00:20,736 --> 02:00:22,528
And not good mood

2555
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:23,552
Now about

2556
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:26,368
The the the the cases could use some money

2557
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:29,184
He's desperately trying to fundraise

2558
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:30,208
Yeah I am

2559
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:30,976
Let me know

2560
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:31,744
Updates

2561
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,072
It's hilariously transparent

2562
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:40,192
On these episodes he hasn't reached a point yet where it would be like

2563
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:41,984
Losing his s***

2564
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:46,080
Right you know I still think that maybe on the horizon

2565
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:46,848
Yeah

2566
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:49,664
Yeah I mean I'm listening to this

2567
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:51,456
Even for an Infowars listener

2568
02:00:51,968 --> 02:00:54,272
I am observing some of this news

2569
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:55,296
And I'm just going

2570
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:56,832
This ship

2571
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:58,368
Is Sanka

2572
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:05,280
Everytime he says he needs money to fight the globalists all I hear is another bucket of water going on

2573
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:11,680
That ship if you're a fan even like how do you not hear this and be like oh he's saying you really really needs money

2574
02:01:12,448 --> 02:01:12,960
He just

2575
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:15,776
Ended up being on the hook for a lot of

2576
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:16,544
Money

2577
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:17,824
In those lawsuits

2578
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:21,920
I think it's connected I don't know if he's trying to expand

2579
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:26,016
Search my memory real quick

2580
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:27,296
His last

2581
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:28,320

2582
02:01:28,576 --> 02:01:30,624

2592
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:06,208
Perceive

2593
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:09,792
Piercy about the lawsuits

2594
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:10,816
