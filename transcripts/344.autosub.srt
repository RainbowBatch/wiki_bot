1
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:23,040
Respectful

2
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:29,440
Knowledge fight

3
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:42,240
Money

4
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:55,040
So Alex

5
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,832
Dot-com

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,168
What is the word on the street

7
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,728
You

8
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,520
Everson oppression

9
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544
In public

10
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,592
Oh man back when I used to work

11
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,128
Groupon

12
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:25,504
All the way from my

13
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
To work

14
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:31,136
Groupon office

15
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,440
Down down Halsted

16
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,536
Chicago Avenue from my place up in

17
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,816
Exactly where I was living

18
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,608
I did get

19
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:47,008
Terminal stop of the Halsted bus

20
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,544
Is it intersects with Broadway

21
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,712
Who cares for everybody outside Chicago that nobody what I'm talking about anyway

22
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:59,808
Bus trip and I would almost fall asleep literally every morning

23
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,832
And every

24
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,648
Return home

25
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,232
Like I feel myself fading

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,144
Fall asleep while asleep

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,216
You already look like YouTube

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
Expect you to be on this bus

29
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,176
Let him have it

30
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,224
Have you ever missed Mr stop

31
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,576
I've missed stops

32
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
Gorgeous

33
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,880
Strong like negligence

34
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,744
Feels like sometimes it's not that bad

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,072
Looks like I got to backtrack a block

36
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:49,728
20 really weird place at the next time I like half a mile

37
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
Yeah it's

38
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,056
I don't know in terms of falling asleep

39
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
Public though actually

40
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
Church

41
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,040
Public then

42
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:09,696
Here's a little church story

43
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
12 ish

44
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,792
Put in that ballpark

45
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,840
I discovered how cool it is

46
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
Lean back in your

47
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,264
Like I realized it non reclining chairs

48
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
The church

49
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
Service

50
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,736
I went to this like megachurch

51
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,504
Pretty big

52
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
The congregation

53
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,344
I was in the back row

54
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,368
It was all like

55
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,648
Stationary chairs

56
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,720
The perfect opportunity

57
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,280
You try out this whole leaning back in my chair thing

58
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,096
It's so I did it and I'll be back

59
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,400
I lose control I just fall backwards

60
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
Bright

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,800
Everybody is like

62
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:03,200
400 people in this room.

63
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,992
Athletic

64
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:09,344
Smooth rolled out of the fall and ran out of the room

65
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,768
I don't know I don't know if anybody as a whole

66
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
Open do it with me

67
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,887
Service

68
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,935
Later

69
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
That day

70
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,983
I'm talking to my brother

71
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,335
And my brother is like oh my God

72
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:36,735
Is it could you see that guy couldn't tell if it was me

73
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
Famous falling asleep

74
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
Pretty embarrassed

75
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,679
And I only know what you tell me about both that's correct

76
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
I'm thrilled to get into some of this

77
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,919
Just people have signed up and are supporting the show

78
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,759
Daniel

79
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
Ewok

80
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,071
Colin

81
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,447
Thank you so much

82
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,287
I'm a policy wonk

83
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
But you are now a policy wonk

84
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:41,247
Garage Dubois

85
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,487
I would I would say that the rhyme doesn't quite work yet I wear that to be the case

86
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
Also I think it involves

87
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,327
Salad dressing

88
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,983
We really appreciate that

89
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,079
, wizard of

90
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,127
You are both wonderful technocrat

91
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,159
Heroin

92
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,023
Freakishly large

93
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,863
Thank you so much

94
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:33,215
Oz, Wizard of

95
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:40,383
Absolutely

96
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,199
Click the button that says appreciate it

97
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,295
So Jordan I hope to do a wacky one

98
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:52,927
Episode for today but I regret to inform you that

99
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,511
Has not gone back to Vacaville prison to talk to Mark Richards

100
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
Yet

101
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,095
Cheapies that it's going to happen

102
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,655
And then the rest of the episodes are like

103
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
I can't do it

104
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,495
She interviewed like a former guitarist of the

105
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
Steve Miller Band

106
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,823
About happy life

107
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:16,479
It's surprisingly not that good it was not something I could really think my

108
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
I teach him to let's say

109
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:21,855
Did he also get into

110
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
Aliens

111
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,463
It has to do with like twins have

112
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
Telepathic

113
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
Connections

114
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
I don't know I didn't

115
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,351
I couldn't handle it

116
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:38,495
Not allowed who don't like a suspicious person

117
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
Handle

118
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,783
I can't do it it's so boring I know that people enjoy it and I wish that we could do more of it

119
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
If it is so boring

120
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:59,231
He is the worst for the purposes of making fun of him he's the worst

121
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
Yeah

122
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
Either f****** desire

123
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,215
I don't

124
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
Alex

125
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
Is present day

126
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
Is developing

127
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,567
Either

128
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,103
Like

129
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,663
The trend of present-day episode

130
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
Continuing

131
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
I'm in any way that

132
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
Compelling of course

133
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,879
And here we're going to be going over April 9th 10

134
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,415
2013

135
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,207
Because

136
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
Very important

137
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,279
G happening on our last 2013

138
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
Episode

139
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
Where they go

140
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,167
I'll say that I found a couple of really wild thing

141
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,751
In this stretch of time

142
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
Value

143
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,335
Supposed to like let's say talking about

144
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,871
Abracadabra by the Steve

145
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Steve Miller Band

146
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
Alright

147
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,551
Is that a Steve Miller reference

148
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,183
You said I found a couple of wild things okay

149
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:07,839
I thought you thought that went okay

150
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:13,983
I apologize sincerely thought that was a joke

151
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,151
It's the Alex

152
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,943
News item

153
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:27,807
It's been covering in the prior day

154
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,775
Japan and the West Coast in Austin

155
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
So

156
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,927
Alex has

157
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:11,327
Write being in allegedly in South Korea

158
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,655
I keep calling into Alex's show is to be like the media needs

159
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,215
To deescalate this rhetoric it's a load of b*******

160
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:23,615
This is a psyop

161
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
Stupid

162
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,807
North Korea's going to fire missiles tomorrow

163
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:38,719
But even if you got a psych Warfare expert has been coming on your show telling

164
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
Stupid

165
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
Complete

166
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:53,055
Ridiculous

167
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
Those reactors

168
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,407
It's so much more of a complicated situation than Alex

169
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,199
He's selling the version

170
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:05,599
North Korea

171
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:12,511
Real very serious non-proliferation talks withdrawal

172
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,791
Nonproliferation treaty

173
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,375
Had we had some reason they already had

174
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,263
Better react

175
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
Is the light Water Reactor

176
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,079
You can cuz they're much

177
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
Harder to make weapon

178
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,127
Great blue Tony

179
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:33,247
Agreement of selling them

180
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,271
Deactivate

181
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
I'd like demolish

182
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,343
Their other reactors

183
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
And allow weapons in

184
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:44,767
So a complicated deal

185
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Image

186
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
To be with you

187
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
Isn't real

188
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,543
There are similarities in North Korea

189
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,847
Clearly f****** rap

190
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:05,247
Will you understand

191
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
I would possibly make it

192
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
Decision that looks

193
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,343
Little bit weird given Global Circle

194
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
Stances that surround

195
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:16,767
But the Optics

196
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
And they did

197
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,095
Sell light-water reactor

198
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
There's two

199
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
North Korea at the

200
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
Time

201
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:27,263
But it's also before the agreed framework completely collapse

202
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,055
Pakistan like was a 2002

203
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,895
The world is different

204
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,455
Sets of circumstances that were in place then

205
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
The change

206
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,063
Fairly quickly

207
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,927
That's a good one even though it appears that selling reactors

208
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
Is

209
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
Nuclear reservation

210
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
It was an attempt at

211
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
Nonproliferation

212
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
And it just

213
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
Alex doesn't care

214
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
50 old

215
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
Peace with our enemies

216
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
Until when

217
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:08,479
Give up something otherwise

218
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,527
You're not negotiating your

219
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,111
You're just sweet already given Aid

220
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,903
Like terms of

221
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,439
To get them to stay Within

222
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,255
The framework

223
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
Tibet

224
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
I don't know it's just

225
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,887
The subtlety use

226
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
What does not really

227
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:31,263
I think more importantly though like he has this dude who's telling him

228
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Back

229
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
In the pharmacy

230
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,103
China candies like what

231
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
Strange

232
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,991
Next Club Alex has

233
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
Another news item that is

234
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
Continuing another trend

235
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,623
That we saw on our last episode

236
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,671
And I think you really steps

237
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
In a big old puddle

238
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,639
Shooting facility

239
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:26,047
So what's interesting here is that Alex has been dancing around actor ideas in terms of

240
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,423
Yeah doesn't believe he's not

241
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,959
Delivering the

242
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,775
Message to his audience that they're actors

243
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,079
But he's blaming the parents

244
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,151
This is worst

245
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
It's their fault

246
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:49,087
Makes perfect sense if they're fall into the only way to solve this problem is to harass them

247
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,879
Send forever until they die

248
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:55,743
Simultaneously dancing around the actor ideas

249
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,839
Missions there are dead children involved in this

250
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,679
Possibly know what you trying to make

251
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
Cuz it's all over the place

252
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,567
In his acknowledgement that they were children that are dead

253
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:16,479
He's pointing the finger at school

254
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
That's the only way I can

255
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
Gun control that's against the rules

256
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:29,279
Whatever it is like even if he believes there or or if it's

257
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
It Whatever message

258
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
Marketing

259
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,471
It's victimizing another

260
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,615
Wild how bad this is

261
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:50,015
You expect us to just jump down the road

262
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Is like

263
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,087
Guess what

264
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,135
F*** you

265
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:02,559
You took the kids to school

266
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,631
Golf course in Lancaster what are you doing golf

267
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,167
That's your fault

268
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,751
You know that that's a weather disarmament Zone

269
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,591
It's insane but he's transmitter seeing her

270
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
I completely stocked up

271
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,943
It's weirder than I expected

272
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,415
Is waffling position is

273
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
Just as much

274
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
Him like

275
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:36,607
Forgetting whether or not he's lying at this point in time

276
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,167
He might accidentally acknowledge that

277
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,495
It wasn't a false flag the kids actually died

278
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,287
But if you thinking about it

279
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:52,991
Clear everything was a false flag bulshit

280
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,295
Possible like just like the most cynical approach is

281
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
This is Mark

282
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,487
To war

283
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,047
If you're looking at

284
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,607
A perspective that could easily explain

285
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,423
This sort of disjointed Behavior wherever

286
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,031
And then also it's real but it's the government answer parents fault

287
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,591
I don't I don't know what he's doing but

288
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,663
Like if it's accidental it's still manipulative

289
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,943
Gazelle

290
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,343
Baby I'm saying to expect his audience to figure out what the point is

291
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
Until the audience

292
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:35,999
Determines which one they believe in both exist at the same time and then the waveform collapses and guess what

293
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
False flag

294
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,327
Alright

295
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,399
So

296
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:48,799
And the last episode

297
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,151
I mean

298
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,223
Proxy extension

299
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:03,135
To be like a giant editorial move on his part

300
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,671
CPS is coming

301
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:09,023
They're also having sex with the kids and they want to deliver the back to you dead or something

302
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,327
So Alex is

303
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,887
Dovetails into that

304
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
Narrative

305
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,471
And he decides to go Whole Hog with it

306
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,775
He was a very bad idea for him to do that

307
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:25,919
Incredibles

308
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:32,063
Surveillance footage from the dock in Tampa Florida

309
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:38,719
Michael haykin Anaheim

310
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:43,071
Play the Air Force veteran engineer's wife

311
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:46,655
No criminal record

312
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:59,199
I was just watching

313
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,071
Point well-taken about drugs

314
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:21,471
Related

315
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:25,567
I'm with you actually Joshua hate

316
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,103
Isaac

317
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,223
Decided intentionally wrong to make it harder for people to find story about

318
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:37,855
So what's going on here

319
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:42,207
Your kids needs to push that

320
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
Close to be sort of element

321
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:49,375
And that's the end up making Heroes out of this Florida couple who kidnapped their own two children and tried to flee to Cuba

322
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,167
So Alex

323
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,215
Music as the state

324
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
But I don't make the

325
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
Quick snap judge

326
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,079
I need to know more about the

327
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
The case before I made it

328
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,919
The decision about what I thought

329
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
More information

330
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
And before you

331
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,015
Throw out a

332
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:11,391
So my first red flag was from an NBC Miami article about the couple being found trying to

333
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:17,791
Philippe specifically part where the children grandfather who had permanent

334
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,559
The police

335
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,143
This wasn't a case where the kids were adopted after strangers or something

336
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:27,007
He was family members and they were in agreement the Joshua shouldn't have custody of those kids

337
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:32,639
That's a pretty relevant piece of information cuz your family knows you pretty well

338
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,919
They're all globalist

339
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,199
They're all in on it

340
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,527
The second I found particularly interesting was that

341
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:44,927
The first time Joshua tried to kidnap his children

342
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:50,815
Short amount of time after the state has taken away his parental rights

343
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,911
He showed up at that foster home to try and remove them from custody

344
00:20:55,167 --> 00:21:01,311
At gunpoint

345
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:05,151
You're not some kind of noble KIRO you are you are crazy

346
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,440
Do father-in-law who has custody of the children

347
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,816
Just showing up

348
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
To somebody's house

349
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,656
With a gun

350
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,704
Me and you should have your kids taken away

351
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,496
Even if it's trying to get back

352
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,896
That's a different discussion but I don't disagree

353
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:42,784
Normally when a regular person here's a story like this about a parent who's kidnapped their child

354
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,928
Well I won't disagree is a very strong one

355
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,512
Cases where people kidnap their own children are generally ones that involved

356
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,048
Deeply Disturbed individual

357
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,120
So it's usually best to get a little more information before you

358
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,680
Support a particular person in that kind of situation

359
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,472
Alex doesn't play that s***

360
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:07,616
He's got parental paranoia to stir up so he paints Joshua hakken is a hero in man that is a horrible decision that he

361
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:15,040
Reporting is Joshua lost his kids because he was arrested with a bowl of marijuana in a hotel room

362
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,320
Sugar bulshit charge

363
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:22,720
Well then

364
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:29,120
Is giant fish bowl filled with weed pipe

365
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,144
Asian one of those

366
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,008
I can't even talk credibly about weed anymore it's been way too long for me

367
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,080
Little bit of weed

368
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,616
The government evil

369
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,384
These kids way

370
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,664
In reality

371
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,480
I'm going to read you hear from the Tampa Bay Times

372
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:50,880
Slidell police were called to the Holiday Inn where the Higgins were saying on the afternoon of June 17th

373
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
2012

374
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:55,744
After receiving calls about a woman knocking on doors

375
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:59,328
They found Sharon Hagen 34 years old with quote

376
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:03,424
Multiple bruises on her body and bumps on her head where it looks like she would be

377
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:08,800
I heard a child crying through the door of the family's hotel room

378
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:14,432
Entering they found Joshua hakken sprawled on a bed with his children next to him a heavy odor of marijuana

379
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
Smoke hung in the air

380
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,784
Joshua told officers that he would beat his wife Sharon

381
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,576
To quote bring her back to reality

382
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,392
He believed that she was possessed by spirits

383
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:27,488
Unconsciousness multiple times to rid her of those

384
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
Gotcha

385
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,280
Gotcha

386
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,328
Play the biblical literalism

387
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,888
In interviews with authorities the children

388
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,192
Hit her up their mother in their presence

389
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,264
You may have got arrested for marijuana possession

390
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,384
Initially but the reason the situation escalated to the point where he lost

391
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,944
Very serious domestic problems

392
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,504
As a result of their initial call to the hotel room

393
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,784
Which didn't have to do

394
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,392
They got there and found drugs a battered woman crying children

395
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,208
I would have been completely negligent

396
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:58,976
Find

397
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,816
Also according to the Tampa Bay Times article the police found a large knife

398
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,120
In the hotel room which Josh asked them not to

399
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:09,472
To take because quote I needed to complete the ultimate objective of my journey

400
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,752
Okay

401
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:17,152
To complete the ultimate adult large

402
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:22,016
You better either be going through the jungle

403
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:22,784
F******

404
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,600
Returning that knife to the f****** princess

405
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,648
So she can

406
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:34,048
Survivor you better not be hanging out with the wife you admit that you assault

407
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,608
In a hotel room with

408
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:41,472
No big deal but for people who have other problems it's very bad

409
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:52,224
Recent murder possibilities

410
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,504
So that you can just allow

411
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,856
360 what happened now this is murder-suicide written all over absolutely

412
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,928
In discussions with the authorities Joshua laid out his

413
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:05,024
Completely insane theories about how he was subjected to attacks by microwave weapon

414
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,096
And how he was a victim of MK Ultra

415
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,936
You convinced of literally every anti-government conspiracy theory UK

416
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:16,032
Can think of it was ultimately

417
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,104
Ultimately

418
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,152
To 15 years in prison for kidnapping

419
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,480
His children opportunity

420
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,784
Which resulted in him ranting about.

421
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
That's for about 30 minutes

422
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,880
They gave him the opportunity to speak

423
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,696
I mean nobody Oscars

424
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,488
I honestly think also if

425
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,280
We're looking at this from

426
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,304
What's best

427
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,984
I kind of agree with his defense attorney that is like going to prison is not going to help him at all

428
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,616
The hospital said he got 15 years in

429
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,920
Prison yeah I was like

430
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,944
Well that's a bad idea

431
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,344
It seems to confirm a lot of his anti-government paranoia and stuff

432
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,184
I think one of the reasons that he did end up

433
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,208
Pizza

434
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,768
Prison was because there was some dissent

435
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,792
Voices about

436
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,072
His legal insanity

437
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:14,400
Some people who talk to him said that he was

438
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,168
Competency

439
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,984
Sam trial because of

440
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
Agreement there's Xbox

441
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,592
If I were the judge probably would be like

442
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,896
I don't know I would honestly think

443
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,176
Especially after this

444
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:29,504
Diatribe you probably help him

445
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,064
Might be

446
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:38,720
Cuz clearly drugs are involved

447
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,768
I don't know I don't know

448
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,376
If he was if he was a school shooter Alex might have a thing that he was on

449
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,472
Maybe he refused all drugs

450
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,240
Whenever he was

451
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,800
Holding

452
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,872
Another reason of

453
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
Be pointless to put in

454
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
Prison is busy

455
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,944
He's not going to

456
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,344
No no no not going to take

457
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,744
I don't know if that's part of the reason for why they wanted to go to hospital

458
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,768
Air on the side of like

459
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,048
Put him in a federal

460
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
5

461
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,144
Yeah I said where I doubt prison guards are going to

462
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,216
You take your meds today

463
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,264
I have no idea

464
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,824
What you have here is very

465
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,640
Violent

466
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,432
But I understand

467
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:33,504
I'll reach you from the Tampa Bay Times article

468
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,064
Twice

469
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,880
Survive attempts on his life

470
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,160
Can foxes Bow Down

471
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,696
He said okay

472
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,976
Icarus

473
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,024
Muhammad to the Shiite Muslims

474
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:51,424
I am the Joshua of the tribe of Judah I am the pahana the white friend of the Hopi

475
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,728
I am the one written about in prophecies

476
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,008
Okay

477
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,288
So all right

478
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:00,896
This guy's a little out there

479
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:06,272
This is the story of a heroic father who wanted to reclaim his children from the evil stage

480
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,320
Confront him

481
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,624
Abuser kemetic insane levels of domestic

482
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,720
It's staggering to imagine what those kids were going through in that household

483
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,512
And what they went through when they were kidnapped

484
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,792
We just consider

485
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,352
In order to kidnap the children Joshua actually

486
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,888
Tied up their grandmother

487
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
To get away with

488
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:26,496
And when the kids were rescued they were badly sunburned

489
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,544
For being out on that boat that was headed to Cuba

490
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:34,944
This is a seriously traumatic event

491
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,992
Talking to them about this is like

492
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,296
What we're doing is pretending it was a vacation

493
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,624
2 + 4

494
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,256
Make this not be evident experience as a trauma

495
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
And I think that's great

496
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,608
But even so I don't think there's going to be a fingerprint of like

497
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,936
For sure there's going to be some

498
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,264
Yeah but the reality doesn't matter.

499
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,544
It's all about sex

500
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,848
And here we have a story that he can turn into being about the

501
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,872
The evil government taking

502
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:09,760
Give a f*** about what he's actually doing this guy

503
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,808
It's important domestic violence

504
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,648
I like I like how he has all of that with

505
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:20,512
But just so that he was tired of it

506
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,304
And so we went and got him

507
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,096
The end of the story for him

508
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:28,960
That doesn't sound right no because also prior today

509
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,008
Yeah but still

510
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,080
I would totally understand that

511
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,504
If you were absent from his coverage of the story

512
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,904
Would be like

513
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,000
And I understand the appeal of that line of thinking a

514
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:52,768
And that rhetoric

515
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,096
Inseparability of Perinton

516
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,912
The child is archetype

517
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,192
I'm like let's say if some

518
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,984
Gang of

519
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
The mafia

520
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,664
If it's cool

521
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,456
Like proper recourse

522
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,248
In terms of like systems

523
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,016
Where

524
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
You can get

525
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,880
Your parental rights back with the mafia they don't have those

526
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,696
Because Noster do you have hearing

527
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,816
Once a year to see if they can give competency hearings with

528
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,120
The dawn or whatever

529
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,448
What's the date

530
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,824
I realize that

531
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,640
Like it really is just it's a part of the Alexs

532
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,944
Continuing coverage of the globalist want

533
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
This

534
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,016
Weaves perfectly into it so you don't care about that

535
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,808
Details

536
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,624
For me to like be okay that's why I

537
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,648
Recovering

538
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,184
For the more he kept talking

539
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,744
The more I realized there was another reason

540
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
There we go

541
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:32,608
Joshua hakken was an info Warriors

542
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,032
A reporter who showed up at his house

543
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:45,152
Infowars bumper sticker on the guys mailbox

544
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,432
So Alex

545
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,968
As every reason

546
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:53,344
I'm to protect protect the brand

547
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,136
What's interesting about this

548
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:58,976
Cuz like if Alex ran into this guy on the street

549
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:05,376
This fan

550
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:15,360
I got to go I like you I think

551
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:20,992
Cool wall

552
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:28,160
Pink and painted a mural on the wall of us

553
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,976
Going to be in prison

554
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,536
And his story can be manipulated and used

555
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,584
To support whatever narratives Alex has

556
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,984
He's already Niro

557
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,336
What sticker on the mailbox was the mail person

558
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,360
And I walk to that

559
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,128
Mailbox every

560
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,528
Because there's no way on Google

561
00:32:55,296 --> 00:33:00,672
I think that might be illegal or a bomb or something

562
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,000
Pop out. Don't tread on me

563
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:11,424
Is a secret any disruption of the mail service regardless of who does it

564
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,216
I believe that

565
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
McKay's

566
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,032
It's one of those things I get technically

567
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,336
As I recalled a felony to like

568
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:21,664
Smash mailboxes

569
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,456
Like petty larceny

570
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:29,600
They didn't have weather rain nor sleet nor hail nor Infowars

571
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,952
I think Infowars bumper

572
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,744
Still open

573
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:42,656
Little bit more about this situation

574
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,192
This is really interesting

575
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,264
Because he's tries to read an article about it

576
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,568
Listen very carefully because there is a

577
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,592
Certain point

578
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,872
Were you stopped reading

579
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,664
And I know where that point is

580
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,504
Maternal grandparents

581
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,416
Michael Hagan

582
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,464
Goes on from there

583
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,328
You know what is Elijah's

584
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:17,472
What kind of a f*** you f*** you Alex from 2013

585
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:23,872
He tied the grandmother up

586
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,152
But he shouldn't have it

587
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:31,552
Listen to this and see how in the middle of us

588
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:37,952
Because he interferes with the narrative

589
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:42,816
Beat up the grandmother maternal grandparents

590
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,728
Michael Hagan

591
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,264
Goes on from there

592
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,688
Run

593
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,712
AR

594
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,272
Theory that he is 100

595
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,536
Reading comprehension elac bigger picture

596
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,584
Text Gil

597
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,352
In terms of read

598
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,400
He has a f*****-up version of literacy

599
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,984
Just the actual words make out

600
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,056
There is no preparation

601
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:28,384
But he doesn't know the story at all before he starts reporting it

602
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,408
Because

603
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,968
You would have known that like

604
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,992
This paragraph

605
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:36,064
Send to the fact that this dude tied up a grandma

606
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,880
It's not great

607
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,672
God that was really f****** about

608
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:47,328
If my God he accidentally told right back at ya

609
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,616
I do like a good

610
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,896
Real-time pun

611
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
You know like

612
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,016
Nope not going to win that battle

613
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:09,344
It said it's pretty impressive like those editorial skills

614
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,416
Like not this is gasolinera

615
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,464
So we get back to a little bit

616
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,488
Sandy Hook talk here

617
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,560
Alex is pretty much like spinning his wheels

618
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,120
Trying to find ways to attack

619
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,936
The mainstream media story about

620
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,216
Without going to

621
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,240
Too far with it

622
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,544
And you find something that he thinks

623
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,312
Is

624
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,104
Like indicative of

625
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,384
A connection

626
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,432
Between so many of these school shooting

627
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,712
That lends it

628
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,480
Self

629
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,040
Maybe it's all

630
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
Event

631
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
Ant-Man

632
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,112
This is crazy

633
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,184
This is a type of

634
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,680
Harrison

635
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,848
So is argument here is relying

636
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:06,432
Conspiracy theory that Adam Lanza's mother work

637
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,224
Work for DARPA I remember that one

638
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,040
Now I have no idea about the Creed

639
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:16,416
To tell you

640
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,744
I want to give you that qualification and I we can take

641
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,048
Camaro allow you and the audience

642
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,328
To make their own conclusion

643
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:27,936
So like I said

644
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,264
Noxitril

645
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:37,152
Nancy was unemployed haven't been awarded a nothing alimony for her divorce to live without a job

646
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,944
I can find no sources

647
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,016
That I find credible arguing the Fancy works for DARPA

648
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,576
But I can't find one that I don't

649
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,880
Define credible

650
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:54,304
Conspiracy sites the claim Nancy move to New Town in order to work for DARPA

651
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,632
And without exception they all basements on One Source

652
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,984
But some of the post you'll find out message boards will just cut off the attribution and make

653
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
Acclaimed but it all Tracy

654
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,800
Is back to 1

655
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,568
Flights

656
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:10,432
This source is an alleged report distributed to the crib light by the FSB

657
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,456
Russia's intelligence

658
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,248
Sure

659
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,272
Vine of course

660
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:19,392
What would be the Russian intelligence

661
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,160
Okay

662
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,696
The earliest reporting and I can

663
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,256
Confined on this is dated December 15th 20

664
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,536
12 just act

665
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,608
There's no leaks

666
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,400
I can find it there's no substantiation

667
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,448
And for this outside of it just being asserted

668
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,472
On a website

669
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,520
Called what does it mean.

670
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,824
In order to gauge that's lights

671
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,432
Check out their front reporting

672
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,712
And here are some of their headline

673
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,736
Michael Hagan

674
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:52,928
Russia mobilizes 12,000 troops after a snake like alien craft communicating with mysterious Interstellar

675
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
Object attacks

676
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,976
Norway

677
00:38:55,232 --> 00:39:01,376
I remember when the right now right now

678
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:04,192
Top headlines

679
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,752
All right there's one from a little while back

680
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:13,152
US army takes over Pentagon after unus Navy smuggles Isis snipers into America 2

681
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:13,920
Kill Trump

682
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944
Okay

683
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,320
The type of ridiculous world I want to live

684
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,440
Cuz I'll tell you right now

685
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,512
If the Army and the Navy are currently in a

686
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,792
Death battle

687
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:36,192
Controls the Pentagon a high-profile football game

688
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,496
Why are you

689
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,032
Cuz you're the Navy

690
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:47,712
I'll tell you what we don't have time to talk

691
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,736
Talk about Sean Spicer

692
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,016
That's what I'm saying

693
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,808
That's what I want

694
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,648
This is full of b*******

695
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,464
Yes it is

696
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,864
If you look through the content is posted on that site it really feels like almost all of the stories are over

697
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,144
Berleypro Russia

698
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,192
And seemed to start by citing unseen

699
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,496
Report allegedly circulated

700
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,264
In the Kremlin

701
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,800
And this is suspicious

702
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:16,384
Now in the ensuing days after this

703
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,920
Report was published on September

704
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
1520

705
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,992
12 the information made its way onto message

706
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,808
Sports website

707
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,368
And sites with seemingly non insane name

708
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,648
But are insane

709
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
EU time

710
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
Dotnet

711
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,512
There's absolutely zero doubt that Alex either

712
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,536
Information he's repeating

713
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,072
From this site or someone

714
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,096
Reposting this sites

715
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,400
It's absolutely the route of the theory

716
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,192
From which all the branches grow

717
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,800
Is relying on real Russian until

718
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:49,920
Reports to make their site really remind me

719
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:56,576
It's possible but it also seems super unlikely to me

720
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:00,160
Is run by a real weirdo conspiracy theorist to relies on

721
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:00,928
Claiming

722
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,976
Ffsb reports

723
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:07,584
That you know no one can confirm or deny or anything like that in order to

724
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,400
Create the validity and The credibility

725
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,960
Of whatever bulshit you're putting out

726
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:16,544
Decided alleged to be run by a person named Sue

727
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,824
Faal

728
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,128
Whose actual name is Sister Maria Theresa

729
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,664
What is he

730
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:28,064
All is a title that's given to a person after they're elected to this

731
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,416
A position of leadership in a group known as the order of sorts of fall

732
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,952
This woman is the

733
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,512
Maria Teresa is the

734
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,048
The lion of sort of Falls

735
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,448
After her election in 2007

736
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:50,848
I don't know I couldn't I couldn't get that information

737
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:57,247
I think it's b*******

738
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,367
That is truth behind

739
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:08,511
Many folks on message boards believe this to be a cover and that's a real author of the site is a guy named

740
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,047
David Booth

741
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:19,519
Little people

742
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:25,919
It's a lot of bulshit

743
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:29,759
Is genius hell and this is not a good source of information

744
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:34,367
If you're relying on this you are in bad shape

745
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,391
Love it

746
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,951
Get bored

747
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,231
So you like to write fanfic

748
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:44,607
He's got all these secret intelligence reports from the Kremlin

749
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,631
So why not

750
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,655
I love it

751
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,703
See I don't think it's a Russian intelligence

752
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:55,103
I don't I don't think so

753
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:01,503
They would do a much better job with the site which looks like

754
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,271
Disaster

755
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:07,647
This is really important to me though

756
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,415
Is true

757
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,207
I'm legitimately the only place attic

758
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,743
Becoming from is this website

759
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:15,071
We can see it when we look at this April 2013

760
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,607
. Alex is the processor

761
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,655
So changing his mind and his coverage about

762
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:24,799
Information put out by the 73rd sorcha fall

763
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,335
This is nuts

764
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,639
No one is convincing him of this

765
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:31,711
No one is come on the show and told him this piece of information

766
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,503
Introducing it to the show

767
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
Himself

768
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
Incredible

769
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,087
That's really fun

770
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:37,855
Locked up

771
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,647
The only two possibilities

772
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:43,743
Here I think this covers all possible realities

773
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:48,095
Once he got the information directly or second-hand for the site himself

774
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,655
I thought it was cool 42

775
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:56,287
Someone told

776
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,567
Before repeating it on air

777
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,335
Yeah

778
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,615
Dispute is embarrassing

779
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,407
But this lack of any kind

780
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,455
Standard for disseminating

781
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,735
Information is also

782
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,503
Really

783
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,039
And we're seeing

784
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,831
Right here was like

785
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,879
This lack of editorial

786
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,183
Standard in any way

787
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,719
Just really

788
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,999
What he's he's

789
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:20,351
Because he wants to save the Globus want to take kids he's defending this

790
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,375
Completely

791
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,911
Insane domestic

792
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,935
Violent

793
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,239
Weirdo

794
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,263
Mailbox

795
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,799
Only because he wants

796
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,335
The cast was fishing about

797
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,359
Sandy Hook

798
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:36,479
And claimed that Adam Lanza's mom works there.

799
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,759
From a fake

800
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,319
The Russian intelligence report on a

801
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,367
Completely insane website

802
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,903
Write it almost

803
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:45,951
Having

804
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,231
A thing that you want

805
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,023
And then

806
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,559
Searching the internet

807
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,327
Scouring for

808
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,095
Any

809
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,375
Possible proof

810
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,447
2

811
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,239
Say wrong

812
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,263
Evil dumb

813
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,823
As I like to call it

814
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:02,591
Right wing

815
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,943
That's one of the reasons that I started out this show with a like

816
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,711
Openness

817
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,247
Do Alex being right about something

818
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:14,623
To prove him wrong

819
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,391
About

820
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,415
It just

821
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,071
F****** stupid

822
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,703
I think now it's just become habit

823
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,727
Two black guy

824
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,007
It's like it's Soca

825
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
Consistent

826
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,079
He's just wrong about all this s***

827
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,127
I'm setting out to debunk it right

828
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,151
Not

829
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,711
Just that situation

830
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,247
If you are

831
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,271
Doing any

832
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,575
And you have already decided

833
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,343
What the

834
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,623
Endgame

835
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,927
And you will ignore literally

836
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,951
Anything else

837
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
Along the way in order

838
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,535
You're you're just

839
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,559
The pointless

840
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:58,911
Like any study any study that paid for by the Koch brothers

841
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,519
Edinburg

842
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:07,103
Is all built around the idea that we saw this little weird bit of data

843
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,663
So recontextualizing so we can

844
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:12,991
That's all we want to do we don't want to find out any

845
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,271
Anything that we don't want

846
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,575
The small version of that is Alex

847
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,855
Having a story about a guy

848
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,135
Cuba

849
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:23,231
Has the kids of honorable

850
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:28,863
There's a few years so that mean

851
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,399
The entire f***

852
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,167
Can government

853
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,191
Science established

854
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,239
Is trying to lie to us in order to get

855
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,615
So Alex is really mad

856
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,407
About Obama

857
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,455
Meeting with the Sandy Hook families

858
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,503
Thinks that they're using them

859
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,831
Crops in order to

860
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,135
Achieve their gun-control agenda

861
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,159
Taking the gun

862
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,439
Richard now

863
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,463
Check my watch it

864
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
How we doing

865
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,535
Now

866
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:02,399
So here is Alex talking about how Obama uses

867
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,167
Jamaica's arguments

868
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:10,079
University poll government-funded poll

869
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,479
Registration for car

870
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
Cool

871
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:28,255
If you get a really interesting

872
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,535
Glimpse into how Alex

873
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,071
Twist things on multiple

874
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,351
Levels

875
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,375
Multiple

876
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,679
If you will

877
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:39,263
The first movie saying that the stats Obama cited are from a government

878
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,031
Pole

879
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:44,127
Even further impugns the numbers by saying that they're out of line with every other Pole

880
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,919
Contextualize

881
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:50,015
Actually just registration

882
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,039
Application

883
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,623
These are all things he's doing without providing any evidence or support

884
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,391
Nothing

885
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,671
He's just attacking

886
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,719
Statistic not doing any work he needs

887
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,999
To do in order to receive it

888
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,815
As for calling the polo government poll that's amazing

889
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,143
Attack the polls that Obama were using workout

890
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:12,799
Is just controlled by the government in full-scale war

891
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,823
Shared reality

892
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,615
Its measured by statistical analysis

893
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:25,599
Just found that support for all of Obama's planned initiatives to deal with gun violence was overwhelmingly pause

894
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:30,463
91% would vote for criminal background checks on all gun sales

895
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,767
82% would vote for increased government

896
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,815
Spending for mental health programs for the Youth

897
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:39,679
75% would vote for an increase criminal penalties for people who buy guns for people who couldn't

898
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,959
Casa background check

899
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,775
60% result for the reinstatement

900
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:49,663
These are specifically neutrally

901
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,199
By not connecting to plan

902
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,735
To Obama in there question

903
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:02,975
They probably drop it I don't know I haven't I didn't see any poll

904
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,071
But every time

905
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:10,911
Calling it Obamacare versus APA where there was differ

906
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,823
User to neutralize that effect is

907
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,591
Is vitae

908
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,615
Just saying hi to you

909
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:23,199
You support this position as opposed to do Sports Obama's position

910
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,271
And that's overwhelming score for all of it

911
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:32,927
That's very hard for Alex to deal with

912
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,207
Extreme outlier

913
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:38,815
Answer the question of whether or not this result is in line with other poultry

914
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,863
I don't know what he's talking about

915
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:45,471
Pulling huge support

916
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,031
A couple of things to discuss

917
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,311
Galloped

918
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:52,383
Historical trend

919
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,687
And one question I've asked him.

920
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,967
1990s quote

921
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,271
In general do you feel that laws cover

922
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:02,111
Bring the sale of firearms should be made more strict less strict or kept as they are now

923
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:06,975
In the entire history question 2%

924
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,767
Has never been more than 14

925
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,815
And is regularly less than

926
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:15,935
More strict has only been under 50% 7 times

927
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,983
The entire history of Poland

928
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,263
That's never been lower than

929
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,031
143 Percy

930
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,823
Their pulses

931
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,103
Support for background checks

932
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,407
Universally over a long span of

933
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,223
We live in a

934
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,551
So it seems like a very large majority of people

935
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,319
Support something

936
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:36,415
We live in a republic

937
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:42,815
Corrupt

938
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:45,119
I mean

939
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:45,887
I don't know

940
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:49,215
It was just a raw vote of the public

941
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,055
Easily compare those results

942
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:53,823
Pagalpan

943
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,639
Historically the other polls you see that it's not an outlier at all

944
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,455
Quinnipiac's June 27th

945
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:01,503
Study found 94% approval

946
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,527
For background check

947
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,831
Washington University's July 20th

948
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,367
84%

949
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:09,695
There's literally nothing I can find to support the idea that Alex's

950
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:14,815
Namely that there's credible polls showing lower support for background checks for gun purchases

951
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,375
Which is why you needs the last

952
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,959
The reframing of background checks just to be about regulation

953
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,239
Occasion

954
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,799
And honestly I can't do anything with that kind of paranoia

955
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:27,103
You guys run wild with that s*** if you want to

956
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:33,503
Like you shouldn't have to do a background check when I apply for a job that's just letting the government know where I work

957
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,271
Me fired

958
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:40,415
You shouldn't do a background check when I try to rent an apartment that's just a government where I live

959
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:45,791
In life there are times when submitting to a background check are pretty understandable and necessary

960
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:52,191
If your real problem is that you think it is it some kind of registration that you should be politically moving to help shape

961
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,471
That the background checks take

962
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,239
Replacing

963
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,543
You should be pushing for background checks that are not

964
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,311
Kept on file

965
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:01,919
You should be advocating for the background checks to be as anonymized as possible with no data retention

966
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,455
What you shouldn't do

967
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,735
If you're thinking person

968
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,551
Is pretended background checks of the same thing as confiscation

969
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,855
Because ultimately what you're doing then

970
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:13,183
Is actively supporting people who can't pass background checks getting guns

971
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,231
If that's what you're all about

972
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:15,999
Cool

973
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:19,583
But don't in favor of responsible gun owner

974
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,375
Worship then because you're not

975
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:28,287
You're lying you're literally in favor of irresponsible

976
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:34,431
Nihilist

977
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,479
But also

978
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,015
So why try and knock

979
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,319
Get shot that doesn't make any sense

980
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,623
Also I'm saying like

981
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:46,975
Like don't try to pretend you're in favor of law-abiding honest

982
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,999
Good people only

983
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:51,071
Guns you're a roading a system where there could

984
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:52,351
B Jackson Control

985
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,631
You can't

986
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:57,727
Possession there are less than 10% of the rest of the country

987
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,031
You have to lie

988
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,823
And pretend that you're in the majority in order

989
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,359
Enough of those

990
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,919
Idiots into following along with you

991
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,479
It's just

992
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:13,343
Like a good bit of Alec

993
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,367
It's kind of like a

994
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,695
About various

995
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,231
L audio

996
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,255
Games to believe the Joshua

997
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:21,535
Hero

998
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,559
Particularly

999
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,863
No lying about things

1000
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,167
Passing along the idea that

1001
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,471
He worked for DARPA based on

1002
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,263
Dumb blog

1003
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,311
So this clip

1004
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:55,583
Welfare people

1005
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,031
One of those

1006
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:04,799
Is more important

1007
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,079
Men should have more power than the

1008
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:13,759
Also I wandered for Kerry Cassidy conference is the name of her country

1009
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:22,207
Stop one always brings up is this idea that it's

1010
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,231
It's been proven that gun

1011
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,255
Reduce crime

1012
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,047
Which we have established

1013
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,095
Previously in multiple episodes

1014
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,703
Pacific

1015
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,727
A statistic that

1016
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,263
You always say

1017
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,823
He brings that up in this club and then I want to talk about it a little

1018
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:15,967
Stupid know what they're doing

1019
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:20,319
That's one of Alex's favorite talking points

1020
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:25,695
That's what I've heard him Scream by pretty consistently in anytime. Of the show that I've listened to

1021
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:29,023
That idea 9% drop in violent crime

1022
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:29,791
Cause

1023
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,095
People having more gun

1024
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,703
When it comes to Houston

1025
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:42,335
The part of this is true is the time span of 1993 to 2013

1026
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,127
Private gun ownership numbers wife

1027
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,687
I thought violent crime rate went down

1028
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,223
Both of these are correct

1029
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:58,207
There's no reason to believe that just because two things happened around the same time as each other or even at the same time as each other

1030
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,743
They're somehow related

1031
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,047
Correlation equals causation

1032
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:10,239
There's a whole website dedicated to really weird Cole related phenomena that

1033
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:14,847
Guy named Tyler vision

1034
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,639
And something's like

1035
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,455
There's a 99.26% correlation

1036
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,503
2009

1037
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,295
In the divorce rate in Maine

1038
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,343
And the per capita consumption of margarine

1039
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:29,439
That's a very strong correlation

1040
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,487
There's also a 95% correlation

1041
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:34,815
Super 1999 to 2010 marriage rate in Kentucky

1042
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,607
And the number of people who drowned after

1043
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,887
For falling out of the fishing boat

1044
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,911
Yeah no

1045
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,191
When you get married in

1046
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,495
Sooner or later you're going to drown

1047
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:48,895
Robert sooner or later wouldn't make it so immediate the time will match them animal

1048
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,431
Go on honeymoons

1049
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:54,271
You wrote a book about this called spurious correlation

1050
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,807
Which if nothing else is Dumont

1051
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,623
Two numbers run similar

1052
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,415
Or appearing we correlated

1053
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,207
You're passing it doesn't mean anything

1054
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:02,975
To do with each other

1055
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:06,047
People who study the gun

1056
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,839
Violence drop

1057
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,375
Gun

1058
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:12,447
Prime drop in gun ownership

1059
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,263
I'll be point to other variables that

1060
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:19,615
Explain the drop-in possible post 1993 which was

1061
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,663
What major factor is at

1062
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:24,479
The post-world War II Baby Boom generation had just passed

1063
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,503
The age brackets

1064
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,807
Marimo statistically likely to be high crime

1065
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,855
Right the Baby Boomers just stop killing

1066
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:35,231
Alorica practice partially attributable to block of population

1067
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:38,047
Aging out of the high crime

1068
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:42,911
. whatever is 16 to 40

1069
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:43,935
Like that

1070
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,959
Passport

1071
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:48,287
When you're older

1072
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,567
Less likely to

1073
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,359
Commit violent crime

1074
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:58,527
Just hired another element is at the

1075
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,295
Economy was in

1076
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:02,111
A natural byproduct of that is a dropping

1077
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:02,879
Cry

1078
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:07,231
Other folks have theories By the Drop is partially fueled by increased access to abortion

1079
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:11,583
People were able to control their families

1080
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:17,471
I also touched on that

1081
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,287
Exposure to lead

1082
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,823
Is another big factor that be

1083
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:22,591
People going to

1084
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,383
They are proven

1085
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,455
The people that put forth with x

1086
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:28,991
Study these numbers

1087
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,807
Other not-so-great factors

1088
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:35,135
Like the soaring rates of incarceration for non-violent offenders

1089
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:41,535
Like that's just a huge population of people who are now in a controlled environment

1090
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,375
You have another telephone

1091
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:50,495
No it's terrible you have a net less population

1092
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:54,591
So what else has failed to do in anyways take these other factors into account

1093
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,383
Preferring instead to just take this to

1094
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,431
Statistically crime drop 49%

1095
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:00,735
And appeared that gun ownership has risen

1096
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:03,295
Side of the guns with a reason that the rate

1097
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,855
This is how serious people approach stats

1098
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,927
If they have

1099
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,207
Looked at the issue

1100
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,023
Conclusion for Metallica

1101
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:13,791
To come up with

1102
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,327
Most notably in that 27

1103
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,375
19 Stanford study that showed that states

1104
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,655
The pass right to carry laws

1105
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:19,935
Experience 8:30

1106
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,215
18% increase

1107
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:21,983
Recent violent crime

1108
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,799
So I don't I just

1109
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,567
Addicting

1110
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,103
Essential piece

1111
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:27,871
Is this

1112
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,687
Is when you look at what Alex is doing

1113
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,503
He's taking the correlation in applying cause a

1114
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,807
And he does know work it anyway

1115
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,599
To establish that

1116
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,391
He doesn't have any study

1117
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,159
To show like

1118
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:42,975
So it is true that you know

1119
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:45,279
Morgan equals less crime

1120
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,071
People who looked at it

1121
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:47,839
Trump

1122
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:51,167
The relationship between

1123
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,447
Morgan

1124
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:54,239
And less crime

1125
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,799
They look at it from the standpoint of

1126
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,847
Rising crime

1127
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,639
Makes people buy more

1128
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:01,663
Right

1129
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,711
They look at it from almost like

1130
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:04,991
Their analysis

1131
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,527
6 shows almost

1132
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:07,807
The opposite with Alex

1133
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,111
Is the crime motivates people to buy gun

1134
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,647
As opposed to

1135
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,951
Gun buying leads people to do less crime

1136
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:14,719
Right

1137
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:15,487
So

1138
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,279
All I'm saying is Alex's

1139
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,559
Just being fast and loose

1140
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,583
Dodging around

1141
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:20,607
Being shipped

1142
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,655
It just it just flies in the face

1143
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,679
Of the one

1144
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,727
Truth that I don't

1145
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,031
I don't see ever changed

1146
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,055
Which is that

1147
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,335
The more

1148
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,103
Like

1149
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,127
If you make

1150
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,663
The means by which

1151
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,199
To do something more prevalent

1152
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,479
It makes it more like

1153
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,831
If you give people more guns

1154
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,111
More like

1155
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,391
That gun violence

1156
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,159
Is going to have

1157
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,695
That's that

1158
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,743
Forever

1159
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,535
That is human

1160
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,303
Reality

1161
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,839
And to argue

1162
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,375
Do the opposite of that goes against

1163
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,399
Something that's

1164
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,167
Dental in Bayside

1165
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,471
Inhumans and I will never trust any

1166
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,519
Okay it's just not

1167
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,847
Drawing your Line in the Sand

1168
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:07,711
So Alex Theory and that is that Obama

1169
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,479
Staple gun

1170
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,783
Yeah cuz Alex

1171
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,319
Arby's

1172
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,343
Send it

1173
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,111
The world

1174
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,159
They needs to disarm them

1175
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:16,927
Because they're winning

1176
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,207
Hi Galaxy

1177
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,487
Not yet

1178
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:25,887
That's why Obama needs

1179
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:47,391
New World Order

1180
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:48,927
So

1181
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,975
I mean

1182
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,511
Throughout time

1183
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,535
Just be like

1184
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,559
This is at

1185
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,327
Kind of

1186
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,351
Mentality

1187
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,911
Very consistent

1188
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,191
This time.

1189
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,823
Especially recited

1190
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
20

1191
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:07,871
The election season

1192
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,407
I think

1193
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,687
Consistently afterwards

1194
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:13,247
Like you've been very regularly like

1195
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,527
Like we are on the

1196
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,575
Best all the f****** time

1197
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:20,671
You're seeing massive ramp-up of that

1198
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,207
I like those of the Battle of the Bulge

1199
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,767
It's happening this is the full of salt

1200
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,351
That's the clip I want to

1201
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,143
Or anybody

1202
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:30,911
Who buys into

1203
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:37,567
No we should reach across the aisle at once we return to normalcy will be able to

1204
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,103
Listen to that clip

1205
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,687
No one's region

1206
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:45,503
That's the weakest link

1207
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,295
They're not

1208
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,063
Listening

1209
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,111
Listen to Obama.

1210
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:50,879
Vicky

1211
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:56,511
Belle yellow brick column of Liberator

1212
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,863
Maybe if you were kids

1213
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,679
Call Ray

1214
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,215
That's the reality of it

1215
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:06,495
Maybe

1216
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,775
Maybe it'll change

1217
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,199
Corn Pops

1218
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:15,967
Story was pretty good

1219
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:27,231
So Alex

1220
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,047
Singled out

1221
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,839
That's because I I know

1222
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,911
Probably pretty difficult and I don't know if I could actually even

1223
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,679
Convey this in

1224
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:38,239
Like even if I played you a hundred clips

1225
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:40,543
I'm not sure that I could fully expressed to you

1226
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,823
The ramping up as a

1227
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,591
Extremist

1228
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:45,151
It's going on in this April time

1229
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,199
Maybe even a little bit in

1230
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:47,967
To the end of March

1231
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:50,015
But it's very specifically happened

1232
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,319
Right here in the time frame that we're talk

1233
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,367
It is

1234
01:03:54,623 --> 01:04:00,511
Very easy to hear the clip like the last one we played we're like we're Rising we're the best

1235
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:03,839
Obama is not my president collaborator

1236
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:06,143
You could be like

1237
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:06,911
Stop Alex's

1238
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,703
Reliant

1239
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:09,727
But I have

1240
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:10,751
I have to stress

1241
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,031
If you listen to me

1242
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:12,799
These episodes

1243
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:14,847
In their entirety you do notice

1244
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:16,639
That this is getting much more extreme

1245
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,687
There isn't a application

1246
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:19,967
And Alex

1247
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:20,735
Even

1248
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,759
Explicit

1249
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,783
About the fact

1250
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,319
That he is getting bored

1251
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,391
In this neck

1252
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,695
Equip one of the things that I think is really important

1253
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:30,719
Is

1254
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:31,999
The Alex

1255
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:32,767
Hi

1256
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,863
That growing

1257
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,911
Extreme now

1258
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:41,215
I need to come up another word for it but

1259
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:45,311
That growing radical he has on his show

1260
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,335
With

1261
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,103
Sales

1262
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,407
Which is one of the contention that

1263
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,175
The people in the same

1264
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:54,783
Sandy Hook lawsuits are making is the profit off of this sort of cover

1265
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:56,831
If you listen to the

1266
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,623
Text Cliff you get some indication

1267
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:20,127
Because there's no

1268
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:23,199
He's also set another times like

1269
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,991
He is going more like

1270
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,271
He's getting more intense

1271
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:30,623
He's saying you got to pay me

1272
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,647
You got it

1273
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,695
Gotta Buy my shoes

1274
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,487
If you was my ability to go 100

1275
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:37,023
10% in this

1276
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,815
No Holds Barred

1277
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:41,375
I think there's

1278
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,911
It's interesting

1279
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,679
To me because

1280
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,959
The

1281
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,519
Presenting

1282
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,287
Episode

1283
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,823
It doesn't justify

1284
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:54,943
That's the one that's the one area that is light to legalize

1285
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,247
But if there were like

1286
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,783
VA doctors or

1287
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:02,111
Ministers who were harassed by Alex Jones

1288
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,391
Just fans

1289
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,671
I could see them soon

1290
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,695
Him for what he did

1291
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:07,231
At this. Just as easy

1292
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,535
Yeah I like it

1293
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,095
It's a broader Behavior that's going on

1294
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,887
And it just so happened that maybe

1295
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:14,655
Caught on

1296
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:17,215
Yeah it's people who wanted to harass in Target

1297
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:20,799
Don't

1298
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,079
Any way to get around

1299
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:24,127
The fact that he's

1300
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,663
That Ram pickup

1301
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,711
Controls of

1302
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,247
That's one thing that I

1303
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,015
Thought about what

1304
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:30,783
With the lawsuit

1305
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,831
Because when we're talkin

1306
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,855
Sing about Zach

1307
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:35,903
That's where we getting

1308
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:36,927
Correlation cause a

1309
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,743
I don't know how you can

1310
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,767
Can prove that

1311
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,303
Specifically the

1312
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,583
The Sandy Hook stuff

1313
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,375
Increased his

1314
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:49,983
Prophet right I agree

1315
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,263
Like obviously

1316
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,287
Talking about Sandy Hook

1317
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:53,823
2 sails

1318
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,847
In the same way that

1319
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,127
Talking about

1320
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,175
Joshua

1321
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,711
Athleta sale

1322
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:04,063
You know part of a concerted strategy

1323
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,367
They were one of the victim

1324
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,903
One of the targets

1325
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,439
Of this broader

1326
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:11,743
Right thing that's going on

1327
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:14,303
With his bucket we're at the Battle of the Bulge

1328
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,071
Roxanne

1329
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,119
Rapper in the middle of the Civil War

1330
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:20,959
Yeah I don't I don't know how you sort of differentiate

1331
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,751
Other than

1332
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,519
To take it as a

1333
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,287
Totality

1334
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,335
I I suppose that means

1335
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,383
But not only do

1336
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,407
Doctors in

1337
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,687
VA officials

1338
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:36,319
Morally imperative for them to join the class action

1339
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,367
Yeah

1340
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,159
From what I understand

1341
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,439
This is the only reason that

1342
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:46,047
Extends the statute of limitations is that Alex brought up

1343
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,071
These things

1344
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:49,119
Her people are able to

1345
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:49,887
Vesuvio

1346
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:50,911
Using

1347
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:57,055
Stuff from Beyond the statute of limitations to inform things that he said within the

1348
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,615
Positive that all of that applies

1349
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,383
To the

1350
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,407
Myriad group

1351
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:03,455
If that Alex's

1352
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:06,783
Working with you right

1353
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:13,439
That you could make an argument complains about the glitterbug mainstream globalist churches all the time

1354
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,303
And all the like there I don't know if specific

1355
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,327
VA doctors

1356
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,423
Legally literate people I think

1357
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,727
Be tough for us to know what concert

1358
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:26,751
Fat bike

1359
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,823
It's important

1360
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,127
You look at this and it's very clear

1361
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:34,431
They are on the level

1362
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,455
He is he is

1363
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,735
Trying to benefit

1364
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:37,503
From

1365
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,295
The behavior that led

1366
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,319
To the

1367
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,599
Treatment of Sandy Hook

1368
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:45,439
For this Behavior

1369
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,487
Profit-based

1370
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,255
So

1371
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:49,791
You know

1372
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,583
You can make an argument that

1373
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:57,983
Internal documents

1374
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:58,751
Yeah

1375
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:04,127
Despite the fact that it is a more Universal behavior that we're talkin about it is also still

1376
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:04,895
Specifically

1377
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,431
Focused

1378
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,199
And

1379
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:10,015
Alex plays video of Sandy Hook

1380
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,807
Victims talking about their

1381
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,599
And

1382
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,415
Because

1383
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,231
It's just family members

1384
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,767
Saying this is horrifying

1385
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,559
We don't

1386
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,863
But here's Alex's response after

1387
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:25,887
This video

1388
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:55,583
So first of all Peter Parker Spider-Man

1389
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:58,399
You talk about Robbie Parker

1390
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:00,447
Continuation of now it's okay for him to

1391
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:02,495
To make fun of this grieving father

1392
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:05,311
As opposed to call or calls

1393
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,079
Suggested

1394
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:08,127
Coach

1395
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:11,967
Is right that's the your toe into the water of the actor shed

1396
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:12,991
He's he's

1397
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:13,759
Teasing

1398
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,039
He's getting around that

1399
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,087
Logically

1400
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:17,855
To be coaching

1401
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,879
If they are coach

1402
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:23,999
You have a reason until

1403
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:27,071
An escalation

1404
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:27,839
This cruelty

1405
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:31,423
Making it okay

1406
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:34,751
To look at these people as not victims

1407
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:37,055
Make it look make it look at

1408
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,591
Okay for the audience

1409
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:41,151
Them as people Worthy

1410
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:43,455
People worthy of

1411
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,735
Making fun of

1412
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,015
There

1413
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:48,063
Implying that they're fake

1414
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:48,831
Emoji

1415
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,623
Like that is

1416
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,927
Exactly what we're talkin to

1417
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,719
That's exactly the behavior

1418
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:59,071
That's the early stages of the we've been looking for

1419
01:10:59,327 --> 01:10:59,839
Entire time

1420
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,887
Absolutely it's happening right in front of our eyes

1421
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:04,191
I know he seems like the things

1422
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,983
Seem to be leading to it are

1423
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,031
Obama talk to them

1424
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,823
Steve pieczenik is coming around

1425
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,359
He read

1426
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:14,943
A dumb blog they claimed it had a Russian intelligence report

1427
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,735
By sorcha faal

1428
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,039
It's very sad

1429
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:21,855
It's a really shity soup

1430
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,623
Super villain

1431
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,415
It's really hard

1432
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,719
But one thing you would expect for

1433
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,535
Right I mean

1434
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,071
He studies all the time

1435
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,095
Vino's the globalist

1436
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,119
Playing backwards

1437
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:33,887
Forward

1438
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:34,655
Upside down

1439
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:35,423
All of it

1440
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:38,239
Do you expect that you would know exactly what he's talking

1441
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:40,031
He'd remember all of his talking

1442
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,567
Remember his narrative

1443
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:43,103
He knows the books he's read

1444
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:44,383
But

1445
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,151
Unfortunately

1446
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:04,607
Hundreds of shots they want to give kids

1447
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:11,519
This is a good demonstration of how little Alex cares about his own bulshit

1448
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:14,591
He's claiming the John P Holdren's book ecoscience

1449
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:16,895
Discusses diet injections and injunctions

1450
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:17,919
Control the public

1451
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:22,783
And I really honestly think this is a result of him never reading the things here Aunt by reading all the time

1452
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:26,111
He's talking about isn't a reference to Eco science

1453
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,135
The textbook

1454
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,415
Jean-p holdren Road

1455
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:33,535
That's a line that I was always misuses from Bertrand Russell in his book the impact

1456
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,303
Society

1457
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,351
We talked about there's a bunch of times like

1458
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,655
Alex is just taking that line entirely out of town to

1459
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:43,775
Russell was talking about the really bad stuff that could come up if for instance

1460
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:47,103
The Nazis have been more scientifically Advanced as a dictatorship

1461
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,639
He's not advocating for the

1462
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,711
But because he's discussing them Alex's decided

1463
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:53,247
Gridley actually saying

1464
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,319
F****** stupid

1465
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,135
I guess what I didn't have to look any of this up to

1466
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:05,535
Remember I heard him talk about it

1467
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:08,607
Do you miss match references body

1468
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:16,031
Even care about getting things right

1469
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,311
Doesn't care either

1470
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:20,895
Bucket

1471
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:22,687
Yeah

1472
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:24,223
If you have like this

1473
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:24,991
Really

1474
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,271
You like

1475
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:28,063
Revolutionary

1476
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,599
World-shaking

1477
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:32,159
Information that you've uncovered

1478
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,183
But a plant

1479
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:33,951
Depopulate

1480
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,487
Planet and kill off everybody

1481
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,303
Seems like you know what you're talkin about.

1482
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,327
Keep your ducks in a row

1483
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,351
I need.

1484
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:43,423
Communication

1485
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,775
Easier to get away with

1486
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,079
His listeners

1487
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:50,847
General

1488
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:51,871
Looking for like

1489
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,175
Emotional

1490
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,991
They have no interest in the intellect

1491
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,295
They just want to understand

1492
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:01,087
And have their anger in

1493
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:02,111
Fear and paranoia

1494
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:02,879
Mirror

1495
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,463
As opposed to being like

1496
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,255
I need to think about what this guy

1497
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:11,583
No I just need to get the general Vibe of how he's

1498
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,119
That's what I really

1499
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,399
I don't need

1500
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:20,799
I'm not going to I'm not going to do homework for Infowars

1501
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:25,407
Yeah it is

1502
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:32,831
Interview with

1503
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,903
How about the evils of exit

1504
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:38,207
He's not the one know the faces

1505
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:38,975
Sisters the one who look

1506
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,351
Yeah right

1507
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:50,751
Is another guy album recording

1508
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:56,895
Elbow

1509
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:09,183
Forgot I'm really glad Anthrax came up

1510
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,975
Thursday

1511
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:13,279
Tickets still available

1512
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:15,327
Probably

1513
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:19,679
Is not a good interview it's pointless I don't want to I don't want to

1514
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,703
Listen to any of it

1515
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,983
It's just the standard.

1516
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:24,031
But also they're not

1517
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:24,799
Extreme masala

1518
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,591
About the vaccination evils of the

1519
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,359
Depopulation

1520
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:33,759
Silence

1521
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:38,879
I don't know especially from candy or what

1522
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,927
Also I don't want to bring this up

1523
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:41,951
Because

1524
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,487
I looked into them a little bit

1525
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:44,255
And

1526
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,535
They might

1527
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:51,423
Might be a really bad dude you don't want to get into it

1528
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:55,263
Look that up yourself and feel like

1529
01:15:55,519 --> 01:16:01,663
Specifically shooting to be having on his show

1530
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:06,271
Maybe other things

1531
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:10,623
So out starts ranting about school shooting

1532
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:15,743
Again this goes back to what I was talking about about

1533
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,511
Tying

1534
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:17,535
Height

1535
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,815
Extremism with the

1536
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:19,583
Desales

1537
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:21,119
There is a very

1538
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,399
Queer things happen

1539
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,679
And it wasn't happening

1540
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:27,007
Before but this is kind of new to this April 9th episode

1541
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,287
Easter

1542
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:29,823
Trying to take

1543
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:30,847
The

1544
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,383
Heightened elevated

1545
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:34,431
Nature of what he's doing

1546
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,479
Push it toward

1547
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,503
Marketing Opera

1548
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:49,535
Countries

1549
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:56,703
Well guess what we're onto you this is boomerang

1550
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:04,639
Health Challenge

1551
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:08,735
World Order

1552
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,167
Saying

1553
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:30,495
Third Kind of juxtaposition

1554
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,543
Of what he's doing

1555
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:35,615
Yeah normally like

1556
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:47,647
Also I'm trying to get everybody healthy

1557
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:54,047
Buy our product

1558
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:58,143
I will do anything for people to buy more

1559
01:17:59,423 --> 01:17:59,935
Please

1560
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:05,311
Clearpath

1561
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,127
These ideas

1562
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,919
Also you can see that it's at

1563
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:15,551
No but they're coming coming into the modern form

1564
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,575
Census of

1565
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:23,743
What would you call a modern Alex pivot covid-19

1566
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,351
Now we have these

1567
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,119
Teacher salary

1568
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:31,679
50%

1569
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:38,079
I forgot

1570
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,615
Pretend like

1571
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:45,759
My adverb

1572
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:48,063
Okay I understand

1573
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,087
That is

1574
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:50,367
Wisely

1575
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:51,647
For you to do

1576
01:18:53,951 --> 01:19:00,095
Didn't quite work on April 9th Alex has Mike

1577
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,119
Come in

1578
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,655
Health Ranger

1579
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,935
Again

1580
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:05,471
Health Ranger

1581
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:09,823
Yeah

1582
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:14,175
Normal transfer the health Ranger detriment on

1583
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:16,735
I don't think it's really that

1584
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:17,503
Pinterest

1585
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,783
Conversation

1586
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,319
The number of points

1587
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,855
Which

1588
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:24,159
Clip

1589
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,207
I think it exposes

1590
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,743
So much about Alex Jones

1591
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,871
That's so revealing

1592
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:48,735
Oh yeah

1593
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:50,783
Is a completely unrelated field

1594
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:51,807
Sabine on medicine

1595
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:54,879
Then by God I'm going to be well-versed in don't know why

1596
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:56,159
Got coming in as an expert

1597
01:19:56,927 --> 01:20:01,023
Amazing arrange Alex's guest tab so long as the subjects are all weird and

1598
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,047
Completely speculative

1599
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:02,815
Yeah

1600
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:05,375
Eddie Izzard

1601
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,191
Disagree with too much

1602
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:12,031
Coin may be a good thing and they support

1603
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,311
Decentralized currency

1604
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,336
But they're skeptic

1605
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:18,688
In the clip where you can hear Alex speculating that the central bank

1606
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:20,992
Some Federal Reserve there in the pups

1607
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,528
Pump-and-dump with Bitcoin

1608
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,832
How's life is fun with it

1609
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,392
But I think it's important

1610
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,672
His reason for his

1611
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:30,976
Expiry I think like the enemy

1612
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:33,024
If I was the enemy I do

1613
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:37,888
That's so fucken reveal

1614
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:42,496
The sport is conjecture that the FED is artificially inflating Bitcoin to bring up Adventure crash

1615
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:44,032
But he feels like that's the

1616
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:46,848
It's because he's decided what the enemy is how they think

1617
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,128
How they operate

1618
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,408
I need the sided

1619
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,432
But that's what he would do

1620
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,456
He was them

1621
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:54,528
When you take into account that is enemies are imaginary

1622
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,856
And all his primary sources don't say what he thinks they do

1623
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,648
You really have to consider

1624
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:03,744
Comes up with his ideas about the globalist

1625
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,024
Shear imagination

1626
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,560
He's imagined a villain

1627
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:08,864
And you just as what would I do if I were them

1628
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:13,984
I really felt like this was what he was doing for a long time but I've never heard him so clearly

1629
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,544
Express that mentality as in that life clip

1630
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,104
Like the global don't want to depopulate the planet

1631
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:25,504
The Alex would if he were there

1632
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,296
But Alex would if he were them

1633
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,832
All the shoes Alex

1634
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:29,600
Projecting

1635
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,136
Everything is in his head

1636
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,672
Dance is all nonsense

1637
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:33,696
Welyn

1638
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,976
But that's

1639
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:37,536
Few times in the past.

1640
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:39,072
How revealing it is

1641
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,352
Say what the enemy

1642
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,376
Doing

1643
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:43,168
Because like

1644
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:44,192
Like how many times

1645
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,728
Do right-wing people are

1646
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,008
Are there like

1647
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:48,544
The Democrats are

1648
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,872
Stealing boats in there right

1649
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:52,640
Steel Alexa

1650
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,968
None of that actually

1651
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:59,552
But every voter suppression

1652
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:00,832
An effort every attempt

1653
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,600
Original

1654
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,136
Crisco box

1655
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:03,904
Continue tags

1656
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,440
Like all of that

1657
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:06,720
You see

1658
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:08,000
Oh well

1659
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,792
Describe

1660
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,328
To us in order to just

1661
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:13,120
Defy why they do with it

1662
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,400
Because I just

1663
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:17,984
Honored tradition

1664
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:22,336
Two boys I like hitting yourself

1665
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,152
It's pathetic

1666
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,480
Probably

1667
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:32,832
So we get to the there's not much going on here cuz I'll be honest with you

1668
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:33,856
About

1669
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:36,160
2 hours

1670
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:36,928
Of this show

1671
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,464
Is David Knight

1672
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,256
Jakari Jackson

1673
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,024
Coming in

1674
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,096
Like to co-host with Alec

1675
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:47,680
Because they do a gun control rally

1676
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,448
Okay

1677
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,544
You're going to try and take my gun

1678
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:53,568
Type sign

1679
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,616
Councilman Mike Martinez

1680
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,152
Of Austin

1681
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,688
Got on the mic

1682
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,552
Attention

1683
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:05,856
There is no gun,

1684
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:06,880
Station going on

1685
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:14,048
I keep that side cuz you're going to need it later

1686
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:20,448
That's a good move

1687
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:26,336
I guess right

1688
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:28,128
He's showing his cards

1689
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:34,016
Is aiming for eventual

1690
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,136
Is about

1691
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,160
Took a little bit

1692
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:41,184
Unearned

1693
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:45,024
They try and create a victim out of this guy who's older

1694
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,584
Messiaen the train say that he wasn't trying

1695
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,608
To get attention

1696
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:50,656
Victim of

1697
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:51,936
For poking him

1698
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:55,520
I don't know it's a long time to talk about

1699
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:56,544
It's Mike martini

1700
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:57,824
In a weird way that I

1701
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,848
I've never heard his f******

1702
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,896
Before I have no idea

1703
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:05,248
This guy is now just like he's one of the one of the leaders of this movement

1704
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:11,136
Attention by the media given to any the local news story

1705
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:17,792
Actually I've known forever 100

1706
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,192
F***

1707
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:25,728
It's just

1708
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:26,752
Laborious

1709
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:29,312
Getting through it would be no good

1710
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,872
David Knight is boring

1711
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:32,640
2019

1712
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:33,920
What do you think he's doing

1713
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:47,488
Jakari Jackson

1714
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:50,048
He's on board with Infowars s*** like

1715
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:50,816
Q

1716
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:54,912
Is amazing

1717
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,704
Jakaria's voice

1718
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,520
Radio voice

1719
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:04,384
Fantastic also fairly boring

1720
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:06,176
Still a kind of young

1721
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:09,760
So he can handle the Nightly News

1722
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:14,368
And s*** but being on Alex's show itself or this clearly way more listeners

1723
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,392
Right

1724
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,976
You seem to be a little bit like

1725
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:20,768
This is the big leagues right

1726
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:22,560
And that's very weird

1727
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,424
Enjoy Alex

1728
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,216
That much

1729
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:31,264
Kind of

1730
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:34,336
Like they don't seem to cut into his bulshit which is

1731
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,872
How this episode is going to end

1732
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:37,408
But it doesn't make

1733
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,688
We're like really into

1734
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,456
Justin Conte

1735
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:43,040
It was

1736
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,320
F****** top

1737
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,624
So much David night talk

1738
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:47,904
Can't believe

1739
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,024
Like 25

1740
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,304
Still see him being

1741
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:57,376
Monotone

1742
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:02,752
Understand everybody

1743
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:09,664
Call because there's a strategy

1744
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,504
It's trying to penetrate other markets that Alex doesn't really have access

1745
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,320
You're exempt

1746
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,344
To get old pee

1747
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,368
Your attempt

1748
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:22,464
To get people who don't like how Alex gals all the time okay

1749
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:26,304
You filter your content through David night in a boring prom

1750
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,584
Loud

1751
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:33,984
Somebody's somebody's like I want I want to racist as the presentation

1752
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,520
Milquetoast

1753
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,128
Destroyer in the mix

1754
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:40,896
Because you needs

1755
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:41,920
Somebody was kind of

1756
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:46,272
Theoretically interesting to the youth younger set

1757
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,832
That's

1758
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,952
Alex

1759
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,256
And Alex

1760
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:59,328
As we start up here with

1761
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,864
I just want to give you a little bit of a

1762
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,632
Atone

1763
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:02,656
Alex

1764
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:08,800
Chester

1765
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:13,664
If you want

1766
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:42,848
Okay

1767
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,432
Threatening

1768
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,552
Glenn Beck

1769
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:24,832
But love it

1770
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,624
But the waves

1771
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:29,184
You got to listen to every every word okay

1772
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,720
It

1773
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:31,744
So

1774
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,024
Stupid

1775
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:35,072
Call Des Moines

1776
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:41,984
And

1777
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:46,336
He's talking about

1778
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:08,096
Infowars.com

1779
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,984
Newport.com

1780
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:25,248
So all the time but Alex

1781
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:31,136
Who's crazy

1782
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:37,536
Play no reason to assume that

1783
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:42,400
Gwen didn't say this every 100 press

1784
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:44,192
Glenn Beck

1785
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:47,008
Is plagiarizing my material and he's not

1786
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:49,824
Absolutely not 100%

1787
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,128
I don't know

1788
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:57,248
Cuz I haven't listened to the show actually said that Source but I guarantee you 100%

1789
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:59,808
Riverview

1790
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:04,416
Also he Alex like his whole business model on infowars.com is like

1791
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:09,792
Using other people's articles he does like where the article came from

1792
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:11,584
He doesn't have permission

1793
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:15,424
Post in hole these articles that came out

1794
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:17,216
Not too long ago

1795
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:18,496
Tubac he was

1796
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:21,824
I'm trouble for it but it was like

1797
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:24,640
Entirely

1798
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:25,664
Instantly does that

1799
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,200
From various

1800
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:27,968
NewsHour

1801
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:28,992
Without

1802
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:32,320
But I don't know I don't care I feel like

1803
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:33,856
If Glenn Beck said

1804
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:36,160
Who cares

1805
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:36,928
If he's

1806
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:37,696
Also

1807
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:39,232
Covering the story

1808
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:42,048
As reported by another outlet and Alex

1809
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:42,816
Just thinks it's

1810
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:44,096
I'm covering Infowars

1811
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:44,864
I don't care

1812
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,168
If he's ripping off before

1813
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,960
Also don't care right

1814
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:52,032
I'm struggling to find an angle with

1815
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:56,384
The only angle is Alex being like he ripped me off I know this

1816
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,152
Maybe

1817
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:57,920
Reset it and I didn't

1818
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:02,784
Is the overconfidence the admission of

1819
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:04,576
I don't know

1820
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:08,672
Guitar ER in studio for like

1821
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:09,440
Most of the time

1822
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:10,976
Boring

1823
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:13,792
The only things that I really think are in

1824
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:15,584
You staying are this clip

1825
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,608
Where Alex

1826
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:17,632
David Knight

1827
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:18,400
What he think

1828
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:19,424
About Sandy

1829
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,192
Okay

1830
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,008
Aurora

1831
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,824
False flag

1832
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:29,152
Suspicious

1833
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:35,552
Exactly

1834
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:37,600
Okay

1835
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:38,368
What

1836
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:39,392
What is this

1837
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:41,440
All right what is this Alex

1838
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,280
What is he saying

1839
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:46,048
Which actor

1840
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,216
It's one week before the UN votes

1841
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:54,240
So you want an

1842
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:55,520
Bright

1843
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:57,312
You know you got to have somebody that Appeals

1844
01:31:57,568 --> 01:32:03,712
Benicio del Toro

1845
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:07,552
Usual Suspects

1846
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:10,112
I would

1847
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:11,392
Say this isn't

1848
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:12,416
Good

1849
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:16,512
This is an indication of a bad mindset

1850
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:18,816
I would agree

1851
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:21,120
David Knight says it was a false flag

1852
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:24,448
Event unprompted Alex's they should have got better actor

1853
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,472
Now

1854
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:26,752
It is my

1855
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:27,776
Gallatin life

1856
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:28,800
In my

1857
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:30,336
Steak in this whole thing

1858
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:32,128
Overleaf air-to-air

1859
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:36,224
Because it is unfair to everybody

1860
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:39,040
When I hear this

1861
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,344
There's two problems

1862
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:44,160
1

1863
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,440
In fairness

1864
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:48,000
Is that the better actors

1865
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:50,816
They should have chosen victim

1866
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:52,608
Family members who had better Act

1867
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,192
Skills in order for them to convey the gun-control message

1868
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:59,008
That could be what he's trying

1869
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,288
To stay

1870
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,056
Give him

1871
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:02,336
If

1872
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:03,872
In this time.

1873
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:05,664
Clarified immediately I would even

1874
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,688
When are on the side of life

1875
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:09,248
Fine still not good

1876
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,016
Not good

1877
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:12,320
They should have got

1878
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:13,856
Better actors

1879
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:17,696
That one

1880
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,464
Balanced

1881
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:20,768
Hard because again you could

1882
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:23,328
You could fall back behind like I've never heard Alex

1883
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,632
A defend his position by saying like

1884
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:29,472
Father probably victims family members who were better actors

1885
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:31,008
That's what I was trying to say

1886
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:33,568
I've never heard him use that defense

1887
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,152
Ruby Tuesday

1888
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:42,528
An interpretation that could be made of

1889
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,296
But

1890
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:46,368
No one was the interpretation

1891
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,720
Know if you're listening

1892
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:52,768
You hear him say it's a false flag

1893
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:53,792
Entirely

1894
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:57,376
There were actors are all after actors means they were all

1895
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:59,680
Whether or not

1896
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,240
Yeah I think it's far less mature

1897
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:03,264
Absolutely

1898
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:04,288
Absolutely

1899
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:06,848
To nail down

1900
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:08,384
Thoroughly

1901
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,688
No

1902
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,712
Also

1903
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,272
Court of law isn't

1904
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:16,064
Nesterly best place to

1905
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,088
Try and parse

1906
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,112
The experience

1907
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:18,880
Listening

1908
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,976
Listen to all of this I can

1909
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:24,512
I can tell you the experience of it

1910
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:25,792
Jointed

1911
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:26,560
It's

1912
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:27,584
Confusing

1913
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:29,632
Trying to figure out what point

1914
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:30,656
He's exactly trying

1915
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:33,984
If you were someone who bought

1916
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:36,544
Hearing that would be very

1917
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,824
Clear what he is

1918
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:38,848
Trying to say

1919
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:43,200
Where is other times there's there's so much like ambiguity

1920
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:43,968
Fourth

1921
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:46,272
Of whatever

1922
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:48,320
Map of

1923
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,088
The Carlton

1924
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:50,112
He's directing towards

1925
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,648
These people it's your fault you took

1926
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,672
It's the school

1927
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:54,464
Mocking Robbie Parker

1928
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,744
And his friends

1929
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,512
Conference

1930
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,816
You can just see the trend going there

1931
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,096
Directions to die

1932
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:01,120
Fuel

1933
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:02,656
Give the benefit of the doubt

1934
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,680
Easy

1935
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:04,448
Expressing their

1936
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:07,776
I'm at the court of law is the worst Park

1937
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,544
You can't be like

1938
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,824
Your honor I submit

1939
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:10,592
6

1940
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:11,360
27 Hunter

1941
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,384
Turn hours of Alex

1942
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:14,432
Content from multiple arrows

1943
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:15,200
So you can have a

1944
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:15,968
Full Count

1945
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:16,736
Text on what if

1946
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:18,016
Exactly this means

1947
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:20,064
As opposed to what it is that you

1948
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,856
Think it means an illegal

1949
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:22,624
Definition

1950
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,160
There is two

1951
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:26,208
Contact around

1952
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:27,232
.

1953
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:28,256
Where is b*******

1954
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:29,536
And he be like

1955
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:33,376
Write it down

1956
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:34,400
So Alex

1957
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:35,424
I think

1958
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,448
More fun having

1959
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:37,216
Dakari

1960
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:38,752
Studio then

1961
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,032
Either of them are happy

1962
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:43,360
Is the most

1963
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,640
Clip

1964
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:48,480
Where Alex says they're actors which is substantiv Lee important

1965
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:49,248
And then

1966
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:51,040
Spiritually important

1967
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,320
I think Alex is employed

1968
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:56,160
Do not like her much

1969
01:35:56,416 --> 01:36:02,560
More fun than anyone that has to interact with Alex

1970
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:07,680
Cesium save experiencing life in a way that no one around him in

1971
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:12,288
Kind of indicative of that vibe

1972
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:26,112
Shawn and Aaron Paul and Alex guest Pelletier

1973
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,256
A day-long woman

1974
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,680
Stop it

1975
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:59,136
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison

1976
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:01,696
What the f*** is going on

1977
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:05,536
Potato salad

1978
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:10,656
And he doesn't f****** Star Wars impressions

1979
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:13,216
Fat is the most

1980
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:15,008
That is the most like

1981
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:23,712
Interesting

1982
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:28,576
Yeah it's been in

1983
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:37,792
Completely unfounded and I think the two of them guitari both have

1984
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:41,376
3 * 2 wanting to

1985
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,400
To do better

1986
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:47,520
Feel like they want to actually

1987
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:48,544
Do something

1988
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,176
It does feel like they

1989
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:56,992
They're trying to build up almost like a real

1990
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:57,760
Can go to

1991
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:00,576
I don't know if

1992
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:01,856
Or just like trying

1993
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:05,952
Have have actual like waves

1994
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:08,000
We are actually reporting something

1995
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:10,560
Even with the if it's within the context

1996
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:11,584
Infowars

1997
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:15,680
Narrative propaganda right still like we're respectable

1998
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:17,984
Alex knows where the money is

1999
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,520
Nathan is Goofy

2000
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:26,944
Well that's what I'm saying if you're working it into info

2001
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,504
And your aspiring to do real Journal

2002
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:31,040
You are not working

2003
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:31,808
You're not looking

2004
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:32,832
To retire in

2005
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,112
You know what I mean

2006
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,136
Do you think you can

2007
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:40,256
God bless everybody who thinks

2008
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:44,096
Good for you I wish I had your level

2009
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:47,168
I really do

2010
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:49,472
Gorgeously you might heard from Alex

2011
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:53,568
Play come back from break

2012
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:54,848
And the vibe

2013
01:38:56,896 --> 01:39:02,016
Darth Vader

2014
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:06,368
So surprised

2015
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:14,048
Is the Diplomatic ship

2016
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:20,448
Actually really not bad

2017
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:26,592
That's really not bad

2018
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,872
Haha

2019
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:31,456
Blood pressure

2020
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:34,016
It's not bad

2021
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:38,368
300 times out really not that I've heard Alex do Impressions 300 time

2022
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,392
Service

2023
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:41,440
Yeah that was that was

2024
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,720
Twice as good as burn

2025
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:46,304
I would say at least twice as good as we're on a f******

2026
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:52,704
Show that are actors

2027
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:56,288
He's these laying out this b******* about the Josh

2028
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:59,104
Nonsense like

2029
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,968
This is Don sentmanat it like this

2030
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,760
Existing in the same spaces

2031
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:08,320
Is it surreal

2032
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:12,416
You guys have some bro downtime are you doing impressions and goofing around like

2033
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:22,144
And

2034
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:28,544
Now we're going to do a great bit from The Wedding Crashers

2035
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:33,152
I already I received

2036
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,968
We have one last clip

2037
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,272
And it's Alex

2038
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,040
Quoting

2039
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:40,320
But not Thomas Jefferson

2040
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,088
Okay

2041
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,880
So I wanted to

2042
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,416
And it's also pretty extreme

2043
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:46,720
The Wayans the April 10th episode

2044
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:27,936
So I can you shouldn't you should know what year it is

2045
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:30,496
You at half

2046
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:31,264
You would think

2047
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:35,104
Because you're a civil war illusionary war historian

2048
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,384
It is kind of big

2049
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:38,176
Literally

2050
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:39,456
102 bus

2051
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:44,064
From the Revolutionary War here

2052
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:46,880
We know his batting average with Jefferson quotes

2053
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:48,672
Parable

2054
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:49,696
From the early days of

2055
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:53,792
How did you fare with those

2056
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:54,816
Over

2057
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:59,424
Waldo's are Jefferson

2058
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:01,728
Yes I believe he did not

2059
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:05,312
68th and Landing

2060
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:11,968
Ground don't fire unless fired upon

2061
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:14,784
It's attributed to Minutemen Commander John

2062
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:15,552
John Parker

2063
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:17,600
These words spoken on April 9th

2064
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:20,928
Since 1775

2065
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:24,768
So there's a reason to believe it

2066
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:26,560
It's a real quotes

2067
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:28,864
Probably the Quotev

2068
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:32,192
There's no actual solid historical basis for

2069
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:37,568
No reliable source who was there put it down into writing until a lot later

2070
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:41,408
The quote was spread initially by Parker's grandson

2071
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,688
Who was not present at the

2072
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:44,992
The time of being said

2073
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:46,528
Yeah probably

2074
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:54,720
Trying to mythologize is family

2075
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:55,488
These heroic

2076
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:57,280
Figures within the revolution

2077
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,048
The jump park

2078
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:01,376
Survive

2079
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:02,144
Terrier something

2080
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,936
Everybody

2081
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:04,704
War dies of

2082
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:07,264
In the middle of the Revolutionary War

2083
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,288
He died of some

2084
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:11,872
So they wouldn't even know

2085
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:18,528
His grandfather.

2086
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:21,088
Right

2087
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:26,976
He wasn't from what I understand he was alive but not present

2088
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:28,000
17

2089
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:42,080
Theodore claims that Sergeant William Monroe

2090
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:43,360
Back when he was a kid

2091
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:45,152
August grandfather's great quote

2092
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:47,712
But weirdly

2093
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:51,808
Some forty years later Theodore is remembered it and if he comes

2094
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:53,088
The part of American lore

2095
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:58,720
Temporary accounts of John Parker's actions that day from people who were there

2096
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:02,048
Don't really square with this quote presumably would have

2097
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:02,816
Heard that

2098
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:04,352
Dope quotes

2099
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,376
Better write that s***

2100
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:06,144
Shut down for pasta

2101
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:09,984
Ebenezer monroes

2102
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:16,128
Captain Parker ordered his men to stand their ground and not molest the regulars unless they were unless they meddled with us

2103
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,408
He was later visited

2104
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,432
Pre Civil War

2105
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,200
Hahaha

2106
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:21,760
Almost

2107
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:23,808
Is Paul Revere's account of that day

2108
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,600
You can see similarities

2109
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:26,368
Difference

2110
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:28,928
The similarities of the sentiment like

2111
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:31,744
Don't f*** with those people and less than self-defense

2112
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:33,280
But the difference is

2113
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:38,656
Cluedupp are cats saying if they want war

2114
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:40,448
The bravado is gone

2115
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:44,544
Veneers

2116
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,568
Last nerve

2117
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:49,152
Those differences of the only thing that Alex is interested in about

2118
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:52,480
Office quote

2119
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:53,504
To glorify his grandpa

2120
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:56,064
Looks like once again

2121
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,856
Firmly on the side of law Rover

2122
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:58,624
History

2123
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:01,184
Really believe

2124
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:05,024
Anything about the country unless it matches up with whatever

2125
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:07,072
Feeling whatever he wants

2126
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,472
You might have recognized that the ends are used

2127
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:16,800
Yes the war has already begun

2128
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:19,616
Alex is close enough on that pic for me to give it

2129
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:22,176
The quote is actually

2130
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:23,712
The war is actually

2131
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:30,368
It is probably a very accurate assessment of March 23rd

2132
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:31,648
Scene 75 speed

2133
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:33,440
Did the second Virginia convention

2134
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:35,232
Honestly

2135
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:37,792
To be a great thing for Alex to actually quote

2136
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:39,584
It really closely matches

2137
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,608
Vybes

2138
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:43,936
Throwing out lately but I think there's a problem with him actually

2139
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:44,960
Quoting the speech

2140
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:46,240
Paraphrasing it

2141
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:49,312
And that is a Patrick Henry's legitimately calling for war

2142
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:51,360
Not an Infowars

2143
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:53,664
In fact

2144
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:56,992
Patrick Henry speech

2145
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:59,296
To oppose them

2146
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,832
Shall we try argument

2147
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:03,392
Sir we've been trying that for the last 10 years

2148
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:06,464
Have we anything new to offer upon the subject nothing

2149
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:11,328
We have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable but it is all been in vain

2150
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:14,144
Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplications

2151
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:16,960
What term she'll be fine which we have not already

2152
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:17,984
Exhausted

2153
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:21,568
Let us not I beseech you sir to Steve ourselves any longer

2154
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:27,712
Paraphrasing

2155
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:29,760
Alex believe that Warhead

2156
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:31,552
I truly already started

2157
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:32,832
Patrick Henry would think

2158
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:33,856
Coward

2159
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:36,928
And helping the enemy with his infowar.

2160
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:41,280
Engaged

2161
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:42,560
It's crazy

2162
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:47,424
Accurately

2163
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:52,288
Woodlake

2164
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:55,104
The Civil War has already started

2165
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,640
Patrick Henry would hate you

2166
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:59,712
Yeah he would think that you're a Redcoat absolutely

2167
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:05,088
Or at least like someone who's collaborating through their inaction

2168
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,160
Weak-willed callow

2169
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:13,280
I don't know we come to the end of this and

2170
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,048
I don't know

2171
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,328
It's just like

2172
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:17,632
Trains

2173
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:23,264
Foreboding

2174
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,080
Listen to this April beginning of April

2175
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:29,920
I mean part of it is knowing the Boston bombing is coming

2176
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:34,016
Even not knowing that

2177
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:37,856
You just see these elements that are enter

2178
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,392
Texting

2179
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:41,184
Liquor

2180
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:42,208
Going on dates

2181
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:43,488
Not on the show

2182
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,304
Like the way that Alex is rhetoric is asked

2183
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:48,608
So severe light the way

2184
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:49,888
Kind of

2185
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:51,168
Shifting towards

2186
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:53,728
Directly Target

2187
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:57,568
There is something going on that is

2188
01:47:58,592 --> 01:48:00,640
But you can tell from listening to

2189
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:04,224
I don't know what it is but

2190
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,784
I texted you yesterday

2191
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:07,808
It was yesterday

2192
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:08,832
There's a big fog

2193
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:12,416
Coming off the light.

2194
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:13,440
It feels like that

2195
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:16,256
If you would like looking at Lake Michigan and just seeing

2196
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:18,816
Nicholas Sparks

2197
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:21,888
Every time you've used that trade metaphor I have had that heavy

2198
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,448
Did you ever see The Addams Family Values

2199
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:27,008
I see, but I don't remember

2200
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:29,312
Starring Raul Julia being f******

2201
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:30,848
Amazing with Angelica

2202
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,128
Anjelica

2203
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:34,688
Absolutely

2204
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:41,344
He's down in the base

2205
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:42,624
And he's playing with his

2206
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:44,160
And

2207
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:46,464
The entire Addams Family

2208
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:47,488
And they're all

2209
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:50,304
Oh no its

2210
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,840
Running around Dead Man's Curve

2211
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:56,192
They all know that this is going to result

2212
01:48:58,496 --> 01:48:59,008
Destructive

2213
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:00,544
He knows it

2214
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,360
They know it everybody's involved in watching

2215
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,176
And it's still so enough

2216
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,736
You know everybody anybody

2217
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:10,528
Everybody included could have

2218
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:14,112
Stop it I don't

2219
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:15,392
Framed

2220
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:20,256
Another putting Addams Family Values

2221
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:21,792
It is just like a

2222
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:24,608
Zebit

2223
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:25,376
80s

2224
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:27,168
You everybody knows what

2225
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:27,936
Going to have

2226
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:30,752
Everybody knows it's inevitable

2227
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:32,544
And yet anyone could stop

2228
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:35,360
We are to consider the idea that people were listening

2229
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:36,384
Maybe

2230
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:37,664
Pick up on me

2231
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:42,016
People were onboard fully as this was happening

2232
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:42,784
Yeah

2233
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:44,832
The trends are

2234
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:46,112
Really clearly

2235
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:47,136
I wasn't

2236
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:48,672
All of these episodes

2237
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:50,208
And I can

2238
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:51,232
Fuel the entire

2239
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:52,000
10:30 right

2240
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:54,048
Like I can steal

2241
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:56,608
Did he's in his rhetoric and the

2242
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:59,168
He's laying out these episodes

2243
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,192
The story

2244
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:02,240
Choosing to cover the ways covering.

2245
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:04,032
It's coming in

2246
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:04,800
Into like a

2247
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:06,080
Bottleneck

2248
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:09,152
It it's weird to imagine

2249
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:09,920
Someone

2250
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:11,456
Like who loves Alex

2251
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:13,248
Experiencing

2252
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:16,576
Like as a real reporting

2253
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:20,416
Respond

2254
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:21,184
Be taken on

2255
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:25,792
Hard to figure out exactly what this guy you look up to is actually

2256
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:27,328
We saying aw of time

2257
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,096
Bruschetta

2258
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:29,376
