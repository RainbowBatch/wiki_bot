I'm going to call an emergency meeting of the knowledge fight

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,224
The knowledge fight bat signal went up

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,760
And we had to respond

7
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,576

00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,416

Can have to cover this

14
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,376
It was in a meeting

To cover it

19
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,592
We had to get in the studio we had to take care of it

20
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,616
Now unfortunately

21
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,920
In between

22
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:56,320

00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:31,136
Bills are most important in the womb

36
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:37,280
Let me ask you a question

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,680
Unfortunately in between the time that we decided that we were going to do this episode about being on

38
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,216

00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
Another game

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
Which is way more important

49
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,560
Way bigger

50
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
He had

51
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,144
Putin's advisors

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,424

Was a guest

00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
On the Alex Jones Show

60
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,344
Add that to me takes

61
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,440
This changes the game do you mean having a top Russian

62
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,720
Dandasana in

63
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,768

So he had the Alexander

67
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
I feel like that's always

68
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
We talkin about unfortunately

69
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
It's not

70
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
Heavy news organization

71
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
Should be covering

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
We can't handle it

73
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,968
Are they

74
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,272
Not yet not that but do you think

75
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,296
Do you think they will

76
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,280
I'm still trying to say we're Russian shills behaving like Russian shells

77
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,840
Couple clips for Men review

Kettlebowl ship

Play racist I have no idea

82
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,360
Anyway

83
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,176
I have a couple clips from the Dugan interview and then we'll get

84
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,992
To the business of Monday's show but I want to illustrate

85
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,296
F***** up this interview

86
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
That he did

87
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
With this Russia

88
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,184
Here's the first one Jordan in

89
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,952
Enjoy

90
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
This

91
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,328
Disposition

92
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
We just want our right to be here

93
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,152
These framing that is Putin

94
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
Sandpoint

95
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,272
Alexander Dugan said that Putin is not imperialistic

96
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,088
He does not want to invade other countries although you pronounce

97
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,000
Which is fine he doesn't bring a little bit of levity to know that

98
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
We've got a Star Trek

99
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,351
Yeah it does

100
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,911
Notice how humble poop

101
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,239
The craziest thing I've ever heard

102
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,287
A bumper of man

103
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
Horses shirtless

104
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
About how

105
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,855
Russia is on the Forefront of fighting globalism and

106
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,671
Listening

107
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,951
Let's take three seconds

108
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,975
To absorb

109
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
What the f*** that way

110
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,071
Substantially worse

111
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
1

112
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
Sounds like a Nazi

113
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:59,519
Russian Russian accent

114
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,871
If you listen to that clipped

115
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
Within his

116
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
Yeah

117
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,671
They also discussed kicked out the oligarch

118
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,951
18 years ago

119
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,255
This was a big deal

120
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:27,679
Give him credit. We jump and replace it with an autocorrect

121
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
You did tear down the Oliver

122
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,823
Most of the reports that I've read by Thoreau journalist

123
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,127
Bogart's

124
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
He just told them I'm taking

125
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
In the cut

126
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,271
Yeah you just came into power and was like I want half of what you have

127
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,831
MSY Putin has 200 billion dollars

128
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
This is all just a

129
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,231
Narrative but as we all know from

130
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
Understanding

131
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Give the mafia

132
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,351
Let's call it the Godfather

133
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,167
When you do that

134
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,495
When you kick out or when you just you know you become the overboss

135
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,127
They're not oligarchs anymore they're just really risky

136
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,967
Yeah yeah

137
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
There's an Italian word for it

138
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,623
Probably

139
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
Will probably end

140
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
You know

141
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,559
We've all lost our minds right

142
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,887
Has anybody ever explained what the

143
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
The f*** is going on other than people

144
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,007
Don't like us shouting

145
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:41,151
I think we are

146
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:46,783
Trump is it's our man and Putin is Sauron we're living in The Lord of the Rings

147
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,183
We Are Who has the one ring I don't want to be Frodo

148
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,791
It was cool in there can I be

149
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,631
Pastels

150
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
Lord of the Rings

151
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
Of course

152
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,199
Oh boy do I know this was about Lord of the Ring

153
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,527
You're a nerd

154
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,903
My other for America

155
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
Dies

156
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
In the middle of

157
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
Exactly

158
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,815
The other thing is that all of these

159
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,119
Aspects of the dirty dossier

160
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,679
Are starting to come out as kind of like

161
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,471
That looks like it might have been real

162
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
So it can't

163
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
Not be real

164
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,407
Individual

165
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,967
20% of Russia's state-owned oil inter

166
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015
Image traced back

167
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,343
Untraceable bank account in the Cayman Islands

168
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
Well

169
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:58,463
I've heard a couple of different theories theories

170
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
About

171
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,767
Billionaires from

172
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
Saudi Arabia

173
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,839
As well as

174
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
About that guitar

175
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,447
What was the separate

176
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
Yeah

177
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,007
Which is another great

178
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,079
Guitars

179
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,735
What's an interview

180
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,015
Which I think

181
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
Should

182
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
Look I'm not saying

183
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,647
Did anyone needs to kick Alex Jones

184
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,439
I'm not saying

185
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,719
But this clip

186
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,023
Is so f***** up I don't even know

187
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
How to set it up appropriately

188
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
Awesome

189
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
So America

190
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:48,127
The world

191
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,479
I just give you some contacts beat that new Atlantis thing is

192
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,807
Francis Bacon's idea about America being a new Atlantis

193
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
Bubba blah

194
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
There's like

195
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,463
It's it's it's part isn't really all that

196
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
Nefarious

197
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,023
Coronavirus Atlanta

198
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,815
Just sort of like a metaphorical

199
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,399
He's about the beginnings of America and

200
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:26,015
State of America

201
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,815
We're basically taken out

202
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
Also

203
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
If you

204
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:47,263
He thinks the Russian czars were taken

205
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,127
Lalala Fantasyland

206
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:58,527
If you are unfortunate enough to listen to Infowars like I do

207
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,575
Make note of every time

208
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
That Alex says

209
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
But somebody's not perfect

210
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,671
And you will start

211
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
Sofia trend

212
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,487
That's very similar to Trump

213
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
Use of quotation marks

214
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
His tweets

215
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
Great

216
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,631
To use a racial slur whenever uses

217
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Quotes

218
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
And something

219
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:19,007
He's like Bad Dudes out there or we have to stop

220
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,055
Quote evil from getting into the country

221
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,359
Stuff always wants to say

222
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
Something offensive

223
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
And the quote marks

224
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
Stopping

225
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
Whenever Alex says

226
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
They're not perfect

227
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
It's like

228
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,183
They're not bad which one of us is

229
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,255
Perfect

230
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
At the very least

231
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Wish digenis

232
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,863
Also I've been keeping track of earbuds

233
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
There's no discernible pattern yet but

234
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,519
Texas here

235
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,871
He was talking about the booze out during the Superbowl he talked to her

236
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,335
On the British

237
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:31,711
Russia helped defeat the Germans better for history of Russia wouldn't have

238
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,231
Even the Russian propaganda

239
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
This is like that s***

240
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
Razee

241
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
The Nazis are bad

242
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
Yeah yeah yeah

243
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
Well I mean the Nazis

244
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
Look Nazis

245
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:10,623
Perfect

246
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,023
Virginia Woolf

247
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,815
Sylvia Plath

248
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,631
You're thinking of Sylvia Plath

249
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,191
Clearly you weren't depressed

250
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,495
Teenager who is also a girl

251
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,055
I went hunting directions

252
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,079
I went to God

253
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,407
I went directly to wiccanism

254
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,271
Do I have a bunch of Christian Scott

255
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,319
The most dangerous

256
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
Quite literally

257
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:46,719
Suggesting that the world might be a better place if the Nazis had won World War II

258
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,279
The other thing that you slept in there that I think

259
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
Who got silver

260
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
He said Russia got but

261
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,631
Trade ya

262
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Do you know who

263
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,703
Would have betrayed Russia in this

264
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:01,055
No do know you're talkin about Germany betraying them right

265
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,615
No

266
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,407
Germany map

267
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
Betrayed because of global

268
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,759
That's your

269
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,879
Idea there is that

270
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
Russia was

271
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439
Betrayed

272
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
Instead of

273
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,999
Russia

274
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,839
Ape shirts

275
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,631
Yeah like

276
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
What he's really he's baked

277
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,471
Typically rewriting history to

278
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,055
That Churchill and FDR worm

279
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
People I think

280
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:41,247
I think that Alex would probably argue that

281
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:47,647
I don't know how he feels about Churchill necessarily a shrew

282
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,719
You know Churchill still has a busted

283
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
Churchill in there which

284
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,583
Cuz I don't know if

285
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:05,055
Almost 20 days into Trump's presidency

286
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,383
Alex

287
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,919
Still takes time on the show

288
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
Complain

289
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,479
About how

290
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
Someone claimed

291
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,575
But Trump's throughout the bust of Martin Luther

292
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,951
Weather report at no one really cared

293
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
Also

294
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
No one would be surprised

295
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,839
I think

296
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
There is

297
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,935
There is like a lot of fake news now

298
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,007
It

299
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
But the problem is

300
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,103
The news about Trump is there's nothing that you wouldn't believe

301
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,943
You could literally spend any lie and it has

302
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,503
The Ring of plausibility

303
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Can't go

304
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,951
Far enough outside of the realm of possibility

305
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:10,847
Lock that in that deposition

306
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
I'm sure you can walk

307
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,711
He's being blackmailed by Russia

308
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,343
Which muscle We Can't Stop

309
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:27,231
There's no we can all believe that

310
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,143
Ali any other president you're like

311
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
That's crazy

312
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
There's no way

313
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Anybody

314
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
President

315
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,919
Rechargeable leave literally any others

316
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,991
Yeah

317
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,831
He's blackmailing the president

318
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,647
Yeah

319
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
Bucked up

320
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
The Monday

321
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:04,607
We got some fun with this we can get that

322
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,167
Before I get to this cuz it's

323
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,447
From boring-ass David Knight

324
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,495
But he takes over at the end of the show

325
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:15,103
Andy accidentally let slip

326
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,711
He has a little slip of the tongue

327
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
Play it here but he sucks

328
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
One last one

329
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
About the whole Russia

330
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,255
If I was going to

331
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,815
If I was going to put together an idea of what

332
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,887
Russian flag

333
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,191
Now.

334
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,007
Here is what here's what I would

335
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
I'm I'm

336
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
They are trying to

337
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
Demolish

338
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,919
All of the United

339
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
Nations

340
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,831
Whether or not they're going to do anything but

341
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
America in

342
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
Either

343
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
Non-issue

344
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,975
Somehow there

345
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Lackey

346
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303
Domingo there

347
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,351
Is whenever they separate everybody else

348
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
Then finally they can act

349
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Really get vericon

350
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
Yeah because

351
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,751
Does he have

352
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,543
Because

353
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,871
They keep f****** with people and their stats

354
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,431
So so they do that

355
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,479
Keeps them from being beholding to the say

356
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Of the United

357
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
God knows that's probably

358
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,463
John McCain

359
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,023
The least worst person on the

360
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
The sanctions right now

361
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,351
Noel open trader

362
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,887
With all of these other name

363
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,167
Who otherwise wouldn't

364
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,215
And they have massive oil Reserves

365
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,031
Really both

366
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
And then

367
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,591
Backcountry

368
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,383
Whenever they get that

369
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,687
They are going to do the Ukraine

370
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,479
To all the time

371
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:02,623
Old Soviet Union

372
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:06,975
Vindicated

373
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,279
My theory is to what

374
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,887
But we're not here to be speculative show we're not here to make

375
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
Guesses

376
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,495
And mock out

377
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,775
So

378
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
Keep in mind

379
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
Alex Jones

380
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
Is a policy

381
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663
I keep that in mind

382
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
For the rest of time

383
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
Alex starts this show off

384
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,319
By explaining that

385
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,087
Ikea's fuc

386
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
Sickened

387
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,159
Buy something he's red

388
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
Oh no

389
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,607
Now that's the only

390
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
Free Press learn.

391
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Maybe didn't read

392
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:56,383
About last night

393
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:04,063
It makes me sick to myself

394
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,719
Do you want to try and guess what the plans are

395
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
God

396
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
Make Alex

397
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,095
Musically

398
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
Jessieville

399
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,143
Physically sick

400
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,215
Polonium poisoning everybody

401
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,031
Okay

402
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
Where I live

403
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
Here in Austin Texas

404
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
Has been

405
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,391
More than 25 years

406
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,487
As the global

407
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,023
Model City

408
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
Of the future

409
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:51,935
Berthold not sure why you're mad about that

410
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,799
He sounded so angry about that

411
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,871
Have been telling me

412
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,663
For 25 years

413
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
That this city

414
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
Is animes

415
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
Eating place to live

416
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,831
And it's going to be whatever

417
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
And that

418
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
Seconds

419
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,183
Occupy

420
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
Sickens me that

421
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,255
This place is so enjoyable to live in

422
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,559
We'll see if he can explain it a little better than

423
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,839
Just your city is awesome

424
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,263
And when you actually read what they say they're going to do

425
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,311
Under Agenda 21

426
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:33,151
And you realize it's only

427
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
1 Japanese City

428
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,599
Read what there

429
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,647
Somebody just pop up

430
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:52,863
I just realized I don't pick up on the mic

431
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,143
I have energy

432
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
Drink it wasn't a beer

433
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,567
That sounds like I'm being Alex

434
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,831
That it's just makes me want to cry

435
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,928
It's so obvious

436
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,496
And not give it the True Justice of making a no

437
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:34,336
30 minutes documentary

438
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,408
He's on minutes sticks of talking about it

439
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:46,368
Usually starts with I don't want to talk about this

440
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,792
F****** nuts what is going to happen really ramping up

441
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,120
Is it is there going to be an MD

442
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,472
Spoil anything but no

443
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,264
As fast as I can research

444
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,104
It's so big it's so old it's so plan

445
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,808
Can you find out

446
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,112
How many people are involved in

447
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,512
Then you realize about half the people fling

448
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,584
San Francisco in Los Angeles

449
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,400
F*** you

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,592
Banner coming here

451
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,128
To collude with it

452

Weather

453
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,040
And to help suck everything

454
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,576
And everybody off

455
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
And then

456
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,904
Move on in 20-30 years

457
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,864
Conferences in

458
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:11,872
Wrench and you're hurting people in your

459
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
At the doctor Houma

460
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:26,720
Lobbying at the convention center

461
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,568
All world leaders were do

462
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,368
That's not what I'm getting into

463
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:04,352
Nico I think I actually gave you my stack on that

464
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,168

466
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,728
Traffic that was

467
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,640
Describe how evil nothing was

468
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:22,784
Anythink

469
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,624
31

470
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
Letgo app

471
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,704
I don't know I know Shanghai

472
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
I could be in Hong Kong

473
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,080
I don't know

474
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:50,432
Germany Munich

475
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,224
Munich Airport

476
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:55,040
Be fun

477
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,320
Look up with the detour

478
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:02,208
Which is where we landed

479
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,304
44 the Dorf on golf as well

480
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:14,752
Are there cities in Japan Tokyo

481
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:21,920
What is he f****** talking about gender and age

482
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,760
The order that

483
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,320
To take out all the Younglings

484
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,720
It's one of the most thoroughly debunked

485
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,304
Conspiracy theories it's been lingering since the 90s

486
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,096
Is it making everybody fits

487
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,400
Physically ill makes Alex physically l

488
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,936
So what helps.

489
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,264
I don't want to give like a whole primer on this but if you want to look at

490
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,032
Google

491
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,080
Find all this stuff out

492
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:54,944
Beware that's how they get you into Agenda 21 you know that right

493
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,088
21 was a paper put out

494
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:04,416
By the UN about sustainability and growth

495
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
In the 90s

496
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,024
And had to do with third world countries

497
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,072
Basically Rising

498
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,096
People out of poverty

499
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,376
Protecting the environment

500
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,192
It was completely non-binding

501
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,240
100-percent voluntary

502
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,568
And there's no there's no

503
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,592
Dictate

504
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:25,152
It's mostly just about like

505
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,432
Ideas

506
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:33,856
Is it was 178 countries voluntarily signed on when it first came out

507
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,416
People have been really bad

508
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
Destitute

509
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
Interested

510
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
Bunch of

511
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,352
Is a good idea somebody

512
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,168
Dab well I found

513
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,960
This guy who is research

514
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,728
I had a really

515
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,008
Good quote about it

516
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
Like that explained

517
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,056
In the

518
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,896
Assertive anger at it was the quote Alex Jones is full of s***

519
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:01,504
Michael Barkin University political scientist

520
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
Conspiracy theory

521
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,112
You go to the thing anytime you get

522
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
Some sort of un program

523
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:10,208
Suggest any kind of change in the way people live

524
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,256
Even if it seems outwardly benign

525
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,328
It's going to be taken up by people with Atkins

526
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
Conspiracy band

527
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,912
That

528
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:25,312
Let's believe that 21 what's going to happen is

529
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
Is under the eye

530
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,872
Pictures of Environmental Protection

531
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,712
And under the auspices of trying to help the poor

532
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,504
Everyone is going to be pushed into

533
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,296
They're super compact

534
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,600
Everyone's going to be living in basically

535
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,880
Closet Apartments

536
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
It's it's

537
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
It's not

538
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,720
Absolute nonsense

539
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,352
Because of the name

540
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:52,448
Like I said that's the order that Anakin

541
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,080
Needed a plan to make the 21st century better than the last

542
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,128
That's why it's called 21

543
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,712
Contagious

544
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,736
Good ideas for people

545
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:08,832
That would be awesome

546
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
You can risk

547
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,880
Construe good ideas

548
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,440
Hey guys this is non-binding

549
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:19,840
21

550
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,376
Do these

551
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,168
Naming things not

552
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,192
Hear the voice

553
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,728
Oh that means

554
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,520
I think back in like 8

555
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:31,360
It was 92 when it was Saved by the Bell

556
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,968
Omar Limehouse Beyond days

557
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,856
All day all night

558
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,184
But I think back then

559
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,976
People didn't have the same

560
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,000
Crazy

561
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,584
You know like we didn't have the same people who are out there

562
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,608
Making everything

563
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,168
You know so I don't think

564
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,984
Agenda 21

565
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,264
People take

566
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,800
Somebody

567
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,848
I think it kind of sounded catch

568
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,736
21st century agenda agenda for the 21st century

569
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,880
Good at good ideas

570
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,584
The answer is almost always

571
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,352
Or not

572
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:29,472
I've looked into this one pretty extensively and given it a score of

573
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,288
Thumbs down

574
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:36,896
Thumbs down on this being a legitimate

575
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,176
I was going to say

576
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,736
Classic deck a SeaTac

577
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,504
Conspiracy

578
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,880
Makes Alex sick

579
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,464
Cuz there's a sinkhole

580
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,352
There's something that he feels is 21

581
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,632
Code next

582
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
God

583
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
F***

584
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,520
Evil name I don't know

585
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:09,408
People named slickback has really weird cuz

586
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,688
You choose like

587
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,504
They sort of vague word

588
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:15,808
With the same stuff

589
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,936
Yeah it makes sense

590
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,216
Be scared of

591
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
You scared of everything

592
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,264
But

593
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
They're not the greatest

594
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,480
Yeah

595
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
Empathic

596
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,552
Empathetic

597
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,576
If you don't

598
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,112
Climate change

599
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:50,880
Just real

600
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,672
Then people trying to push for things

601
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
To protect against

602
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
What's climate change

603
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,024
Obviously you would think that they were up to no good

604
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
If you believe

605
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
His premise

606
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
What is promise

607
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,912
Is horribly flawed

608
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,448
Do you mean non-existent

609
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,104
He's had nothing to f****** say nothing everyone

610
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,320
Yeah and then getting to

611
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,488
I just wanted to make you guys

612
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
X bankers

613
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,352
Being interrupted

614
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:36,192
Administration

615
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,496
About how he knows everything about these

616
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,288
Contact bankers

617
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,080
Does not remember one of their name

618
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,384
Which is a little bit.

619
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,296
I always said

620
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:55,392
I'll let go monkey

621
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,704
All of them

622
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,288
And watched it happening and for

623
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,360
One half of that is true the other the second part

624
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:23,296
Years and years are very

625
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:26,368
Alex

626
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,184
Claiming that everything I know all about these guys

627
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:35,840
Tigers as pets

628
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,400
That's Rick Perry not remembering agency

629
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,960
To demolish

630
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:50,432
The super important don't want this always in charge of nucleus

631
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,736
No

632
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,808
So far everybody that's been hard for everything his headache

633
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,624
Complete look of shock the moment they found out what it is

634
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,488
Did the people who are in charge

635
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,768
Putting them in charge

636
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,072
Of those agencies

637
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,608
They want

638
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:12,448
The reason to privatize out of

639
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:16,544
Entirely that government is wrong

640
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
Mirror

641
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,992
In the next decade to come

642
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,552
Can't we and then reject the next

643
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:31,136
10:15

644
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,696
NFA please no please

645
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,744
Did the other thing I think is really unfortunate about

646
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,560
That clip is he's talking about

647
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,608
Steve mnuchin

648
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,888
In particular was

649
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:45,984
Pretty heavily implicated in

650
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,288
He

651
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:55,456
He just failed miserably at it and then stole all their money along the way it was pretty

652
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,760
How much do most you can fail at like

653
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,808
If his goal was to get people

654
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:03,136
Cheaper housing steal all of their money

655
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:07,232
Man he did a really bad job

656
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,304
Clip I was really high one day and I saw a clip of this

657
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:11,840
Daredevil

658
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,888
His name was death wish.

659
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:18,240
That is some f****** great

660
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:22,080
Naming right there

661
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,456
You screwed up everything

662
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:32,320
His nickname is like tiny fridge

663
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,904
This next

664
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,256
Who is George Soros

665
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:46,656
Infowars

666
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
Needs to be list

667
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,984
Composite

668
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,776
I think it might document

669
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,800
It's like psychotic break

670
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:59,200
Call Alex point it's worth it instead of just a borderline Alzheimer's

671
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,784
He just Rambles about how sick things are and then

672
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Forgets what it is

673
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,624
George Soros

674
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,648
Explain but then

675
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,696
F****** wet

676
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,512
But here are the headlines

677
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,120
Rally House

678
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:24,032
Goldman Sachs Economist are starting to worry about President Trump has Bloomberg's putting all the bad news

679
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:24,800
News out now

680
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:32,736
Wait what time to sell the Dollar on our policies

681
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:39,136
Delete last week by good intelligence agencies

682
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,672
What's that

683
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
George Soros

684
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,280
Is basically naked shorting the dollar

685
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:49,632
And the pound to punish us to get us back under Global government

686
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,912
And so of course

687
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,704
We should have him

688
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,008
We got to have JP Morgan

689
00:35:55,264 --> 00:36:00,384
And Bloomberg and Goldman Sachs all come out against America

690
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,176
So here we are

691
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,992
He thinks George Soros shorting

692
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,016
Games that he's

693
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,112
Evil but also

694
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,392
Let me beyond that

695
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,672
Accuracy

696
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,256
It came out from good

697
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,048
The George Soros

698
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:22,656
What he's referring to is what we talked about

699
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,192
No date

700
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,520
Financial organization accidentally posted

701
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,080
Everyone short online when they weren't

702
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,872
Supposed to they post those short bet

703
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,712
It was a German Bank

704
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:40,832
The Deutsche Bank came out

705
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,160
Eman Eman saying

706
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,720
Did it comes from good intelligence services

707
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,256
Is lying about the sourcing

708
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,304
Is absolute

709
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,192
Those are good until

710
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,592
Yeah

711
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,552
The Patriots game

712
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,344
The football team they didn't need any help

713
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,648
No

714
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,672
In the

715
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,072
You remember that one

716
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,960
But Alex will talk about that

717
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,240
But

718
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,640
Speculation

719
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,944
Possibly time to get worried about our currency

720
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,272
Become erratic

721
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,368
It's not saying hey everyone

722
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,392
It's saying

723
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,696
This could be dangerous times ahead

724
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,256
Responsible Financial

725
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,048
Advisor would probably

726
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,864
Without getting panicky

727
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,632
Tell you like

728
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,192
Keep an eye on

729
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,984
I see they don't have to do that anymore now that the

730
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
Sushi roll

731
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,152
For their own good

732
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,968
So why would you have a responsible

733
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:17,088
Yeah yeah he's a f******

734
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:21,184
Exactly that's against the law

735
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,208
Can't be profitable

736
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,000
Anymore

737
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
Anyway

738
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
Was it ever

739
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,352
Psychotic break

740
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:35,264
Oh yeah

741
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:39,616
Thank you oh yeah oh cuz I forgot

742
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:43,712
Cuz Trump works for you right he's doing what you want now he's doing the opposite

743
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:48,832
Doesn't even deserve

744
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,368
I'm serious

745
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
You're right

746
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,888
Frozen Arctic

747
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:08,032
God forbid to give you a space heater or some food God forbid

748
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:13,408
What did we do to the other way

749
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:19,296
Channel 7 other than the torture The Invader

750
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,088
You know

751
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:25,440
History American history slavery races

752
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,768
Make a really compelling

753
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,304
For karma

754
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,400
This is a this is karma doesn't work, ethically though I thought

755
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:40,544
What's the right way to phrase that it doesn't work karmically because

756
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,872
The people who are going to be most hurt other people

757
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:49,504
You don't like Trump coming into power is only going to hurt the people who deserve retribution

758
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,552
Yeah yeah well

759
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
It's going to be like

760
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,368
Grindhouse films victim

761
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,648
Is also the one

762
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:59,488
It's called again

763
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,048
Yeah yeah

764
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
Yeah yeah

765
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,656
Goes far deeper

766
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:11,520
You don't deserve that like Eliza told me it is a public

767
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,056
Is a bunch of scum Alex

768
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,872
Evil

769
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:20,736
Alex you'll never be your one of us

770
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:25,088
One day you'll come and work for us one day that's why we're going to let you live

771
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:37,376
I know the truth about this as I am and together

772
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:43,520
I don't care what you

773
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,824
I'm not lowering your level and feeding on them

774
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,104
I'm not a cannibal

775
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:56,064
Bloomberg Warren

Endomorph and Total Control

779
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:15,008
Monster wants to decide what you're going to eat

780
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,848
Self the Great technocrat

781
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:24,480
He made a billions of dollars extra just the last few years

782
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:29,856
Because he's

783
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:34,976
Vote the systems with the NSA that literally control you in

784
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,376
Whatever that one

787
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:47,776
He's like a Time magazine article that's called the Great technocrat

788
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:51,360
Article article

789
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:54,943
Causes of the great Michael Bloomberg

790
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:06,207
Decide what I'm going to

791
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,511
Looking at this looking at the cereal aisle

792
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,327
I'm trying to figure out what cereal to buy

793
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
Just wish

794
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,119

Fed MSN live

808
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:26,847
I don't know I don't either

809
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,919
Infowars which is why

810
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:33,247
You texted me 8 different conspiracy theories

811
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,039
About what's going on

812
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,855
89

813
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,135
I did not I did not

814
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,695
I'm starting to suspect

815
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,255
That possibly Rodger stone is pulling the strings

816
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:50,655
How do you say it was true I said it's possible

817
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,423
Anyway

818
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:56,543
Call Austin

819
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:02,943
Wonderful

820
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:10,879
Make sure you're not letting dog poop

821
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:19,071
Code next

822
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,447
In the board of the Malaysian

823
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:28,287
Assimilated to be

824
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,079
Destroyed

825
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:36,479
The end of humanity

826
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:42,879
Thousands of white papers I read 20 years ago

827
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:47,743
There's people with huge mustaches

828
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:50,559
Screw you Alex

829
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,351
It's a master plan

830
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,911
I think your mustache is cool actually

831
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:58,239
I think your green and red sauce

832
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:04,127
You're not individual by being screwed over by this and then by believing this is how you're cool

833
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:12,063
Agreed

834
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,903
What happened

835
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:22,047
Bora Bora

836
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,375
What is going on

837
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,423
This is imagining a person who's taunting

838
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:32,799
In the same way earlier in this he was imagining some guy at this agenda 21 conference

839
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,567
Suicide

840
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:37,663
I know he's using creative license

841
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:42,271
Is the movie phone voice

842
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,319
Dan LaFontaine

843
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,087
Justin Bieber

844
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,391
I'm serious no world

845
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,183
Nothing

846
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,719
And Tom Bombadil Taunton

847
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,743
Have you seen

848
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,511
Star Trek

849
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,959
Just a little bit more put the punchline is definitely the

850
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:04,543
You got this big mustache

851
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,711
All your friends

852
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,759
Home Alone

853
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,807
Cuz there is no family none of it's real

854
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,599
You're living a simulation

855
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,879
You're living a fraud

856
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:25,535
In sports is a primitive form of virtual reality it's real reality

857
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,559
Confine

858
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,655
Won't affect the power structure

859
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:33,471
VR

860
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:39,871
Total systems that remove you from reality and I could see that myself

861
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:52,671
Building fortresses in Jungle Mountain

862
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:56,511
Hawaii 51

863
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:59,839
He's also saying from Tasmania to

864
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,887
It's just that talk about Peter Thiel

865
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,191
Teal and Mark Zuckerberg

866
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,495
He's not everyday

867
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,775
Hippie 20

868
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,847
I have information on a great

869
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:13,663
Swath of Elites moving to Jungle fortresses

870
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:18,783
They're just two people who announced they were creating like vacation but if you're going

871
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:24,159
Mountain Fortress

872
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:28,255
I got to get an even better

873
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,535
And then eventually

874
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,327
Uber clearly fighting

875
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:35,679
Other from Jungle Mountain Fortress as the rest of the world especially Austin

876
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,471
Because you know where they hide their lies

877
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,519
Austin their mustaches

878
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:42,591
OSHA

879
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,687
You know like your mustache

880
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:54,623
If it's the only way to get Ally.

881
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:58,463
Death as believable as Agenda 21

882
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,279
Introduced a little bit

883
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,071
Call Alex

884
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,631
I really want to get into house

885
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:12,799
So is his idea of primitive virtual reality

886
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:14,847
Games

887
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,151
Games games

888
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,223
No

889
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:23,295
Playing games

890
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
Stuff like that

891
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,343
Kind of like a

892
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:30,463
You're creating a false reality to live in for a while

893
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,263
Correlation without coming election

894
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,287
I love it

895
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:47,359

Want

898
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,415
Military

899
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,231
He wants you to go to college

900
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,791
Marion sports teams

901
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,775
Evite your life destroyed all you can do is be

902
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,175
The modern guy in France

903
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,743
Russian

904
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,399
Again

905
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,935
Cruz's first part

906
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,727
We don't want the most

907
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,287
Aggressiveness

908
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,591
Are you in the military

909
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,615
They're going to do a graph

910
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,807
Reviver read all of history

911
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,343
Vicky

912
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,671
The most aggressive

913
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:07,487
They're not on the right side of History

914
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:12,607
They're usually bad but the idea that

915
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,143
Sports is created to keep aggressive

916
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,167
2 people out of politics

917
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:22,079
Is wacky realize it's all a trap

918
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
To become a coach

919
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:27,455
Earned

920
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:33,855
Do something with it pretty f****** happy with being a coach

921
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,671
It's that good

922
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,439
Exercise

923
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,975
It's good way to

924
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,535
Trying to import good messages to

925
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,815
The kids about team

926
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:45,119
Building voucher

927
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,399
Making it

928
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:52,799
It's actually very valuable to curb male aggression in

929
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,567
Keep them out of

930
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,919
Sports a little bit later with some theories

931
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,687
It is time

932
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,223
To get to the Milo interview

933
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:04,575
I brought

934
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,367
Italian wine

935
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,391
To celebrate us

936
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:10,463
And we're almost done with it

937
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:15,327
And I have a bottle of Moscato because we don't deserve good favorites

938
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:21,215
This interview I really didn't know how to cut it up into separate clip

939
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:25,567
So it's just an interview

940
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,151
There's a couple of important things that I want

941
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,431
Let me know and I'll pause it

942
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:34,527
Also it starts with Alex saying that he's not going to

943
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,319
What he and Milo have planned

944
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,855
And at the end of the clip

945
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,647
Straight up

946
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,207
Alex Jones

947
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,839
I don't know

948
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,607
Some sort of a

949
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,375
Set up

950
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,447
It's an interview with Milo

951
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,263
Also planning something

952
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:58,847
I on the street in the next few weeks

953
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,759
I really

954
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:20,351
I've never actually heard

955
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,727
Studiously avoided his Mountain

956
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:26,751
I'm sorry to bring this

957
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,287
Listen to your life

958
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,335
Forest

959
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,639
Stalking British

960
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,759
Speaking

961
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,807
Wild inaccuracies

962
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:44,415
And total b******* erupt

963
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,207
No not really

964
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:50,303
Any interview that he does is largely like rhetorical

965
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,447
Worst Christopher Hitchens

966
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,983
Somewhat yes yes

967
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,007
Ender

968
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:08,223
I read Hitchens memoir

969
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,159
West Coast

970
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:21,791
Uc-davis UW Seattle uc-berkeley things went talk and we had the page

971
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:26,399
Black clothes.

972
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,471
You're always welcome

973
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,783
So

974
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:46,623
His is framing of this like everything was going well until the West Coast

975
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,951
I mean that's not entirely accurate

976
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:50,719
Unless

977
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,743
What he wants

978
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:54,559
What's to say is that when he was at

979
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:58,911
University of wisconsin-milwaukee

980
00:53:59,423 --> 00:53:59,935
Xbox

981
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:02,239
The s*** out of her

982
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:08,895
Yeah kind of gave an account of the

983
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,687
He was going

984
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:16,319
Project a picture of her years before when she was

985
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:22,719
What the f*** tranny everyone ever

986
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:27,839
She was in the crowd and was terrified one of the quotes

987
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,191
Her transition was the way you know he's failed

988
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,471
Is I could still banging

989
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:36,031
What the f*** that kind of speech

990
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,079
Is so f****** inappropriate

991
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,895
What's that

992
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:41,663
You didn't

993
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,943
Hade

994
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:46,271
Why

995
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,575
I don't know what is there

996
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,599
Reason

997
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:50,367
Money

998
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:55,999
Specifically

999
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,815
No but this sort of thing gets him a bigger reputation

1000
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,607
Will she was a student actor

1001
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,423
Against

1002
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,239
Again president

1003
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:11,103
Basically docs are on

1004
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,151
And I know it's not the same

1005
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:19,807
That is

1006
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,831
Harry level

1007
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,671
Powers everyone in that room

1008
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,207
F****** dead

1009
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:29,023
If I like legitimately if

1010
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,071
She had killed herself after that

1011
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:31,839
Nonna Pizza

1012
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:37,471
Laughing at me

1013
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,007
They don't know I'm in the room

1014
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:42,335
While a charismatic speaker is mocking me on stage

1015
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,663
Believe me

1016
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:49,247
And for something that has been difficult for me growing up

1017
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,527
That's what I think is it

1018
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:54,879
We talked about what people actually is evil

1019
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,671
Rule that's the

1020
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,951
Roulette f******

1021
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,255
That's childish f******

1022
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,535
Crazy hair

1023
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,839
8 year old

1024
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,119
Someone who's still in college

1025
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,983
Could you get more punching down

1026
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,263
What a f***

1027
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,287
Monster

1028
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,103
He's the f****** worst

1029
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,175
Part of his part of the tour that

1030
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:18,943
It's gone well

1031
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,671
Maybe some crime involves

1032
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,999
I believe that she filed

1033
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:35,839
With the school but I don't know what ended up happening with it

1034
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,607
I can't imagine

1035
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,631
Aunt Sue

1036
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,679
There's some sort of Publix

1037
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,727
Slander harassment

1038
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,871
Dennis article I think

1039
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,895
There might be

1040
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:54,271
Bubba Bubba. That's for something about a book deal

1041
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,039
With Milo has

1042
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,319
Anyway

1043
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,599
I hope it gets you

1044
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,623
F****** truck

1045
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,415
There's a book out called Dangerous

1046
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:04,255
Alex Jones

1047
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:09,375
Cuz it's too dangerous

1048
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,447
Push the buttons

1049
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,471
The PC left

1050
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,615
I don't think most people I know who are on the left don't care

1051
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,455
Particular

1052
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:29,087
300 on the list right now

1053
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,135
So f***

1054
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,439
Monster at his events

1055
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,719
Seattle

1056
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:37,535
Be angry about that for months yet

1057
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:43,167
Seattle protester got shot by one of his

1058
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:46,751
And

1059
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,103
If you

1060
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,151
Even if you disagree with

1061
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:59,551
Hazard

1062
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:04,159
Because of

1063
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:13,887
What happened in Seattle

1064
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,911
Between so I apologize

1065
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,263
To Berkeley that there were

1066
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,335
Essentially riot

1067
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:26,431
But also it came out then one of the things that he planned to do it

1068
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,199
Berkeley

1069
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,223
Was to

1070
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,527
Much as he did with that trim student

1071
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,063
He was going to out

1072
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,343
Illegal immigrants

1073
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,111
Students

1074
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,135
And make a Target

1075
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:42,047
The idea that he's expressing free speech and that's what being shut down

1076
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:46,143
It's really not all that accurate reminds me a lot of

1077
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:49,727
Something nothing like

1078
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,263
You wanted to commit

1079
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,799
Some sort of

1080
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:59,455
Right huh you would like some sort of underrepresented minority

1081
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,551
In front of your fervent supporters

1082
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,599
In order to

1083
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:09,183
It might be a good idea if you were sort of

1084
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:16,095
I don't know people the money Players behind one was a really

1085
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:20,703
Member of another underprivileged group because

1086
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:31,199
Some stuff a little bit you could also pay him a lot of money to do it as well

1087
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,735
Ears ears

1088
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,015
Here's where that

1089
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,319
Officially

1090
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,367
Done no further

1091
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:42,207
There's no further conversation about

1092
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:44,511
You have a long talk with you about that

1093
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:47,327
Here's what I would say in this long talk

1094
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,191
Hi Milo

1095
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:52,959
You're not

1096
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,007
I can't even do an impression of him

1097
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:58,079
Do you know that first clip how Alex was saying nothing

1098
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:01,663
Time 45 minutes Milo's really good at that he can just

1099
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,967
Spin sentences where there's no substance

1100
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,271
Manager voice cadences

1101
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,279
Argument

1102
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,047
Once again

1103
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,071
Alright

1104
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,351
First Amendment

1105
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:23,679
Congress can't make an outline

1106
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:24,703
Sayings

1107
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,495
That's a really big part of the First Amendment

1108
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,263
You can't go to

1109
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:30,335
Yeah no one have to f****** listen

1110
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,639
YouTube

1111
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,175
If you're getting here

1112
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:38,271
Then people who are Institution

1113
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,575
Duchenne is paying this guy

1114
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,367
100% right

1115
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,135
To be like

1116
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,159
F*** you you

1117
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,231
I want to make one point

1118
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,791
That is mildly defending him but it's not

1119
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:52,607
And that is that the First Amendment

1120
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,375
Spirit

1121
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,423
Truly is to protect

1122
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,447
Abhorrent

1123
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,055
Torrentz2

1124
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:03,359
The powers-that-be

1125
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,383
Football

1126
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,663
You know things that are fancy

1127
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:12,063
And I fully agree that Milo's should be able

1128
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:16,415
To see the things that he wants to say what does not have the right

1129
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,207
Do essentially harassed

1130
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:18,975
People

1131
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,255
And threatened

1132
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:25,631
You

1133
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,447
He should be arrested

1134
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:31,775
Berkeley was a threat

1135
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:32,799
Hippie people

1136
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:36,895
Illegally

1137
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:45,343
Also limits to free speech as much as you want to say

1138
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:49,695
You can't threaten people you can't commit slander

1139
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:52,255
These are two things are built into the first

1140
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,303
He's doing

1141
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:58,399
Computer some people are here illegally

1142
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,167
But it is

1143
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:04,287
It's an absolute

1144
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,847
Fire in a crowded

1145
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:07,871
Now we have to

1146
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:10,175
Deal with the aspect of it

1147
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:10,943
Which is

1148
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:13,247
The idea that

1149
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,271
Leftist

1150
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,831
Well-organized well-funded protesters

1151
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,367
Again it's a Soros narrative

1152
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:20,671
Are the ones who caused

1153
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,207
Chaos and rioting

1154
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:25,791
I watched a bunch of videos of the beginning

1155
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:29,375
Of what was going on there. Going to say it's responsible for all of it

1156
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,679
There's a lot of people at

1157
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,447
Meditating the Proto

1158
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:36,031
There's a lot of people who are getting up in their face

1159
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:40,895
Trying to get them to be violent

1160
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:43,199
Video of the guy Eddie Brock

1161
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,479
Yes

1162
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:51,903
He was pulling into them

1163
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,951
People's faces and literally

1164
01:02:54,207 --> 01:03:00,095
Forcing them to CM from their face bone in their face

1165
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:00,863
Again

1166
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:01,887
Nazi

1167
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,935
Here is Arizona

1168
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,007
And the First Amendment

1169
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,031
And how we should have

1170
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,079
It should not be

1171
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:10,847
Illegal

1172
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,383
To espouse Nazi

1173
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,455
Okay it should also not be illegal

1174
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:16,735
To punch.

1175
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:18,783
Now

1176
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,319
I agree

1177
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,111
The very that you know what I

1178
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:22,879
Stan white people

1179
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:23,903
Push back against

1180
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:27,487
We got some more Milo to get through life

1181
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:29,023
Okay everybody gets

1182
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,583
You get to punch a Nazi

1183
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,375
If you can prove they're not

1184
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,911
You get to punch a Nazi one

1185
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:37,471
Field day on Milo now

1186
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,263
Absolutely

1187
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,799
You know what

1188
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,823
Let me ask

1189
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:47,711
Ever seen we're not to get punched ever been like

1190
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,015
I wish they protected that

1191
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,183
RPM jump in his

1192
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,999
Archaeology artifact

1193
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:04,607
Falls in all aspects he's probably

1194
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,887
He's waiting.

1195
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,191
But God damn it if the man doesn't punch your goodness

1196
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,607
Handmaid's tale 1984

1197
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:46,591
Backwards

1198
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,151
Maybe it will they feel about

1199
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,175
F****** nuts

1200
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:54,527
Absolutely

1201
01:04:57,087 --> 01:05:01,951
I only say no.

1202
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:05,023
Tipping Point matter what George Soros

1203
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:21,919
Media

1204
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:34,719
And lied about sick of having dinner

1205
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:40,095
I was just speaking what we should read them and then what we should know

1206
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:42,143
Expresssos

1207
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,215
Yeah

1208
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,007
I don't want to play

1209
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:52,127
I really want to play the rest of this

1210
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,687
F****** brutal

1211
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:56,223
Listen to this man talk

1212
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:56,991
Is

1213
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:59,039
It is heartbreaking on so many levels

1214
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:05,439
Kissing from Alex and a bunch of nonsense

1215
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,207
Bring up

1216
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,511
Maybe we can get to Exotic it's kind of early

1217
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:12,607
Apart

1218
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,399
About people

1219
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,423
Call Target

1220
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,223
Nevermind

1221
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,623
They're voting the complete opposite direction

1222
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:37,951
Pelosi

1223
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,999
Promenade

1224
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:42,559
The main problem is that

1225
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,351
We're not doing s*** for us either

1226
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,167
Lying

1227
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:53,567
I know you're out there listening

1228
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,103
The numbers

1229
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,639
Episode

1230
01:06:56,895 --> 01:07:00,223
Each one teach one another word knowledge fight for the truth

1231
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,271
Opposite direction

1232
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:05,087
Keep your mouth shut about our show

1233
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:14,303
Settings

1234
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,583
Are coming world

1235
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,655
Tucking authoritarian

1236
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:23,007
There's a point where Milo talks about how

1237
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,287
He saw Robert Reich

1238
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,895
Responsible

1239
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:32,223
Right-wing forces were responsible for the

1240
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,551
Milo

1241
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:36,575
What size it is

1242
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:38,111
Is an absolute bulshit

1243
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,903
It's one of the most sickening

1244
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:40,927
Crazy

1245
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,975
Conspiracy theories

1246
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,767
Island

1247
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:52,447
By George Soros

1248
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:56,031
It is well

1249
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,871
Well organized and paid

1250
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,407
One thing

1251
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,711
Better at being non-violent

1252
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:08,319
Really want

1253
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,087
No

1254
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,111
Because

1255
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,135
He doesn't

1256
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,159
He doesn't give a

1257
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:17,279
I do agree with Robert Reich

1258
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:21,375
I don't agree with Robert

1259
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,143
I don't think

1260
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,679
Gets the right-wing I think

1261
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:26,495
Everybody is losing their s*** right now

1262
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:32,127
Exactly the right-wing doesn't understand

1263
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:33,407
What's happening right now

1264
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,175
They're starting

1265
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,711
To get this like inkling of

1266
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,063
That is driving

1267
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,855
And there's no stability in our

1268
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:50,815
The left we're aware that we're getting f***** and apparently we have zero power

1269
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,351
So there's all of these

1270
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,119
Powerless

1271
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:56,447
Surrounding surrounding each other

1272
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:57,727
One Small Place

1273
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,775
You're going to get violent,

1274
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,847
Because you only punch the people you see

1275
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,151
Call everybody

1276
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:10,015
He's mad at come back to this over and over

1277
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:15,135
Over to the point where these idiots vote

1278
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:21,535
We just never debate necessarily really about who they are

1279
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:26,655
It's a broad group it's very

1280
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:30,751
Some of it's disconnected it's complicated they think it's good globalist

1281
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:31,775
Which is appropriate

1282
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,359
I think it's pretty obvious that

1283
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:38,943
Once all of the corporations no longer have any

1284
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:43,295
Then now it's not about any country

1285
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:48,671
Get their money

1286
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,511
Capital is self-perpetuating

1287
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,535
Teams that are going to eventually

1288
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,095
But they just can't

1289
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:58,143
They don't understand that because they can

1290
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,935
It's but it's in their very nature

1291
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,703
R2

1292
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:05,311
Themselves

1293
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:06,591
Dangerous

1294
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,919
Because eventually you're going to have to come up with

1295
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,479
If everyone is America first

1296
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:14,015
Germany first

1297
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:17,087
There will be no room for compromise event tonight

1298
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:17,855
Is it

1299
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:21,695
Really crazy how every time there's a giant nationalism outbreak everybody

1300
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:24,255
F****** goes to work it seems like it's better

1301
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:30,655
Yeah but I want to make a few more points but Milo before we move on to some crazy bulshit from Alex afterwards

1302
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,935
Great little bit more

1303
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,215
So he want

1304
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:35,519
He claims that he was kicked off Twitter because he made

1305
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:40,383
Sure

1306
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,943
Very very good

1307
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:46,015
That's a big part of it also tweeting

1308
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,295
Fake tweet

1309
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,855
Were allegedly they were created

1310
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:52,159
With

1311
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:55,743
Make it look like I said it

1312
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:56,511
Things

1313
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,791
Infected is it there

1314
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,071
6 a bunch

1315
01:10:59,327 --> 01:10:59,839
Really crazy

1316
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:00,607
People ever make

1317
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:04,959
Leaked nude pictures of her and s*** like that

1318
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,495
It's up

1319
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,775
You get kicked off Twitter

1320
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,359
What

1321
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,663
What what could possibly be

1322
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:15,967
Possibly

1323
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:17,759
What

1324
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,063
Much of a monster

1325
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,343
I don't know

1326
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,671
Walk down the street

1327
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,719
And suddenly find myself walking

1328
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,743
Behind a woman

1329
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:31,071
Had a very similar Pace without me going through this way

1330
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,863
Does she think I'm a murderer

1331
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:38,495
I'm not a murderer I don't think I have an X

1332
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,775
Essential meltdown

1333
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,567
Because I'm horrified

1334
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,591
Of walking

1335
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,639
10 feet behind a girl at the right

1336
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,663
Speed

1337
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:49,247
Run to get ahead of mixture that I

1338
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:50,271
Knock

1339
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:55,647
Fusing myself with better because we're p**** lip tard Cox and that's why we're never going to make it

1340
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,463
Sure

1341
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:03,583
Maybe be better if everyone is a little bit more squeamish than they were aggressive

1342
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,351
First second

1343
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,375
And just think

1344
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,471
Maybe

1345
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:11,519
Maybe it would be helpful if we thought that way

1346
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:16,639
Am I good news about

1347
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:19,199
Here's another good piece of news about Milo

1348
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,247
He's a horrendous p****

1349
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:23,551
So

1350
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:28,927
Very laughable even more even more

1351
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,207
Frustrated

1352
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:32,255
If you're going to be a nothing

1353
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,023
At least

1354
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:36,607
Play the victim

1355
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:37,631
Every f******

1356
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:42,239
Astoria

1357
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,031
So

1358
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,823
Around when he got kicked off Twitter

1359
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,615
He was making the rounds in the media

1360
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,151
He was also

1361
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,967
That he was going to lead

1362
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:53,247
A gay pride March

1363
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,015
Stockholm

1364
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,295
Muslim neighborhood

1365
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,063
Because he's like

1366
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,855
They didn't hate

1367
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,927
But one of those big things is that like

1368
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:07,327
There's all this immigrant crime is going on in Sweden has become a home of rape gangs and either killing gays

1369
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,887
Stuff like that it's under-reported might like that

1370
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,703
None of these things have happened

1371
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:17,823
So he was going to lead

1372
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,615
He made a big

1373
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:26,015
F****** deal out of this use even on Rogan's podcast and I was going to do this

1374
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:29,855
Canceled

1375
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,647
Security team in a review the situation and

1376
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,927
Breitbart News

1377
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,207
Does Campbell Milo's appearance

1378
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:40,095
Despite his commitment

1379
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:42,399
We're not confident that we can ensure his safety

1380
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,543
If I were at a pride parade

1381
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:50,079
And Milo is there

1382
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:51,615
I don't think it would be

1383
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:56,735
Muslim gangs

1384
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:00,831
I'll tell you that just from you

1385
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:07,231
Yeah on this podcast as many times as it was said in Inglourious Basterds

1386
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,255
Already

1387
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,535
There's no other word

1388
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:14,655
Pejorative

1389
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:17,471
The only one I can think of that's worse than not

1390
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,239
Except

1391
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,519
Double knot

1392
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:23,103
Nothing nothing nothing

1393
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:26,175
Little Caesars

1394
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:31,039
We made a big deal

1395
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,575
I think you realize I'm like

1396
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,855
You f***** up at this parade

1397
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:34,623
And then

1398
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:36,927
I can't I can't

1399
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:40,255
I can't cancel the right type

1400
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:42,559
That's a p**** move right there it is

1401
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:45,631
So anyway Alex

1402
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:48,959
Kegel muscles

1403
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:54,335
Alex finishes up his interview with him they talked about how they do have plans on the

1404
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:56,127
What streets Alex is going to join him

1405
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,687
Free speech thing

1406
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:04,063
Can't wait

1407
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,391
Then

1408
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,159
To his old tricks

1409
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:14,815
Vague f****** angry desperate

1410
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:15,583
New system

1411
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,863
Sounding new settings

1412
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,399
Launching new ships

1413
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:20,447
Washing new personalities

1414
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:23,007
Launching new movements

1415
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:26,591
I sincerely want to turn the tide

1416
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:31,199
Isn't it I have to get people to restrain themselves

1417
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,511
I want to do it very judiciously

1418
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:46,303
By the book by common law

1419
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,327
By the Constitution

1420
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:17,023
And here's the strange

1421
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:21,119
God is ascending Vengeance just get ready

1422
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:26,239
I'm not the one

1423
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:28,031
Why not

1424
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,079
How f****** scary is that laugh

1425
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:34,175
Yeah.

1426
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:36,991
Hahaha

1427
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:39,295
Usually gets to his role in the whole thing

1428
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,975
I'm just sure I'm only up here

1429
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:56,191
What the f***

1430
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:59,519
The shifting gears into reality in the war is coming against the

1431
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:01,567
Pedophile

1432
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,335
Toucan

1433
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,615
I agree

1434
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:05,407
I totally agree

1435
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:09,247
Yeah it's an if-then statement

1436
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:15,647
I feel like most of the people he wants to die though have 20 kids

1437
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,439
Personally killed and raped

1438
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,511
With Rome

1439
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:23,839
So after this after this

1440
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,423
He gets into a sentence

1441
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:31,007
I don't know I don't think you should be able to murder

1442
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:36,383
Nope

1443
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,663
Bad

1444
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:40,991
I'm going to even I'm going to agree with Alex

1445
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,343
Devil worshiper seem pretty cool

1446
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,111
Yeah I know

1447
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:50,719
So far they've done nothing but good in the world which is very

1448
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:54,047
Piles of dead kids and their base

1449
01:17:54,303 --> 01:18:00,447
For whatever may or may not exist

1450
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,215
You kill kids

1451
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:02,495
Bad

1452
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:07,359
Afura do you know what's the through-line

1453
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:09,919
Necessary

1454
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:12,991
I feel like that's the that's the part that you would

1455
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,271
Just being Satanist

1456
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,039
Fine

1457
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:17,087
Find

1458
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:21,951
Killing kids

1459
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:26,047
Alex Jones accidentally

1460
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:26,815
I think you meant to say this

1461
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:31,167
GM's of accidentally

1462
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,703
He doesn't does not mean to

1463
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:36,287
Accidentally says something that is quite literally black

1464
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:42,431
So right after talk about how God hears the screams of these children

1465
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:44,735
Literal black

1466
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:49,599
Those of you that have splice humans animals

1467
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:52,159
Chimera

1468
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:55,487
So that others fear ever doing what you've done

1469
01:18:56,767 --> 01:19:00,095
God

1470
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,119
Spider-Man

1471
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:05,727
No

1472
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,519
That's the last

1473
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:10,079
How God works

1474
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:16,479
I looked through the Bible as best I could to try and find any indication that

1475
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,759
Care about me you guys take it

1476
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,295
Yeah yeah I don't think

1477
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:22,111
Pretty sure Jesus take the wheel nut

1478
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:25,439
Jesus I'm still drunk but

1479
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:31,839
Quite literally the reverse is in the Bible

1480
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:33,375
Literally

1481
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:36,191
Going 100 mean we can take all the wacky

1482
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:42,591
The energy stuff but he says and that sort of bizarre religious bat he has it is very much.

1483
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:47,967
Zoroastrianism

1484
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:53,087
Like crystals like this dude is this is all over the place religion

1485
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:57,951
Religious stuff a little bit towards the end of the eclipse

1486
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:58,719
So we have

1487
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:01,023
Say something

1488
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,119
It's not racist

1489
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:07,167
Let's find out

1490
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:11,007
And in Europe now and they're trying to

1491
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:16,896
Trump's plan to reboot and then power of the third world

1492
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:24,320
I have a one-sided deal that helps third world

1493
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:28,672
We've been part of an economic War folks economy

1494
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:29,696
Yep

1495
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,384
Band needs to be a big liberal

1496
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:53,760
Loans to small businesses

1497
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:57,600
People oughta be kissing the feet of rum

1498
01:20:57,856 --> 01:21:00,672
If you want to be kissing is

1499
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:02,976
Kissing his feet

1500
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,256
Because

1501
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:09,120
These people are really committed

1502
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,912
Focus

1503
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:13,216
Straight nose

1504
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:19,360
100 Centigrade flashes of a picture of band and he looks like 3/4 around

1505
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:21,408
Picture of Bailey looks like

1506
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,176
Keys

1507
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:28,576
It looks like he's slowly turning into Jabba the Hutt he's got the bucolic knows that comes from drinking too much

1508
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:33,696
Trump is Trump is salacious crumb sitting on his shoulder

1509
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:38,048
But also like

1510
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:45,216
Black people should kiss Trump speech

1511
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:51,616
In there too

1512
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:00,832
The second half

1513
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:05,440
I think it would cut myself

1514
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,976
Because he thinks that

1515
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,536
Clearly because black

1516
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:11,072
People

1517
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:14,656
Enlarged margins because the Republicans

1518
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,424
Azar

1519
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:17,984
As we seen before giant f******

1520
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:18,752
Braces

1521
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:21,568
Yeah like there's no other there's no way around it

1522
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,152
GOP

1523
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,432
Your races

1524
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,456

You're supporting taking us back to some of the darker

1528
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:45,376
Just parts of American history

1529
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,472
Parts of f****** European history

1530
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:54,080
The guy who's going to put over the FDA doesn't think

1531
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:54,848
The drugs

1532
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:55,872
Reprove

1533
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:58,688

Made indications that they want to sell off publicly National Park

1537
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:15,840
We're going to go back

1538
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:20,448
Watch dark time

1539
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,984

1540
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:28,384

Is going to be really bad for schools but it's not going to matter cuz they'll be in the mine

1544
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:42,464
People eating

01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,232
Feudal law

1546
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,256
Can't believe

1547
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:51,936
That's how that's how we're going to deal with all three every morning I wake up and I open Twitter

1548
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:01,152

Voted for Hillary Clinton

1558
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:18,816
Yet somehow

1559
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,352
We're in The Darkest Timeline

1560
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:22,656
Like we're in The Darkest Timeline right

1561
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:23,424
Couldn't

1562
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:28,288
It would be worse than where we are right now

1563
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,056
In that interview with

1564
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:31,360

01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:38,528
You had an enemy in life how would you do

1569
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:39,296

1570
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:43,392

Nothing

1578
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,016
Different words about George Soros

1579
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:16,928
They're not they might be the mildest words I've ever heard

1580
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:21,024
Makes me right now

1581

A long shelf-life mine public

1587
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,096
A reaction

1588
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:59,168
He went on a 7-minute tirade about the

1589
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,448
Sickening

1590
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:04,288

No

1600
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,264
Well

1601
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,336
It could just be that he ran out of adjectives

1602
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,920
You know when you're when you're riding a really long piece

1603
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:42,944
And you start

1604
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:47,296
You know you start looking at all the words used in you realize oh I said

1605
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,320
I said

1606
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:52,416
Shitzu or sick of which we've heard

1607
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,952
In every single clip

1608
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:57,792
Pick up something

1609
01:26:58,048 --> 01:27:00,096
Momentum with words

1610
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:06,496
Episode

1611
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,776
He kept calling everything

1612
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:08,544
Powerful

1613
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:11,616
You talk too much

1614
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:14,176
He's such a malleable little stew

1615
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:18,784
Isn't he

1616
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,088
He said

1617
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:26,976
I talked myself into believing

1618
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:31,584
15 years from now he'll look back on this

1619
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:32,864
Nothing that I regret

1620
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:35,936
You know Trump

1621
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:40,032
I didn't have integrity be wildly optimistic

1622
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:40,800
Suggesting

1623
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:42,080
Any of us will be here

1624
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:45,408
I just want to crash and then we'll be coming back

1625
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:47,712
I don't know man

1626
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:49,248
I just don't know

1627
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:50,528
Like I said we're in the dark

1628
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,344
It could be 50

1629
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,624
It could be

1630
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,392
Could be the

1631
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,440
And believe me

1632
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,232
I don't think any of us

1633
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:02,816
You mean Alex I don't think

1634
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:06,144
Galaxy out

01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,704
Going to die because we have no resources

1636
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,520
No resources

1637
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,568

1640
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,896

1642
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:22,784

1643
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,832
Definitely could

1644
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:31,232
Anywhere Kickstarter to move us.

01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:44,032
If enough people to eat at me

01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:46,592
I will start that pic starter as a ghost

1649
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:50,432
You are really hammering home that you are

1650
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:53,248
I really do

1651
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:55,552
We need more we need to show to spread

1652
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,112
We need to spread

1653
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:59,136
But we needed to do better

1654
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:03,232
I'm not going to sell you survival gear fake pills but it'll be

1655

Retwist

1658
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:13,216
I'm just not used to being this boldface

1659
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:21,920
You can follow us on

1660
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:24,992
You're going to have to give us

01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:26,528
You know you're going to have to give people in a

1662
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:34,976
Open Dan to make sure that he doesn't have a stroke of sad

1663
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:35,744

Treated me with Alex's handle

1671
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:01,856
Someone kidnapped

1672
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,000
I would love it if I was listening one day

1673
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:15,936

We got one more clip

1676
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:30,784
This is also another thing that I think is

1677
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:33,856
Bordering on a psychotic break

1678
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,648
Start

1679
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:39,744

So far

1685
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:59,968
In the time that we started this

1686
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,248
Seems like

1687
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:04,064
Alex has gone crazy even by his own

1688
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:07,904
Crazy like

1689
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,696
Do you think he's going to pull it back

1690
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:10,464
Or do you think

1691
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,232
He's going to lose

1692
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,280

To keep spiraling into crazy right even for a second the whole thing

1697
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:26,336
The show that he did over the weekend

1698

01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:37,088
I know I just think that he is a a

1703
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:39,904
Spinning spider as they say

1704
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:43,744
Whatever you say is is b*******

1705
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:47,072
Sure I don't I don't care to give him any

1706
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,864
I don't want his voice on my

1707
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:53,728
But he and Alex were talking about

1708
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:04,736
I could not make it through without crying

1709
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:06,528
Yeah but

1710
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,368
The he was on and they were talking about how their leak

1711
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:12,160
Coming out of the Trump White House

1712
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:14,208
And basically what they were saying is there's the

1713
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:14,976
The Bandit

1714
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,000
Overworld

1715
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:17,536
And you know General

1716
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:18,560
Flint neighborhood

1717
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:19,584
Trump people

1718
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,376
Got it then you got people like

1719
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:25,216
Andre

1720
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:25,984
The ship

1721
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,288
20 days in

1722
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:30,080
They've already decided that

1723
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:31,616
Internally there are enemy

1724
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:33,664
So like

1725
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:40,064
They can't even blame the Liberals

1726
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:46,208
It really destroy the media necessarily

1727
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:49,792
To eat themselves alive and that is

1728
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,328
No the next stage of

1729
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:52,608
And then what

1730
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,680
Start not trusting yourself

1731
01:32:58,752 --> 01:32:59,776
Situation where

1732
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,056
Your

1733
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:03,872
Your entire thing is built on distrust

1734
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:04,896
You know

1735
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:06,688
The more the more you

1736
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,992
The more you desire purity of Belize

1737
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:12,832
The more you start tearing people away

1738
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:20,000
Yeah you show even the slightest bit of disloyalty to Scientology

1739
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:22,304
And you are a missing person

1740
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:26,400
It has

1741
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:28,704
Purity Bass

1742
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:31,520
Religion or ideology or whatever

1743
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:33,568
Religion

1744
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:35,360
With sinners

1745
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:40,736
So what we're saying is

1746
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:44,320
Just about all religions betray their own beliefs by there

1747
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:49,696
Somewhat I believe if I'm not mistaken of starts

1748
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:51,488
Gruesome wacky shirt about football

1749
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:55,328
Amanda leads into

1750
01:33:56,864 --> 01:34:03,008
Is not a Christian

1751
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,592
You know the beliefs that he started espousing

1752
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:09,408
The sort of out there

1753
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,992
12 dimensional multi-dimensional yeah

1754
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:14,528
Some of that stuff has

1755
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:17,088
You never talked about it

1756
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:17,856
It's bleeding

1757
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,136
Yeah it's bleeding through

1758
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,672
Okay

1759
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:29,376
Today how they're saying it's white supremacist because there's a few

1760
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:38,336
He did get into it earlier by the way

1761
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:40,128
Can we just let it go

1762
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:43,200
Well it's all look I'll just be like hey the paper

1763
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:47,552
Who won the Super Bowl airing on white supremacy at all let's just leave the

1764
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:51,392
Reacting to something

1765
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:54,720
What was Richard Spencer

1766
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,840

1768
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,448
Let's play

1769
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:10,848
Punch Richard Spencer Twitter

1770
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:12,640
Richard Spencer

1771
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:14,432
F****** racist is she

1772
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:16,480
No one was really saying

1773
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:19,808
Hey this is racist because they have a white quarterback

1774
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:21,088
No nobody

1775
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:23,136
Let's all just be like hey

1776
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:26,208
Education

1777
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:26,976
Secretary

1778
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:29,280
Football team

1779
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:31,072
One f****** anything

1780
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:33,376
It's a petty squabble

1781
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:34,144
Petit pois

1782
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:35,424
Meant to distract us

1783
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:42,848
We have a good quarterback

1784
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,384
Good receiver

1785
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:57,440
But that's what they're doing

1786
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:00,000
It's not what they're doing

1787
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:10,496
You shouldn't

1788
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:15,360
It's not true this stuff is so obvious it's like I've have eyesight

1789
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:18,176
And the General Public

1790
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:24,320
I'm awake on this planet exists inside of eyesight I have touch I have some a liability

1791
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:26,624
Plane

1792
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:32,000
No there there

1793
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:35,584
Trying to wake him up so you have goggles on

1794
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:36,608
You can't wait

1795
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:37,632
Somebody up

1796
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:45,056
Mega

1797
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:57,600
They got blinders on

1798
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,624
They don't want your help

1799
01:36:59,136 --> 01:36:59,904
Watch

1800
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:02,720
I'll just take one goggles off and say you're a bad guy

1801
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,584
You don't want to give them shot

1802
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:09,120
Their profane

1803
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:13,984
So this this is a paranoid fantasy

1804
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,776
Mixed with Plato's allegory of

1805
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,336
Sync

1806
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,360
This makes

1807
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:20,384
Zero cents

1808
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:27,552
You don't think it's just sort of a bizarre sort of psychotic version of the allegory of the cave

1809
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:29,344
Philosophy 101

1810
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,648
Proto

1811
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:32,928
It doesn't make any sense

1812
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,464
Of course not

1813
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,768
F****** in sex

1814
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:38,304
What

1815
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,352
What weight

1816
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:42,656
Wake somebody up out of

1817
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:43,680
That's not how blind

1818
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:46,752
Note episode of House

1819
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:51,104
But it was also everything

1820
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:53,408
His house is basically

1821
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,688
Episode of House

1822
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:56,736
In order to see this patient

1823
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:58,016
House will have

1824
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,040
Kill her

1825
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:02,368
That was a real promo

1826
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,392
Do the great Epic

1827
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:05,952
I love how

1828
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:12,096
Houses basically where Alex gets all of his ideas of right

1829
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:18,496
Greg Gregory House

1830
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:20,032
Does not

1831
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:23,104
But anyway

1832
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,808
I don't know where ever going to

1833
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:33,856
Deal with it but on Tuesdays show

1834
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:38,208
He starts to show you his grandmother was before

1835
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:38,976
Just passed away

1836
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,280
Sweet

1837
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:42,816
It's nice you know like

1838
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:44,096
Those human moments

1839
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:48,960
He's a human being all the time

1840
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:55,104
But then within a minute of starting the show talk about his grandma

1841
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,152
He talks about her getting a vaccine

1842
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:58,688
And how that was a soft

1843
01:38:58,944 --> 01:38:59,456
Kill

1844
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:00,224
On her

1845
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:04,064
And she lived through like all these years after getting this back

1846
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,856
Polio vaccine

1847
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,904
Did she get polio

1848
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,208
I don't think so use this whole like

1849
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:11,744
This is Grandma's death

1850
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:13,536
In order to sort of

1851
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:14,304
Espouse

1852
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,328
Anti-vaccine

1853
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:22,240
Human feelings for him at all

1854
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:24,800
The humanity out of

1855
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:33,248
I'm going to kill people does he talk about his daughter loving is Cookie Monster

1856
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:35,296
I was talking about

1857
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:38,880
Nuclear war

1858
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:41,696
Uniworld

1859
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:42,464
Everyone

1860
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:43,744
Killed by

1861
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:45,792
I bet this

1862
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:48,096
Allegory of the cave ripoff

1863
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:51,936
Pretty insane you're right but it's going to get a little bit more

1864
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:55,008
They don't deserve the site

1865
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:08,320
There's a lot of things that happened I'll never tell anybody about

1866
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:11,136
Is he

1867
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:14,976
But I was just tell you there's a lot going on this universe not books

1868
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:17,792
Elite know all this stuff

1869
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,072
They know it

1870
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:21,376
And they don't want you to know

1871
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:24,448
You're like a composite of all

1872
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,984
Wait was he talking about

1873
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:29,056
The elites know the stuff that's not in the books

1874
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:32,128
Like the religious books like the Bible

1875
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:36,992
Confused

1876
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:39,040
We talked about the elites know stuff that

1877
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:39,808
So he's

1878
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,344
Ostensibly

1879
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,624
Espousing Christian beliefs

1880
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:45,952
Somewhat yeah and there's a lot of stuff in those

1881
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,488
In the Bible

1882
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:49,280
That they

1883
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:50,560
Don't tell you though

1884
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:52,352
Well I mean if you want to just

1885
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:55,424
Like take a really simplistic person I don't think this is what he saying

1886
01:40:57,216 --> 01:41:00,544
Gospel

1887
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:02,848
Not all of them

1888
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:06,432
Some good but if you read like those extra biblical text

1889
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:09,248
Bunch of books that aren't in the Bible

1890
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:15,648
Pretty wild stuff

1891
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:19,232
Enoch Enoch goes up to heaven with God and he never dies and

1892
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:25,888
Joseph Brothers there's a bunch of stuff in other text

1893
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:27,680
People have never died

1894
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:32,032
Simple version of it

1895
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,080
I don't think that's what he's talking about

1896
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:40,224
Yeah that's somehow the elites know more about

1897
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:42,784
Metaphysical beliefs

1898
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:43,552
Of

1899
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:48,672
It's too heavy

1900
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:49,696
About all that

1901
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:53,792
Just say something

1902
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:58,400
Some of it I agree with and

1903
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:03,520
Joe and will have to sit out after he's done

1904
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:07,360
Kind of trippy

1905
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:08,896
Search

1906
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:09,920
Complete

1907
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:12,480
Contradictory nonsense man it is

1908
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:18,112
This is where we started this I thought we were going to get

1909
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:20,160
I thought we were going to run out because

1910
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:22,208
Everyday

1911
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:25,024
Time we listen to him there's a new facet of

1912
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:28,864
Theory

1913
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:32,704
It's not a secret I want to like

1914
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,472
I want to love

1915
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,776
And then like maybe

1916
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:37,568
One night while we're asleep

1917
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:38,336
Sleep in bed together

1918
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:42,432
While wearing a globalist

1919
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:45,248
Like in the movie The Purge

1920
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:48,832
The only way that I was regular prime or legal for 12

1921
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:50,880
Which might be soon

1922
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:58,560
Again if we're going to go crazy might as well just f****** go all in

1923
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:01,120
Is

1924
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:02,912
That

1925
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:04,448
Alex went on Rogan

1926
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:05,728
Michelle

1927
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:08,800
The trippy s*** he was saying

1928
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,080
Alright I realize

1929
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:11,872
Oh I can cater to

1930
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:12,640
Assertive

1931
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:14,432
Shroom heads out there

1932
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:18,016
He has already called trendy

1933
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,112
2 sticker

1934
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:26,720
Yeah yeah

1935
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:32,608
If you want to go to church and let's B'Elanna and let's go to

1936
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:33,632
12

1937
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:34,656
Dementia

1938
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:36,192
Again I have to save it

1939
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:37,216
Some of this stuff

1940
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:39,264
Some of the stuff he's going to say

1941
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:40,544
I meant

1942
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,824
Okay

1943
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:48,224
I'm not

1944
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:52,320
Keep notes

1945
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:56,416
Before you in the human Journey

1946
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:57,440
And their genetics

1947
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:04,096
Access all of that and the enemy knows that

1948
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:11,520
How they've confirmed

1949
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:15,104
The trees have fungus net worth of the trees communicate with trees

1950
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,152
Hundreds of miles away

1951
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:18,432
Underground

1952
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:19,968
Internet of Things

1953
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:23,296
Of course I show you that movie Avatar 2 years ago

1954
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:32,000
And the global artificial system

1955
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:37,888
Ancestral memory

1956
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,720
All this stuff should be no

1957
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:10,656
And I'm certainly

1958
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:14,752
Play games with people

1959
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:23,712
I got a loaded phones here but I'm sorry I'm out of time no pressure on David if you want to flush him out of hand of the great people

1960
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:27,552
So also I want to say this before you get to your

1961
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:29,088
Potomac

1962
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:37,792
At about 1 our 6-minute Mark of the show he announces the lines are open is going to start taking calls

1963
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,328
I'd like you to guess

1964
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,864
What timestamp

1965
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:41,632
Pocky sticks

1966
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:47,264
He takes to call

1967
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:51,616
Let's go with the first 12 hours and

1968
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:52,384
20 minutes

1969
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:54,944
1 hour and 31 minutes

1970
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:58,272
Only a half-hour after he open the floor

1971
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:01,088
And then it was only if I

1972
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:02,624
I don't know

1973
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,952
45 second call was just saying

1974
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:08,768
The globalist

1975
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:15,168
You communicated with I think so

1976
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:16,704
Had a listener who disagreed

1977
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:23,104
I know you mentioned that

1978
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,128
You know what

1979
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:25,664
This is Alex

1980
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:33,856
Let's talk about it

1981
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:40,768
I disagree with you I think it would be important for you to be in the White House

1982
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:43,328
I disagree

1983
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:48,960
You're better than you think you are wonderful

1984
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:50,752
That's the only push back

1985
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:55,616
I've heard from any caller anyway what are your predictions about 3

1986
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:57,152
Did you love the tone

1987
01:46:57,664 --> 01:46:58,944
That's all the positive

1988
01:46:59,200 --> 01:46:59,712
Call

1989
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,296
Here's a thought

1990
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:07,136
It sounded like he was in a sleeping bag with me

1991
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:11,744
In the forest

1992
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,816
Ohio mushrooms

1993
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:16,864
The conversation starts with

1994
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:18,144
Hey Alex

1995
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:19,936
Do you believe in

1996
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,472
Now

1997
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:25,056
And now let's get into ancestral memory

1998
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:29,920
Yeah I agree that genetic memory

1999
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:39,648
Trees do have an underground fungal Network and that if

2000
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:40,416
Future

2001
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:43,232
Miles away

2002
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:46,304
Instantly the other trees will know somebody

2003
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:51,424
It is true that

2004
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:53,984
Brighten every Rock and every creature in every

2005
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:57,824
Forest

2006
01:47:58,848 --> 01:47:59,360
No

2007
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:03,712
I'm not sure I understand

2008
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:06,272
Communication

2009
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:08,064
What's going on with that

2010
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,856
Some sort of a transmission that is true

2011
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:11,392
I think there is a

2012
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,672
Basic level of conscious

2013
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:15,488
Implied

2014
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:19,584
New release

2015
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:20,608
Not you

2016
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:25,728
This smells the oils and Olive

2017
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:31,872
I do kind of think there's a base level Consciousness Within

2018
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:33,408
Most

2019
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:34,176
Plan

2020
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:35,200
Dances well

2021
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:45,184
But it's unclear whether it's a breathing carbon dioxide on them or so

2022
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:49,280
Either so it's so hard to isolate any Ella bright

2023
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:50,560
Prove or disprove any

2024
01:48:52,096 --> 01:48:53,888
Which to me means

2025
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:55,680
That no matter what you do

2026
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:56,960
No matter what you eat

2027
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:59,264
You are killing something that is alive

2028
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,032
And is aware and is

2029
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:00,800
Screaming is it

2030
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:03,360
Unless you're one of those who only eats

2031
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:05,152
The fruits that have already fallen off

2032
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:06,176
Stats

2033
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:11,552
There are those people I don't know exactly what their children

2034
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:13,088
Means those are abortions

2035
01:49:13,344 --> 01:49:15,392
If you eat it going

2036
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:17,440
Fruit

2037
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,744
Depends on the

2038
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,840
Morphic knowledge

2039
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:25,888
Was that mean

2040
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:27,424
There's an internet

2041
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:31,264
Documents

2042
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:33,568
Not sure on that one

2043
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:36,896
Well the theory behind acknowledge is

2044
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:40,480
Like they observed that I want to say like

2045
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:41,760
A couple of

2046
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:43,808
Island

2047
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:46,880
A species of bird would suddenly

2048
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:47,648
Figure out

2049
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:49,696
How do you say

2050
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:50,464
To get to some

2051
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:52,768
And then within a week

2052
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:53,536
Even though there's been

2053
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:54,816
No contact

2054
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:56,352
That same species

2055
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:57,376
Somewhere else

2056
01:49:57,888 --> 01:49:58,400
Would have

2057
01:49:58,656 --> 01:49:59,424
The same sure

2058
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,960
Exact humans

2059
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:05,568
The studies that have been done about like old crossword puzzles being easier than new one

2060
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:09,408
Is there a morph acknowledge that we all share

2061
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,944
I'm going to go with

2062
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:12,736
It's fun to think about

2063
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:14,528
But I'm not sure that

2064
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:17,344
Mmm another step

2065
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:20,160
Even trip.

2066
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:22,976
Like lucid dreaming where people

2067
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:26,304
There are indications that people are able to dream together

2068
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:28,608
Which written test practice

2069
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:35,520
Also Fitz

2070
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:37,312
It's not clear

2071
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:38,336
I don't know if I

2072
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:39,872
Their methodology

2073
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:40,896
And I don't

2074
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:43,968
I certainly never had any experience like that but

2075
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:49,344
It is interesting to think about I'm not sure I believe it I'm going to go

2076
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:53,696
Acknowledge

2077
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:56,256
Put myself firmly in the no column

2078
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:57,792
The next one

2079
01:50:58,048 --> 01:50:59,328
Ancestral memories

2080
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,120
Rape

2081
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:02,912
Genetic

2082
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:03,936
Shut that goes back

2083
01:51:04,192 --> 01:51:04,960
Back to instinct

2084
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:12,896
From from bygone eras were afraid of monsters because of like

2085
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:14,688
He also brought up the

2086
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:17,504
The idea of the wolf you are little kid with

2087
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,272
With an old man

2088
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:19,808
I think that was

2089
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:22,368
The separate thoughts

2090
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:29,024
There was a pause and I thought

2091
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:32,352
Isaac that was Benjamin Button

2092
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:38,240
That I don't know if you believe or not

2093
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:39,776
It is

2094
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:43,360
He knows all about it you missed one

2095
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:49,760
What was that

2096
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:52,576
What that one go

2097
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:53,600
Came from

2098
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:55,136
True where do you think

2099
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:57,184
Imagination

2100
01:51:57,696 --> 01:51:58,976
Jerk

2101
01:51:59,232 --> 01:51:59,744
Creativity

2102
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,840
I think is one potato

2103
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:04,864
Especially because

2104
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:06,144
He's still obsessed

2105
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:06,912
Please

2106
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:08,960
Every single

2107
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,776
He thinks is something that

2108
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:12,544
Has actual

2109
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:15,104
He's trying to send a message

2110
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:20,224
Right

2111
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:22,016
Comes back to what

2112
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:25,856
And that is the culture and movies and all that stuff is

2113
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:26,624
What's

2114
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:27,648
Do program

2115
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:30,208
So something comes out in a movie

2116
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:31,488
Super true

2117
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:34,304
Powers that be don't want you to think

2118
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:37,632
Think it's true

2119
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:39,936
That stupid movie

2120
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:44,032
Yeah that is

2121
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:44,800
That is a

2122
01:52:45,056 --> 01:52:45,824
Really impossible

2123
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:49,152
Mainly because

2124
01:52:50,176 --> 01:52:53,504
That's what most conspiracy theory stuff comes down

2125
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,552
Wildly unprovable

2126
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:00,160
I meant

2127
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:06,816
The old Carl Sagan

2128
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:09,376
Anika where the woman came up to

2129
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:13,216
There's a turtle underneath the Earth holding it up

2130
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,544
She's like a bigger turtle

2131
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:19,872
What's below that any Turtles all the way down

2132
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:20,640

2133
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:22,176
There are you

2134
01:53:22,432 --> 01:53:23,712
Right

2135
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:25,504
To be an infinite Loop of

2136
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:26,784
You'll never

2137
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:30,368
Where's your mother

2138
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:33,184
And I've noticed turtle

2139
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:37,024

2141
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:43,936
Question you missed one do you believe this

2142
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:47,008
I'm a policy wonk

2143
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:53,152
By far the greatest thing

2144
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:57,760
Whatever happened

2145
01:53:58,016 --> 01:54:02,624
Violin entire like morning Zoo crew bump level

2146
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:06,720
Missy said 10 Missy's dead ones

2147
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:11,328
I love you you're like a doctor

2148
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:17,728
