Dan  00:58
Hey, everybody, welcome back and I'll try to sit around the altar of saline and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

Jordan  01:06
Oh, indeed. We are Dan Jordan. Dan, Jordanne quick question for you. What's your spot today?

Dan  01:12
But calm with me and us? Uh huh. Bright Spot. I didn't prepare.

Jordan  01:18
I was gonna say you're you're you're waiting for you to run out of gas on this one. That's why

Dan  01:23
my bright spot you're so my Wonka games are paying. The first golden ticket button has been found. Ooh, ah, it was found by Juniper in Vermont today. So congratulations, juniper. This is very, very exciting. I can't wait to see where these other ones turn up. Yeah, because I am not rigging this thing. I'm not. I have. As you can see, there's like boxes of buttons. And I'm putting them in bags. And then just taking them out. Yeah, taking the bags, putting them in the envelope. could go anywhere. He's got buttons going to Japan, we've got too many buttons, Scotland, we got to move to Scotland. I love us.

Jordan  02:06
I'm waiting for you to have to hire somebody whose eyes are sewn shut who's who's lost feeling in their fingers in order to choose the correct button. I have put them in the right place.

Dan  02:16
I have a non problematic team of

Jordan  02:21
like a Yakuza boss.

Dan  02:24
So that's very, very exciting. And you know, as a part of this, I want to say to Juniper, brother gratulations. Well, the brother John just got laid off. Oh, she and I want to take this opportunity to say chin up John. Can you keep keep yourself on the on the good spirits high? Yeah. You know, hey, bad times when you lose a job, right? being unemployed sucks.

Jordan  02:52
Unfortunately, our golden tickets don't wind up with you owning a factor. No, that is not a thing. We are not job creators.

Dan  02:58
I wish I could give you a button factory or a candy factory or whatever. Right? But hey, I think that when I look back on my life, a lot of times there were times that I lost jobs and it felt like the worst thing in the fucking world. But it ended up being positive. Yeah, eventually Yeah. You know you find you find some brother job and maybe you never would have had the opportunity to find that other better job later. Sure. So John, keep keep your eyes

Jordan  03:30
I have no idea why that like came about.

Dan  03:33
Well, it's because I am not somebody who's good at expressing optimism. No, no, no, I

Jordan  03:36
understand. on a deep level, things will get the same John things will maintain or get worse.

Alex Jones  03:45
Oh boy.

Dan  03:46
Great message. Yeah. gratulations juniper. Jordan, what's your price?

Jordan  03:52
By brightspot? I'm gonna keep with the theme of cartoons. Harley Quinn just finished its third season and it's a really good cartoon. Start from this place. Like imagine the old classic Batman The Animated Series with Kevin Conroy? Sure. One of the best cartoons of all time. Yeah, fantastic

Dan  04:11
real just legendary art styles. You just totally could just see it.

Jordan  04:15
Yeah, the whole thing imagine if you started with that show, but from the premise that we have landed on now where Batman is a billionaire destroying the world by using his money only to serve his weird game right right right so start from that point of view and then make Batman The Animated Series fantastic. It's really really great Batman is a piece of shit like it's it's so good Commissioner Gordon is the absolute worst a cab all day

Dan  04:43
oh man like it is

Jordan  04:44
it is a very

Dan  04:46
It sounds. I rarely check things out but maybe I will check that out because that vibe sounds. The only problem that I have. I have not seen this show. So I'm not entirely sure but sure. There's a pervy preoccupation with Harley Quinn. In that I'm not Oh, totally, totally, you know what I mean? Yeah.

Jordan  05:02
And and the centerpiece is a relationship between her and poison ivy, which people have taken to creepy. But I would argue that it's actually been way more of just a positive representation, kind of

Dan  05:14
not always the creator's intent and the source material isn't always the problem.

Jordan  05:19
Absolutely. No, you're not wrong. You are not wrong. But yeah. Ron Funches is in it. He's a great voice. He's fantastic. That's great. It's great show. Alright, check it out. Sure. Yeah.

Dan  05:31
So Jordan, today we have what was not a great show. That is Alex's show, and also Alex's trial, oh, Connecticut, to discuss. So we're gonna be talking about the 13th and 14th, which is Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, we're gonna talk a little bit about the court case, we're gonna listen to a little bit of some, some clips. And then Alex's shows from those days, and get a little sense of what he's up to. Well, all this is going down.

Jordan  05:59
I bet he's comporting. himself with a certain level of respect that he hasn't shown in the past, right?

Dan  06:06
Yeah, man, he's classy. But before before we get into anything, and even before we talk about the walks, I wanted to say, we don't really talk about this, like sort of logistical stuff on air all that much. But, you know, today, we were set to record at a certain point, and I needed to push back half an hour. And Jordan, you accommodate me when these things come up from time to time? And I really just wanted to say,

Jordan  06:33
nope, nope.

Unknown Speaker  06:36
I just wanted to say, thank you, Jordan.

Jordan  06:42
I really, really, really don't appreciate because eventually Alex will be gone and all that will be left is your soundboard. I mean, here's what's gonna happen. We're gonna return to the beginning. Eventually, there will be 50 people listening, because it's just gonna be you and me is old men with you just playing sound bites that does giggling

Dan  07:02
it's possible. Yeah, that's the goal. Yes. And goal. You really thought I was going somewhere sincere with that, didn't you? I did. Did it tell a turn

Jordan  07:12
all over that it was all over.

Dan  07:15
But I thank you for accommodating my time schedule anyway. Sure. Yeah. So we got an episode to do but first, let's say hello to some new laws. It's a great idea. So first, Bobby, aka the other Shane, thank you so much for now policy while I'm a policy wonk, thank

Dan  08:13
Thank you. And we got a couple of technocrats here to it. So first, squid says no heroes, the worn out technocrat, and this I'm delayed on this. And I'm very sorry about that. But Marcy the Wabi bear, thank you so much. You are now a technocrat.

Alex Jones  08:31
I'm a policy wonk. I have risen above my enemies. I might quit tomorrow. Actually. I'm just gonna take a little break now. A little breaky for me. And then we're going to come back. And I'm going to start the show over, but I'm the devil a lot going on there. I'll fuck you. Fuck you. I got plenty of words for you. But at the end of the day, Fuck you and your new world order. And fuck the horse she wrote in on and all your shit. Maybe today's Kabbalists broadcast. Maybe I'll just be gone a month, maybe five years. Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow. And you never see me again. That's really what I want to do. I never want to come back here again. I apologize to the crew and the listeners yesterday that I was legitimately having breakdowns on air. I'll be better tomorrow.

Jordan  09:25
He's not No, I didn't think so.

Dan  09:27
So, Jordan, I wanted to say like, we got the Connecticut case started. Sure. And we've been watching the stream and texting back and forth quite a bit.

Jordan  09:39
I think we were both came into this with the plan of like, I don't know if I'm gonna watch the whole thing this time. And yeah, we've basically been saying because it's a

Dan  09:47
little bit different. I actually, I would say for my defense. I came in with the perspective of I don't want to do this again. Last time was a lot Andrew I was very concerned about redundancy, like things being like, Oh, this is the same thing again. Right. But it's it's not it's a different it's a different beast. It is in the Austin situation. First, there's a lot more plaintiffs. Second, the case accuses Alex of slightly different violations and has a bit more to do with the business end of his his operations. So there's a bit more there a bit more meat that you can look at. Then third, and most importantly, Norm Pattice is a completely different brand of lawyer than ravenol. Oh, yeah. Alex has representation in Texas. Yep. We've long wondered why. It is exactly that norm is Alex's lawyer. He seems like a mope generally and he's a really embarrassing loser outside the courtroom what with his stand up adventure, which was actually so bad that there's no need to list a second thing here and then

Jordan  10:49
oh, no, that's the real bad yeah, once you do that, you're that forever should get woke insurance. It's a little bit it's a you know, like, Oh, I've been a bricklayer for 30 years, but you fuck one monkey and they call you a monkey fucker. Jim, you know, they never call you a bricklayer? Jim, they

Dan  11:04
call you pants down racial slur. Exactly. Yes, exactly. Norm gets paid because he will do anything. He's a mercenary with a law degree and he doesn't give a shit how awful the things he's saying sound or who they hurt. That became crystal clear on day one. And it really gave me a sense that as bad as Alex's lawyer wasn't Austin, he at least had some boundaries. It didn't seem like it at the time until I saw norm and realized how shitty Raynal could have been if he had wanted to eight is crazy. So we're gonna start today by looking a bit at norms opening statement and a couple particularly shitty things that happened and then we're gonna tune in to see what Alex was doing while this was happening

Jordan  11:44
simultaneously. Yeah, yes. It's always good. Whenever there is simultaneous, like you can put up side by side broadcasts of being sued into oblivion, and a man being like, we're winning there our asses off. Yeah,

Dan  11:58
things are pretty good. All things considered, things

Unknown Speaker  12:01
are great. Also,

Dan  12:03
there's a tweet I want.

Jordan  12:05
That's absolutely the most important to eat fine.

Alex Jones  12:07
Yeah.

Dan  12:08
So here is a little bit from norms opening and the sound isn't great on this. I have to say there's there's a, you know, it's from the law and share law and crime.

Jordan  12:19
Yeah, I think it's not law and order.

Dan  12:23
But there's like some sort of room tone.

Jordan  12:27
Yeah, there's some artifacts. Yeah.

Norm Pattis  12:29
Your job is to decide if Um, Mr. Jones is responsible for all they are claiming. In other words, we claim their claims are exaggerated. And if they can prove to you that he's causing them all the arm Bitcoins, and give them a something to compensate for them for that. They've suggested Your job is to punish Alex Jones can hear from the judge. They hate him because he says outrageous things. And the haters wanting to silence. Each of you has chosen to be here today to compensate them for their grief. And you're being asked to make an F an example of Alex money is their weapon of choice award enough that you might Summon, or you might silence Alex Jones. He was mocked. They're coming they're coming. They're coming. planets and their consoles are here.

Dan  13:25
That's wild. First of all, just being so blunt as to be like we're just gonna say their claims are exaggerated.

Jordan  13:32
Yeah, that's a listen. Last time we tried to Red Pill the jury and say that maybe we didn't actually do it. And this time we're like a share. We did it. Fuck yeah, we did it. We're already guilty. But it wasn't that bad. Oh, come on. It is the come on

Dan  13:47
defense. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I think it takes a certain level of callow madness to do to say something like that out loud. Yeah, one of the things that I noticed is the norm did have a bit of a faulty delivery. There was moments where it almost felt like he was thinking am I gonna say this? But I might be attributing that to him unfairly based on what he had like the way he ends up comported Sure, sure. I don't believe he was like worried about saying these No, no, he was underprepared. Right

Jordan  14:21
right. I mean in my in my thought process I didn't see that so much is comes razor told me that like he's he's just kind of winging it. A little bit

Dan  14:32
of stand up. Delivery is not great. Throwing it. He doesn't have much. Yeah. So Norm does, he does make basically this accusation that they're partisan hacks. The plaintiffs. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  14:46
Why these parents? Why? Why not the children of the others who never filed suit in Connecticut or Texas. You will learn that each of the parents and family members here transform their grief and rage over the death of a loved one. into a powerful and effective mode of gun violence, promoting school safety. And who can blame? Who can blame their members of interest groups? They hold vigils, they testified before Congress and state lawmakers. They've become partisans. They've walked into a divisive debate about guns in the Second Amendment, the extent to which the state should be more aggressive in making a state permit. Do they overstate the harm that Alex caused them? Because they want to silence him for political reasons? Because he disagrees with their point of view. I would suggest you that is the case he will argue that they are objection. Sustained.

Jordan  15:41
Oh, Your Honor. Okay. So yes, my client murdered this person, but he did. We saw the evidence. He did fight back. Is he a victim? Obviously not.

Dan  15:52
There is a basically, Ken, what he's putting forth here is is essentially saying that they put themselves in the arena of just Alex's words, more or less, absolutely. With Ray No, there was there was a sense that it's like, alright, this is a guy who's taking direction from Alex, trying to do something like a lawyer. With norm it really feels like all right, yeah, I'm gonna use Alex's shit with the law stuff. Yep. Just gonna swing as hard and in the direction Alex wants, and I'm gonna use the words and tactics that I've learned in law school. Yeah,

Jordan  16:27
yeah, no fucked up. It felt like Ray Now was trying to transmute Alex's bullshit into something that you could pass in a courtroom. And norm is like, you just put a powdered wig on Alex is absolutely nervous. Just like, hey, guess what? I'm a barrister. And I'm gonna say some bullshit. That's what's gonna happen. Yeah, Jesus,

Dan  16:49
it is a mess. Yeah, it's

Jordan  16:51
not great.

Dan  16:52
I think that this also is inappropriate for the damages portion, which is obviously why we have some of these objections, which is Chris Mehdi, the plaintiff's lawyer here is contesting This is an attempt to unravel the the default judgment. Absolutely. Yeah. Re litigated in a place where it is inappropriate.

Jordan  17:15
It is a bit like No, no, no, Your Honor. See, he's a public figure. No, no, we're past that.

Dan  17:22
Yeah. And so norm continues to behave poorly after the sidebar.

Unknown Speaker  17:27
Our contention to be clear, is that the damage claims here are exaggerated. But the big idiosyncratic motives of the plaintiffs transforming their briefs into political weapons, you'll have to decide whether that's true. Here's what you learned in 2016, Ellis Jones became a household name again, when a presidential candidate used him to berate her opponents and talked about Sandy Hook. Hillary Clinton. She never got sued. Objection, Your Honor. Sustained right off this police sustained move on to Tony Perez, please. How many times did you notice? The times I objected to telling you letting them

Unknown Speaker  18:07
tell their story, Attorney

Dan  18:10
improper and either finish your opening or be seated. That was in his opening statement. As I was watching, I was like, this is going to be bad. Yeah, this whole thing is going to be bad. Yep. Based on norms behavior. He clearly knows that this isn't appropriate. And then his How many times did I object like that kind of a response in open court is like this guy is unhinged. Yeah. This could go any number of directions. I do. As I described it. To someone. I don't feel safe when I'm watching. Not that there's any threat to me personally, but I feel unwell. Like I'm not in good hands.

Jordan  18:53
Yeah. Yeah, there is. You know, I appreciate how willing everyone else in the courtroom is to abide by like the, oh, I can't wear shorts, you know, like that kind of shit. And he's just walking out here. Like, do you hear how many times I fucking objected? How about that shit judge? Like, I mean, it's bananas. How disrespectful he is. Yeah. to the judge. It's, it's wild. Yeah.

Dan  19:17
And I mean, we'll talk about that a little bit more later. But sure, you know, on the second day, he wasn't standing up to make objection so funny. And like he had to be scolded about that, which is I mean, that is a huge disrespect to the court. I mean, I think some of the core procedures stuff is a little bit silly from the outside hilariously stupid, right? Yeah. But you've agreed to exist within this space. You are a lawyer, you know the rules. And part of the rules are you respect the fucking court?

Jordan  19:48
Yeah. This is I mean, listen, I'm on your team. If you want to be like, hey, standing up to object is fucking stupid. We're all sitting down here. This is fine. If you want to argue that I'm on your team, we're past the time, though. You've already been in court for hours.

Dan  20:07
A different setting. I'm here that argument totally. Of all about it. Yeah, sure. It's too late. Now this it's bizarre the way we do this stuff. And I'm not entirely sure why we do great.

Jordan  20:19
If we're in the middle of a water slide, you're like, maybe we should add water to this. You're already halfway down mad. Yeah,

Dan  20:24
that's on you. Yeah. So he's been scolded about the Hillary Clinton angle. So he tries another one. Yep. Either

Judge Bellis  20:32
finish your opening or be seated.

Unknown Speaker  20:35
In 2017. Matt, Alex was interviewed by Megyn, Kelly and NBC. He worried it would be a hit piece. He said for the interview. It was a hit piece. Megyn Kelly didn't get sued. Alex, that's objection to stay on.

Judge Bellis  20:53
One more time, and I will ask you to be seated.

Dan  20:58
I mean, it's just, you know, I as I was texting you, I'm like, keep swinging. Yep. You know, there's something to be said for persistence. I know. It's like my parents. When I was a kid, I was very persistent about things. Like being able to, you know, stay out to ride my bike or something, you know, I wouldn't get my way. And my parents were very much like, This is bad. You shouldn't do this. Right. But persistence is a trait that may pay off in the right. Day. That's how I feel with Nora.

Jordan  21:31
It is it is a little Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade like you lost this one today, kid, and then he puts the hat on. Yeah. And you're still trying to get it back into a museum. 20 years later, I get it. Yeah. Yeah, with you.

Dan  21:42
It's, in some context, persistence is a very admirable trait in this one knew, I mean,

Jordan  21:49
I disagree. Just on a like, from what I've seen level, because at a certain point, you can only say one more time. And you're done. Mr. Pattice. Before I don't give a shit anymore. How many times you say one more time? Because we've gotten that one more time, literally every day?

Dan  22:08
Yeah, that's true. Yeah, I think that the one more time maybe as a, I'm being serious here. But I think I think that giving a lot of wide berth to this year. I think that that is still appropriate. Yeah. Like it. I've made this point before in these circumstances. Like you don't want to do any. These people are babies. Yeah. So you don't want to give them the ability to credibly argue that they're being poorly. Sure. Sure. Sure, sure. And so I think I think that you kind of have to act that way. There is sucks there is a

Jordan  22:49
certain amount of you're watching wily coyote run off the cliff, and he's still being a dick, and he's still running, and you're like, there's nothing beneath you. You got to stop running, but he just keeps running. You're like, I guess I'm not going to be the one to tell him when the floor doesn't exist, but sooner or later the floor will not exist, and he's gonna fall a long way.

Dan  23:12
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I don't see much floor

Alex Jones  23:14
here for sure.

Dan  23:17
Yeah, I just, there's just parts of this that I was like, I don't even know why he's saying these things.

Unknown Speaker  23:22
At the end of the case, you know, you'll get to evaluate the evidence and ask what exactly they proved. That hurts. But the world is filled with unhinged people for becoming a failed state. Ellington old phrase is often offensive and keeping score on our site, how many times they use the word lie? Eight so far. Liar, liar, pants on fire. Shout enough. We could respond by saying and I asked you to consider this each time you hear the words, Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt you. When did political debate become toxic?

Dan  24:00
What is he even saying? I mean, there is a first of all, there's a very bizarre admission that he seems to be making there. That is like, I You gotta take it on face value that Alex is a liar. Yeah, like what are they going to prove that losing a loved one hurts that Alex is a liar. We know these things. Okay, so that's great.

Jordan  24:21
Oh, is this on up there? Yeah.

Dan  24:24
Okay. So I guess it's hard to come back from that and be like, Well, Alex does actually, you know, he's serious. And he tells the truth, but I'm sure Alex will try somehow to save this or just ignore it, which is yeah, what he has done.

Jordan  24:39
I mean, yeah, there's no continuity here. But then

Dan  24:41
the second thing is that you know, yeah, Sticks and stones may break bread. That's good when someone's insulting you, right. You know, rise above the insults, share or whatever. Sure. Like, I don't know, me saying that norms a fucking child. Yeah, rise above it and rise above it. When you're defaming somebody there and there is material harm that is done by your words. Oh, so it's no longer a, like the lies that Alex is telling are not just like fun lies. Sure, sure, sure. They're defamation lies, you

Jordan  25:19
know, I mean, words can never hurt you until you print them out in block letters out of titanium that weigh 1000 pounds and then drop them on your head. Yeah, words can hurt you eventually. And the

Dan  25:31
just the words and the lies are not necessarily the end all be all of what this case is about. Right. Right. Right. So that that's the other illusion that norm is perpetuating. Yeah, this this idea that Alex is just like questioning things, the idea that it's just words and stuff, is the attempt to unravel the default judgment. It is deeply inappropriate. A norm knows that. Yeah, he knows that.

Jordan  25:57
I mean, it's it is a little bit the result of the default judgment. I mean, again, we've talked about in the last trial, but like the Default Judgment is a default judgment, because all of the arguments that they would have made in court are essentially inadmissible. And they're still trying to make those arguments. And you can't say, you guys don't get to say anything now, because you lost. You can't say that. I mean, as you said, you know, you've been giving them a wide berth is a, you know, reasonable thing to do. But yeah, listening to his opening argument, I was sitting there going like, technically, you can't say that. Technically, you can't say that. Technically, you can't say that. You know, just checking it off the list. Yep. What you're going to do persistence pays off,

Dan  26:43
I guess. As long as those checks from free speech systems keep? Exactly. Yes. As long as they do that. So this I took particular issue with, he's just written another book,

Unknown Speaker  26:56
The Great reset to war for the world's best seller and Objection, Your Honor. He answered tonight TV for more wealth classic, he tells you isn't 1776 It's a serious message. It's not a lie. We live in deeply divided times and plenty of people think 1776 is the answer to the 94. We are. Yeah, he said that. He's also the guy who worries the chemicals in our water might be turning frogs gay. That weather balloons or secret government weapons that trails from airplanes are seeded with toxins that are destroying and controlling us. That Hillary abuses children, that pedophiles run the government and that people actually eat babies to remain forever young. Which of these messages do we take seriously enough to regard him as a threat we should shut off at what point do we guard regarded as the crank on the village green person, we could walk away from this we choose.

Dan  28:05
This is an interesting tack that norm is trying here because he's essentially arguing that Alex is simultaneously really serious and important and on the right track, but he's also a raving madman who you should just ignore. At first glance, this seems like a message message that Alec shouldn't endorse. But if you think about it a little more, you can see how this is exactly the kind of ambiguity that Alex wants to cultivate about himself in official circles. For his audience, he's serious all the time. And all that stuff about chemtrails and shit is very much sincere and real. Yes, but for the rest of us, and in a courtroom that isn't going to fly. So a different tactic needs to be employed. And it's that sometimes he's serious. And sometimes you should just write off what he's saying is crazy. It's a perfect way to evade any responsibility for anything you say. But simultaneously allow yourself to feel like a big boy hero about things you want to be taken seriously for. There's an uncertainty about whether or not any particular thing Alex says should be taken seriously. And that works really well in this context. talking shit about social media being too powerful, take that deadly seriously. And recognize that Alex was way ahead of the curve on that. And he was essentially a prophet, claiming that murdered children's family members or actors and the whole thing didn't really even happen. Come on. He's crazy. You can't take what he's saying. Seriously, you can see how this game that norm is playing works. It's very transparent. Yeah. And I want to take this one step further. I do think that the things that norm is listing off as the crazy stuff Alex says that you should discount as the ravings of a madman are things that you should absolutely take seriously. Alex isn't someone on a street corner is nor wants to imply just talking to himself about outlandish theories. Alex is a multimillionaire businessman who's great at a career out of disseminating these outlandish theories to masses of people. He's not someone on a street corner. He's a demagogue with international reach and the race things that are just supposed to be ignored. Those aren't things that his audience is supposed to know that Alex, his lawyer would describe that way in court. These are very serious, very real, completely documented conspiracies that are aimed at killing you and your family. This isn't up for debate on Alex's show, but mysteriously when you're in a formal setting, surrounded by people who aren't indoctrinated into the fold, these are examples of things that Alex says that prove you shouldn't take what he says seriously. The ludicrousness of the things Alex says is used as a defense against him taking responsibility for the real world damage he causes. And I think that is something to take very seriously. Even beyond that, the thing is, norm is listing off a very fucked up conspiracy theories, many of which have their roots in anti semitic tropes from histories. The the eating of children and drinking their blood is a holdover from the blood libel, many of the conspiracies about poisoning the water in the air hearken back to well poisoning accusations about Jewish people intentionally spreading the bionic plague. Leaving aside these bigoted roots of his talking points, there are just very serious dangers in the way that a non insignificant number of people and some elected officials are using pedophilia accusations to rile up their followers into a state where they're causing real damage to people primarily aimed at members of the LGBTQ community. Even if we aren't supposed to take Alex's theories themselves seriously, if we are responsible members of the public, we do need to take the reason they're being spread seriously. We need to take the impact that they have seriously and the game norm is playing here is an attempt to run cover for that. And based on norms character, I'm pretty sure he knows what he's doing. Because he's a piece of shit. Yeah, and he should rise above that sticks and stones, you know, very good bones and words don't hurt.

Jordan  31:47
Yeah. I feel I feel like we're like watching this. Like, you know, we've we've discussed in the past that the world got lucky that we haven't become right wing nut jobs on account of you know, you and I yeah, we're failed coming. We've got the we've got the we've got the pedigree for it, right. We're both two white dudes. Yeah, we're on Mike all the time. You know, that is that is ripe for becoming a right wing shithead that kind of thing. But if I were one of those, then my legal strategy would be Fuck it. Everything I say is crazy. Everything. And then I go into it in court and be like, Why would you be racist? Do you not see that there's no genetic basis. Like I would go ham on everything I've ever said and be like, see, look at how silly it is that people believe any of this shit and

Dan  32:41
then go on air and be like, I didn't mean any of that.

Jordan  32:44
Yeah, absolutely. Nobody cares. Nobody cares.

Dan  32:49
It's yeah, it's it is a little bit. It's a bit strange that there's like the the I think

Jordan  32:55
there are third rails for them where they're like, I won't come out and say that hating gun man you hating like anti gun shoes. Stupid. True? No. Well, I

Dan  33:04
think that there is also the they don't want to blow up their game. I think the problem is that you're imagining a situation where you don't have like, an elaborate business to party. Sure, sure. Sure. So you could do that in your hypothetical scenario where there isn't like, a warehouse full of pills. You gotta be right, right.

Jordan  33:22
But for me, it would also be like, Oh, I see the writing on the wall. This business is not going to be mine for that much longer. So I might as well get me taken care of, because I'm a right wing psychopath. shithead. Like these people are just aren't smart.

Dan  33:36
I honestly think that the more you talk, the more I realize you wouldn't cut it.

Jordan  33:40
No, I really would. I would be I would be terrible. Yeah.

Dan  33:43
And I don't think that you would be like, accepted into the circle because that is kind of chaotic energy. They don't want to round right? ruin their pill warehouse.

Jordan  33:53
Yeah. Hey, I am the Joker. I'll burn the bottom half of the money.

Dan  33:58
Yes. So we're done listening to norm shit for now. But we were gonna jump in here on the 13th Alex's show. It starts off and maybe I was feeling nitpicky. Was that kind of day? Yeah.

Alex Jones  34:15
Everybody knows about the frog in the boiling pot of water analogy. That's actually true. The folks down in Louisiana and Mississippi, like to eat their crawdads and their bullfrogs, and the rest of it and well, sometimes they just throw the whole frog in the boiling pot, but they've learned that if we throw one into boiling water, he'll just jump right out. But if you sent him in a cool pot of water, he just turned the heat up slow. He thinks it's a hot tub at first and then passes out and dies and painless death. And that's where America and the world is right now. We're in the middle of the New World Order.

Dan  34:56
This isn't true. frogs don't just sit in water as you turn Turn up the heat. People have conducted tests on this. And it's really consistent that the frogs have a way to get out of the water as it gets hotter they do. Also, they don't just magically jump out of boiling water. Although there are less people conducting this test for obvious humane animal treatment reasons, biologists have discussed the prospect and it's pretty clear that, you know, a frog being thrown into boiling water would just be burned immediately by the scalding water. And they tried to escape it probably die. Yeah, even if it made it out of the boiling water, it would probably succumb to injuries from the burns.

Jordan  35:32
Honestly, you couldn't barely get back out of boiling water, right? That's it's boiling fucking water, right,

Dan  35:39
it would cause like a shock response. This is a fun analogy for Alex to make because he comes from the school of anti communism that views all social progress as the incremental change. That is the metaphorical temperature of the water rising. It's all kind of a fantasy, though. And the real metaphor is that the rising temperature of this particular water is, is killing off Alex's ability to live in a society that caters solely to the needs of straight white Christian men. Yeah, that's the metaphor understood appropriately.

Jordan  36:10
Yeah. Yeah, I do. I do appreciate he has a, what would I say an almost detrimental commitment to taking any down home country aphorism, and being like, and that's 100% True. Sure. You can, yeah, you know, you go out back, you cut a log, and then you're gonna break your leg. And that's 100% true if you crack your bread crumb, resolutely, 100% of the time that comes from the old country.

Dan  36:36
Now, ironically, the phenomenon that's described by this boiling frog analogy actually kind of does apply to our collective response to climate change. And that scenario, we're all frogs trapped in this pot, and Alex has a frog yelling at all of us that the water is not getting any hotter and the globalists are just pushing that idea to get us to give up our frog guns and pay frog taxes. Yeah. So

Jordan  36:59
I just got it. I just got an image of like a giant gumbo pot with, like, 20 Frogs on either side of it armed to the teeth, playing a game of chess, that kind of that kind of feel. Sure. And then they all boil to death.

Dan  37:12
And there's just one who's just yelling at them. The water's fine.

Jordan  37:15
That's it. No, that's absolutely right in the middle of them. Yeah.

Dan  37:19
So yeah, maybe a little nitpicky, but I was bored. Anyway, Aleksa has some big news.

Alex Jones  37:25
And that's where we are as a culture and as a civilization. And to give you an example of how we're winning the culture war, Tucker Carlson talked last night about the horrible next level of deception and censorship that is taking place at the master of lies. The New York Times, here it is. Okay.

Tucker Carlson  37:47
Just how dishonest is the New York Times? It's really a philosophical question. It's hard to answer directly.

Dan  37:52
Do you have any idea what this is about? What do you want to guess what this is about?

Jordan  37:57
Oh, God, I don't know. Okay.

Dan  38:01
So how about the New York Times?

Jordan  38:03
Right, the New York Times must have published I don't know, maybe, maybe Aaron judges 57th homerun wouldn't have gone out? Interesting. I'm gonna go with that.

Tucker Carlson  38:12
Okay. Let's see, how drunk was the guy you saw passed out in the men's room at a Packers game? How angry is Hillary Clinton at her husband? When we answer in all cases is very, extremely, so thoroughly. And so totally, that's hard to put into words. So instead of describing the dishonesty of The New York Times with conventional adjectives, we'll give you a specific example. Because we think it tells you more. So last week, the paper told us that the best selling book in the United States was titled called I'm glad my mom died by a child actress called Jennette McCurdy, but that was not true. That book was not the best selling book in America. In fact, the best selling book in America last week was the great reset and the Warhammer world written by Oh my Jones.

Dan  38:57
Oh, my never predicted that the

Jordan  39:00
fuck out of here. Yeah, he's he's whining like Alex about Alex on his show. And

Dan  39:06
then Alex is playing Tucker.

Jordan  39:08
Oh, my God. Yeah. Fuck me.

Dan  39:10
So one thing we should just get clear. Before I get into any of this is that for over a decade and probably way longer than that people have been a bit confused about how best seller lists work. There is not well, certainly a precise science to it. And if you look at different publications, you'll see different listings because they use different metrics. I went to check the New York Times list and sure enough, I'm glad my mom died is a number one but if there's some kind of a weird systemic bias on this list, I don't know how Jared Kushner his book breaking history is coming in at number three in its third week on the list. That seems strange. Yeah. Or what about number 13 on the list being the book battle for the American mind by Peter Giggs, if and David Goodwin which is described as quote, The Fox and Friends Weekend host makes his case for what he calls a classical Christian at occasion seems like the time to just say no thank you to that if they're just manipulating their shit. Yeah, given these inclusions I just don't believe for a second that there's like a systematic bias against Alex's book. No, of course not. There's one factor that I think is working against Alex, and that is that a ton of his books are being purchased directly from his website at a giant markup. Oh, yeah. And he's complained quite a bit about how he asked to sign them all before shipping them out. On his Wednesday show, he said that he sold 14,000 copies on his own website, Jesus Christ, these purchases through Infowars wouldn't be confirmed purchases, The Times would factor into the rankings partially because Infowars store doesn't report sales data to the time

Jordan  40:41
they don't report sales data to the courts. Yeah, this is a major part

Dan  40:45
of how the times makes their list from their website about the lists methodology. Quote, rankings reflect unit sales reported on a confidential basis by vendors offering a wide range of general interest titles published in the United States, every week. 1000s of diverse selling locations report their actual sales on hundreds of 1000s of individual titles. The panel of reporting retailers is comprehensive and reflect sales in 10s of 1000s of stores of all sizes and demographics across the United States. So you know, they have like some smaller bit like operators, some smaller bookstores, some chains, yeah, Amazon, of course. And so they have these to get a sampling of where books are sold. Yeah, of course, this is where Alex is probably hurting. I would guess that he doesn't have like really great distribution for this book, and it's probably not being carried in many stores. He's got his own website and Amazon. And while a ton of book buying is done online, there is a wider picture that is often ignored. Alex's book is currently number five on Amazon's top seller list, which is great for him. That's just based on purchases, so it's a little more straightforward in terms of rankings. Incidentally, number four on that list is I'm glad my mom died. So he's not beating generic either. Heartbreaking also, number two is a cookbook written by Steve Doocy and his wife so really Dungar should be asking why is it the New York Times charts putting Steve Doocy up there?

Jordan  42:12
What everyone should be asking is why try to write well, why? Look, the point is that Tucker

Dan  42:18
is not making a sincere argument. No, absolutely not. Also, please remember this is apparently the top story on Alex's show the day his trial in Connecticut is beginning as this episode is airing norm is in court. Like he Alex is complaining about his book sales in the New York, snubbing him. Norm is doing is disgraceful bullshit. No,

Jordan  42:36
no, no and that but that's all in character and shit. You know, like, fuck me. Tucker Carlson is going on national to little degrading TV to whine. The New York Times didn't give him enough of I mean, that's, that's shameful. You're the most important man in the world. It's a little although that is why he's the most important man in the world. Yeah, he's willing to go on his show. Yeah, that's a fair point.

Dan  43:03
Stucker gets into the numbers zakaat

Tucker Carlson  43:06
Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last week. Jeff McCurdy, whatever her merits, we have no idea sold 34,686 copies of her book. So Alex Jones sold a lot more books. Alex Jones had the biggest book in the country, but the New York Times lied about that, because New York Times doesn't want you to know that.

Dan  43:27
Tucker is number four McCurdy his book is pretty specific. So he's pretty simple to track that down. This is from the Publishers Weekly list of top hardcover, frontlist nonfiction. On that list. McCurdy is number one with 34,686 units sold. And Alex is number two with 30,649.

Jordan  43:47
I thought he was number two with 54 something 1000 No, no, no,

Dan  43:52
Tucker is taking that number of books sold from Alex.

Jordan  43:54
Ooh, not a good idea that probably adds the several 1000 copies that he signed.

Dan  44:00
I'm guessing that he took the number of McCarty's books sold from Alex to because it's cited in a bunch of Infowars articles about how the times is Shadow banning Alex. But what's this? books don't only come in hardcover and nonfiction that doesn't sound true on the overall list from Publishers Weekly McCurdy his book is at number seven, with four of the top six books being by Colleen Hoover, Alex isn't even on the top 10 on that full list, Rudel, if Alex really wants to make sure that all is right in the universe, and make sure that the book that sold the most copies is number one, then you should be yelling about how Hoover's 2016 Young Adult romance novel it ends with us should be at number one, not McCurdy Yeah, yeah, he's not doing that because he doesn't actually care about other times the list is compiled. This is just about him taking his own petty grievance and insecurity about feeling left out and pretend to get actually reveals a political point. He also very clearly sees the potential this has as a way to drive sales as the article on Infowars says, quote, The New York Times excluded Alex Jones as the great reset from its rightful place on the list. It's time to end the censorship of conservative voices from bestseller lists. Fuck me, that article is maybe 700 words long, and it includes six hyperlinks to the Amazon page to buy Alex. Also, I shouldn't know that all the book is 36% off its original price like a week into its release, which definitely doesn't scream. We fleeced people on pre orders, and now we're trying to sell off the rest of these books at a cut rate. Yeah, so they don't fill up the warehouse. Exactly. Alex did well, he cashed in a bid on a book. And he should be proud of himself for turning his incoherent ramblings into 30, something 1000 books sold. But this whole thing is a bit much. And it's really pathetic for Tucker, to be jumping into basically doing a segment based on an Infowars article about how the cool kids at the times aren't letting Alex sit at the table. Yeah, it's a little bit sad.

Jordan  45:53
Yeah, yeah. And not just that, but like, wow, only 50,000 books. I mean, that's like the biggest. That's, that's the biggest book in America is 50,000 books, right?

Dan  46:07
It does go just rough. It does go to show the numbers of books sold are lower a lot of the time than you think. Yeah, yeah. But then the second thing that goes to show you is, like, look, I think it's great. Like if you were to sell 50,000 books, I would say amazing. Yeah, that's awesome. Congratulations, bro. Yeah, if Alex is selling 50,000 books not good. No, no, I'm it's because it's because of who he presents himself as sure he is the biggest thing in the world. He is the number one media source is the Howard Stern of truth. Absolutely the leader of the Patriots in the CIA and the FBI and all this shit. He is the king of the world. He is friends with all the most powerful people Bolsonaro listens to his show every day right now that he doesn't want to directly associate himself with Putin listening to his show all the time. Yeah. Bolsonaro is much easier for him to change. Yeah, 50,000 is like this is sad, bro.

Jordan  47:03
No, I think I think overall, I think I had in the first two weeks, like 10,000 downloads, which to me was approximately the book 100% of our audience, you know, like, that's the best conversion rate we can know that kind of thing. That's amazing. It's not I don't have Billy, I don't have $100 million. In my bank.

Dan  47:24
It's good. It's good for you and what you are, that's great for me for what Alex purports to be sad numbers bad, sad. Also, like he's saying that 14,000 sales through his his website, and I understand that he's selling something, and I'm just giving something away. But the number of buttons? Like if we're just talking about straight up response rate, sure, sure. Sure. That number doesn't look so impressive. Because you look at my inbox. Yeah, that's true. But we're not that far away, necessarily.

Jordan  48:00
Alex can't be free in price, though. That's

Dan  48:04
that's a variable. So anyway, this whole thing is really, I mean, you know why he's doing this,

Alex Jones  48:10
and the bandwidth and the rest of it are costing us $300,000 a month. And the more popper we get with our own platform, the more money I've got to pay, so I'm not bitching and complaining. I'm just simply saying, we've hit the zeitgeist, we are in the pole position. We are winning, we are hurting them. We are inspiring Liberty movements worldwide. That means you are but I need funds. And quite frankly, buying the books sends a message. It's the Death Star plans. It exposes the New World Order they can't stand it. So get at Infowars store.com or get an amazon.com or get in Barnes Nobles. That's all fine and dandy. But we want to support the broadcast where we actually do bring some money in now I had all the news get what's been sold out for over a year green fiber capsules, the highest quality.

Dan  48:55
Everyone loves green fiber capsule. It says green fiber capsules. Yeah. So I mean, this whole thing really even the playing of the Tucker piece now is a sales. Yeah, this whole beginning of the show is just sales. Yeah. It's sad. I would be fuzzy on that a bit.

Jordan  49:14
More fun. And Job shopping network was like, these swords are the best swords we have on the market. Actually, you know what, let's play a clip of somebody saying these swords suck. And then we'll talk about it because these swords are so fucking great. That would be fun. We're gonna have to put a clock on this. Yeah.

Dan  49:31
So there's big news out of big news. Yeah, he has done his piece chair, big news.

Alex Jones  49:37
Now I'm gonna cover all the mash of news and more. But here is the big news. inflation's off the hook. business sales across the border down. We're going into a depression. And with inflation, that stagflation we're all in deep trouble. And I'm just asking listeners to understand that because of the storm is here. It's not coming. And with all the things you do in life, supporting corporate brands, supporting you know The football games all this crap, please set aside some money to keep Infowars on the air because we're in Chennai bankruptcy. And the next few months, it'll be decided whether we continue on or this shuts down, and we are barely profitable. We've gotta be able to show we're profitable. As this plan goes forward in just the next six weeks show now is the most critical time in Infowars. History to go to Infowars store.com and get diet force.

Dan  50:24
So we're going to talk about this towards the end of the episode because Alex gets a little bit more clear about this, but the way he's talking about his bankruptcy leads me to believe that he might be trying to defraud the bankruptcy court. Yeah. And he might be discussing this plan on air in a way that is a

Jordan  50:40
great place to play to discuss it a little, a little flagrant. Nah, nah, you hide in plain sight.

Dan  50:47
Do your crimes on the radio.

Jordan  50:48
Exactly. Absolutely.

Dan  50:50
So yeah, inflation is on fleek.

Jordan  50:54
stagflation now. Yep. That's in Britain. That's what you do before you get married. You have a stagflation? Sure.

Dan  51:00
So we're back to I mean, it's just I need more money stuff. Sure. It keeps trying to trick me with this. I'm gonna get to the news thing.

Jordan  51:08
I liked that he he played the Tucker clip as a way to sell his book. But the way he sold his book as a way to sell something that has a higher profit margin, right by saying don't buy my book. It's it's a sale within a sale. Yep. Yeah.

Dan  51:25
Yep. Yep. So we actually do get to some news. I'm not this isn't a bait and switch this time. Okay.

Alex Jones  51:30
Because it's not debatable. It was OSI up. It's not available. It was a lie. It's not debatable. It was a fraud. We have them. And the good news is the rats are leaving the sinking ship. Again, ethically unjustifiable. top scientists from Harvard and John Hopkins go public with a major study. COVID-19 Shots 98 times worse than the virus. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  52:00
How would you do 98? I don't know.

Dan  52:03
So this is a headline Alex is reading from Jim Hoft substance didn't want to run this on Gateway Pundit. So he kept this little gem for himself. I would give that one up there. Also in substack is called second smartest guy in the world, which is pretty cool. Got some first place isn't his twin brother.

Jordan  52:19
No, it's still Ben Stein. Oh, when his money Oh, you gotta

Dan  52:23
you got a Jimmy Kimmel. He was co host

Jordan  52:27
he was. Yeah, see what a weird What a weird life. We

Dan  52:30
enjoyed that show.

Jordan  52:33
I did too. That's the weirdest part about it.

Dan  52:35
I have neutral feelings about Jimmy Kimmel now and negative feelings about

Jordan  52:41
Yes, yes.

Unknown Speaker  52:42
I

Jordan  52:44
have all the CO hosts Jimmy Kimmel has had none of that have made it past. What how many time? Man 220 12 as being like, you're a good person. None of them.

Dan  52:59
Yeah, it's an interesting question. Who's worse? Ben Stein or acerola? Probably Adam.

Jordan  53:06
Yeah, I would say so. He's been Adam has been in worse mood.

Dan  53:09
And I actually enjoyed the hammer when I was younger, but I don't want to revisit it. That's fair. But the question is definitely answered with Adam. And here's why. Yeah. He felt like there was when it loved line, you know, you had a feeling that he was somebody who was being helpful. He was very funny. Maybe again, I don't want to go back and not worry about it. But then to now or terrible, whereas Ben Stein was a fucking speechwriter for Nixon. He

Jordan  53:40
was just Ben Stein the whole time. Why did he get a show? There's no explanation. Ferris Bueller. That's but that's not enough for me, apparently. Yeah. Well, you're right.

Dan  53:51
So anyway, Jim Hoft as a substantive, good enough. So this is as always what they're talking about. It's a preprint article that's being reported on by a COVID denial propagandists. So this isn't even really getting my eyebrows raised. It's getting to be a yawn kind of thing. Alex absolutely did not read this study. It's 50 pages long and he doesn't even sound like you read the title of Jim Hoffs blog before cold reading it on air. He just making up what he thinks he's reading to the study itself as a cost benefit analysis of mandating booster shots for people under 40, particularly in the context of college students. The argument is that these mandates may not avert that many hospitalizations, and I can see where that may make some sense. I think that'd be very reasonable if people under 40 and people over 40 Never came into contact with each other but seeing as we all do intermingle and vaccines are a community level solution to a problem not an individual level one. I have some issues with the just the very idea of this. Yeah, that being said half headline is bullshit. The study didn't say that vaccines are 98 times worse than the virus as Alex is repeating that number 98 is used In the paper is the high end estimate of the number of serious adverse events you might expect to see in a hypothetical College of 30,000 students who are all given the booster, right. Also, this paper hasn't been peer reviewed. So their numbers and methodology might be suspect probably

Unknown Speaker  55:13
self reported.

Dan  55:16
But it's a hypothetical University. Sure, who knows, right? We've seen in this COVID Time preprint articles have like, just math problems. Yeah, I mean, you know, like, do you just calculate it wrong? I don't know what to do with this. Yeah, let's get that through peer to peer reporting

Jordan  55:32
98 times. Well, how do you how do you claim that without having some concept of what it is that is 98 times worse? You know, it's 98 times worse, man. But it how mathematically how, like, Okay, so COVID This is one right COVID is bad. COVID is a one right? But getting a booster shot is 98 COVID. But I don't know what that beat. It's like a Nicola che. Do I get 98 Worst coughs?

Dan  56:02
Yeah, every cough 98 coughs 98 coughs

Jordan  56:05
Oh, that's bad. 98 times.

Dan  56:11
I will say it's not ideal. No. So anyway, Alex is the leader of the resistance.

Alex Jones  56:16
We are the American resistance. We are the human resistance. This is it. And I don't say it again, with some arrogant pleasure. I say it to recognize what you as listeners have back and you're commissioning of this operation. This is the tip of the spear. This is the platinum standard. This is it right here. And don't think I don't know that. And don't think it isn't a giant weight on me. So, if you could temporize and actually let it get into your mind and understand that obviously, of course, America is the main resistance as bad as we are. And of course, the main resistance in America is coming out of a place like Texas. That's the way the world's been. It's the way the world still is. As Texas goes, America goes as America goes. So goes the world. You know, who said that? The white the Eisenhower, when he was first elected president in the 1950s 1950 to look it up.

Dan  57:12
I looked it up.

Jordan  57:13
Did you look it up?

Dan  57:13
So Eisenhower, won the 1952 election, but he was inaugurated in January 1953. Sure, this quote does not appear in that inaugural speech, nor in any speech you ever gave, because it's fake. Not good. I believe if I had to guess, Alex's misremembering this line from that speech, quote, whatever America hopes to bring to pass in the world must first come to pass in the heart of America, you could interpret that as being like the heartland and Alex might think that's Texas, or just the Texas is the heart of America. Either way, that's as close as it gets in this beat right into that lay. In that speech. Eisenhower also lays out nine basic principles that his administration would be guided by in terms of achieving peace. Let's hear those one of them is quote, respecting the United Nations as the living sign of all peoples hope for peace. We shall strive to make it not merely an eloquent symbol, but an effective force. That doesn't sound true. Seems like Alex, you'd think that this is a dirty globalist speech does sound like that. Anyway, more fake quotes.

Jordan  58:13
Yeah. You just, you're just never gonna get it real quote, no, it's just not going to happen. No, because in order to get a real quote, you would actually have to go look for it, or learn about it or read it in a book, you would have to get it from a book, like even even Qi 's Book of General quotes or whatever it was whatever they released that some of those were fake as shit. Like you don't know. You don't know about quotes.

Dan  58:38
Yeah. And I mean, the the, what if I can't remember exactly what state it always was? The as Maine goes, so goes the country. She's always the expression because Maine was like the bellwether. Sure, initially, and there's those expressions in like

Jordan  58:57
the electoral college. So yeah, yeah, Iowa does. Yeah, that whole thing.

Dan  59:04
That kind of framing has been used about a number of states over the course of our history gaining. But yeah, this thing in terms of Eisenhower's inaugural speeches,

Jordan  59:14
as the colony of the Carolinas goes, so goes the 13th.

Dan  59:19
So here's where I wanted to throw my hands up and just say I quit.

Alex Jones  59:25
Last night, the massively expanding Democrat Party weaponized Justice Department attack on every major national Trump supporter, including Infowars here it is.

Tucker Carlson  59:37
It shocks the conscience of everyone who sees it.

Dan  59:40
This should just be a Tucker Carlson recap show like it's just he's running a rerun of Tucker Carlson. Yeah, this is nonsense. Why why are we why does this this?

Jordan  59:52
I mean, it's a Yeah, yeah, national news show set wind for me. So I'm gonna dead Okay, my entire broadcast to rebroadcast

Dan  1:00:03
to Tucker segment

Jordan  1:00:04
oh my god too much.

Dan  1:00:07
Anyway Eddie Bravo sound Aleksa Instagram video

Jordan  1:00:10
Share shared that's a thing that we should say today. That's an out loud thing that should exist.

Dan  1:00:17
So Alex is reporting on this Instagram video reporting.

Alex Jones  1:00:21
This is just a layperson but that's the most important people that got hundreds of 1000s of views on Instagram. Asking the question and then Allah how they say astrologist are saying the economy's gonna implode. Well, that's astrologist. sheeny economy implodes say, I'll make the prediction according to the stars, this is gonna happen. I'm not attacking astrologist, but come on. Why astrologers, you got the great reset, and the globalist saying they would do this, but they do a good listing of some of the top acts that have just cancelled going out and giving shows the next five months because 56 days out from the election, they're planting false flags.

Dan  1:00:58
Yeah, Alex has a lot of nerve talking down on astrologers when he gets his information from prophetic dreams he's had and visions brought on by chicken fried steak,

Jordan  1:01:06
but those were sent by God right? Not the stars. Sure. That's stupid. So

Dan  1:01:11
this Instagram video that Edie sent to Alex has to do with like a bunch of musicians canceling tours and stuff. And it's like, it's because they know that something's gonna happen like a false flag terror event concert, right or there's going to be another Coronavirus lockdown. Huge cancel his upcoming shows Oh, no, I don't know if he has any shows anyone wants to go to That'd be nice. So I found this video that's laying out the conspiracy and it flashes on screen a bunch of canceled events to make a point that a lot of stuff is getting cancelled. First is the Weezer Broadway residency, which was the headline that they show says quote, citing low ticket sales, so I don't know maybe it's not a surprise that ouiser On Broadway as

Jordan  1:01:56
Broadway goes. so goes the nation. Right.

Dan  1:01:59
The next is about Luke combs canceling a single concert because he had problems with his voice. I don't know. That happens. The third is Shawn Mendes canceling a tour to take personal time. I have no idea who Shawn Mendes is but good for him. Yeah. After that he is quote Carlos Santana canceled six concerts as he continues to recover. Oh, Santana is 74 years old and he collapsed on stage in July while performing in Michigan

Jordan  1:02:26
is Rob Thomas. Okay. I assume that the two of them are inextricably like like when when Adams become entangled I assume that's how the what happened after smooth. is santana. Rob Thomas became one

Dan  1:02:40
well, I mean, like when Carlos Santana collapsed on stage, Rob Thomas said I'd give my world to lift you up to pick you back up off the stage. Yeah,

Jordan  1:02:47
sure. That does make sense. He was 1000 miles away though. All of a sudden, he stood up in the middle of a restaurant and started singing that

Dan  1:02:55
and then somewhere off in the long distance Everlast is pissed off. Put your lights on.

Jordan  1:03:02
Big Everlast is never gonna it's never gonna have it. It's never gonna happen under

Dan  1:03:07
my bed. Oh, boy. It's good song. I think sure again, don't want to revisit it. Yeah, so then there's another band I've never heard of the canceled tour and then quote Foo Fighters cancelled all tour dates after a drummer Taylor Hawkins death. None of these cancellations seemed suspicious at all. They're all pretty well understood Weezer ticket sales weren't going well. Carlos Santana is old and collapsed on stage. Yeah. What guy canceled what Gods are because he had a voice issue and then the drummer of their band died,

Jordan  1:03:38
man. Did you see you didn't I assume you didn't see the tribute concert.

Dan  1:03:43
I saw this his son playing the drums. Oh, my hero makes you makes you cry every time I can say it's impressive as hell he was great. Because that's also not a super easy song. Drop wise, you gotta

Jordan  1:03:55
you gotta have the strength to hit. Yeah, you got to have the strength to hit on those

Dan  1:04:00
18 Like the poise to be able to perform now at all, let alone for a Foo Fighters crowd for your dad's a lot of pressure is daring into Dave Grohl eyes as you play the drum solo that he wrote. It's very impressive. Yeah. The just to be able to be on that stage and not freak out. Yeah. I don't think I wouldn't be ready for it. Nope. Nope.

Jordan  1:04:28
I'd be weeping. I

Dan  1:04:30
think it's 60 I might have done a musical or a play at my school and it freaks me out. Anyway, honestly, this is some of the stupidest most early 2000s conspiracy message board as shit. It's no surprise that Alex said that Eddie Bravo tipped him off on this one. Yeah, that would make so dumb. Fingers crossed that we get to see Tucker dual segment about next week and then Alex can cover Tucker covering it. Like honestly between the playing multiple Tucker segments and then this bullshit I felt so embarrassed that this is the show we do.

Jordan  1:05:02
I I feel embarrassed that this is the world we live in. I mean, you know, we used to talk about being in the dark timeline or in the funny time this is turned into just like a What are we doing here people? Come on. It's very stupid. Yeah, yeah. And everybody's making choices actively against their own interests. This

Dan  1:05:20
is the part where I want to say when I when I say going back to the past is more interesting for me. There's more to do. Yeah, a lot of it is because Alex is doing this like Tucker segments. The COVID Conspiracy of the day right from some dumb asses Substantia and then Eddie Bravo sent me a fucking Instagram video about some bullshit got

Jordan  1:05:42
hundreds of 1000s of views I find most important man in the world right now is Eddie Bravo.

Dan  1:05:48
Totally based on the dumb nonsense that I see people post that got like, hundreds of 1000s of views on Tiktok. I don't think it's a hard it might not be that hard. I don't know. Anyway, Alex is selling lots of books. And that money is going straight back into the show, baby. Also he has a coin.

Alex Jones  1:06:07
I want to thank you all for your support. Number one, but in the world. I got $80,000 just paid to me in the first payment. They think I'll probably make a few million dollars off the book, Grau. It's all getting dumped in this operation. Few weeks, you know that raw sewage and the trials and the attacks. We're going to file the appeals make at you to battle them for years and keep this operation going. But it's up to you to fund the operation. Thanks for your support. Info war. store.com. The industrialized America they've done one sided trade deals to shut you down. Everything they're doing to me they're doing to you. We're just the focal point of that fight. 1776 going.com I'd like to see a shine of liberty and just show up 9000 coins that are left. Sold 1000 Yesterday. I don't see him sold today.

Dan  1:06:57
Yeah, let's move these coins. Here's another coin he's selling.

Jordan  1:07:00
As a businessman, I would like to see all of my business done quickly, as opposed to slowly Yes.

Dan  1:07:08
I love to that. He was like, alright, we're doing this series of four coins. It's just gonna be four coins. Also, hey, I got a fifth coin.

Jordan  1:07:18
I remember when Batman Forever came out. You could get these mugs from McDonald's or whatever. It's frosty. Yeah. And you would get all the I would try. I tried to get all of them. I tried to get all of them. You know what I feel like those are worth as much now as that coin will be later. Right? Yeah,

Dan  1:07:38
I mean, it is overpriced. And we'll deal with that a little bit later. I'm self conscious about it. So look, he takes some calls. I don't care. They're dumb. Boring. So let's go to the 14th. All right, Alex says another COVID Conspiracy of the day sorry.

Alex Jones  1:07:55
What a broadcast we've got lined up for you today. We can put the full show. Headline up on screen it tells it all. Global bombshell. Secret Israeli government report with video of the report from their health ministry head confirms COVID Vax causing massive side effects and death. No, our top story is not going to be a show trial in Connecticut and all the fraud that's going on. Why not? We'll cover some of that today. And it's incredible. Robert Barnes joins us. The other information coming out is the proof of the premeditated global un WEF Big Pharma directed mass murderer. Wow.

Dan  1:08:39
So I was curious about this bombshell report Alex's covering here. So I searched for the words he was saying and imagine my surprise when I found that he's just reading the headline for the article on Infowars. That includes the embedded video of the show that he's in the middle of doing. This is just a headline Alex himself has written for this day's show. And you can see the exact same wording reposted on tons of really shady looking blogs, all of which are just reposting Alex's video. But weirdly, none of them have links to these documents in this Israeli study. That is supposed to be the bombshell. So I did a little digging around and I found what Alex is covering and it's just another post on Steve Kershaw's subsidizes Christ. There's a video on rumble that purports to be from the Israeli health ministry having a meeting where they discuss findings that are that, that there are some longer term side effects of the Pfizer vaccine that hadn't been known previously, findings which are being said to have been covered up by Pfizer and the Israeli government. Sure, I can't find coverage of this on any outlet that I find even halfway respectable and I don't speak Hebrew. So I don't know what's being said in this video, right. The context in the original narrative framework for this story traces back to a post on Twitter by a woman named Yaffa Shira Roz, who is credited generally as a health and risk communications researcher and a health journalist. This translates to her running a website called Real Time news, which is kind of it comes off as an Israeli version of a lot of the dicey sources that I run into on this show things like World Net Daily. Yeah. Pundit or Steve curses substack

Jordan  1:10:14
if your name makes me wince, then I know you know, real time real time news and I'm like, Yeah, that's that's gonna hurt

Dan  1:10:20
it's uncreative and so bland as to be like, you're trying to

Jordan  1:10:23
you're totally Yeah, you're trying to you're lied to bait. Come

Dan  1:10:27
on. Now, I don't know too much about Shiraz. But it's worth noting that she was a major source of the fraudulent narrative that tons of soccer players were dropping dead because of vaccine side effects. She fudged data and miscalculated shocking numbers on that front, which then became big talking points in the anti Vax world that we cover. For this reason. And because there's absolutely zero reputable coverage of this video, I'm skeptical of the way it's being discussed. These particular information sources haven't heard the benefit of the doubt. So I got nowhere to go on this. Yeah, I can I can cover it as it's being told by these people. And the ways that Alex's coverage of it doesn't even match the version of it.

Jordan  1:11:07
Yeah,

Dan  1:11:08
that makes sense. I have. I have no idea.

Jordan  1:11:10
You're, I mean, yeah, you're not going to win. If you're not. Also, why is Alex using? I mean, so the Israeli Health Minister has come out and said that Pfizer is lying about or ostensibly? No, that's the conspiracy.

Dan  1:11:26
No. So the video is of a Zoom meeting, that the is like a group of researchers that were commissioned by the Health Ministry, okay to look at side effects. And they apparently found some longer term side effects, and some side effects that hadn't been seen in the signals that Pfizer had. Right. Gotcha. Take a note of and then apparently, after this, the health ministry put out a report or maybe even in conjunction with Pfizer that covered up these these side effects that they found. That's our allegation, generally speaking, right.

Jordan  1:12:07
So then the government was covering it up. Yeah, gotcha. And Pfizer? Yeah. The government and Pfizer so. Okay. I mean, he'll just accept anyone who says what he wants to them to say. Yeah. Like, it doesn't matter. Like there should be sources that should be off limits for him.

Dan  1:12:26
Well, he'll he'll accept anybody who says what he wants them to say. And he'll also make up things to add on to things right. We're saying things that are close to what he wants. So we got another COVID Conspiracy of the day.

Alex Jones  1:12:40
She She admits it falsely claimed it was monitoring vaccine safety, but still won't release the full data. But in our admitting that it's killing people. There desperately needs to be some prison time. CDC director admits agency gave false information on COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring, because they didn't do it. Because they done secret tests. The CDC knew it was killing the ranch, which is one of the 2000 October report, they predicted everything that happened.

Dan  1:13:05
So this is a fraudulent story. Essentially, what it boils down to is semantics. The Epoch Times I was running some stories about the CDC is monitoring of various data and they were contending that the CDC was not analyzing the data at all. The CDC had made some comments that they had used a data analysis method called proportional reporting ratio, or PRR. But in fact, they only use that method between March 25 2002 And July 31 2022. As is clarified in the letter from the CDC director to Senator Ron Johnson, who is questioning her about this, quote, CDC and FDA chose to rely on empirical Bayesian data mining more robust technique used to analyze disproportionate reporting, rather than PRR calculations to mitigate potential false signals. CDC performed PRR analysis between March 25 And July 31 2022. to corroborate the results of the EB data mining, notably results from PRR analysis were generally consistent with EB data mining revealing no additional unexpected safety signals. This isn't a story about the CDC not monitoring data, it's just about them using a different methodology that they felt was more useful and possibly someone Miss speaking at some point in the past.

Jordan  1:14:20
It is it is so funny. And so just the world of humanity, that the idea of somebody going out of their way to double check if something's right, is the source of a conspiracy for people. Get the fuck out of here. You're trying to verify the shit you're telling me? That's only something that liars would do? Sure. Wait, what? Yeah, nevermind.

Dan  1:14:44
Yeah, fact checkers thorough people.

Jordan  1:14:46
They're suspicious liars.

Dan  1:14:48
So anyway, we got a we got a story here.

Alex Jones  1:14:50
Pray every day we see 50 or 60 of these articles teen athletes revised was furious six foot one glad, but now football is off the table. He did of course take the shot.

Jordan  1:15:00
A six foot blood clot, and it

Alex Jones  1:15:03
just gets more crazy. It's not

Dan  1:15:05
a single blood clot, but it's six feet of blood clots. Right? So this is a headline that Alex is reading from CBN, which of course is the Christian Broadcasting Network. This is about a high school student named Kaden climber who had a large blood clot and multiple nowhere in the story doesn't mention climbers vaccination status. Alex is just making that up because he has a vested interest in reporting every story about a young person who gets hurt as being the consequence of their getting vaccinated. Right. He can't make his point by discussing reality. So he just makes up whatever works best for him so he can keep his audience scared and in his way, incidentally, the CBN story includes this that Alex never talks about doesn't mention this at all. Quote, it's unclear what caused the extensive clots in his body but doctors diagnosed Climber with a condition called inferior vena cava at tree Xia. Just disorder can be acquired or congenital. Even the CBN is letting you know that there's a decent chance climber was born with this condition. Right? I looked up other sources on the story and no one mentions whether or not he was vaccinated. I did find a lot of angry blogs saying that the fact that stories don't say whether he was vaccinated as proof that he is and they're covering it up, I think that's dumb. Yeah. Also in July 2021, Ohio, where this high school is located passed a law prohibiting mandates for public schools, so there's literally no reason to just automatically assume that he was vaccinated. Alex doesn't care about the reality of the situation. To him. This story is useful if the kid was vaccinated, so he can make it look like this as a consequence of vaccination. So he doesn't need any proof to justify reporting that he was. That's how simple his brain is and how little he cares about what he tells his audience.

Jordan  1:16:46
I want to I want Alex to sit and watch like a Premier League game. And just every time a soccer player goes down, just be like, Oh my God, that must be vaccine. Oh, he's getting up again. All right. Okay. But I swear to you the next time it's vaccination that caused him to fall, right. I swear, it wasn't a hard tackle. He was vaccinated.

Dan  1:17:04
It wasn't citadines it was

Jordan  1:17:07
long ago. Did that happen here? We have made five at least references pre 2000. Today, I think I think we're old.

Dan  1:17:17
I don't think those preachers Yeah, my I don't know. I

Jordan  1:17:19
know that man forever was like 97 or something like that. I want to say,

Dan  1:17:24
well, I watched that World Cup with my brother, because it was like Don's last world that would have been 2004. That sounds about right. Yeah. And, and now it's you old man trying to remember yours. I saw I saw that headbutt live, I

Jordan  1:17:40
think. Yeah,

Dan  1:17:41
I feel like I did. Because I remember having a who about that. And then there was a rap lyric that, like, I'm like, is the dawn Yeah, like kick it? Yeah. I'll be blowing trees in the mezzanine. Who was that? That was the reverb.

Jordan  1:17:56
I remember that.

Dan  1:17:57
I think I told you about it. Yes. No one else has ever heard that as well. That would make sense. Probably some

Jordan  1:18:05
conversations. Eventually. We got to set a date. Yeah. Yeah.

Dan  1:18:09
My brother was big into the French team of Terry Henry. Okay. That's all I remember is egoli. No, I only remember a couple of those French players. And then the US World Cup team from when I was a kid. Yeah, because they tried really hard to make like Alexei lawless, like a really cool grunge figure, because he had the bread hair and the beard. Yeah. And then there was Marcelo Balboa. They had a cool name can't

Jordan  1:18:37
go wrong with a Marcella bow bow.

Dan  1:18:39
I feel like he did the bicycle kick. And that must you know, some soccer memories.

Jordan  1:18:44
Sometimes you think of you see somebody's name and you think of the moment that their parents named them and you're like, what were they thinking? But after like a Marcela Balboa, they must have high five to like, that's the best name we've ever come up with. If we nailed it,

Dan  1:18:59
like there were a couple other people I remember on that team, but let's let's move on. Let's move on. Because a big name is about show up. Okay. media star Bobby bar. Oh, boy. But he's not on to talk about the trial. All right, ladies

Alex Jones  1:19:12
and gentlemen, constitutional lawyer, historian, good friend of mine. Criminal lawyer. Well, Mark joins us into the next hour. And no, he's not here right now to talk about the show trial and Connecticut. That's important. He's here later to talk credible developments at the start of the next hour. But he's involved suing Pfizer and Robert Kennedy Jr. with the big whistleblower that helped this whole ball start rolling. So I don't get you know, butterflies around Hollywood stars or NFL quarterbacks until they start telling the truth and I do like Aaron Rodgers love him. But But I just get butterflies with Robert Barnes because wherever there's the fight for liberty, wherever there's a battle against tyranny he's there.

Dan  1:19:53
Alex had to save himself because he had just spent a while talking about how cool Aaron Rodgers was. He was on Bill Maher shit and right He was doing some anti Vax nonsense.

Alex Jones  1:20:02
So I got Roger. Yeah, I don't.

Jordan  1:20:07
Yeah. wasn't talking about how Brett five defrauded the welfare system now not talking about that one right now.

Dan  1:20:12
So yeah, Barnes is not talking about the trial he's here to talk about his doom the lawsuits that he's How did

Jordan  1:20:20
he? How did he swindle JFK Jr. and Robert Robert Kennedy?

Dan  1:20:26
I don't think it was hard. That's fair. Yeah, that's fair. I think it works. It's a perfect arrangement for the both of them. It's going nowhere and they'll both scam a bunch of money off their followers for is true. Anyway, sad. Aleksa got to complain a little bit here about his trial

Alex Jones  1:20:43
shows is trending number one, again, every major news channel demonizing us lying about us, and never explaining that you don't find somebody guilty by a judge, and then have a show trial about how guilty are they tying the hands the lawyer in Texas tying the hands in Connecticut, but the difference is, in Texas, the judge would turn the internet feed off, and the cameras would all be like turn it off. But she would spend hours lecturing my lawyer that he couldn't speak people said his lawyers an idiot. Why is he defending because it's a damages hearing where they're having their own trial, but then we can't defend because we're quote guilty, the judges say So you finally understand the damages. He's an independent analyst doesn't work for Infowars. Or for me at this time, he's able to lay this out. He's been doing live streaming with literally over a million viewers yesterday with his co host, no lawyer out of Canada, laying the Shall we got a bunch of clips, but just lay out what's really happening here because this is unprecedented. This judge is sending it all out where she spent two hours telling my lawyer, you can ask questions about this, you can ask questions about that. They said their opening statement, we want to shut him down and take them off air. He says well, I'm going to ask these people. You know, this FBI agent ever said his name. I want to ask, could you talk about taking on software? Nope. You can't ask that question. It's incredible. Explain what's happening.

Dan  1:21:59
So this isn't accurate at all. But what can you really expect? Yeah, Norm strategy, as far as we've seen up to this point is to insist that the plaintiffs or political operatives, who transmuted their grief about a tragedy into activism against the Second Amendment, and they're exaggerating the trauma in order to use money in the legal system as weapons against Alex, because he is the only true supporter of the Second Amendment or something, right. As a consequence of their default sanctions, Alex aside isn't permitted to make certain claims which they could have contested and raised in an actual trial, if they hadn't engaged in a very clear pattern of malicious non participation with the discovery process. As the third day of the trial really seemed to make clear, there are many things that were intentionally withheld from discovery, particularly Google Analytics data, and it's not hard to see the reason that they were withheld probably has to do about how bad they like,

Jordan  1:22:49
confirm whether or not Infowars has ever used Google Analytics, Dan, yeah, I can only go by what Infowars says Now, sure. All those emails, they look like we did. So on

Dan  1:23:01
day three, what we're referring to here, day two, and three have largely been the depth or the questioning of Brittany. Spencer, if you will, the she is the corporate representative. And a lot of Thursday, day three, had to do with the question of Google Analytics, because they were supposed to turn over these Google Analytics data. Right. And they did not and claimed that they just didn't use

Jordan  1:23:28
they don't even use it. Yeah. Especially not for making decisions. Right.

Dan  1:23:32
Yeah. And so there was a lot of instances that were brought up of Google Analytics being referenced in, in emails and snapshots of Google Analytics. JPEGs. Yeah. Which is not the data that is full. It's not a full picture. It's not what was demanded and discovery. Sure, but it does very clearly illustrate that they were lying, and not turning over this for a reason.

Jordan  1:24:02
Well, okay, think so. So okay, so here's what you're gonna say, when we turn this data over to you, because we had a huge spike in traffic. And we knew about that by checking Google Analytics. We use that to decide what our coverage about Sandy Hook going forward would be. And we saw that the right way to do it was to lie about it.

Dan  1:24:24
And apparently, there's a deposition of Alex's dad, David Jones, who said that when something works well, they tried to replicate it. Yeah. Which, again, taken in conjunction with this looks really doesn't

Jordan  1:24:37
look good. Doesn't look good. But have you considered? I've never heard of Google.

Dan  1:24:42
Interesting. Yeah. So this is just the latest example of things that they clearly didn't turn over that were responsive to discovery demands. The texts that Mark produced in the Austin case that included the word Sandy Hook clearly demonstrate either an active decision to not turn them over, or that Infowars didn't even look for the stuff that they were required. or to look for, which is still against the discovery.

Jordan  1:25:04
Yeah, all the rules don't exist you them. Yeah, this song and

Dan  1:25:07
dance got old long ago, but we're in another trial. So we're gonna hear this quite a bit. Yeah, the ultimate irony is that Barnes was Alex's lawyer during a lot of the beginning of the discovery abuse. So he might not be Alex's lawyer now, but he's in essence, the architect of getting Alex into the situation he's in now. Seems like the perfect person to interview about how you're being wronged by the courts.

Jordan  1:25:29
I mean, you can't help but look at this as Barnes's idea, right. Like from the beginning, the idea was don't cooperate. Barnes was their lawyer, I

Dan  1:25:39
think. I think you could maybe make that assumption. incompetence is certainly a possible explanation. It's strange credulity a little bit. Yeah. I don't know if Barnes intended it to get to where it is now.

Jordan  1:25:55
I mean, that is definitely up in the air. Yeah, for sure. Because we have replaced a lot of lawyers, many of whom, in depositions, we've heard implied, we're not stoked about what they were doing. Well,

Dan  1:26:09
and they said that they're considering suing farms for malpractice. So there is that now, the judge in Texas didn't turn off the internet feeds and lecture Alex's lawyer for hours that's just completely made up and actually might be defamatory. Chris Mehdi, the plaintiff's lawyer here in Connecticut did say that a fitting punishment for Alex is to get him off air to make it so he can't profit off hurting people in the future. That could possibly be argued to be a little bit out there in terms of an opening, but I think it's fine. It's a damages hearing, and the lawyer is saying that fitting damages would be to impose whatever punishment makes Alex unable to continue doing this damage in the future. Alex is also misrepresenting the issue with normes questioning of the FBI agent who was the first witness called by the plaintiffs that had to do with Norm asking inappropriate questions about whether or not he was one of the people in Connecticut who had petitioned NBC to not air the Megyn Kelly interview, right? It wasn't trying to take Alex off air per se. And Alex himself filmed a bunch of videos where he was trying to get that interview pulled. So I don't even know what the point is here. Also, Norm had no reason to believe that the guy was involved in that and his conduct was way out of line. It was part of a chain of things. He got reprimanded for where he was trying to present to the jury that Alex is only getting sued because of Hillary Clinton, putting a target on him basically the premise of that cool documentary, Alex's war. Yeah, that fair, impartial documentary, Alex's wars. Great. Sounds very similar to Alex's defense,

Jordan  1:27:36
you know that I just saw one best soundtrack at TIFF did it? Yes, that is what Alex's Ward just did. Wow. Yeah. Yep.

Dan  1:27:49
It was great soundtrack if nothing else,

Jordan  1:27:52
what are you gonna do?

Dan  1:27:53
So Barnes has some thoughts about Nora? What are they? Well, they're good.

Robert Barnes  1:27:59
Are they go to know I wouldn't have thought credit nor if you want to see what good defense advocacy looks like against a rogue judge in a hostile setting. There is no better example that norm Pattice has representations yesterday, and I've recommended watching that video in this part of the trial to people all across the country, even if they're not interested in in this case is particularly because how do you stand up to a judge Alex, Norm Pattis showed how you do so you don't capitulate to rogue judges.

Dan  1:28:28
On the first day of the trial norm almost got the jury excused because he wouldn't stop making inappropriate statements in his opening remarks. On the second day, Norm got chewed out for openly disrespecting the judge and the court by not standing up to make objections. On the third day norm fell asleep for a short stretch, and then quote tweeted a post from Mike Cernovich, who is trying to be edgy about bussing immigrants to Martha's Vineyard. He tweeted, during the while he was at trial and he fell asleep

Jordan  1:28:55
I just the moment like we texted about it because it was the setup for a three stooges bid where where it was like the judge saying to the lawyers in the jury, like hey, you know, it happens sometimes, or the jury has to get up and go out and get up and go out and I'm gonna try not to make you do that. So we're just gonna talk to the lawyers here. And she's telling norm, don't do what you're doing. You can't do that. I'll have to set the chair to the room. And he's like, No, listen, you're right. You're right. I won't do that. And then five seconds later, he does it and she just screamed, get over here. That was the moment where it was like, you can't you've got to be kidding me. This is this isn't allowed

Dan  1:29:35
and then smash cut to like an hour later. He's asleep. But he's got like half ping pong balls.

Jordan  1:29:42
Yes. Yes, it is. It is. Most

Dan  1:29:47
This is not a good job. If you

Jordan  1:29:49
had never seen a trial before ever in your life, you would watch this shit and go man. These things are a lot crazier than I ever would have imagined. Yeah, I thought They were just quiet somber affairs.

Dan  1:30:02
I am saying that. I mean, it's not it's not like, as chaotic as maybe you're making it seem No, not really. Today's Yeah. Mostly when norm decides he's gonna get get a little loose.

Jordan  1:30:12
He's got he's got a Power Up button. Yeah.

Dan  1:30:16
And like I said, it's not fun. It makes me feel on edge. It makes me feel worried. Yeah. Because it's so disrespectful. And, you know, family members are in the courtroom. You know, that is something that has been brought up, right. And the cameras panned a couple times. And I've seen a couple people that I recognize share, and like, that is a reality of this. Yeah. And when norm is being a shithead, right. That's a factor. And yeah, I don't know you should you should grow up. You should also get woke insurance. All right, buddy. So Alex and Barnes are pissed off, man, I just want to make this about Hillary chair.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:55
And what's the one name that is all about what led to this case that this judge says can't be mentioned can't be asked about can't be talked about? can't discuss it. An opening statement, can't discuss it in direct examination, can't discuss it and cross examine

Alex Jones  1:31:08
ran the national TV ads have edited tape of me questioning Sandy, that was my right. And I don't apologize for questioning it. I apologize. You're out of context, hurt somebody's feelings. She literally says you will not bring that up. But she ran $30 million worth of ads, the closing months of the campaign 2016.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:25
In fact, as nordpass Explain this whole case came about because of Hillary Clinton. And yet Hillary Clinton is the one name that can't be talked about can't ask questions about or can't mention an opening statement can't reference into the

Alex Jones  1:31:36
form. He can't talk about anything. She told him yesterday. You've got to say your clients guilty. I found him guilty.

Dan  1:31:42
No, it's you can't try and undo you. You established Yeah. Yeah. That you are liable. It was you have lost by default? Yeah. You can't pretend that you didn't. That's going to ruin the jury. Right? It's going to fuck up the entire case. Yeah, it's

Jordan  1:32:05
like guys, like when he was talking about he was trying to get to admit that she's lying. And he kept saying the word lie. And norm objected, like, you can't say lie that makes it and the judge has to be like, overruled. It is a lie. She can't she can't just say like, no, no, don't ask. It's like, yes, he's She's lying. Yeah. What else is there to say

Dan  1:32:28
much? And the whole thing with Hillary? That's a really interesting thing you could have done in court if you had not gotten yourself defaulted by a clear pattern of abuse of discovery process. Right. I mean, it would have failed as a defense. Yeah, it would have been ridiculous, but it would have been appropriate in that other setting. For

Jordan  1:32:51
for a while until the judge was like, you know, this has nothing to do with anything. Right.

Dan  1:32:56
You are, I believe, allowed to defend yourself by being cut, you know, just completely like saying stuff that is like, well, that doesn't make sense. That's fair. You are entitled to a nonsensical defense. Suppose you're not in this setting. Right. The damages hearing it is a damages hearing you things are established as real. Yep. Yeah. So they don't seem to understand or I mean, it's obviously false, not understanding. Sure. But why? Bill Oldenburg, the FBI agent, yeah, is a plaintiff

Unknown Speaker  1:33:33
knowing that you have a case supposed to be about damages. And yet almost none of the evidence presented has anything to do with damages. And their look at their lead witness for all these people. Like there's the media has covered everybody except their lead plaintiff in the case, who's the lead plaintiff there was the first witness who testified. It was not a parent of anybody who died. It's not a sibling of anybody who died at Sandy Hook. It's an FBI lawyer, an FBI lawyer, he's the one who is their lead number one plaintiff and writing

Alex Jones  1:33:59
as they're doing is setting the precedent where the garbage man I never said his name. I question something he can show me. This is bureaucrats setting the precedent to shoot people that disagree with them.

Dan  1:34:10
No, no, it's not. Nope. But Barnes has decided that because he was the first witness, you can tell what this is all about.

Jordan  1:34:17
Isn't that evidence, though, that it's not about Alex being called the person who did the thing at Sandy Hook if the FBI agent isn't a member of the nevermind.

Dan  1:34:29
Well, I will say that Alex does again say that his people he knows and his lawyers don't know who Adam Lanza is which again, is shockingly poor preparation on their part, if that's true, which it's not

Unknown Speaker  1:34:43
Yeah. Here's a high ranking, well regarded FBI counsel, right that that's who this guy is. This isn't some low level, schmuck. This is and he's their lead number one plaintiff testifying witness that tells you what this case is really all about. out. This case is not about Sandy Hook. This case is not even really about the parents and the families or they would have been the first witness up for these lawyers. Instead, it's an FBI lawyer saying who admits you never even talked about him. You never even mentioned him. You never even referenced him never.

Alex Jones  1:35:19
He sued me.

Dan  1:35:20
Bill Oldenburg is likely their first witness because he has a very powerful story about being one of the people who responded to the school who had seen the horrors of what had happened firsthand, and then was subjected to a campaign of harassment and attacks because of information put out by Wolfgang Halbig and endorsed by Alex, this has to do with the accusation that he was an actor and accusations that he and one of the parents were the same person. So it is all connected to the exact same stuff that is relevant to everybody. Right? Barnes knows this. He's just a piece of shit. And he's pretending that this is just an FBI lawyer because Barnes is a piece of shit. Sticks and stones, buddy. Don't worry about it. Yeah, just an insult you piece of shit. Yeah. Also weird that Barnes doesn't bring up that the second witness was Carly Soto who is a relative of Victoria Soto. Yeah, so teacher at the school who died? Yeah, her testimony, I guess you can really only get the sense of a case by the first witness, not the second day? Um, do you probably want to just ignore that? Because it was

Jordan  1:36:17
especially, especially a four week long trial? Yeah.

Dan  1:36:21
Another thing to keep in mind is that what has been covered does have a lot to do with damages. And that aspect of this case, it's just that acknowledging that is really dangerous for Alex and Barnes. First of all, the angles of these people have experienced is incredibly relevant. Secondly, the details about Alex's business operation and how things work internally demonstrate the extent to which they were aware of the profitability of acting in ways that cause that anguish. It's all super relevant. And if Barnes really wanted a chance to deal with his stupid arguments in court, he had his shot. I guess he could probably bring some of this stuff up to defend himself when Alex Suzan for malpractice if that ends up happening. But yeah, probably won't. Yeah, that'd be well,

Jordan  1:37:02
they're there their entire deal right now is is trying to obfuscate the the the connection points between, you know, like, because here's the here's a fact, you know, this is how their business works here. This is a fact, this is what they did. This is a fact, this is what happened, all of those things. There are those connecting points that the lawyers have to get to, you know, like, here's how we directly connect those two things. Yeah. And that's the only place where they can argue is just like, I'm going to attack this connection. And if I can attack the connection, I'm going to attack whatever the space around it is. Or you could yell Hillary. Well, I mean, it's all Hillary. That's what connects all of them. Well,

Dan  1:37:46
I mean, Alex, I think you could argue he's afraid of Hillary. Actually, you couldn't. Alex is not afraid of anything oh

Jordan  1:38:00
this song should be evidence. loaded in there, he won't change his life.

Alex Jones  1:38:11
Listen, listeners. You want somebody to take on the globalist. You want somebody that's fearless. I don't even see that as a good point in my life, and I am fearless. I'd add what's known as brave Dave once and I just can't help it. I don't have fear. Only fear. I gots the fear of brave, the dentist gentleman. And we are now on the front lines of the fight against the New World Order. And you want to back your family you want to back the future. You want to fund something that's at the tip of the spear is a slashing and crashing under total attack and who loves that? We're at ladies and gentlemen. So go now to 1776 coin.com as a fundraiser. Oh my god the coin coffee on NPR fundraisers?

Jordan  1:39:03
Yeah, you know, there is something about a good jab that either makes you want to dance or say inspirational yelling things.

Dan  1:39:10
You know what is true that NPR sells memberships and you get gifts for the memberships that would cost less if you just bought them at a store like a mug or something? There's a slight difference though, and I don't think I would be super into paying that much for a mug. If Kira is doll was desperately yelling at me to buy the mugs. We can pay his legal expenses to fight a lawsuit that he's already lost about how he defame family members of murdered children. Yeah, then I don't think I would get into the pledge drive. Yeah, if he's just like, hey, Marketplace is a show that I do. Just

Jordan  1:39:41
Just so everybody knows we're doing our fundraiser right now. We're opening subscriptions for as many people as we can because we have been sued by the families of Remingtons owners and really

Dan  1:39:55
it is just Hillary Clinton trying to destroy

Jordan  1:40:02
There's something about the PVS.

Dan  1:40:05
We're not allowed to defend ourselves. The connections between these law firms and Hillary are very clear any

Jordan  1:40:13
kangaroo court, they have already decided.

Dan  1:40:21
So Barnes has some choice words for the Conservatives out there who aren't helping. Sure. And then Alex says something that confused me.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:28
Okay. All of the conservative institutional press, anybody that's involved on the legal side should be embarrassed and humiliated that they're defending this case, I dare any of them to watch yesterday's proceeding and call that a fair trial to call that the the beacon of American civil justice. America's justice system is supposed to be the beacon of justice to the world. And right now it looks like a dystopian nightmare.

Alex Jones  1:40:50
It looks like Venezuela, right? I mean, I've seen him in this way. Just now.

Jordan  1:40:53
Just now.

Dan  1:40:54
Alex, what Venezuelan show trials of use. What What are you talking about

Jordan  1:41:01
Venezuelan show trials? Name one. There was Hugo Chavez.

Dan  1:41:07
What he

Jordan  1:41:08
was tried in Venezuela. Which

Dan  1:41:10
one what trial we talked about

Jordan  1:41:12
the one word that was that was the show try

Dan  1:41:14
Alex watch

Jordan  1:41:15
that he watched the whole thing. I all the, you know, I just think that's silly Castro. He was on trial.

Dan  1:41:22
So why don't we fuck Barnes. He's, he's out. Yeah. And Alex has another guest. And it's our boy Roger. And he has an interesting take. This shocked me. It's too blunt. It's bizarre. It's about something that we're not supposed to talk about on Infowars.

Alex Jones  1:41:40
Okay, let's, let's get into the waterfront here. I'm gonna give you the floor.

Roger Stone  1:41:45
One of the things that's disturbing me right now, Alex, are the actions of Peter Thiel. For those of you who don't know Peter Thiel is a billionaire was a major financier of Donald Trump's candidacy.

Dan  1:41:57
So real quick, just just a button here. Peter Thiel is not a name that is usually brought up on Infowars. Right. Second, you're not supposed to acknowledge that Peter Thiel was a giant funder of Trump's

Jordan  1:42:09
campaign. Well, he was self funded with Peter TEALS. Money,

Dan  1:42:13
right. But But associating this right wing billionaire guy with funding Trump is not something that is generally an acceptable, but Rogers bringing it out. But he has some other problems. Gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:28
And he stepped forward, essentially to underwrite it 10s of millions of dollars, the endorsements of JD Vance for the US Senate in Ohio, and Blake Master's in mass in Arizona, that might add that I very strongly support both of them America first candidates, but having financed their nominations, Mr. Thiel is now declining to finance their general election efforts. And both of them are behind their opponents slightly, and behind their opponents in fundraising. Mr. Tim comes forward and says, Well, the Republican Party has not defined enough of a positive image a positive program for this election. Alex, all elections are about the incumbent party, about the job that is being done by congressional Democrats in combination with the Biden White House.

Dan  1:43:22
So Roger is problem with Peter Thiel is that he gave these guys a bunch of money, right in order to run their primary campaigns. Right. And now they are unpopular and not raising money. And Peter Thiel isn't continuing to give them millions of dollars to, to prop up their general campaign. Right. Right. That's an interesting gripe, no,

Jordan  1:43:44
here's the problem. Okay. These candidates, all right, sold themselves to a billionaire. Right, right. And the billionaire bought them. But then the billionaire tossed them away. That's not fair. replace

Dan  1:43:55
this with a Democratic candidate and George Soros. And

Jordan  1:43:59
here's how much here's how much it costs to own a politician. Might as well be what he's saying. Would you like to own a politician? This is here's, here's how much you have to spend. Roger. Wow,

Dan  1:44:12
Roger. Anyway, Roger has some other complaints. This one about Kevin McCarthy? Sure.

Alex Jones  1:44:18
Please continue. Just give us your analysis. That's what I want of the midterms.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:24
And then secondarily, you have Kevin McCarthy, who kind of following in the footsteps of Newt Gingrich has put forward a proposal that is kind of reminiscent of the Contract for America. problem with this is that in order to have a policy statement, broad enough for every Republican to support, all one needs to do is to look at the flip side of the Biden administration. In other words, why don't we putting forward pay No pastels, we need to have a bold policy but it's easily defined as being the direct opposite of that, which the Democrats are for.

Dan  1:45:09
See Roger is really smart here. You can create a fake version of your enemy and then define yourself as the opposite of it and trick people into supporting you for no reason. It's basically the story of Alex's career. Hey, guys, stop it. Just say you're the opposite of this. Right? We don't like this. But I mean, all this is basically Roger, his entire take on the midterms in this interview is just classic Roger. Attack, don't defend ever attack. If this midterm is going to be about us being worried about your trial about the Sandy Hook stuff about ban and getting arrested about Mike Lind Dells phone being taken away. Trump is being in trouble. If the MAR a Lago raid if we're going to, like play those games at all. We're fucked. Yeah, we need to just attack Biden on everything. Yep. I mean, it's just classic Roger Stone. Yeah. Tactics. Yeah. I mean, yeah, not interesting.

Jordan  1:46:09
No, no, it'd been it would be better if he was like, he reminds me of whenever I was an intern for Nixon's campaign. And he was like, Should we just say whites only? And I was like, No, don't say it. In opposition to

Dan  1:46:24
me, I was hanging out with a young Bernstein.

Jordan  1:46:28
And I said, are you gonna say whites only on your show? And he said, No, no, no, no, not today.

Dan  1:46:34
So Alex wants to know, yeah, the big question. Is Trump running bro. Oh, my God.

Alex Jones  1:46:40
Roger Stone. Trump. We know he told a lot of people including you and mg MTG, in early July, he was set to announce and he said, Well, I'm gonna run. But I'm not gonna announce when Well, that's an announcement. Iran strategically created all this law fair. And all these fake criminal charges. Try to go after him. What is the inside baseball currently on Trump running? And is the announcement intimate? Or watch unfolding?

Unknown Speaker  1:47:04
Alex, the only thing that's predictable about Donald J Trump is that he's entirely unpredictable. In a certain that's not good presidential on his home in Mar Lago has galvanized his support so that I don't think a an immediate announcement of candidacy is either, you know, in the offing, or necessarily desirable.

Dan  1:47:27
So maybe it'll be a little while.

Jordan  1:47:29
Maybe. I mean, I am. I am now enlisting the Mad Hatter to run for president. Because if the only thing that you guys need is that it's unpredictable, Dude, I got news for you.

Dan  1:47:46
Yeah, it's it's you don't want you don't want to study? Hey, and that's, that's crazy. So Roger, doesn't think that Trump's necessarily going to announce anytime soon and they weren't wrong to play around about I was gonna do it on Fourth of July.

Jordan  1:48:02
No, totally. Totally. Very cool. Super awesome.

Dan  1:48:05
But yeah, it looks like Rogers got another definite.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:10
I happen to believe that Governor Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, my Governor intends to announce his candidacy literally, immediately after the election. And I think the President remain needs to remain mindful of that. I still think it is more likely than not that he will be akin. I

Alex Jones  1:48:28
just heard a record skipping noise. We're gonna put this on the front of the interview. Once it's posted demand on video. Roger Stone is rarely wrong about his political. I'm sorry, what analysis you're saying you're inside baseball, or is that just your opinion, the Shanice will announce after the midterms in 56 days.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:45
That is, that's hard intelligence. Alex, that's not just my instinct. That's hard intelligence. And by the way, as President Donald Trump has said, Ron DeSantis has the right to do that. It's his prerogative to run if he wishes to run.

Dan  1:49:00
Oh, wow. Trump said it was cool. Wow. Here's Trump's permission to run

Jordan  1:49:04
it. What a good boy, what a good boy. He's been he got a pat on the head.

Dan  1:49:08
So it's hard Intel? We'll see. She says, I mean, I wouldn't be too surprised. It does end up it would make sense.

Jordan  1:49:15
Yeah. It wouldn't make as much sense if he did it on the Fourth of July.

Dan  1:49:21
Take him back America. Yeah. So Alex has another idea about this.

Alex Jones  1:49:27
We got a secret agreement to run together.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:31
It the Electoral College prevents that you

Alex Jones  1:49:34
cannot from Florida. Correct. You cannot

Unknown Speaker  1:49:36
have a president and a vice president from the same state. Because if you do you would forfeit the electoral votes of Florida's 27 votes. That's too precious for us to do

Alex Jones  1:49:47
but good. Just swing back Cheney lives in New York again.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:51
Do you think he wants to pay New York state income taxes? I think not.

Dan  1:49:54
Wow, this President seems cool.

Jordan  1:49:57
I mean, cheese. Oh, sure. A Billy Do you think he wants to pay a slight percent or

Dan  1:50:02
you think that he cares enough about this country to pay tax more taxes? I

Jordan  1:50:07
mean, come on, man, that the amount of grift that's open that Roger can just talk about as being a grifter that's acceptable to say is happening, because fuck it.

Dan  1:50:19
Yeah. You know, once Roger found God, I guess maybe I don't I don't give a shit. What am I?

Jordan  1:50:24
I'm not gonna lie about how I'm a liar. Okay, I'm gonna tell the truth as God intended about how I lie to everyone all the time.

Dan  1:50:32
Yeah. So we got some false flags coming, right? Yeah, of course. Absolutely. It's the midterms.

Alex Jones  1:50:37
False flags. I'm not a rocket scientist, but I'm also not stupid. When you've got Hillary and Democrat Party members like Tim Ryan yesterday, they're everywhere, saying Republicans are terrorists. They're gonna blow stuff up. Republicans are illegal. They're the biggest terror group. It's imminent. They're gonna get history. I mean, we saw the Whitmer staged attack. We saw January 6, provocateur. It's not even two plus two equals four. It's the number one is the number one there obviously provoca tearing or planning suddenly 55 days out your take on that? How do we counter it?

Unknown Speaker  1:51:08
You know, as I have said here on the show, and in other places, I still yet a fear some other kind of manufactured health crisis, some kind of additional pandemic, that when you

Alex Jones  1:51:21
predicted that six months ago, they tried monkey pox. It didn't work. But you're right. I already tried to try how they try

Jordan  1:51:27
out it it now work. They tried monkey pox because they didn't kill enough of the rest of us. But

Dan  1:51:32
how did it not work? If Alex has this conception that these super powerful evil people can just launch pandemics whenever they want and all this? Why didn't it work? According to Alex, what is what? What? How? How is there a supervillain group that goes through all the effort, right launching a bio weapon, and then they're sitting in their their bunker, their underground base, and they're like, fuck, it didn't work. Well,

Jordan  1:52:02
well, well. Now, what you need to understand though, is that the devil is impatient. Which is why he did the whole falling thing in the first place and years behind, and he's a quitter. He's the eight. Listen, oh, shit, the monkey pox thing. It didn't work. Pack it up, pack it up. We're on to the next idea. I don't know it's pinking in the brain. This is stupid. That is who Alex is fighting against. So I told you, we'd

Dan  1:52:27
get back to Alex's bankruptcy strategy. thing. Yes. And how dicey? Yes. And that's that comes here. This is after if Roger leaves, and like, there's a weird tone, after I will discuss that here in a minute. But first bankruptcy thing,

Alex Jones  1:52:41
the strategy in the last fake trial where I'm already found guilty a month ago, this new one, where the judge is promising to hold me in contempt or even get there next week is that I have hundreds of millions of dollars on my children. I don't have a million half dollars in the bank. And as big an operations This is that's like on E. And I don't want to get into all this. But just a week ago, we're like, Hey, we're doing well, in the chapter five bankruptcy, all we got to do is prove or profitable. And then whatever judgments they have can't shut us down. Because whatever profit there is the future these jerks get but who cares, we're on air, we don't care about money. And they're openly saying get rid of bankruptcy is shutting down to the bankruptcy judge. The judge is like, well, that's not what you're supposed to do so

Dan  1:53:24
so if you understand what he's saying, basically, what he's trying to do in bankruptcy court is artificially inflate the amount of money that's coming into the business to make it appear that he's profitable and solvent by just doing these things, like, you know, the release of the book and the 1776 coin, check all this stuff, just like really pushing that that shit hard. In order to and the presenting things as a fundraiser. Sure, the overpriced pneus of the coin, the markup on the book and stuff. These things are in order to create the appearance of a business doing well. So he can coast through the bankruptcy court and make it he won't be able to keep it up after that. No. But then ideally, I guess, his image of it is that like, they won't crush me. I'll just not have money to give them a leader or something. It's a bad strategy, but I also think it's, it feels fraudulent.

Jordan  1:54:31
I mean, it does feel like Alex is just coming out and saying on his show. I'm betting they won't find all my money. Yeah, like it may mean it might as well he might as well be like listen, I've hidden a lot of money. They're not gonna find all of it. Like that might as well be what he's saying.

Dan  1:54:48
It does feel that way. Yeah. And will be able to, like just sort of Sully Sullenberger land Yeah or whatever. Yeah, not gonna be a runway.

Jordan  1:54:59
Listen, it's not gonna be great. Nobody's gonna be happy. But we survived. We're gonna get awards when we land this thing because it is impossible to land

Dan  1:55:07
now, one last clip here and this just really captures the vibe towards the end of the show. It's a bummer

Jordan  1:55:21
Lord, I cannot change you wanna go? As far away today freedom comes from the car not all

Alex Jones  1:56:05
crimes and the vaccine poison will bring our border or will bring us down. The barrel is now joined as they try to openly kill us. Let's play some clips here. This isn't about our shows. It's about the murder of free speech, the murder of the process. Here is the judge the puppet judge, the plaintiffs had already found us guilty. Now they still want to fake show trial and the damages. Trying to pre screen my lawyers questions. So you wonder why my lawyer in Texas couldn't talk. He was threatened with sanctions if he did.

Dan  1:56:40
So it just plays clips from the trial by himself. Like comes in from break with his weird Lana Del Rey thing. But like, here's the vibe. It's like he's had his friends on. Yeah, had a party. You know, like Barnes and him. Were talking about the case and they're having fun. He's coming in with like,

Jordan  1:56:59
Freebird now he's looking at his empty bottles

Jordan  1:57:07
got the bag? He's putting shit in there. Like,

Unknown Speaker  1:57:10
I can't believe they lift all this stuff on the floor. No, no,

Dan  1:57:12
no, no, no, no. It's 3am 4am. Okay, he's still drunk.

Jordan  1:57:18
Gin drunk. Yeah, he's

Dan  1:57:21
ginger. He's just like, all my friends have gone home. Up here alone. I have to soothe myself by doing an amazing duet with her. And then just complaining about my own victimhood. And by myself

Jordan  1:57:39
if that was a commercial, and Alex was like sitting on a bus with his head leaning against the window, as the song played, and it just money, power. Like that's that's what Zoloft like that's what you're looking for.

Dan  1:57:55
It just it just had the vibe. I can't I can't stress this enough. It felt so much like a guy whose friends have left. But he still is drunk and has to finish something. Yeah. You know, there's something that like, there's a deadline he has as an he has, like 10 minutes he has left to do of his show. Sure. So he can't stop. Right, right. Good. Just play a special report. But he wants to complain about how he's getting jammed up. No, he's

Jordan  1:58:19
still got two shots left in the vodka bottle. Right. And he's just sitting there. It's right in front of them. And he's getting sadder. But I can just go to bed at anytime I could drink these tomorrow night.

Dan  1:58:28
Yeah, no big deal. But I mean, I'm just not gonna let him sit. It made me sad. They're so lonely. It made me sad. But then I realized that I don't really care. I don't have much, much. Fluffy. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. So I would say that the first couple days of the trial have been quite interesting. Two days of just the plaintiff's attorney questioning of corporate representative Brittany pause. Yeah, so that Li like they ended with they're still probably, you know, tomorrow, Friday, absolutely. Probably still going to be some questioning pause. And then there's going to be cross examination. Or you know, like, norm is going to get to come in there. Oh, my God asked some questions that I don't get anywhere.

Jordan  1:59:16
What isn't even a match? What i Yeah. i Do you like me? That's the only question I could think of. Am I cool? How do you feel about that? Check? I said, You're not big enough. Is it? Hey,

Dan  1:59:33
do you want to come work for me? We offer a lot of fringe benefits. Woke insurance.

Unknown Speaker  1:59:38
Oh, man, you're

Jordan  1:59:39
never gonna stop. He did it. He

Dan  1:59:41
started it. I know. So yeah, we'll be back on Monday with the check in on Alex's Thursday and Friday for sure. Gonna try and keep up with the things going on during the trial Right. Which is unfortunate because this show sucks. But hey, it is what it is. Sometimes you get to hear it. Sadly singing long clamshell right. So we'll be back Jordan, what do you tell them?

Jordan  2:00:05
