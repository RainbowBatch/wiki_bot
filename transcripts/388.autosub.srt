1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B B I'm sick of imposing

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,952
Everybody

6
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,792
We're couple dudes exit around Jack novelty beverages. A little bit about Alex

7
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,072
Jones

8
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,864
Jordan

9
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,656
Let me ask you a quick

10
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
Sure

11
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,240
How have you traditionally dealt with being in a

12
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,264
Creative

13
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:20,128
Not well

14
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,688
I mean there were a number of years where was booze

15
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,016
Certainly that would be a go-to of like I

16
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,160
I'm stuck I can't get anything done

17
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,208
Certainly that didn't work

18
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,256
No I've known

19
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,024
Weatherforyou

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,840
I guess actually I kind of do have an answer for you

21
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120
Incredibly unsatisfied

22
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,912
Is just keep working

23
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,496
That's the only thing that I've ever found

24
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,848
Americans like it in pastimes things like meditation and mindfulness

25
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
I have

26
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,664
Yielded some positive results

27
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:59,296
But I would be kind of putting on airs if I use that is like an actual

28
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,832
Actual piece of advice

29
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,880
It's not really a consistent part of my life

30
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,672
But

31
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,952
Just keep making things

32
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,232
Keep moving forward

33
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,632
It was something I was impressed upon me in some but I believe some like creative writing class I took Longo's like

34
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,192
You can't control

35
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,728
The quality of what Euchre

36
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,032
Sometimes things will be good

37
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,312
Sometimes things will be bad

38
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
But you can

39
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
Control

40
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
Quantity

41
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,688
Answer if you create 100 things and

42
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
Three are good

43
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:34,112
That's better than sitting around and trying desperately to create that one good thing and not allowing your

44
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
Yourself to do any

45
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
Anything get anything done

46
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,184
Unless it's

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
Is good as white

48
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,256
Sorry I would say

49
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,816
That's probably that ice just keep doing stuff keep work

50
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,400
Eventually exercise

51
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,520
Uno oversight of what you put out or what you release

52
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
Well drive

53
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,360
I see those 97

54
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,944
And they think that oh my God he's crazy things they're all amazing

55
00:02:59,456 --> 00:02:59,968
That's the key

56
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,736
That's the trick

57
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,016
So

58
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,832
This is been my episode of masterclass

59
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,392
I think you did great

60
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,464
Navigate to Fort Gordon Ramsay

61
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,072
Just keep doing things

62
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,120
Amanda lot about Alex

63
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,912
And I know a little bit about books

64
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,728
Right so Jordans a bag of the present today

65
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,520
I wanted to check in

66
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:28,128
Since we had the 2013 episode on Monday and so I started

67
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,920
Listening to January 12th

68
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,712
That was Sunday's episode

69
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,808
And I got incredibly bored at stop listening halfway through

70
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,344
Only to be here

71
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
Right in the face

72
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,720
With something terrifying on the January 13th Monday episode

73
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,024
That is what would be going over today

74
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,584

Knowledge

117
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
Maybe very

118
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,167
Now Jordan before we get down to

119
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,727
Today's episode

120
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,031
Cause of dissension in the ranks

121
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,359
Between you and me know

122
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:11,711
I want to split the audience to out-of-context drop

123
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,039
And I would like the audience to sound off on which

124
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,111
They think is a better out of context drops her but I

125
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
So here's the first one

126
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,183
Is a little bit too heavy

127
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:27,839
You know what I really think about the world plus a on there like I say things on air I never

128
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:33,471
The whole world

129
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:38,847
The secret place

130
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,151
Is this Buddhism what is happening right now

131
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:45,247
The only place you really can be private and public

132
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,087
Set the first option one here's the second.

133
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,159
Innovation horses are psychic and that's been proven

134
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,279
Psychic horse

135
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:01,631
Secret secret horses

136
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:06,751
Team psychic or public place

137
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
No f****** rat

138
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
Okay.

139
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
So we're starting on the 12th

140
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,431
Because I wasn't

141
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:18,015
It's it's interesting cuz this is a Sunday show that is absolutely

142
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:23,647
In the mold of the we're going to soft launch some narratives this is definitely that

143
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,183
Sort of Sunday shower he's

144
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,719
Doing a trial run

145
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,767
You know we're not on the main show

146
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,303
World Neon vastation

147
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,607
The carry the Sunday show whatever

148
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,655
Diminished viewership psychic horses

149
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,447
Let's get down to it

150
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
And see

151
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,775
How this feels coming out of my mouth

152
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
So I would start a couple of narratives writing

153
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
At the top of the show and

154
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,895
Pizza Fair

155
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
Absurd

156
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,063
January 12th, Sunday broadcast 2020

157
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,463
We have definitely enter the quickening everything hit is now beginning

158
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,863
They revealed she's going to be a bumpy ride

159
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,423
Californian textbooks for 8

160
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:13,567
Raiders officially have blood-drinking and vampirism as part of sexual pleasure

161
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,895
The multiple pages

162
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
That's coming up

163
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:24,319
All right how many years have we been in the quickening now so many

164
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:30,207
This is a difficult story to tell exactly what Alex was talking about cuz of the phrasing of it it's

165
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,743
No that's not

166
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Super

167
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,791
Easily googleable

168
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:39,679
Okay so it turns out this is just an article that Alex is employee John bowne wrote for the Infowars website

169
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
That's all

170
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
That's what we got

171
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,335
Even if you believe everything that's in John Brown's article which I do not Alex is still wrong

172
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:52,991
He's here on are saying that the stuff is being taught to 8th graders when the article specifically says that it's part of curriculum for

173
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Through 12th graders

174
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,319
Alex Jones cannot help him

175
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:00,159
Himself he just reflexively embellishes literally everything he talks

176
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439
It's you just

177
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
Got to lie

178
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,511
Adelita

179
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,351
Now as to whether or not California students are being taught about blood-drinker

180
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
A sexual pleasure

181
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,703
I'm not sure that this article johnbowne route established

182
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
Does that

183
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
According to bounds article

184
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
He saw Facebook

185
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:22,687
Post on a page for a treaty out

186
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:30,111
A post on the Facebook page for group called informed parents of Washington they claimed that there was a book called

187
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,695
Sex that was on the suggested reading list for high school students

188
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
McDonald's

189
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:42,143
First problem this is just a Facebook page which is not a sturdy Foundation to use as a base for your reporting

190
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,679
Second problem

191
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,983
This is the inform parents of Washington talking

192
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
S*** about education

193
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:47,775
California

194
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,335
Which seems like them working across purposes

195
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,151
Doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense why this is

196
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:58,271
Susan their purview

197
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,319
Truly informed parents group

198
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
From wash

199
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,671
About Washington

200
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,951
Yeah that they could be in a

201
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,279
At my work all right except

202
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:16,959
Quote to the textbook allegedly contained a chapter on anal sex and vampiric sexual practices known as blood play

203
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:22,335
First of all this is not a textbook and even according to that article it wasn't required reading

204
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,127
Is just on a suggested list

205
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,271
If you know anything about high schoolers most of them are not going to do much reading or homework that is not required

206
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
Also

207
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,647
Blood-play is not inherently satanic or vampiric

208
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,975
Do some participants May liquor even drink each other's blood

209
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,791
But my position on this is sort of like

210
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,631
If they're doing this responsibly in both parties are Intuit who cares

211
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:49,471
Alex pretends to be a Libertarian so he should care even less than I do

212
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
The issue here and what are the reason

213
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,847
I could see this being very valuable as like

214
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
Some information

215
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,967
You're being there in a sex-ed program available to

216
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,527
To the student is that kind of play Canby

217
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,367
Be pretty dangerous if you're in if you're not engaging in it responsibly

218
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,415
It's a pretty wide

219
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,487
Spread kink like that super Universal but it's 12

220
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
The number of people I have

221
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,375
Which tends to imply that it's not just going to go way if the right-wing pretends it doesn't

222
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:21,983
Exist due to make sure people who are drawn to that cake

223
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:28,895
Best thing is to have them make sure they have all the information they need you do not understand the right-wing sites

224
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,919
Sex education

225
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,711
All right person for me

226
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,503
Abstinence-only

227
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
No gloss

228
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
Bien

229
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:41,439
I could see why you definitely don't need to make blood play front-and-center in yourself

230
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,511
Curriculum but it feels appropriate to have some resources

231
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
Is available for people if they want

232
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:52,447
That is fun the idea that everybody coming into the sex-ed class is already so very so it's like well we got to find something new

233
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
I just heard about

234
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,799
Blood play on a Facebook post let's get on this

235
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:03,711
Facebook page for inform parents of Washington and let me Begin by a review of it by saying

236
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,783
Probably be a bit embarrassed if I use this as primary

237
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:14,207
As best as I can tell from scrolling all the way down there time live this page first posted on December 9th 2019

238
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,743
It's been about around about a year

239
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,303
Airome s220 followers

240
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
It's completely anonymous

241
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,423
Obsessed with anti-sex education news

242
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,983
There's very little emphasis even on washing

243
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
Your theory about it just being

244
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
Informed but not about Washington

245
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
Might be accurate

246
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,639
This is barely even a real group

247
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,967
An Infowars is picked up his Facebook post from them and relied on it too

248
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
The source of their reporting

249
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
This is really embarrassing

250
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Stuff

251
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:45,695
And later I even learned I think the John bowne article is based on an article on National file which again is

252
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Run by Alex's

253
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,743
Employee Tom pepper

254
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:54,143
Man so they're even laundering it through a second but it all traces back to this Facebook

255
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
Oh what

256
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,215
What tangled webs we weave when first

257
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
We spout bolts

258
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,591
Also even according to this Infowars story on this

259
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,175
Following a massive public outcry it was removed

260
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
That's right

261
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,015
Facebook they're still offended by

262
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:15,903
Who is Betty was on the suggested reading list isn't even on that list anymore because they complained really loudly

263
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:20,511
That's classic info complete bullshits been on a poorly sourced

264
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,583
Story covering a non-problem that they've already got their way on

265
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:28,703
The bunch of assholes just a bunch of clothes just never going to

266
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:33,823
Empires are in the schools superpro vaccine

267
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,455
I'm sure children

268
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,015
There we go

269
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:48,159
The un's had officials admit major vaccine deaths and Andre cover-ups

270
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,743
So that's the next arrogant meaning of x

271
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
Scene cover up

272
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:59,167
So this article or this story appears to be based on a national file article like I said run by Alex's work

273
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,751
So this is a story about doctor

274
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,799
Soumya swaminathan

275
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,079
Giving a speech

276
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,919
She's leading you and World Health Organization doctor

277
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:15,295
And researcher site is just giving a speech which is basically about how there's a lack of

278
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,343
Thorough safety monitoring systems

279
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,951
In many countries around the world and it creates Optics were propagandists can latch onto

280
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,511
Some ambiguities and use it to attack

281
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
There we go

282
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:31,679
She's not saying there's a cover-up just advocating that the international Health Organization to do better and more comprehensive

283
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,727
The job so anti-vax people can't wiggle into

284
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
To the Grave

285
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,799
She does say that their deaths

286
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,359
Actually could be traced to vaccines but no one disputes

287
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,943
Alex's pretending that this is some kind of a giant admission

288
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,991
When it's literally just how medicine

289
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:50,367
There isn't a medicine or treatment on this planet that I'm aware of it doesn't have some death

290
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,695
So this is definitely not her slipping up and revealing

291
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,743
There's some kind of a cover-up going on

292
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,559
You know it's funny to me that I think

293
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,119
Alex prefers doctors from

294
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:07,519
The 15th century who would be like bloodletting is a great idea

295
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,823
The cover-up of how leeches are real men

296
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,127
Exactly one hundred percent

297
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
I don't doubt that

298
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,271
So Alex is pretending

299
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,575
He and his crew been poring over hours and

300
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
Hours of footage

301
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
It's from this world

302
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,439
Health Organization Summit where this woman gave this

303
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:31,839
Speed in reality the only thing ever produces is a video that some anti-vax group that he doesn't name create

304
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,399
Which includes a very short clip of doctor

305
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
Hasan minhaj

306
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
How to

307
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
Contacts

308
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,495
I find this narrative super run

309
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,311
Compelling is Alex really had some kind of a smoking

310
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,103
Gone like he's claiming he has

311
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,175
He would have released the entire raw footage of this meeting

312
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:51,295
Like is he saying I'll putting it out and we have copies of going over it

313
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,111
I'm going to go out on a limb and guess at the reason he's not doing

314
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,391
What is casinos

315
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
The context

316
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
Did the larger conversation

317
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,279
What time does contradicted narrative he's building it's not in his best interest

318
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
To write

319
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
2 allows

320
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:08,191
Yeah that's what happens whenever you start stealing Facebook post from the informed parents of Oklahoma

321
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,751
Write a lot worse anti-vax it going

322
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
There's actually more to this that I looked into the will get into little bit later sort of Trace down some of the roots of

323
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,455
Where this is all coming from but for now I

324
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
Just found like

325
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,295
And bring this up like this is a very uncompelling narrative

326
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,111
Just sloppy work and is anti-vax

327
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:26,879
Crusade

328
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
But

329
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
Little did I know

330
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
CI work

331
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:37,631
Quite a bit like on the show I do a lot of reading a lot of preparation added a lot of

332
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,215
Just sort of wine I'm not complaining

333
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,031
But I didn't know how much more Alex works

334
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,591
Because I hadn't I hadn't

335
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,895
Considered that all this time that like

336
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,687
I think he's sleeping

337
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,479
He's actually working

338
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,759
I don't believe

339
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
Making stuff up here

340
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,391
I don't believe that either that the time I'm dead on Act

341
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,207
Let's just move on from that

342
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,327
Play the people that I do

343
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,351
Blow smoke

344
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
I really lived inside

345
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,215
I had 8 hours of rain last night

346
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,287
In my dreams

347
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
Delivery

348
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,359
Clarion Murray Central and I

349
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,663
I was working the whole time

350
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,015
On what was going to happen what we're going to do

351
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
Fully committed

352
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:32,415
Look I'm not one of these guys who's like real like

353
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:38,303
Wet blanket e about the potential of the subconscious and I just don't believe Alex

354
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
Doc invent

355
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,471
Time travel in his dream

356
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:51,871
Does this imply that maybe he was going over some of the footage of the World Health Organization it is green

357
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,199
Who was the original inventor of DreamWorks Animation

358
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,735
There's only one explanation

359
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:01,599
I would I would say if there's some explaining Tori power in the fact that he works in his dreams

360
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
The fact that you

361
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,903
Afraid of vampires

362
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:10,303
Able to draw a line between his obsession with vampires

363
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:15,167
And Nightmares 58 hours

364
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
I'm that makes me angry

365
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,495
I can't get 8 hours

366
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,031
Neither can I

367
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
I went to bed at midnight last night and

368
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
And got up at

369
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:27,455
Too because I hadn't fallen asleep laying in bed for 2 hours straight

370
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,783
Like I said

371
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Alex is afraid of a

372
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,599
They talked about that a little more here

373
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,135
Let me tell you the next thing

374
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,415
I'm so freak

375
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,743
Vampirism

376
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
The drinking of blood

377
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,095
Is the heart of holly

378
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,167
Movies Reno

379
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,495
Within some movies got involved went there and have people tell me

380
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
And then I thought

381
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,919
California textbooks are now teaching at your old and broke today so I'm forced out.

382
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,967
To drink blood

383
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
Nikeshoebot

384
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
Blood blood

385
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,623
And I went wait a minute

386
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,695
I was told that by

387
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,231
Samurai little FBI

388
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,535
Bulshit

389
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,935
I looked it up and the other teaching children hardcore Satanism I'm going to show you that to folks believing

390
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:24,031
You don't want to look at it but you got to look at it cuz I believe people are these are

391
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
Jewel

392
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,127
Devil worshippers their bodies only forever

393
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,431
Desparasitar in them

394
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,711
Transcend

395
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,503
We'll talk about it when come back

396
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,391
Immortal evil spirits are teaching your kids to be vampires in schools and Doughboy

397
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
You can put

398
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,487
Dramatic music all you want over that that's still lame bull

399
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:48,095
Yeah that is weak tea pretty it's pretty lame

400
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
Also Alex starts rambling about

401
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,447
How you know this sounds

402
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
Crazy

403
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,751
But really like

404
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
As always

405
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,823
Is been the case sure

406
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:04,223
Like you remember how there was that whole satanic panic in the 80s

407
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,015
Now you're shaking your head at me that was true

408
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,623
All of that was real none of it was made up of

409
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,695
Hundred percent real and the FBI has admitted

410
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,767
Was growing up

411
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,071
Leftist

412
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,375
Aldi's

413
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
Squares

414
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,519
That don't you have a girlfriend only a drink a beer.

415
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:32,383
Weird music hires at who is doing this

416
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,527
I don't know they're all paranoid

417
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,111
Nahum Hysteria

418
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:47,487
Doesn't exist even though law enforcement was reporting at their work

419
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:52,095
Convictions of human sacrifice murder satanism

420
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,703
Exist

421
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,775
Titan isn't hysteria the Satanism panic

422
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,223
Those files given classified

423
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,039
30 years later and it's everything

424
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,111
Police were warning us about was real

425
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,720
Irvine satanic panic

426
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:25,120
Well I mean there is a shorthand for something

427
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,168
Silly saying this in this clip but I know for listen

428
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:27,936
Going to the show

429
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:32,800
He says that the FBI Declassified stuff that proves the satanic Panic was a real

430
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:36,640
What are you talkin about is the recent release of the files on the find

431
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:44,064
This is just short-handed he brings up all the time at any consistent listener of the show would know that when he brings up the FBI releasing files

432
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
House approved this stuff

433
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,904
It's generally accompanied by discussion of the group Define

434
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:52,000
Last October the FBI release their file on this group

435
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:56,096
They were a group that was the one of the central focuses of the last big satanic

436
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,168
I'm absolutely certain that Alex has not read the

437
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,192
These files sent its

438
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,984
324 pages long

439
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,568
And there aren't any dank memes in it so

440
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,872
They should let dankula take a pass

441
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,968
Yeah punch this up

442
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,760
Do you know anything about this

443
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,320
No I do know about the losers weepers

444
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,856
But I don't know anything about the

445
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,648
There's there's not keepers

446
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,720
So according to conspiracy lore two men were arrested

447
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,792
The Tallahassee Florida back in 1987 on child

448
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
Abuse charges

449
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:33,216
They're found with six children who weren't related to them and they were uncooperative with the police when they were asked about who the kids were

450
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,264
Provide their identities or anything

451
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,824
These men were part of a cult called

452
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
Finders who were based in washer

453
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,176
A run by someone who was called

454
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,200
The Game caller

455
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,040
The feds would go on to raid the finders and find proof

456
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,880
So how they operated as a child abuse ring with kidnapping and Grooming

457
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
Taking in children

458
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:56,768
Somehow us intelligence is involved as like using them as like

459
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,864
Cutouts or something else is in on it too

460
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,656
Since they're in d.c.

461
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:06,752
So the FBI files on the finders they're pretty much a

462
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
Dot-dot

463
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:14,176
Actually reveals how much of this narrative is based on Paranoid fantasies that were very common in the cultural psyche back in

464
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
The 80s

465
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:20,576
There's a full investigation of these two men were arrested in Tallahassee the police were able to find the parents

466
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,112
Six children and quote

467
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:25,952
The mothers were all aware that the children have been taken to Florida on a trip

468
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,000
They were familiar with him thoroughly Trust

469
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,560
Did the man in whose care the children have been placed

470
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:35,168
The man who go on to spend about ten days in a local jail and then were released

471
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,008
The US attorney's office declined to prosecute the case largely because there wasn't

472
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,800
Strong evidence of any specific crime

473
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,920
A special agent whose name is redacted from the files quote advised

474
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,712
Did the media blew the case out of

475
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
Proportion

476
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,528
That's basically what you find have

477
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,344
Opening throughout a lot of the issues in the satanic panic

478
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:59,232
Yeah it bums me out that while it's happening people don't realize that they are redoing the witch

479
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,768
Yeah right the witch burning

480
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,048
Things like guys

481
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,072
We've done this

482
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:03,840
Before

483
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:07,424
But I mean you didn't have to go back that far I mean if you just look at that

484
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,264
Like Lark Voorhies to relate to

485
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,288
Being in the 80s

486
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,312
Supposed to

487
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
60 and under

488
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,944
So I read over most of the finders files and it seems like they can

489
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,808
Conclusion one should come to is that this is a group of people who wanted to live in alternative lifestyle sort of

490
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,576
Communism

491
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:28,672
Kind of vibe under the leadership of a weirdo called The Game caller

492
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:33,280
I mean hate if you could work if you can get it running to call this easy stuff

493
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,096
Apparently what do you do if you would tell people

494
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,144
In the group things to do in order to

495
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,544
To gain experiences because he would learn through their experiences

496
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,336
I'm sure there was some

497
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,896
Like nefarious angle to it too

498
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,176
I'm sure it was a

499
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:54,272
I am sure there was not great things out of course it was loot box

500
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,040
Boxes all over

501
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:59,136
It's entirely possible that some abuse was taking place in that environment and I

502
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,696
I am not saying that there wasn't

503
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,000
But also FBI investigation failed.

504
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,024
Produce any proof of

505
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:10,400
The rest of the ship the stuff that Alex believes it's all just cultural exaggeration dude what would happen

506
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,960
Sitting at the United States at that time with that book

507
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,984
Michelle remembers

508
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
Speed release

509
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,776
And the McMartin

510
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,056
School trials creating

511
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,336
The fever pitch of fear

512
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,128
Around satanic child abuse

513
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,920
In particular circles in our

514
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
Yeah what has those two

515
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,760
Daycare people was a f******

516
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,784
Travesty

517
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,624
Remember how long that trial was to

518
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,928
It went on for f****** ever

519
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:36,512
So that's all that's going on like this is just a remnant

520
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,096
Of that and Alex is trying to re bring it back up

521
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,376
We talked about it even

522
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:48,288
Like the ways back pretty consistent thing that I was into in the present-day electrifying to whip

523
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,824
These things

524
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,872
Bitter meaning

525
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,408
He wouldn't

526
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,456
Do whip it up into a frenzy

527
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
If

528
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,504
Vampires weren't

529
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,272
Teaching

530
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,320
Kids vampirism in school

531
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:05,184
I really don't like it when you say that sends and I'm supposed to take it like it's a

532
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,976
Okay

533
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,560
Well I mean it's what this is reality

534
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,864
I'm in like a news reporter

535
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,400
And cover the

536
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,168
Sing

537
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
It's in the fog

538
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,752
If it's hard to

539
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,824
That all tied together with all the things that are happening but

540
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,920
California 8th graders taught anal

541
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,200
Bondage sex

542
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,016
Involving blood in sex ed class

543
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,344
Now I saw that National file article

544
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
Bounce It Up on newswars.

545
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
How come

546
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
And I thought

547
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,488
What the hell is

548
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,096
What play

549
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,496
About yourself

550
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
Sure as hell

551
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
Batman

552
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,616
And it is what you do

553
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,944
Somebody

554
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,880
Research on that episode that I wanted to forget and it was sure as hell going on

555
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,440
They're going

556
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
Directly

557
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
The most

558
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,792
I can't

559
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,584
I would love to know what the research

560
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,984
Chantelle there

561
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,360
Hearing jargon for from you no like insulated communities when you get a view inside

562
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,432
I like to find out that that's what vampires call it when

563
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:36,832
Alex has a lot of high-level vampire sources

564
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,928
Naturally he doesn't hang out with blade though

565
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,000
Plainfield Delight still has to drink a little blood from toy

566
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,584
A good resource for information

567
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,864
It's true

568
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,936
I'll tell you I was getting

569
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,728
I'm pretty impatient with this

570
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:59,360
It was probably because you were forced to take vampires real

571
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:04,480
Probably about half hour and I was really losing my will to live like

572
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:09,088
I got you a commercial that Alex did this is what made me turn it off

573
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,904
I was like I'm not losing you this episode anymore

574
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,304
Knock on wood I am not tempting fate but everybody around the office

575
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:24,704
A long time have noticed that I really don't ever get sick

576
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,104
Tomorrow I'll say that again

577
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,432
Alex

578
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,968
Yes

579
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,624
So sloppy and lazy he's rambling about how I saying if you ever get sick of going to make them get sick of these superstitious about

580
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,744
Bad that you can hear from the background he's recording this in his car

581
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,424
Alright

582
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
I just put it up

583
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:02,592
I just can't imagine it like I imagine now McDonald's putting Ronald McDonald in a commercial just him driving ban like

584
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:08,736
I'm telling you McDonald's food is the precious now I may be wrong tomorrow I may be wrong tomorrow because

585
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,808
You know the everyday changes everything is do tricep

586
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,344
You know what

587
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
I'm loving it

588
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,392
But maybe not tomorrow

589
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,440
You know what I'm saying anyways

590
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:24,352
Just hit my Breaking Point kind of has like there's nothing good that's going to come to this episode like

591
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,168
Obviously he's teasing he's going to get into these vampire s***

592
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,448
And like okay

593
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:33,056
We've heard you do this rant before this isn't new yes fabricating a new story

594
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:37,152
To enable you to do this ramp

595
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,480
Play the hits Otis baby

596
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,248
Stocking

597
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,528
Listen to it

598
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,856
Use for a product that's already on the market I have better things

599
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
Things to do

600
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,904
Then wait around for that

601
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,952
So I dropped the Monday's episode

602
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
Holy

603
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,024
The

604
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,328
Individual that I believe controlled opposition

605
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,888
Richard Spencer on the show

606
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,424
Nope nope

607
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,704
Snoop

608
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,240
You know the okay to milk

609
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,288
I don't think it's okay to punch anybody

610
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,824
That's a punch you first

611
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,872
Unless they're not

612
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,432
I just reached

613
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:14,528
So when Alex first said that Richard Spencer was going to be on his show I thought

614
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,808
That sounds about right

615
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,464
Alex's shows in the middle of spiraling the drain of plausible deniability so why not make some of this s*** super over

616
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,536
Then Alex said that he's having a mom because he believes that

617
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
Dispensaries

618
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,584
Controlled opposition

619
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,448
Which could look like Alex having him on for a confrontational interview but I assure you that Alex

620
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,520
Has not equipped to have that kind of interview with a slick

621
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,824
Media polished bigot Like Richard Spencer

622
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:43,968
Do not think that Spencer's been called controlled opposition like a thousand times by now

623
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:48,576
Do not think he has a million deflections and rebuttals to that criticism at this point

624
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,416
I've seen Richard Spencer in a number of the debates and conversations

625
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,696
Both friendly and

626
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,232
And in hostile environments

627
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:59,584
And when I heard Alex teases interview all I could think is that this is going to be a

628
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
Disaster

629
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:05,472
Spencer is much better at Roderick stuff than Alex and Alex is very gullible

630
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:10,592
I just imagined Richard Spencer becoming be like new geopolitical expert and Alex's whacked

631
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:16,480
Like honestly that's how badly I first saw this going he's going to give him a job

632
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:20,320
I see this ending the way that Stefan molyneux

633
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,880
Special report in Poland and varies just like Alex

634
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,416
She's just like you know what you convince

635
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,952
I'm a Nazi now

636
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:31,328
In reality let's just got through the b******* I think Alex is probably having Spencer on mostly because

637
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,400
Spencer recently tweeted that he regrets ever supporting Trump

638
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:40,288
They're now on opposite sides of the white identity seen so there needs to be some kind of a smoothing that out

639
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,824
A meeting of the minds

640
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:42,848
If you will

641
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,944
That's the sense I get of what probably precipitated this

642
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,248
And also they're both pathetic enough

643
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:55,392
At this point in their careers they would appear on the show together

644
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,672
A couple of years back

645
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:00,000
In other career circumstance

646
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,768
1027

647
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,536
1820

648
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,608
Maybe even some 2018 2016

649
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,632
Spencer would his

650
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:12,032
Seen himself as being so far about going on Alex's show you would not have done it

651
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:16,128
Spawning

652
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:21,248
Duffy's dress well and at the same time at that point Alex wouldn't have seen himself

653
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,016
Lesbian

654
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,600
Interposition we're having Spencer on could be anything

655
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,648
Worth doing can't go full not two yet

656
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,304
Or even like it's not worth it to even if I were to present him as false opposition or whatever

657
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,840
Not even in my best interest

658
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,144
Neither of them had a steak

659
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,192
In that and now their lives of

660
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,984
Did you real to the Pirates like

661
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,592
F*** it I'll go on Infowars f*** it I'll talk to Richard Speck

662
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,128
So

663
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,408
We know that Alex

664
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,688
Has had David Duke

665
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,712
On the show

666
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
And so this is

667
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:54,784
Sort of a

668
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,552
Second

669
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:59,136
Run

670
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,672
Facts about that about how like

671
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,512
Spencer Richard Spencer is probably the most famous white supremacist

672
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:07,328
In America outside of David Duke

673
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,680
Solid says things by David Duke and keeping right he's not defending

674
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,984
David Duke Richard Spencer

675
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,848
Other than David Duke is one of the most famous

676
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,432
White nationalist white supremacist in the world

677
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,528
I do not believe David Duke is a fed I'm not believe David Duke

678
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,576
Is an operative

679
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,600
For the Deep state

680
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:37,280
Of the media to demonize David Duke and call the worst person on Earth

681
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
Because

682
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:43,168
He is racially-based when all the minority groups are being taught to be just as racist

683
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,216
Wow

684
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,800
And then I'm out here defending

685
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,848
Baby due date

686
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,616
Before

687
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:58,016
Alex says he's not defending davidiuk but that's exactly what happened

688
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:04,416
In August 2015 Alex had David Duke on the show interview that I'm sure Alex that would be a big chance to prove

689
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,696
That he wasn't like do

690
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:10,048
It was a miserable failure because David Duke is a guy who's been attacked for his horrible but

691
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,072
A decade

692
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:16,192
And through that he's gained a little bit of an ability to out argue people who aren't prepared for debate

693
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,776
What I find very interesting is that here in 20

694
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,824
20 Alex is saying that he doesn't

695
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,104
Don't agree with

696
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:30,016
But that Alex is against the media saying Duke is bad for being racially-based when all the other races are racially-based

697
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:33,856
This is interesting because when David Duke was on Alex's show just

698
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,392
Four-and-a-half years ago

699
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,672
Alex made the exact

700
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,696
The opposite argue

701
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,280
Alex's big big disagreement with Duke

702
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,048
With the fact

703
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,072
The Duke was race

704
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
Usually based

705
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,912
And that focusing on race was a globalist distraction

706
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,448
That's all changed

707
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,520
And Alex is okay with racially-based identification

708
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,288
Grouping

709
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,640
This is a fundamental important pivot that Alex is made whether or not reflect

710
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,664
His true opinion or not

711
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,736
In 2015 prior to joining up with Trump

712
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:05,088
I want to show was explicit in its position that grouping based on race was a globalist trick

713
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,624
Now Alex thinks

714
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,976
It's cool for David Duke to do what he does because he feels that other races are doing the same thing

715
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,792
Alex's show has always been profoundly races

716
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,328
Stand white identity heavy

717
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,120
But that changed presentation

718
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,144
I think is important

719
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,984
Yeah the only things they disagree on now are like

720
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
Seafood choice

721
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,568
Optics Alex doesn't like oysters

722
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,872
You know Optics of choice

723
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:31,200
David Duke does love hello it's weird he's got a weird thing

724
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,224
So

725
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,528
A David Duke is not a fed

726
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,552
He's not fake

727
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,832
But Spencer

728
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,720
The guy is as phony as a three-dollar bill

729
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,000
I'll just say that

730
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,792
Michelle

731
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,936
Behaved

732
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,800
It's just like somebody that's controlled opposition

733
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,176
No s*** you don't

734
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,968
That's

735
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,248
Great

736
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,904
Yeah I'm pretty sure that means that Alex is going to spend all of his time agreeing with Richard Spencer but still

737
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,720
Band like yeah but you're here to make us look

738
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,584
It doesn't go great we'll get to that when we get to it

739
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,400
50 emails

740
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,960
Pretty well spelled out in

741
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:31,360
Nightclub in that is that I have a big accusation to make but I have nothing to base it on and that will be very easily

742
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,896
That's kind of what

743
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,920
Going to happen

744
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,968
So Alex gets back to this qnx

745
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,040
Story and the reason that I

746
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:42,112
Taking one from the 12th and here one in 13th

747
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,160
Is that when he was talking about another

748
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,440
The 12th I didn't really

749
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,488
You know how to get a handle on what he was talk

750
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,536
I don't really understand

751
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,352
Where this information was coming from necessarily

752
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,144
But when he brings back up on the 13th

753
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,704
It gives a little bit more detail and he

754
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,728
He gives me away in

755
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,032
David

756
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,664
To the full video on the UNC

757
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:12,320
So Alex here is saying that he's gone over this 20 hours of footage from the World Health Organization Summit about vaccines

758
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,392
And that he's going to link the videos on Band. Video

759
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,440
Play that's all I wanted

760
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:23,840
I don't mind going over hours of footage to get a better understanding of what's going on here

761
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,656
For the video awesome

762
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:33,568
So I run over bad guy video in the first video about the um vaccine shed that I click on the link for the info

763
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,336
Store on

764
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,128
And that is not going to be helped

765
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:40,480
Cyclic on a second video that Alex put out about the this story

766
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,760
And that one does have link

767
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,040
But they aren't linked

768
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,320
6 to 20 hours of footage

769
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:52,000
What is 22 minute 49 Second clip of doctor swaminathan which is devoid of context and meaning

770
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,536
The second one

771
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,816
Mike is much more relevant

772
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,096
Since it's clearly

773
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,144
Entire source that Alex is working

774
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,984
This is a 9-minute video that highlights multiple short clips

775
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
The Summit

776
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,336
Here's a video produced by a show called The high-wire with Del bigtree

777
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:10,176
Which appears to be largely a show that produces anti-vax

778
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
For some insight

779
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,272
They had Andrew Wakefield as a guest

780
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:19,136
Four months ago which is a bad sign

781
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:23,488
Everybody agrees that he is still the foremost expert on why you shouldn't take back

782
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,816
Del bigtree is one of the producers

783
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,864
Pictures of the pseudo-documentary VAC

784
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,192
Which pushti discredited Wakefield vaccines cause autism

785
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,216
Narrative

786
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,520
Victory has no medical education or training

787
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,592
He is a TV producer who formerly worked on the doctor

788
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:44,480
Sure Phil Show eventually learned about Andrew Wakefield and was swayed by that bullshittin went fully down that road

789
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,552
In March of last year big tree caught some heat

790
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:52,416
From Jewish organizations after he gave an anti-vax speech wearing a yellow star

791
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,952
Meant to compare the plight of the

792
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,768
Anti-vax Community to that of Jews during the Holocaust

793
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:02,144
Iraq

794
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,168
Sure buddy

795
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,984
Is the founder and CEO of the

796
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,776
Informed consent Action Network

797
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,336
Anti-vaccination group one of the most prominent

798
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
In the country

799
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:16,992
He started the group in 2016 receiving a $100,000 Grant from the cells Foundation

800
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:20,832
A charitable organization run by Bernard cells and his wife Lisa

801
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,880
Who coincidentally is the president

802
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,648
Of the informed

803
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,672
Consent action

804
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,488
In 2012 the cells gave

805
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:31,072
$200,000 to Andrew Wakefield legal fun

806
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:34,144
Which kicks off a rash of big dollar contributions

807
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,912
The anti-vax

808
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,264
And went on to provide much of the funding for that pseudo-documentary of his vac

809
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,056
Which is produced by Del bigtree

810
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,872
It's important to remember that rich people are all f******

811
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:48,224
It's also important to remember the 22 others 2 years after Wakefield

812
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
I was convicted of

813
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,272
Professional misconduct

814
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
Denied his license

815
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
Revoked

816
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:55,648
It's not like he was a guy in good standing at these people just wanted to support

817
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,976
According to Business Insider $1000000

818
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
Or 3

819
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,536
Three-quarters of Del bigtree budget

820
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,072
It came from the south Foundation

821
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,096
In 2017

822
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,704
And that isn't even close to all the anti-vax stuff it sells Foundation to support it

823
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,008
They've given billions more to other outfits

824
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,056
Is it spread misinformation about vaccines

825
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:17,408
To the point where it be pretty fair to say that without their money funding a lot of this stuff

826
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,456
Anti-vax it wouldn't be nearly as

827
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
Is probably what does it

828
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:25,856
It's unclear exactly what their motivation is and spending billions of dollars to push debunked and

829
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,880
Discredited science

830
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:32,512
But what is very clear is that these are the people who are largely behind the popularity of anti-vax narrative

831
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,072
People like Alex love to pretend that it's all

832
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:38,144
Does the Grassroots thing we're normal everyday people were given a voice

833
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,704
Social media that's why the conversation is happening

834
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,728
But it's not

835
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,776
Well-funded facts by the

836
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:47,616
Multi-millionaire

837
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,688
I haven't seen her like so many people like to mock that

838
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,456
That

839
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:58,112
That white lady who's like

840
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,904
Group and all that s***

841
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,976
Whenever it's f****** these people who are the issue

842
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,536
It's it's boils down to like

843
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,328
Who is astroturfing what

844
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,120
And why are we making fun of the people

845
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:09,888
Who got

846
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
Tricked by

847
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,192
Instead of going after

848
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
The people who are

849
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,752
Right2know

850
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:18,592
What is one of the reasons why I generally try to

851
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,688
Approached some of the stuff with more empathy than some people

852
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,712
Think is appropriate

853
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,272
And you know I'll take that

854
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,552
I'll take that criticism

855
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,832
As a being

856
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,136
Fine but I disagree

857
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,184
It's one of the family obviously that person

858
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,720
It's been tricked by this is

859
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,512
Still perpetuating and pushing

860
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:39,328
Narratives that could have the real world fact

861
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,864
The people being heard of shells

862
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,728
Something to take seriously

863
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:49,312
Yeah so Alex didn't watch 20 hours of footage on these hearing

864
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:53,919
Do you watch that 9 minute video released by Del bigtree and pretended that he done the work

865
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:58,271
He accepted the out-of-context Snippets from Big Trees video without Quest

866
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,087
I presented this is a gigantic bombshell

867
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,135
And on top of that Alex's pretty

868
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
Presented

869
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,951
Investigative work

870
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,767
He's doing when in reality he's just regurgitating

871
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,327
Propaganda put out by a multi-millionaire

872
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,095
Funded

873
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,119
Anti-vax front

874
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,167
Do the worst I mean it's just

875
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:15,935
It's it's

876
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
So a

877
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,471
He watched

878
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,799
All 20 hours in his dreams Dan

879
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:24,639
Dreams you can watch 20 hours of footage in only 8 hours of Dreams

880
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,431
It's the dream skate but sells Foundation

881
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,735
And paid for those dreams

882
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,295
So anyway go f*** himself

883
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:38,207
I mean it just leads to a breakdown kind of like just complete vaccinations

884
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,743
Analyze

885
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
Science

886
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,279
Flies

887
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:46,655
You know back in the 50s that gave millions of American women in French

888
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
Type of

889
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,079
What type of

890
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,199
Caused hundreds of thousands of children born with arms and legs

891
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:05,343
Do not remember the name of that

892
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,719
Never pull video

893
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:14,815
Just keep giving them to you and telling you nobody ever got hurt

894
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:21,471
So Alex has no idea what he's talking about in terms of vaccine recalls

895
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,031
Cena has ever been both

896
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:27,103
Happens all the time difference

897
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,919
In one instance they

898
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:33,247
There might be a recall on a specific batch of a vaccine

899
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,807
Do the internal quality assurance testing indicating

900
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,367
There might be a contamination or some other concern

901
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:42,463
This happens not super regularly Beacon find plenty of examples of it

902
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:46,047
In other cases of vaccine might be discontinued because of better vaccines

903
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,583
Undeveloped effect

904
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:51,423
Other times their reactions that are not anticipated

905
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:54,495
And oftentimes can't really be anticipated

906
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,799
Discovered after vaccine begins being used

907
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,079
Princeton

908
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:03,711
In 1976 there was a fear of a potential epidemic strain outbreak of swine flu

909
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,735
At Fort Dix

910
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,015
In New Jersey

911
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:10,879
Scientist at the CDC went to work on creating a vaccine due to the severity

912
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,695
Of the possibility of what could come once flu season

913
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,999
After administering

914
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:21,631
The vaccination program it was found that a small number of people who got the vaccine to come down with Guillain-Barre

915
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,167
And the timeline of the

916
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,215
Condition made it possible there was a connection

917
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,751
In between the Centrum

918
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:27,775
And the shot

919
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:30,079
There was no causal link established

920
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,407
But the perception was made by the media that the shock is caused

921
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,431
The gion beret

922
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,223
By December according to the

923
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,247
CDC quote

924
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:42,879
Federal health officials decided that the possibility of an association with Guillain-Barre syndrome and the vaccine

925
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,159
However small

926
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,463
Necessitated stopping immunization

927
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,511
There are other examples

928
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,047
But there's one of them

929
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,095
So what around to saying is a lie

930
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,143
Health officials are absolutely willing to

931
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,679
Chipotle discontinued use of x

932
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,983
Nothing Alex is saying is based on anything

933
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:04,383
He just feels like they never pull vaccine because that better conforms to his dumb worldview that everything is against him

934
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,407
Given everything is a plot

935
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:06,687
Bulshit

936
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:09,247
Yeah that if it's just like the best response

937
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,527
2

938
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
Some

939
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,879
Some kids remembering some fake bulshit

940
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,183
Is to create a satanic satanic panic

941
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,975
Across the entire country

942
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,767
It's also a good idea to

943
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,791
To confuse correlation

944
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,351
Causation in any and all scientific

945
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,423
Right in and then you also want to take correlation

946
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,191
Causation

947
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:34,591
And then also just lie on top up absolutely and the media should accept your claims

948
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,639
And just spread it as far as NY.

949
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:40,991
And if there's a way to demonize a vulnerable population

950
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:51,743
Ariel

951
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,631
Jersey New York

952
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,447
Illegal aliens

953
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,799
Brought in from Central and South America

954
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,079
Yeah no kidding

955
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,895
If you actually read the actual fine print you know that Alex

956
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,967
Just making up the part about undocumented immigrants causing outbreaks

957
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:17,855
We've been over this a bunch but what you talking about is that measles outbreaks those what's happened last year

958
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,879
Some of them are thoughts

959
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:22,207
Because by people who traveled overseas to areas where they were outbreak

960
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,023
Princeton's the Orthodox Jewish community in New York

961
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,583
Cases were brought on by Travelers who'd been

962
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,351
Israel

963
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,143
According to the Pan American Health

964
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,447
There's a big difference between

965
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,983
People traveling and emigrate

966
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,519
Alex doesn't care about this

967
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:40,895
He just sees what he decides to pretend this fine print saying that there may be a foreign origin

968
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,431
Disease in the United States

969
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:48,831
That's automatically understood to be undocumented immigrants being carriers of disease that the left is bringing into the United States to attack why

970
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:53,183
If I was really interested in these sorts of issues I would expect that you should

971
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:58,047
Recovering how there were another severe overcrowding in detention facilities near the border

972
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,351
It's led to internal outbreaks of mumps and chicken

973
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:04,959
Chicken pox never seem to hear you don't care too much about that I don't know if I've ever even heard of Bring It Up

974
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:09,055
I really feel like a simple rule for all media should be

975
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,847
I did grbl save

976
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,151
And let's not say

977
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,711
I like it's to my larger point that I want to make

978
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:19,807
Gearing up to interview Richard Spencer a noted National

979
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,903
And here he is yelling white nationalist s*** about immigrants bring in disease

980
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:30,303
I eat you can pretend all you want those irrelevant difference between him and Spencer but there's not he literally said

981
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,839
Immigrants are infested

982
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:36,959
Communicable disease introduced Richard Spencer

983
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,495
Who is controlled opposition

984
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,775
To make us look bad

985
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:40,799
Right

986
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,103
Good

987
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,151
Alex gets into

988
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:46,687
Tomorrow

989
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,223
Dubious science

990
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,783
Stuff just about China

991
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,575
Is making all our pills

992
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,599
And that's bad

993
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,951
On that China makes the majority of our drugs

994
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:00,255
Deadly Fentanyl

995
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,815
What's the number one killer in the US right now

996
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,119
Not true

997
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,655
Is is a

998
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,679
Absolutely not

999
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:10,495
Surpass automobile accident

1000
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,055
Conference

1001
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,895
Alex has a really interesting angle here on Pharmaceuticals in China

1002
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:19,711
I'm a reading here from an article on Infowars

1003
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
Quote

1004
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:25,087
If we're dependent on China 4000 of ingredients in raw materials to make armetta's

1005
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:27,903
China could use this dependents as a weapon against us

1006
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:32,511
While the Department of Defense only purchases a small quantity of finished Pharmaceuticals

1007
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,839
China about 80% of the active pharmaceutical ingredient

1008
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,863
API

1009
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,399
Used to make drugs in the United

1010
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
Midstate sarstedt

1011
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:41,215
To come from China and other countries like India

1012
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,031
Oh wait I'm sorry I mixed up my notes

1013
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:50,431
That was from an article in the Council on Foreign Relations website published on August 14th 2019

1014
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,503
Where is Alex's gals about these sorts of issues

1015
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,527
His big villains

1016
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,551
Cfra

1017
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,599
Explore them in Far More meaningful ways

1018
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,623
Princeton

1019
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,159
This article points out

1020
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,183
A quote that I read

1021
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,487
That these raw materials are coming from quote

1022
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,791
China and other countries like India

1023
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:09,119
That 80% number is not all just from China

1024
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:14,495
It's the amount of apis that are imported as opposed to being domestically sourced which is totally different

1025
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:15,775
This article

1026
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:20,127
Discusses how we're almost certainly also overestimating the number of these ingredients

1027
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:20,895
The amount of it

1028
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,687
It's coming from China

1029
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:25,247
As of 2018 trying to claim 13

1030
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
Forbes

1031
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,295
Percent of all import line

1032
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,855
Defined as distinct regulated products

1033
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,623
Within the shipment

1034
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,391
Through Costco

1035
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,439
Among countries that export drugs

1036
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,207
Biologic

1037
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:34,975
It's the United

1038
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,047
So it's probably lower than

1039
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,327
You even assume

1040
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,143
Alex's version of the story certainly more exciting

1041
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:44,191
Anil drive more clicks and pill sales

1042
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:48,287
It doesn't reflect reality or any careful analysis of the subjects

1043
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,311
Seat covers

1044
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,103
The evil writers for the CFR

1045
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,639
Do engaging a little bit of that

1046
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,943
Look at things from different angles and what have you

1047
00:49:55,711 --> 00:50:00,063
Also Alex is completely making up the fentanyl alone is leading unnatural cause of death

1048
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,087
The United States

1049
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:06,975
Some say there's no data to back that up he's just a real piece of s*** co-opting people's deaths to push his efforts to attack China

1050
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,791
Go fuc yourself I wouldn't be

1051
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,559
Surprised if

1052
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,839
Killed more people than

1053
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,263
I don't know Alex jumps to cultural issues

1054
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,103
Facebook

1055
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:27,455
People that weren't women saw the ad them

1056
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,479
About women

1057
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,551
It's like city buses in a major u.s. city last week

1058
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,623
The word

1059
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,231
Mother

1060
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,279
Ban the word

1061
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:47,935
WordGirl

1062
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,239
What's a scientific

1063
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,007
Tic-tac-toe

1064
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:54,335
I legitimately have no idea what to talk about with his bus s***

1065
00:50:54,591 --> 00:51:00,735
I can't find any proof of a major unnamed US city or London Banning feminine words from their buses

1066
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,807
I guess if you can prove it or give you a source I'll look into it but

1067
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,087
For now I just talk

1068
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:08,159
I don't even find an article about this on Infowars

1069
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,719
To be fair his sight is almost done navigate about

1070
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:15,839
So I don't know if it's there and I just couldn't stay or what I can't find anything

1071
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:21,215
Think about this we have been hearing about people Banning the word mother for 7 years now at least

1072
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,751
Do purple penguin's know kid

1073
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:28,127
This isn't the same thing is true for the Trump ad at least it's not that I can't find any

1074
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,663
Proof of it it's just that it's b*******

1075
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:35,807
Alex knows damn well that I had got pulled because it said the Trump was quote looking for strong women like you

1076
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:41,183
It had nothing to do with the women part had to do with EU part there was counter to Facebook ad polish

1077
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,999
You can't Target advertising people like that

1078
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,535
And Trump's campaign that every reason

1079
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,559
Them to know that this is against

1080
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,327
Policy

1081
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,119
This is just internet

1082
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:49,887
Intentional

1083
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:55,007
Because it plays better to argue that Facebook won't let Trump promote to women

1084
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:58,591
Then it is to say Trump doesn't know Facebook's policies and he broke the rules

1085
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,127
I like

1086
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:00,895
I don't know

1087
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,687
This cultural stuff is very soft

1088
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,223
Very weak yeah

1089
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,015
But it gets interest

1090
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
Okay

1091
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:07,807
A little bit

1092
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,599
All right I don't know

1093
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:12,159
Alex is talking about here is

1094
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,463
Very good

1095
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,303
I don't know your phone will make

1096
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,327
Montages

1097
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,607
Of photos

1098
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,911
Who's that you've got sure right you know like

1099
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:28,287
I realize that this club up cuz I have no idea what he's talking about

1100
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:30,847
But I believe that there's probably a real

1101
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,871
Thing here

1102
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,407
You know cuz I've seen Facebook

1103
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:39,807
Do this morning you automatically generate like pictures from

1104
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,855
That you posted over the last year of

1105
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:46,463
Stuff like that

1106
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,487
But

1107
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,791
His angle on it is lunacy

1108
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,327
Completely insane

1109
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:55,679
I have one of these devices because it was used as what I know what it does

1110
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,703
Faraday cage

1111
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,495
When I'm not using it

1112
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:03,871
Wocket pocket Priscilla divorce would I come don't know if that's a faraday cage keeps tell Faraday cages

1113
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,895
Quote unquote

1114
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:11,551
Have you noticed that if you have a Droid or you have an apple tickly Apple

1115
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,087
That

1116
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,671
It's getting really good at it

1117
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,719
It takes your photos

1118
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,071
Or your wife or your husband

1119
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:23,839
Rip you went on

1120
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,679
Put together really good timeline

1121
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:31,263
There is good as a human can do some of these look like

1122
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,799
Steven Spielberg Direct

1123
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:36,639
With the music and just how they do things bright the birth

1124
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,991
Your baby daughter's has one little thing right at the end

1125
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,343
It looked on

1126
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,879
My wife's phone is this

1127
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,719
Thousands of photos and videos

1128
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,743
The very best of

1129
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:53,535
Frightening

1130
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,631
Is it done locally on the phone

1131
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,423
This is just the interface

1132
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,215
AR system

1133
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,775
It's being done

1134
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:08,383
The main computers for Apple

1135
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,063
Just say iPhone

1136
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:20,415
Our mole that's all I hear they're I am old and I don't under

1137
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,183
Tuesday

1138
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:27,583
I would assume the reason that they're the other kind of higher quality photos and like they chose the best stuff is because

1139
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:32,447
You've interacted with that stuff more than the photos that I guy that was a mistake

1140
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:36,287
You sent it to more people over that there's some sort of a metric

1141
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:39,103
There's more engagement on this

1142
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,127
Therefore it

1143
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,455
The phone or Facebook assumes

1144
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:45,759
This is something more important to the person

1145
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:50,367
That make that is very easy explanation for this that doesn't involve

1146
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:54,719
Over-complicated AI invasion

1147
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,255
No no

1148
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,303
Is there something that

1149
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,583
Tubing disturbing

1150
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,119
Perhaps later on

1151
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:01,887
You can take a look

1152
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:08,287
Things are becoming far more complex and AI is coming for our jobs and yada yada yada you can

1153
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,079
Go on that tip not the

1154
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:16,479
Beijing is controlling your phone it's also because of Alex's misunderstanding of the like youth

1155
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:19,551
Fix it all all of our phone information is in China

1156
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,855
As opposed to the reality of that story

1157
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,391
But you're still not good

1158
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:27,231
No I mean the future is more terrifying than the 1950

1159
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:27,999
These people could have been

1160
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,815
You don't need to ask a late it like there

1161
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,839
That doesn't get us any

1162
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:37,471
Embellished there is no way around it

1163
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,775
I'd like every single story Alex Telles

1164
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,055
There is

1165
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,591
A necessity

1166
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,871
To amplify

1167
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,151
Sensationalize

1168
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,943
Even if like

1169
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,967
What the f***

1170
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,247
Who cares like

1171
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,063
They're teaching 9th graders to be vampires

1172
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,111
Just Go With It

1173
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,903
That's what's the difference between

1174
00:55:56,159 --> 00:56:02,303
13 and isn't going to be like

1175
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,911
High School

1176
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,447
You were young

1177
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:14,847
You brag Tavares sleeping with like 100 women by the time you were 14 or whatever it was

1178
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,383
Are you

1179
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,663
Kids grow up fast

1180
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,711
I don't know

1181
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:23,039
Just completely unnecessary it reminds me of like pathological

1182
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,855
People who lie about things that have no

1183
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:29,183
It reminds me of a Mike Birbiglia

1184
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:35,583
Bad about the the guy in his school he used to just lie about stuff that nobody even cared about like

1185
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,423
My cousin is a

1186
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,703
Springbok boogie boogie

1187
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,471
Do you know that's like

1188
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:45,823
Why are you lying about that too eighth-grader to however old

1189
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,127
Have to

1190
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,199
So this is scattershot should like it's all over

1191
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:54,015
Talking about like anti-vax stuff

1192
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,319
Chinese Pharmaceuticals

1193
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,855
Your phone

1194
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,647
Creating photo montages

1195
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:06,047
Little bit about climate change stuff

1196
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,839
I think so

1197
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,887
He has

1198
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:14,239
Like a big narrative about like there's a Facebook glitches that revealed

1199
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:16,799
Greta thunberg's Dad Run

1200
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,079
Is her Facebook page

1201
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,895
And she's dressed that by interesting

1202
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,687
Yeah I use his account

1203
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455
2

1204
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,735
Use this face

1205
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,783
Easy administrator of the page

1206
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,319
What's the big deal

1207
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:31,647
It's so anyway I don't care about that

1208
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:36,767
This clip just involves Alex talking about how climate change

1209
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:37,535
Existence

1210
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,815
Create a priest class

1211
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:41,375
That will eventually lead to us sacrificing baby

1212
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:44,191
Okay now the Steve pieczenik become a Duke in

1213
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:49,567
Only I wouldn't even keep that in if this was that was all

1214
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,639
Weaves into a Bible story

1215
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,919
No

1216
00:57:54,687 --> 00:58:00,831
And I think Midway through talking about it he realizes like it means the opposite of what he wanted to anybody

1217
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,855
Members of the details

1218
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,671
Baby believe the carbon dioxide is so evil Tracy

1219
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,791
Because it's about

1220
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,071
Economic Warfare

1221
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,399
It's about control

1222
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:21,567
And it's about dumbing people down with the Superstition like the ancient Aztecs the ancient Druids and others did

1223
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,895
The sun didn't come back today

1224
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,943
Because you're been evil

1225
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,759
So do what the priesthood says people would believe

1226
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:35,647
Even unto given the priest class for children in every culture

1227
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,463
Human sacrifice

1228
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,767
The Old Testament Abraham

1229
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,839
Oh here we go

1230
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:46,143
What God says get your son up here and kill

1231
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:47,423
First born

1232
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,727
Thought you wanted so bad

1233
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:53,567
Come on

1234
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:57,407
Are you forgetting the

1235
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:00,479
That's because every other cultural Society that's what went on

1236
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:06,623
Do you eat wild Paws there is indicative of Alex being like Wade Abraham was going

1237
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,159
Paralyzer

1238
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:12,767
Plan the whole time for no reason

1239
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,815
Yeah he was going to do it yeah

1240
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,703
But the angel stopped him so I guess that's fine

1241
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:29,151
So he was the one who said he went ape shitt at Buckhannon

1242
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,687
Stonehenge

1243
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,455
Yes

1244
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,735
You love The Druids

1245
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,039
He loves the Drew can't get enough

1246
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,599
It seems you got violent

1247
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,135
Because 30% of people

1248
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,159
Experience

1249
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:44,511
Psychotic break

1250
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,351
It's interesting that Alex is saying that this priest

1251
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,119
Glass

1252
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,911
Exist the tells you the things

1253
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,447
You can't observe

1254
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:55,775
Are happening you know like they know when it eclipse

1255
00:59:56,031 --> 01:00:01,151
Was going to happen today they say they're going to block out the sun if you do what they want

1256
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,199
Well but not back then

1257
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,991
No they did not know

1258
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:09,855
Not the not The Pedestrian people who are fooled by the priests class

1259
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,903
Okay so that's the metaphor that needs met

1260
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,183
That like

1261
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,975
These are authority figures

1262
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:16,255
Will tell you things

1263
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:19,071
That you can't prove or disprove

1264
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:21,119
In order to manipulate you into doing that

1265
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,423
I find that very funny

1266
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,959
Considering this next clip

1267
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:28,031
What are evil spirits the things we can't see what Science Now prove

1268
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:31,103
Nothing holding this dimension in

1269
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,407
That many times stronger the dimension

1270
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,431
We're in

1271
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,479
What

1272
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,247
We can't see

1273
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,063
Is Maspeth 5-10-20 time stronger

1274
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:41,599
They cannot read it

1275
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,367
With

1276
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,647
Devices

1277
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:44,927
Read what

1278
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,463
Proven all these dimensions

1279
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:47,999
Joanna Bob

1280
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,327
Multiverse

1281
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:54,911
So

1282
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,703
Science

1283
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:58,751
Evil spirit science

1284
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,031
Has proven evil spirits

1285
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:05,151
So you got to buy some pills that sounds right you know what evil spirits actually science has proven

1286
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,687
Iodine

1287
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:12,575
The soul weighs 7 lb

1288
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:18,463
Little morsel

1289
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,583
Wow that's f******

1290
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,351
Stupid

1291
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:27,935
Alex is obviously really anti climate change guy

1292
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,471
He's really in

1293
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,007
In favor of coal

1294
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:32,799
And all that

1295
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,079
And we know that

1296
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:39,455
Does Mexico has a really extreme version of him expressing his

1297
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,991
His feelings on the subject

1298
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,783
Fossils of alligator

1299
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:44,575
Crocodiles

1300
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,599
Campbell

1301
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,367
Yes sir

1302
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,391
In this era

1303
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,951
It's a bones album

1304
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,999
678 thousand years old

1305
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,815
The middle of the Sahara Desert was African jungle

1306
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,119
I look Atlanta

1307
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:57,887
Healthier

1308
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,447
Carbon dioxide

1309
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,775
By the time we found

1310
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,335
Carbon

1311
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,479
What's the time

1312
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:15,807
Wait till we need to save the planet

1313
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,343
Waiting for us

1314
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,647
What do you believe in God or not you understand me

1315
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,695
I think I do a little

1316
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:25,023
But also know if I understand correctly

1317
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:27,583
Not only is he denying climate

1318
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:34,239
But insisting that we need to pour more carbon into the atmosphere total in order to fulfill God's

1319
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,263
When

1320
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,287
Geoengineering

1321
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,311
To make sure that

1322
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,847
Campbell's can

1323
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,383
Be in the Sahara

1324
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:46,783
I got to say I've generally been onboard with you and your climate change stuff but what Alex is sitting here just makes me

1325
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:52,671
Max

1326
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,439
Sense

1327
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:56,767
And Greta

1328
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:03,167
Are out there trying to stop us geoengineering savior

1329
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:05,727
You know what I was what's the earth dying from

1330
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,311
What what do we need to save the Earth from

1331
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:14,687
From not having enough carbon glue tell you about Abraham

1332
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,903
I do do

1333
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:28,511
That's a pretty interesting as much as

1334
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:35,167
You from somewhere cuz I was reading everything goes through like 20,000 your Cycles at the Savannah and then a desert

1335
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,727
There's some parts of that that's natural

1336
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,519
That isn't relevant

1337
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:40,543
Said the larger cam

1338
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,359
I do think he's revealed that he's a young Arthur

1339
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,383
Right

1340
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:48,223
Cuz he's saying 678 thousand years ago

1341
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,783
So I think that's about when the last time it flooded

1342
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,063
Sure but I do

1343
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,343
He's describing

1344
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,903
Based on what I'm hearing is

1345
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,695
The massive

1346
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:01,279
Carbon dioxide in the air during

1347
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,327
Cretaceous or whatever

1348
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:07,167
All the plants grow so big that's why the dinosaurs could grow so big

1349
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:10,495
So he's like the atmosphere is

1350
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:15,615
Maybe I'll admit that I'm not really well-read on the bat

1351
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:19,967
Subject so I wouldn't really be able to assess whether Allen

1352
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:20,991
What is in line with that

1353
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,295
I'm not positive from what do you think

1354
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,063
Because

1355
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:30,463
The last time the Sahara wasn't the desert desert desert defied

1356
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:32,255
Is around that time frame

1357
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:34,815
That's kind of how I read

1358
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,095
Entirely possible I just

1359
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:39,679
Can't say either way I just see him thinking that the dinosaurs are only

1360
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,703
Center 8.

1361
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,239
That's possible

1362
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,263
So is this

1363
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:46,079
Next clip Alex gets back to the Australian fires

1364
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,895
And we know he has a bad perspective on us

1365
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,967
And it turns out his perspective

1366
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:52,735
Has it

1367
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,831
Department press releases

1368
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:59,647
And a newscast about Muslims being arrested

1369
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:06,047
And indicted for setting fires they believe in there laughing outside the court

1370
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:06,815
Laughing

1371
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,375
Fake photos

1372
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,423
Snopes says that that's a fake

1373
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,495
Chipotle

1374
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,591
Directions

1375
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,359
Turnt out

1376
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,431
Got it from a major

1377
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,503
Public Library

1378
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,039
A portal

1379
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:30,879
I got to say I definitely saw this Development coming

1380
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:37,791
Yep when I first got it covered this narrative on Alex's show I read Paul's article about the Australian fires

1381
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:39,583
There's and he didn't linked any police

1382
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,351
Supporting

1383
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,631
I was just one tweet

1384
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,935
From 7News that he was using as a source

1385
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:46,751
Now however you know the narrative is pivoted

1386
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,775
He's blaming Muslim

1387
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:52,127
So I thought why not see if Paul has written a new article and see if there's any updated information

1388
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:58,527
I went to Summit. News and the only thing I could find is a new video the Paul shot with the title quote

1389
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,087
Who started the Australian bushfires

1390
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,879
With the subtitle quote

1391
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,927
The question the media won't ask

1392
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:08,255
Beastars manga

1393
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,303
It's Angie we sure it's not

1394
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,071
A laser

1395
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:14,911
I could be a laser

1396
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:19,007
It's just you know Paul Standard mobile

1397
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:19,775
Stop

1398
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:24,639
The first 5 minutes of the video is Paul getting really defensive about how people criticized him for writing the most

1399
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:28,223
Celebrated the Notre Dame fire

1400
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:29,503
Like Facebook

1401
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:36,159
Event weaves in a Breitbart article that involves some official from Israel saying that are some could be considered Terror

1402
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:41,023
A Daily Mail article about Isis using fire as a weapon in Syria

1403
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:44,095
All of this is to imply that the fires

1404
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:46,143
In Australia are Muslim terrorists

1405
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,447
It's not even close to subtle

1406
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,727
What is insinuation

1407
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,751
Engaged

1408
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:51,775
That's brutal

1409
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,543
That's just

1410
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,591
Hold on

1411
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:57,407
After rambling about Isis using fires as well

1412
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:03,295
Paul as if he's a man working for a dude is getting sued by literally everyone says and I quote

1413
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:06,111
It's not to say there's any evidence

1414
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,903
But this is taking place in Australia

1415
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:12,767
But a zebra can't change its stripes quote

1416
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,047
Here's the full quote

1417
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:18,399
That's not to say there's any evidence that that's taking place in Australia

1418
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,167
But we have

1419
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,191
To ask the question

1420
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:24,287
Ohmygod translate that means I have no reason

1421
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:27,871
Proof that Muslims have anything to do with these bushfires but

1422
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,663
The only reason I haven't

1423
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,199
Careers to satisfy bigots

1424
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:34,527
Do I need to try and make some kind of insinuation here to keep them happy

1425
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,599
This is legitimately sickshit and you can see how the

1426
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,623
Pipeline works

1427
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:42,463
Paul does this mealy-mouthed we got to ask the question s***

1428
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:45,535
And then that's taken by Alex who pretends that it's reporting

1429
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,815
And that it was Muslim

1430
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:51,167
The only think Paul has to go on here at the Gateway pundit article

1431
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:53,471
About a couple of Muslim teenagers who are rest

1432
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,239
Super starting with I

1433
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:58,847
Paul is is walking that suggestiveness line is always

1434
01:07:59,103 --> 01:07:59,871
Trying to play with

1435
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:02,431
The edge of a are these kids are secret Arrow

1436
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,199
Breasts

1437
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,247
Unfortunately he's super sloppy

1438
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:10,111
Any accidentally flashes the article up on screen including the portion of the article that says quote

1439
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:13,183
The brothers set off fireworks that started a park on fire

1440
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,719
Probably sounds like a

1441
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:19,583
His big angle isn't this picture of one of them

1442
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:22,655
Apparently laughing after they get out of court

1443
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:23,935
Did I say

1444
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,703
Who cares

1445
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:28,031
Would Paul cover it if it was a white kid who is rest

1446
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:30,847
Super Starting Fire laughing after he got out of court

1447
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:36,479
Would you do a f****** 10-minute video about his kid might actually secretly be a member of some white extremist group

1448
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:37,759
Psych have doubts

1449
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:38,527
But he would

1450
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,063
I just don't

1451
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:46,463
Yeah also I think Alex just admitting that clippity didn't pay to use that photo that he stole from Sputnik

1452
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:52,351
And also I read the Snopes article about the Notre Dame misinformation and they don't even mention Infowars

1453
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:59,007
They don't even mention whatever picture Alex is talking about they're more concerned with an obviously doctored video that was making the rounds

1454
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:01,823
We're someone put audio people yelling Allah Akbar

1455
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,359
Over video of the cathedra

1456
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:05,151
I have no idea what Alex's

1457
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,943
Projecting about here but if I had to guess

1458
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:07,967
It's the stress

1459
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:10,783
It's brought on by two decades of being full of s*** yeah

1460
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,087
Man that remind cuz that's such

1461
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:19,231
Like they just put out a the results of a poll where massive amount of people

1462
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:22,303
Think that I ran around already has a nuclear

1463
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,839
Because

1464
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:29,727
Because of that disinformation and just the mashing together

1465
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:32,543
It doesn't matter if you're saying that they do or not

1466
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:35,359
Just put them right next to each other often enough

1467
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:37,151
Just like with this

1468
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:43,551
Did Muslims start the fires in Australia repeat that question and people won't even bother

1469
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,087
Bother answering it

1470
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,623
Just assume that it's already been

1471
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:49,183
Inquiring minds want to know exactly

1472
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:54,047
Exactly

1473
01:09:54,303 --> 01:10:00,191
And 3 years from now you're like a do you remember when the Muslim started those fires in Australia and you like

1474
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:02,495
You didn't even bother answering the question

1475
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,543
Right

1476
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:07,103
Teases this interview with Richard Spencer Seymour

1477
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:09,663
It's really important to understand how he

1478
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,711
He thinks this is going to go

1479
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,991
Before it actually starts

1480
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:17,087
And there's some interesting wrinkles here

1481
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,623
AAA surprise

1482
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:22,463
How much racism we've already got in total

1483
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,767
I think that's also really important to point out

1484
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:31,167
Richard Spencer most famous white nationalist

1485
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:37,567
$3 bill

1486
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:41,919
Cadillac funeral

1487
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:42,943
Fruit looks like a blast

1488
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:44,991
And of course you walk over to plastic

1489
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,343
Maybe he's for real

1490
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,159
Thinking we get to you.

1491
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,719
Richard Spencer get slug

1492
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,255
Which I don't agree with

1493
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:59,583
So I get this sense that Alex is like

1494
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:01,887
He thinks that he's going to have like this

1495
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,935
Gotcha moment where he's like

1496
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,215
You work for the globalist

1497
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,263
Richard Spencer

1498
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:10,079
Like I think he thinks that that's

1499
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:15,455
Maybe a possibility you really think he believes that he's going to know but I think he thinks that he's going

1500
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,223
Going to be in charge of

1501
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:21,599
This conversation hand somehow

1502
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,879
Secondly

1503
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,415
I get a sense

1504
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:26,719
Listening to the way he's framing this

1505
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:29,791
There's almost a disappointment in the idea that he's

1506
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:33,375
Yeah we'll see if he's real yes he's for real

1507
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,399
Almost like

1508
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,703
It would be good if he's real

1509
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:40,287
Yeah well you want that apple looks fake but you want it to be

1510
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:43,615
Right you want that apple to be real haha

1511
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,943
Because you're friends with that apple and you're also a Nazi

1512
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:49,247
We'll see

1513
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,527
If he's real

1514
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:53,599
Alex Goes to College little bit before

1515
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:57,695
Spencer and this caller is talking

1516
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,719
Think about how

1517
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:00,767
You know like immigrants

1518
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,303
They come into the country

1519
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:04,095
There's a vote however there toll

1520
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,679
This is this is a weird thing

1521
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,959
Because this color has a

1522
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:10,239
Respected that Alex should just

1523
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:13,567
Agree with right. That part but somehow

1524
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:15,871
This is weird

1525
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,151
People don't have

1526
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,015
Hillary Clinton

1527
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:26,111
About how they're cold and they're brainwashed a Isis and I hate white people

1528
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:28,159
That's why I feel that brainwashing stops

1529
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:33,023
We have to get control of that and then truck has to bring those folks out of the Shadows

1530
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,583
Just like Abraham Lincoln was attack

1531
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,399
What they call Abraham Lee

1532
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,751
You know what you know I think that if this guy

1533
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:45,055
Paid attention to Alex's hear what

1534
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,847
Alex calls Abraham Lincoln

1535
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:53,247
What Alex is not in favor of Abraham Lincoln

1536
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:56,575
No reason decided to fight his ancestors who Alex also is

1537
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:02,975
Alex and guests like Steve pieczenik and be just like within the last week's B was talking about how bad Abraham

1538
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:05,279
The Infowars line is

1539
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,815
F****** Confederate

1540
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,863
Guess guys should

1541
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,143
Understand like

1542
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:16,543
Oh yeah yeah they're saying bad things about Trump but you should see what they said about Lincoln back in the day as if to imp

1543
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:22,943
Apply what Lincoln did was good and misunderstood

1544
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:23,711
All of those

1545
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,479
Things about Lincoln

1546
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:30,623
And if you were and if you were listening to that show back then you would call in and talk about how much you hate Lincoln

1547
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,903
Total that's what you were

1548
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,695
Did Lincoln would be there Obama

1549
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:39,071
So we get an hour to sort of the intro the preamble to talk

1550
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,863
Answer and Alex

1551
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,655
Seems to think that

1552
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:47,263
He's on this whole thing where is like Richard Spencer is a liberal

1553
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,799
Really

1554
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:49,567
Right

1555
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,103
If he's bought into that

1556
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,127
Framing a little bit

1557
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,151
Richard Spencer

1558
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:57,247
Easier to come on the show

1559
01:13:57,503 --> 01:14:00,575
You know most liberals and socialists will not come on the show

1560
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,855
But

1561
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:07,231
And he's really been angry at that.

1562
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:13,887
So I think that's ludicrous for a number of reasons

1563
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:15,679
But

1564
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:22,335
Leaving those aside I want to give a real important caveat here and that some of the things that

1565
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,871
But I'm going to end up saying

1566
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,151
Sound

1567
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,431
Positive

1568
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,199
About Richard

1569
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,991
Subway and they are not

1570
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,039
Okay I think this guy's a pile of s***

1571
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:34,879
Sucks is a liar and he's a dangerous person

1572
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:36,671
Very much so

1573
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,695
Across-the-board

1574
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:41,279
I might end up saying some complimentary things about him

1575
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,303
In the sense

1576
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,863
That he's better at this than Alex

1577
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:48,191
That is the only context in which

1578
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:51,263
I am going to say positive things

1579
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,055
And I do not want that to be missed

1580
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,079
Construed by anybody

1581
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,615
Also

1582
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,663
Before we get into this interview

1583
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:59,199
I'd like to play

1584
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,479
A clip

1585
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,503
I'm Spencer

1586
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:03,551
That's recently

1587
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,319
Leaked

1588
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,855
You are this

1589
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:06,879
Okay

1590
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,927
So ask if Milo is involved in

1591
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:10,463
Anyting I just skip over

1592
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,743
No interest

1593
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:18,143
These Charlottesville rally the unite the right rally Milo apparently recorded Richard Spencer

1594
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,679
Having a little bit of a breakdown

1595
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,959
About what happened

1596
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:23,263
What is ranting

1597
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,031
A little bit

1598
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,823
And I guess

1599
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:27,103
Whatever reason

1600
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,639
Milo wanted to diss

1601
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:31,199
And some cell from some of these communities

1602
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:34,527
The end of last year he posted this audio

1603
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,551
On YouTube

1604
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:36,575
And

1605
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:39,135
Just a little bit of a Content warning this language in here

1606
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:39,903
It's pretty bad

1607
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,151
So

1608
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:36,223
Obviously this is coming from Bi-Lo who is they

1609
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:41,343
A source of information you never like to take information

1610
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:44,159
I'm from but you would be someone who is situated in

1611
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:50,559
In such a way as to be able to record something like that so it lend some credibility to it

1612
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,583
Come from inside

1613
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:54,399
It's not like we're going to walk up and

1614
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,191
Record Richard Spencer saying that

1615
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,239
It sounds exactly like

1616
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:00,799
Spencer's why so it's either him or

1617
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:02,079
The Great

1618
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:04,895
Rich Little Randy credico

1619
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:08,991
Greater presidents of Arts

1620
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:12,575
Further it sounds exactly like the messaging

1621
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:16,671
It sounds in line with what Someone Like Richard Spencer dustbelief

1622
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,951
So I

1623
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,487
Of course

1624
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,279
Reached for comment

1625
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,839
Tons of publication

1626
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:26,911
Richard Spencer has not commented on

1627
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:30,751
He doesn't want to dignify the story but obviously

1628
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,287
It's a deepfake

1629
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:35,615
So I played it I play that because I think it's important to wreck

1630
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,919
It's slick leazzy

1631
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,199
He's going to try and come off

1632
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:41,503
In this interview and as he does all the

1633
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,295
Beneath that

1634
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:44,575
F****** insane

1635
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:45,855
Right

1636
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,391
So Alex

1637
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,927
Starts off this interview

1638
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:49,695
And I think

1639
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:50,719
He thinks

1640
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:53,279
This is going to go very differently

1641
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,303
Then it.

1642
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,863
Give me your current video of President Trump

1643
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,703
Why you're angry

1644
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,239
Metropolis is not your

1645
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,031
Your fuhrer anymore

1646
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:08,127
Well he was never a a leader

1647
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:10,175
I don't think I need to talk about

1648
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:12,223
How Trump from a white nationalist respect

1649
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,015
I think I could talk about Trump

1650
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:17,855
American nationalist even conservative

1651
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,183
To deliver

1652
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,207
Convey

1653
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,487
Keystone prom

1654
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,255
Promises

1655
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,047
His 2016 campaign

1656
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:28,095
There is no law

1657
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:31,167
Graichen restriction is not

1658
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,959
Going to be in the cards

1659
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,007
Policies on health

1660
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:38,079
Healthcare admin the other things are absolutely income

1661
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:38,847
Hear it

1662
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,871
We have been

1663
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:40,639
Getting

1664
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,943
Domestically deep

1665
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,479
Call Ryan agenda

1666
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:46,783
Daenerys

1667
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:50,623
And so on and we be getting the George W bush agenda

1668
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:53,183
In the Middle East it's not quite as bad

1669
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:54,975
Give Trump that

1670
01:18:55,999 --> 01:19:01,631
But yes very bad he is making war in the Middle East more likely

1671
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,911
Play

1672
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:06,751
What not just me but what hit the PIN

1673
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,543
Ace of supporters voted

1674
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,663
It is true that he said he's going to cut back

1675
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,431
I could leave

1676
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:17,503
Types of visas for skilled workers

1677
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,295
And then he hasn't done that

1678
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:22,623
That was Alex's first question

1679
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,647
You can tell that

1680
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,951
He might be realizing that he is in no way

1681
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,487
Prepared to have this conversation

1682
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:32,863
I was legitimately thinks he can just say what's wrong with drawn from a white nationalist perspective and think that

1683
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:34,399
Anyway get Richard

1684
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,935
F****** Spenser on his heels

1685
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,215
41

1686
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:39,519
Labeling the sky white nationalist is knocking

1687
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,591
Tardis human anyway from the perspective of Alex's audience

1688
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:47,711
Many of them probably think that white nationalist just means being a white person who's also a nationalist

1689
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:49,247
And the rest of them don't say

1690
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:51,295
I think that white nationalism is a bad thing

1691
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,391
In the way Alex delivers his quest

1692
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,927
100%

1693
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,695
Trump isn't

1694
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:59,743
Spencer's pure anymore

1695
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,767
But that smugness

1696
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:03,839
Can only really be the result of not realizing that Richards

1697
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,119
Spencer is a pro

1698
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,655
He's been doing this for years now

1699
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:09,727
And every single interview he's had in that time it's been at least

1700
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,519
On sublevel confrontation

1701
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:16,640
It's the easiest thing in the world for him to deflect that week s*** and push forward with his own talking

1702
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:19,712
Is a fewer Trump's never been a leader

1703
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:22,272
What do you think of trump from white nationalist perspective

1704
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:24,576
I don't need to speak from a white nationalist perspective

1705
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:26,624
I can talk from the perspective of nationalism

1706
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,392
Drop the bass

1707
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:29,952
Sprite with just those two simple deflection

1708
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:33,280
Spencer's completely neutralize these two accusations

1709
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:35,072
But I would start at the interview with

1710
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:35,840
Empty

1711
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,120
Given himself

1712
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,912
The High Ground in the conversation

1713
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,680
Which

1714
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,728
That's going to allow him to deliver these talking

1715
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,032
Which Alex can't really disagree with

1716
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:46,080
You can almost hear in

1717
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:49,408
In Alex when Spencer stop stalking and there's a long pause

1718
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,432
And all Alex

1719
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:54,784
Can come up with is a comment about Hope Trump hasn't cut down visas for skilled workers like you

1720
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:55,552
Upromise

1721
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:59,136
Whatever Alex hope to get out of this conversation is already gone

1722
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:03,232
He's failed right out of the gate because he had no idea who he was about to talk to

1723
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,768
And he underestimated his gas

1724
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,304
And again to be clear

1725
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:08,352
It's not say the richest Bachelor some kind of

1726
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:10,400
Superhuman think or debater

1727
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,936
Is there someone is skill levels

1728
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,704
Hi

1729
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,984
High above Alex

1730
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:16,800
That reminds me of when I was

1731
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,848
First starting out in comedy I went to

1732
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,640
A show

1733
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:23,200
Featuring a friend of the show Marty.

1734
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:27,552
And it was put on at a theater

1735
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:32,672
And it was a regular comedy show put on in a 500-seat theater

1736
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,464
And maybe 50 people show

1737
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:36,256
And

1738
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:37,536
It was

1739
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:38,816
A disaster

1740
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:41,120
The stage was too high and so on and so forth

1741
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,144
What's a Marty

1742
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:46,752
It is featuring set just jumps off the stage and starts wandering through the crowd and

1743
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,032
Blew the place up

1744
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:50,592
50 people made the theater huge

1745
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:53,152
But then the headliner to follow up

1746
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,200
He tried to stand on the stage

1747
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,224
And you can't go by

1748
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:59,808
Marty had changed the the Battleground in Thai

1749
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,088
Right

1750
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,880
The headliner wasn't equipped

1751
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:05,696
That is what Richard Spencer just did

1752
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:12,608
Alex. He was going to have a thought he was going to have a white nationalist conversation and all the sudden the criticism

1753
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:13,376
Comes from

1754
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:16,192
A completely different Battleground Alex is not

1755
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,216
Able to

1756
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:20,544
If you can't sort of predict

1757
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,824
That is what's going

1758
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,848
It happened that means

1759
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:24,128
The year either

1760
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:25,408
Terrible

1761
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,688
At the job

1762
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,968
View signed up for

1763
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:33,856
Or maybe you're not super terrible but you just weren't prepared for the circumstances that you have allowed yourself

1764
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:36,160
To get in this is why you don't do convey

1765
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:37,184
Crustaceans like this

1766
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:37,952
Unless

1767
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:38,976
You are

1768
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:40,256
Fully prepared

1769
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:42,304
Unless you take it very seriously

1770
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,072
Because

1771
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:43,840
Like

1772
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:48,192
Salt Lake I keep stressing Someone Like Richard Spencer Knows these things

1773
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,472
Like

1774
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,264
He's fought through these

1775
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,032
Countries

1776
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:54,336
But do you like okay if someone asks

1777
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,360
This question what's

1778
01:22:55,616 --> 01:23:01,760
The best way to proceed whether or not he's sat down and actually diagram these things have no f****** idea but intuitively

1779
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,808
Experience in rap

1780
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,088
Petition he understand

1781
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:07,648
Okay here's wearing attack is going to come from

1782
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:09,184
Here's what I do with that

1783
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,232
Yeah it's very simple and he learned

1784
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,768
The link it back the crowd work

1785
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:16,352
Comedy club or kind of works the same way

1786
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:19,680
But you know that there's only a certain number of

1787
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:23,008
Types of things an audience member can yell at you

1788
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:24,544
So if you come up with

1789
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,592
Like standard

1790
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:28,640
Kind of strategy to respond

1791
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:29,408
2

1792
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:31,200
Me and the things that said

1793
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:34,016
Unintelligible thing that said

1794
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:37,344
You'll be able to roll with it much better

1795
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,880
Panthers able to roll with

1796
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,928
These are blue

1797
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:41,696
Frame

1798
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:42,720
The conversation

1799
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,000
The framing failed

1800
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,280
It completely failed

1801
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:46,560
And now it is up to

1802
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,352
Spencer to just dictate

1803
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,632
The terms of what they're going

1804
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:51,424
Absolutely I'd now

1805
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,704
He does that

1806
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,496
Immediately after that

1807
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,520
Takes me high

1808
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:58,848
I overheard the tail end of your last Converse

1809
01:23:59,104 --> 01:23:59,616
Versation

1810
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:03,456
And you were both saying well we don't fear h1tv

1811
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,480
IH-10

1812
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,272
Divisas

1813
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,832
Smart Indians or someone well

1814
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,928
The fact is we actually should care about issues like that

1815
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:18,816
Immigration is not simply about illegals or very poor unskilled

1816
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:19,584
People coming in

1817
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:21,632
There are billions

1818
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:23,168
The people who are highly

1819
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,704
Highly-skilled have II

1820
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:28,288
Can come into the United States and displace them

1821
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,312
Middle class

1822
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:31,104
Anyway read wipes

1823
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,384
Then low-skill

1824
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,664
Illegal immigrants

1825
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,200
Doing construction or

1826
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,224
Boy job

1827
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:40,832
Very serious issue and you actually she idiot

1828
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:43,136
A big unskilled

1829
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,928
The underclass taking control

1830
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:49,280
I think more smart people will build the country up not displaced a little blast

1831
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:51,584
Dumb people that'll destroy us

1832
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:57,472
We're dumb and migrants to Smart immigrants to be free

1833
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:00,800
Heated smart immigrant or Glendale ocado

1834
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:06,944
Jobs at University of North America Dell up once Europeans came here

1835
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:13,856
So now that Spencer's realized you can take the upper hand in the conversation it begins immediately with bringing up things Alex said earlier and

1836
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:16,160
And this case

1837
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:18,976
How to desire for more high-skilled and intelligent Democrat

1838
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:24,608
Alex is going to have a really hard time defending his position against someone who's willing to take the other side

1839
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,888
Which Spencer is

1840
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,936
So this is Rocky territory

1841
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:34,336
And you can see how not great Alex is standing is when all I can come up with his smart immigrants made this country would Europe

1842
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:35,360
Game over

1843
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:36,896
Without any

1844
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:39,968
Without any effort without any Force

1845
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:44,064
Spencer is elicited a white nationalist idea from Alex

1846
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:44,832
Bye

1847
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:47,648
Not even cleverly hiding his own whiteness

1848
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:48,928
Thought that was

1849
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:49,952
That was brutal

1850
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:53,024
And he has no real reason to hide it and he's not

1851
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:58,400
Immediately after this

1852
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,704
It's pretty clear in the context of that

1853
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,984
Clip

1854
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:02,752
I've just

1855
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:05,312
Of course he doesn't mind a massive

1856
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,592
Unskilled immigrant

1857
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,360
Population

1858
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,640
He wants to enslave

1859
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:10,944
Right you know that's what he would like to

1860
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:11,968
He doesn't want

1861
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:12,736
Intelligent

1862
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,856
Alex is going to have a tough time

1863
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,136
Unskilled people are not until

1864
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,928
That's bulshit

1865
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,512
Alex is going to be tough time

1866
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:28,352
Combining his talking points and worlds you with

1867
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,632
Arguing against

1868
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:30,912
What sponsor is bringing

1869
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:34,752
He isn't he's in a kind of an unwinnable situation for himself

1870
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,032
And that sucks

1871
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,568
So

1872
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,384
Expensive kind of

1873
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,432
Brazil's a little bit of this

1874
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,504
Whiteness being at the core of all of it in

1875
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,088
I agree to a very large extent but the

1876
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:53,440
The United States was in 1790

1877
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,744
Ultimately a white Khan

1878
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,328
Country with a white European country with an Anglo Protestant

1879
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,352
Fortuitous

1880
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,400
Brought in lots of other European

1881
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,424
Was

1882
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,800
So Alex is said that smart immigrants made America in Spencer

1883
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:14,176
Completely dismisses that comment by claiming to partially agree with it then moving on to his talkingpoi

1884
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,456
And he knows that Alex

1885
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:17,248
Can't really disagree with it without count

1886
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,272
Contradicting his own position

1887
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,600
America was not a white country at its founding

1888
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:24,672
Good God that's kind of a silly thing to say for a lot of reason

1889
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,952
But the most important is

1890
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:28,512
Because what we perceive as white today is not

1891
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:31,072
The same is the 1700's definition of wife

1892
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,120
In the late 1800s

1893
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:37,216
Italian immigrants were absolutely not considered white whereas now you'll be hard-pressed

1894
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:39,520
How to find someone who glued Italians from the category

1895
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:42,080
Same goes for Irish polish in Greek

1896
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,616
Throughout the country's history

1897
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:47,200
Winship Benjamin Franklin called the German people living in Pennsylvania

1898
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,480
Palatine board

1899
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:51,808
You could make the argument that the country is Anglo-Saxon

1900
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,088
In nature

1901
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:54,112
At the beginning Maybe

1902
01:27:54,368 --> 01:28:00,000
But if you did that you're kind of implying with a goal should be for us to make it an Anglo-Saxon country now

1903
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:01,280
Which is not a white one

1904
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:03,328
Because those aren't the same thing

1905
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,912
Current a white nationalist trying to wave this idea way because

1906
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:11,776
Definition of white is not one that would be productive if you try and

1907
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:12,544
Consult history

1908
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:14,592
Their definition includes

1909
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:17,408
People they feel they would want to be in a group with

1910
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:19,968
Which conforms their underlying prejudices

1911
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,784
The sleight-of-hand trick if they're doing is

1912
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,064
Yeah it is it is

1913
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:27,904
Part where they try to pretend that the definition of white has always been the same

1914
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:28,928
And they're actually

1915
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:31,488
They're just in line with the founders of the country at

1916
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,280
They don't say that this country

1917
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:36,352
You should be Anglo-Saxon as a country because that sounds.

1918
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,120
Stupid

1919
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,912
And almost all of them would be

1920
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:40,448
Considered undesirable

1921
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:42,240
Undermining the purity of the country

1922
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:44,544
As they would have been in the 1700

1923
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:50,944
Spencer says 1790 and that closed because that was the year that the United States passed the Naturalization

1924
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:54,272
Which made all male white inhabitants of the country

1925
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:55,040
Citizens

1926
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:55,808
But again

1927
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:56,576
What is white name

1928
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:58,112
I guess that's an open question

1929
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:01,184
Considering decades later they still definitely didn't think Italian

1930
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:01,952
Games work

1931
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:05,536
My point here is this is a stupid conversation and it doesn't really prove any

1932
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:11,168
Even if somehow the founders of the country magically have the same arbitrary definition of white that Spencer does

1933
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:13,472
And they wanted this to be white country so what

1934
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:15,520
That's slaves and women couldn't vote

1935
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:18,080
I'm going to say that whatever their understanding of the world was

1936
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:19,360
It had room for improvement

1937
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:20,896
But here's the thing

1938
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:22,432
Spencer's talkingpoi

1939
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:23,968
This is a white country

1940
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:24,736
Is b*******

1941
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,528
But Alex can't refute that

1942
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:28,576
Without supporting some kind of Multicultural

1943
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,928
Spencer kind of headlight has Alex over a barrel where you have to choose between

1944
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:36,256
Supporting minorities are going along with explicit white nationalism

1945
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:39,584
Really having a tough time with this interview and we're only like two men

1946
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,656
I think what's interesting is

1947
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,936
They are arguing

1948
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:45,984
Flavors of white nationalism

1949
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:49,824
Yeah but Alex can't say that his flavor is different

1950
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,872
Because then you'd have to admit

1951
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:53,152
He has a flavor of lightning

1952
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:56,736
It's similar to the David Duke interview but I think worse

1953
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:57,504
For Alex

1954
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,064
Cuz

1955
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:03,136
I don't I don't know exactly how to describe this Alex

1956
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:07,232
I think you might have prepared a little better for the David Duke won

1957
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:10,816
Or at least he's known of David Duke for a really long time

1958
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:13,120
Or he was just more capable mentally back then

1959
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,144
Sure

1960
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:16,192
Irresponsible of me to

1961
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:22,592
Guess exactly what the reason is but he was more prepared for this he's completely off his game.

1962
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,176
You even see what

1963
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,200
Could be considered

1964
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:27,968
The two of them

1965
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:28,992
Kind of making

1966
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:29,760
Friends

1967
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:30,528
A little bit

1968
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:34,880
You're welcome

1969
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:36,928
Step we hear coming out of the

1970
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:38,976
Gratis way more racially-based

1971
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:44,864
Whites are bad people don't trust them

1972
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,912
Leaving because of the color they are

1973
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:50,240
See that white people into aggressive

1974
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:52,544
Race Pace individual cuz you're not going to have

1975
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,336
Other choice

1976
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:59,456
The Establishment organizes things to do erase base system that just like being in a prison

1977
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:04,576
I wouldn't want to have to go get in the Aryan wing of the present but I did not be killed

1978
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:08,416
I agree that there's a lot of Thai

1979
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,952
Toxic nasty

1980
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:11,232
Auntie White

1981
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:15,328
Rhetoric and even anti-white discrimination policy

1982
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,864
That are emerging from

1983
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:21,472
The GOP does next to nothing to actually

1984
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:26,080
We'll talk about

1985
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,360
Moderate compared

1986
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:30,432
The Democrat leadership Shane White

1987
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:36,320
You're not saying no

1988
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:43,232
Then you're like a little demon

1989
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:46,048
Self

1990
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:48,608
Then then then you are they very small evil

1991
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:52,192
Thank you Alex

1992
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,216
I'll take that

1993
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:57,312
There's almost a dismissive like humoring that's going on

1994
01:31:57,568 --> 01:32:00,384
Spencer has so much more power in this conversation

1995
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:04,736
And I think that's what Alex is doing okay I think he recognizes that like

1996
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:06,016
Spencer is

1997
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:07,808
Authority

1998
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:11,904
And I need to bring us together a little bit

1999
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:18,816
But also Alex realizes they like the whole premise of this interview you said it multiple times already on the show is that

2000
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,608
He thinks that he's false opposition

2001
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:25,472
So that is what needs to be dealt with your false opposition but you're not

2002
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:27,264
Well

2003
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:28,544
Here's the thing

2004
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:32,384
If you're going to make that kind of an accusation or bring up that subject

2005
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:35,200
I think you probably want to do it in a careful life

2006
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:36,992
As opposed to just blurting it out

2007
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,272
Alex.

2008
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:41,088
But my big be forgiven first

2009
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:44,416
Is that your synthetic and you're working for the global equipment

2010
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:46,976
I'm not

2011
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,512
Decker working to the globalist

2012
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:51,328
What I was saying before was it

2013
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:57,472
This whole episode Alex has been saying is going to confront Richard Spencer about how he thinks he's synthetic and working for the globalist

2014
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:59,776
Alex is so on his heels in this conversation

2015
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:05,920
And Spencer is maneuvering him so well that the only thing you could do is blurred think you work for the globalist comment

2016
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:10,784
That's a joke man I've ever seen First 48 hours I've ever seen

2017
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,832
Do you know when they do those

2018
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:13,856
I like

2019
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:16,672
Enter those tents interview scenes where the guy is like

2020
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:18,208
They're interrogate

2021
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:23,840
In the trying to figure out those always start with did you do it and then accepting whatever answer that right

2022
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:26,656
Did you do it no okay cool get out of here

2023
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:30,240
You can see how easily Spencer was able to take that as a sincere question

2024
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:31,776
That's a no then move on

2025
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:38,176
Spencer's in complete control of this conversation and Alex is completely wasted the only arrow we thought he had in his quiver

2026
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:42,528
He thought he was going to ask about the white nationalist perspective on Trump was a

2027
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:46,624
Spencer would say the Trump wasn't mean enough to the brown people and Alex could work with that

2028
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,392
Or something

2029
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,416
That didn't work out

2030
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:49,952
Now he's forced to

2031
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,488
Throw is supposed knockout

2032
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:53,280
The globalist accusation

2033
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,560
And Spencer doesn't even

2034
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:55,328
Flinch

2035
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:56,864
This is just sad this is like

2036
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,680
It's ridiculously bad

2037
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:01,984
The only reason people even enter

2038
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:05,056
Pain that like all white people are bad bulshit is

2039
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:06,336
Because of guys like

2040
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,104
Alexandra

2041
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:10,688
If I didn't know there were so many of these white Nashville

2042
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:14,272
Close out there it would never occur to me to think that all white people are bad

2043
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,808
Write other than our history

2044
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:16,576
Wow

2045
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:24,512
So Richard Spencer's starts talking about like there's an interesting thing with the the globalist

2046
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:25,536
Accusation

2047
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:29,120
And that is that Richard Spencer does recognize the global

2048
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:31,936
Possession is a necessary part of the modern world

2049
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:35,008
Ian so he talks about that a little bit and

2050
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,824
Alex just can't handle this s***

2051
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,104
There is a

2052
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,896
Basis

2053
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:42,688
Or identity politics

2054
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:44,480
That isn't just a

2055
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:45,504
Globalist

2056
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:47,040
Or is it just some bad

2057
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:48,320
Policy

2058
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,088
The Democratic

2059
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:53,440
We live in a globalized world

2060
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:56,512
We don't live in a world where your

2061
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:58,048
Eat your Consciousness is form

2062
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:04,704
By your neighborhood or maybe you're nice small nation-state at most we actually live in a world where we

2063
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:07,520
And the

2064
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:10,080
Major fissures of this

2065
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:11,104
Upcoming War are

2066
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,640
Are going to be racial

2067
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:13,920
Cultural

2068
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:17,504
You are a white man whether you like

2069
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,552
We're not your perceived

2070
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,344
As a white person

2071
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:24,160
Establishment

2072
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:25,440
Supai Emigrant

2073
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:29,024
Refugees and migrants and etcetera

2074
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:30,816
Identity is

2075
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:36,448
Upon Us in this time we need to plow everything not

2076
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:41,056
Geology of freedom and Americana that unifies they want to make it

2077
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:42,080
Racially-based

2078
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:44,128
Erase base system

2079
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,432
Have that warrant

2080
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:50,784
Until I see you playing in as the other side of the left trying to make it right space

2081
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:55,136
Eastbay

2082
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:01,024
About those two models

2083
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,072
I think it's okay to have that discussion

2084
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:05,632
It's not good to bad

2085
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:07,424
The left pushes erase space

2086
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:10,240
You are correct about that I'm saying

2087
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:16,384
You how did you come upon your ideas your system who you are and what you're pushing for

2088
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,152
That's

2089
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:20,224
That's so bad some good work right there

2090
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:23,552
I don't I don't even know exactly what Alex

2091
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:24,320
The same

2092
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,344
No clue

2093
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:28,672
No idea what he just said I don't know what he was trying to say

2094
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:30,464
Richard Spencer is

2095
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:32,256
Being a mess

2096
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:34,816
But he's also giving concise points

2097
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:41,472
That's a better artist for Alex to argue against

2098
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:47,872
Yeah well you know

2099
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:50,432
Avenue debate between these

2100
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:54,784
The I'm having a debate between these two systems or whatever

2101
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,832
Is that translates to

2102
01:36:57,344 --> 01:37:01,440
What do I do it's going on getting my ass beat

2103
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:02,208
Yes

2104
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:08,096
I do wish they would just play like Civilization instead of war game using the race war that's coming sure

2105
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:10,144
Civilization it's fun

2106
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:15,008
And the other problem to that I think is really intrinsic is that

2107
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:18,336
I don't think that Alex can really argue with a lot of things

2108
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:19,360
Spencer saying

2109
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:20,384
Because some of the

2110
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,664
Conclusions about like

2111
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:24,736
We just got to have a all us weights together

2112
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,808
Do you like it or not

2113
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:30,368
You're white which means you got to fight with the whites

2114
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:32,160
The upcoming War

2115
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:34,976
Might agree with that but wouldn't want to say it

2116
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:37,536
But a lot of the other stuff that he's talking

2117
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:40,096
Talking about is right in line with Alex's rhetoric

2118
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:42,912
The concept that the coming

2119
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:43,936
War is going

2120
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,984
Racial and cultural

2121
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:48,032
Like that is that is

2122
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,336
Infowars 101

2123
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,104
Absolutely

2124
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,384
So the fact

2125
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,176
So much overlap exist

2126
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:57,760
Steer it becomes very difficult for Alex to have any kind of a

2127
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:58,784
Conversation that

2128
01:37:59,040 --> 01:37:59,552
Involves

2129
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:02,368
Counterpoint's pushback

2130
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:03,648
Follow-up questions

2131
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:05,696
And that's why you see you like Alex

2132
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:07,488
Rambles is nonsense but

2133
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:11,584
Got rear-ended this stuff and then goes to where'd you get your ideas

2134
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:17,728
What because he thinks that the global he thinks that the rates were is coming but it's because the globalist are drumming up

2135
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:20,288
People from the other racist to hate on us

2136
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,336
Play the race war is coming

2137
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:25,408
And we all should buy together cuz white people.

2138
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:29,248
Richard Spencer into making whites identify as absolute because

2139
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:30,528
Spencer's work

2140
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:32,064
Thing for the globalist

2141
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,368
So

2142
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,160
In order to

2143
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:37,952
Make this even

2144
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:38,720
Worse

2145
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:41,024
I was hoping you would

2146
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:43,328
Spencer man he is

2147
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:45,120
He knows what he's doing

2148
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:46,912
We need to be proud

2149
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:48,192
Out of ourselves we need to

2150
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:49,984
We need to be tough

2151
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:54,336
Because one thing that I really like about you to spy

2152
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:55,360
Criticism

2153
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:56,384
That you are a bull

2154
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,152
Gold top

2155
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:58,432
Man's man and that's a

2156
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:03,040
White racing stabile apologizing

2157
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:04,064
We need to stop

2158
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:06,880
Cena beating around the bush on issues

2159
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:09,184
Add we need to be proud of who we are

2160
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:10,976
In terms of how I

2161
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:12,000
I came to these ideas

2162
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:15,072
IComfort

2163
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,352
From great.

2164
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:18,656
Background idle wonderful childhood 51

2165
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:19,424
Wonderful parents

2166
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:22,752
I could have just gone in and become a warrior and

2167
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:23,776
I made a lot of money

2168
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:30,944
When we come by at because because the right rally were all former Democrats

2169
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:36,064
I have no idea of Richard Spencer prepared for this interaction and new the

2170
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,368
You can easily compromised Alex with flattery

2171
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:41,696
Orbeez just intuitive enough to read the desperation and median

2172
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:43,488
Listen Alex whatever the case

2173
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:49,888
He comes in with the perfect compliment that Alex can't help everyone over by but not only

2174
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:53,216
You like you said Galaxy's a tough guy but on top of that

2175
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:55,520
Alex is what white men need to be like

2176
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:57,312
That's really hitting Alex

2177
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:58,592
Exactly where he lives

2178
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:05,248
Yep and you can see the end of that clip as Alex is going out to break he's almost walking back his suspicions about Spencer being fake

2179
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,528
He's capitulate

2180
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:10,368
He's explaining why he was suspicious as if to show all these cards

2181
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:16,256
What he's trying to apologize by laying out what made him suspicious which that almost looks like I'm sorry

2182
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:21,120
Fuse because five of the six were former Democrat so that's why I thought you were controlled opposition

2183
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:25,728
Now you have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt since you're not a lawyer

2184
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:28,544
I know I look that's why I was a re-look

2185
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,128
You're great I'm a big strong boy we're all having a great day

2186
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:35,200
So I when I get back from break Alex explains

2187
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:37,504
That reason for his suspicions

2188
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:38,784
And

2189
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:40,576
Like

2190
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:41,344
It's

2191
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,112
So lame

2192
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:46,464
Okay so rubber tree Spencer's here weather

2193
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:49,792
Talk to him himself near thing from his vows

2194
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:53,376
Y'all got some of the background here

2195
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:55,168
Classic in Ocala

2196
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:57,472
Prove that

2197
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:59,776
Then you guys have the unite the right rally

2198
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:03,104
Flash

2199
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:05,152
Out of that they blame Trump

2200
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:08,736
And then up most of the leadership of it we're like

2201
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:13,856
No I was supporting Obama but not an hour

2202
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:17,952
Hillary two years ago now I agree with Richard Spencer and where

2203
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:19,744
And it just looks like the left

2204
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,304
Creating a group to identify with Trump

2205
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,864
Deseo look he's a white nationalist

2206
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,168
Out there saying that

2207
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:28,192
And doing that

2208
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:39,456
Dialectic

2209
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,528
The problems and you Collide them together

2210
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,552
Create the

2211
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:45,600
Synthesis

2212
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:48,928
What do you think is really going on here and then who are you really

2213
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,720
First off

2214
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:53,024
I did not organized

2215
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:54,816
O'Reilly I was in

2216
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:57,632
Invited to speak at at and I was at top

2217
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:59,168
Build gas etcetera

2218
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:02,752
It is a perfect example of why Alex needs to do his homework

2219
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:08,128
His big conspiracy theory by Richard Spencer working for the globalist to create some white nationalist

2220
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,152
So you know

2221
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:12,992
Stop this big event to tarnish the Sterling reputation

2222
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:14,784
Necropsy spiracy

2223
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:18,368
Hinges on the idea that Spencer had something to do with the unite the right rally

2224
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:20,160
If that's not the case

2225
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,952
The whole thing falls out

2226
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:28,352
Because Alex doesn't really know what he's talkin about who he's talking to he thinks Spencer was one of the organizers of the rally and he's decide

2227
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:29,376
I did with no evidence

2228
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:31,168
All the rally organizer

2229
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:32,448
Like Jason Kessler

2230
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:33,472
Our secret Club

2231
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:36,800
His conspiracy Falls to pieces in 5 seconds

2232
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:41,152
When Spencer points out that he wasn't involved in organising the rally he was just invited speaker

2233
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:42,688
Every piece

2234
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:45,504
Valic suspicions about Spencer is easily dismiss

2235
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,040
And now it looks Ludacris

2236
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:50,624
To the audience it looks like Alex doesn't know what he's talking about

2237
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:56,000
And this sort of game would not be so easy to play with Alex or done any preparation

2238
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:59,584
It's interesting because I've looked into it and I

2239
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,120
Kind of think that Spencer's Li

2240
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:08,288
I know for sure that Jason Kessler was the lead organizer of the rally and Spencer is sometimes credited in stories and places like

2241
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:10,080
Like the hill is being an organizer

2242
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:11,616
But it's tough to find exact

2243
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:12,384
Confirmation

2244
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:17,248
The splc doesn't list him as an organizer just as the headline speaker

2245
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:19,808
Nnn article in the Associated Press from just

2246
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:20,832
After the rally

2247
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:22,624
They credit him as an attendee

2248
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,392
Of the rally

2249
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,720
That's said I find it pretty difficult to believe that he was

2250
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:28,512
Did Subway involved in the organization

2251
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:29,536
None of the event behind the scene

2252
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,096
And thankfully I don't have to go off insta

2253
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:34,144
Because right now Richard

2254
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,192
Spencer is one of the people facing a lawsuit

2255
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:37,728
Over the United right rally

2256
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:39,776
Which goes to trial this October

2257
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:42,848
In the course of the case proceeding a number Spencer's Tech

2258
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:45,920
Text messages were turned over to the court here in a filing

2259
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:51,040
The picture that's painted in these texts is one where Richard Spencer is far more than just a

2260
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:52,064
The speaker at the event

2261
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:53,344
In one text

2262
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,136
Spencer's requesting speaker booking

2263
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:58,208
Like he's saying hey what about this guy

2264
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,000
Getting in touch

2265
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:01,024
Jason Kessler

2266
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,560
We should have this guy

2267
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:07,936
In another Kessler's Consulting with Spencer about needing legal help for an insurance policy

2268
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:08,704
C4 the rally

2269
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:12,800
Do not text you to expect between an organizer in a headlining speaker

2270
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:14,336
They imply relationship

2271
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:15,104
Far more than

2272
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:20,736
Add to that the fact that Richard Spencer held a torch Centric rally

2273
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:22,272
In Charlottesville in May

2274
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:24,576
About three months prior to the unite the right rally

2275
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:28,672
It just kind of hard to accept that he was solely just a headlining speaker at the rally

2276
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:31,744
But all of that will likely be sorted out later this year when

2277
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,024
Skates goes to trial

2278
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:39,680
Considering the legal implications of him saying that he was an organizer like if he said the Howard Stern Show makes total sense

2279
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:43,008
Ultimately

2280
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:43,776
Depicts

2281
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:45,056
Point I want to make his

2282
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:49,152
Whether or not Spencer was an organizer or just one of the main speakers

2283
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:51,200
Is kind of secondary to the more important

2284
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:53,760
And that is that Alex's conspiracy

2285
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:56,832
The hinges on Spencer being an organizer of the event

2286
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:58,112
And even Alex

2287
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:59,648
Clearly doesn't know if that's

2288
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:00,416
True

2289
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:05,280
Spencer can dismiss that with a few Choice words and all of Alex's theories look like paranoia

2290
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:09,376
And Alex is made to look like he doesn't know what he's talking about in front of his audience

2291
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:10,912
This is really just a

2292
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:13,984
Display of Alex being outclassed by a very slick

2293
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:15,008
Very horrible person

2294
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:18,080
He's being humiliated in front of his audience

2295
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:22,688
08 you and your fellow organizers of the United right rally

2296
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:25,248
About to the other ones are clearly Secret globalist

2297
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,784
That's why I think that you are sick

2298
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,320
Secret Club

2299
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,368
Wow

2300
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:31,648
What do you think about you

2301
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,672
I love it

2302
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:33,952
But white

2303
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:34,976
She's only

2304
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,048
Do they make cheddar and white

2305
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:41,632
It's really sad

2306
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,168
So

2307
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:45,472
That being

2308
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,496
Established

2309
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:47,264
Now

2310
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:51,360
Richard Spencer is free to talk about some of his political leanings

2311
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:54,176
George Soros ending in people

2312
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:56,224
My own personal

2313
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:57,760
Background I never

2314
01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:59,296
Democrat

2315
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,576
Voted for

2316
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:02,112
John Kerry in 2000

2317
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,672
Reasons that I might very well vote

2318
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:10,048
For a Democrat again in 2020

2319
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:11,328
He organizes this rally

2320
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:12,096
Charlottesville

2321
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:15,680
Have a lot of

2322
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:16,704
Ideas

2323
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:18,752
Rattling around in his head

2324
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:20,800
I don't know if he knows who he is

2325
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:27,968
Tobey Maguire

2326
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:30,528
It's not terribly unusual for people

2327
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:31,808
Particularly young people

2328
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:33,856
Different directions

2329
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:41,024
Bobby Lawson was running elihu City facility white supremacist compound

2330
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:46,656
That's all Alex's Howard Howard

2331
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:52,032
No all pretense of a of an adversarial interview

2332
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:53,568
So he's coming Alex is trying to

2333
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:55,104
Need to come up with like

2334
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:58,176
You know hey Jason Kessler used to work that is like

2335
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:58,944
I don't like

2336
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:00,736
Yeah if you read the text

2337
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:02,272
Text that are in that Court filing

2338
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,040
There

2339
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,320
Horrible to Kessler

2340
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:05,344
They hate

2341
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:10,976
Thank you. There is an exchange between Richard Spencer and this other dude where they are

2342
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:12,512
Like talking about how

2343
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:15,328
They've discovered that Kessler's grandma is Jewish

2344
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:18,144
And they're going to blackmail him if they don't if he doesn't

2345
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:21,984
Leave them alone after the rally

2346
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:23,776
Say f****** hate this guy

2347
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:25,568
I don't like the idea that

2348
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:26,592
What is going to be like well

2349
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:28,896
I'm going to bring up your buddy

2350
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:31,200
Like no I don't like that

2351
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:33,760
Richard Spencer's position

2352
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:36,320
Politics makes more sense than Alex

2353
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:40,160
Like this accusation they like some of these people voted for Democrats like

2354
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:42,976
Yeah I voted for John Kerry because I'm against

2355
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:44,512
I hated you

2356
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:47,584
Didn't you hate towards consistently against

2357
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:54,752
And I am willing to vote and backup that position now I'm sure I'm sure it felt great for you to run around and you

2358
01:47:55,008 --> 01:48:00,640
Yell about Ron Paul we all knew Ron Paul wasn't going to get elected in George W Bush's a f****** warmog

2359
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:01,664
So

2360
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,712
Yes I voted Democrat

2361
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:04,480
That makes

2362
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:06,528
More sense and the explanation

2363
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:11,648
People particularly young people have you know they tend to go in different directions

2364
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:13,440
That is it that is

2365
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:16,768
Much closer to reality than the picture that I'll explain

2366
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:18,816
And the reason why this is dangerous

2367
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:19,840
Is because

2368
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:20,608
Richard

2369
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:25,216
Goddamn Spencer is making way more sense than Alex on Alex's own should absolutely

2370
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:26,240
Because

2371
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:27,776
There are defensive bars

2372
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:30,080
Solo

2373
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:33,920
Alex's accidentally allowing him a platform

2374
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:35,968
That not only normalizes him

2375
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:37,760
It makes it look better than that

2376
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:39,040
Man

2377
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:44,416
Are you I want to say I don't know if I want to say this but I don't know if this is

2378
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:46,208
I don't either

2379
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:51,072
I really don't know if this it cuz if I could have an accident on Alex's bar

2380
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:55,680
But I don't know if it's an accident based on whoever book this morning

2381
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:59,264
I think Alex wanted to come off better but I do think that the point

2382
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,544
Was to

2383
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:02,336
Platform

2384
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:05,920
As well as I struggled as well as like

2385
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:07,712
Grab attention for

2386
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:11,040
I haven't got the balls to talk to a wire

2387
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:13,856
I struggle with what I say

2388
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:15,392
The motivation would be

2389
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:17,696
And I think for me to actually say

2390
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:24,096
What We Alright this is why he's doing this I think I'll be a responsible

2391
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:25,888
Feels like that

2392
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:26,912
King is the editorial

2393
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:27,936
You know

2394
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:32,288
Subway but I mean again like we talked about on the last episode you can have people on if you have a

2395
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:33,312
Confrontational

2396
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:35,360
Approached

2397
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:37,920
At least pretending that's what he's doing

2398
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:40,736
So you could easily say like well

2399
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:43,552
He executed terribly that is intention was right

2400
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:48,928
Back on the stupid the evil continue

2401
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:51,488
That is

2402
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:53,280
A possible

2403
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:56,864
Like I was going back and forth with like what is

2404
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:58,400
The reason for this happening

2405
01:49:58,912 --> 01:50:01,216
And I think a big reason for it is

2406
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:03,264
They're both white identity guys

2407
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,032
And

2408
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:06,080
Richard Spencer's recently broken

2409
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:06,848
With Trump

2410
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:09,152
That is

2411
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:10,688
Something with relevant to Alex

2412
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,712
I think he wants

2413
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:12,480
To bring him on

2414
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:18,624
Humiliate him yet because Oye globalist would do

2415
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:20,928
That motivation makes total

2416
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:23,744
Similarly I think

2417
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:26,304
That there might be a kernel of it that is

2418
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:31,424
I want to bring on someone who's demonstrable a white nationalist white supremacist

2419
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:33,472
I distance myself from them

2420
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:36,288
Because everyone thinks that I'm that

2421
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:38,848
If I'm publicly disagreeing with this guy

2422
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:39,872
Then

2423
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:40,896
Right

2424
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:41,920
I think

2425
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:44,736
I think that there's possibly a very complex

2426
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:46,784
Motivation

2427
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:51,136
Yeah I agree with you I'm not I'm not I don't think it is simple

2428
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:52,672
Vienna

2429
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:53,696
By any means

2430
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:55,232
It's cuz there's so many different.

2431
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:56,768
And having rich

2432
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:58,816
Spencer on your show

2433
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:02,144
It don't I could almost even see it being a setup

2434
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:04,192
The booker was like

2435
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:09,568
I'm a white nationalist and I want to get these views out and I know Alex doesn't have a shot against this guy

2436
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:16,224
Yeah you know I'm losing my mind

2437
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:20,064
All possible explanations for why this is happening as being

2438
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,344
Possible but I don't

2439
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:23,904
I think the psychology that Alex

2440
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:26,976
Consistently expressive

2441
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:29,536
Leaves me far more towards

2442
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:32,864
Like he's going to eat wants to have him on to provide some

2443
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,656
Some sort of a distance between them

2444
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:37,472
Whatever energy have the Builder

2445
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:38,752
Example address

2446
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:40,032
Being pretty

2447
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:42,592
Clearly that so it's more likely that that's

2448
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:43,360
The situation

2449
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:46,176
I think also that's not taking it

2450
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:47,712
Into account the amount of differ

2451
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:48,480
Prince there is

2452
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:51,040
Spring 2015 Alex in 2020 absolutely

2453
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:52,576
Lakeview

2454
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,648
Even if his intention was

2455
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:56,928
To do the same thing

2456
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:57,952
I thought you was doing

2457
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:59,232
The David Duke interview

2458
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:01,280
The circumstances aren't

2459
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:02,304
Same

2460
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:04,608
Is bad

2461
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:06,656
That we can agree

2462
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:08,704
How did main criticism

2463
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:12,288
Is that he thinks that he's false opposition music

2464
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:13,056
Believe

2465
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:16,384
We are I think I think their criticisms is just

2466
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:17,408
Squasht

2467
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:21,248
Position like that

2468
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,272
Created

2469
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:24,832
That is not who I am

2470
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:31,232
I'm.

2471
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:40,704
You and I might have similar origins in the sense that

2472
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:44,288
Young Angelina

2473
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:46,592
There was something wrong with the world

2474
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:49,408
So at this point Alice has made his accusation

2475
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:50,176
Spencer's

2476
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:51,456
Responded to it in the negative

2477
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:54,272
And Alex has accepted his claim that he's not false opposition

2478
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:56,064
If you're paying attention

2479
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,368
That means that Alex is just a deuced

2480
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,160
He's talkin to a legit White

2481
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:05,280
It should be the point of the interview where Alex takes issue with Spencer's white nationalism

2482
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:06,816
But that is what I see

2483
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:08,608
I see Alex and well

2484
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:11,680
Who are you then it opens

2485
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:16,800
He opens the door for Spencer to create Report with it by saying I bet we're a lot alike when we were starting

2486
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,336
This is manipulation

2487
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:19,360
And Alex

2488
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:20,640
Completely unaware

2489
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:22,432
Or totally fine with the fact that

2490
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:23,200
But he's being played

2491
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:25,248
Yeah did Spencer like

2492
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:30,112
Call pechanec before this just being like give me give me some give me some Playbook here

2493
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:31,136
Let me know what

2494
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:32,416
Steps I need to take

2495
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:34,976
And then I'll get him saying that he's a Nazi by the end of the

2496
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:39,072
See I don't I don't think that's necessary like I think the

2497
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:40,608
You know like the flattery

2498
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:45,472
Stuff I think that would be something that someone who has some awareness of how people

2499
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:50,336
Are communicating would pick up on and be like all right I'm going to flatter this guy and he's going to roll over

2500
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:54,176
Mmm if you have any understanding of

2501
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:55,968
Alex's talking

2502
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:57,504
Pinpoints in his worldview

2503
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:00,576
Sure you could Taylor whatever you're saying to be like

2504
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:02,112
This is going to be in line with you

2505
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:03,648
Or

2506
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:04,672
You could just

2507
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:08,512
Be a white nationalist and say what you believe and there's going to be a lot over

2508
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:12,864
Just a natural thing that happened

2509
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:13,632
Yeah that's true

2510
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:14,656
Because they

2511
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:17,216
At right after that after he says like

2512
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:21,568
Probably very similar, got there was a problem with the world we identified

2513
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,104
He starts talking

2514
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:25,664
That problem is nonweiler

2515
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:26,432
Right

2516
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:28,480
Did you listen to this clip

2517
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:30,528
Anybody who listen to Infowars

2518
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:31,808
A lot of this stuff

2519
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:32,832
Really familiar

2520
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:37,184
I wanted to understand why my people

2521
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:40,256
Pulling our civilization have been so demoralized

2522
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:43,840
We are not able to stick up for

2523
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:45,120
For ourselves and our

2524
01:54:45,376 --> 01:54:45,888
Are people

2525
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:48,448
Our future why we

2526
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:51,264
Stewie Richie unilaterally disarm

2527
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:52,544
Why we have this black

2528
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:55,360
Black cloud hanging over our heads whether it's

2529
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:56,896
Slavery Woodhall

2530
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:58,944
Holocaust or or so on

2531
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:00,224
Venting us

2532
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,016
Acting in our own interest

2533
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:03,296
Being great

2534
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:05,600
From golfing to the Stars

2535
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:06,624
To put it

2536
01:55:08,928 --> 01:55:10,464
You can go by yourself

2537
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:12,000
Guilt comp

2538
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:12,768
Plaques

2539
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:14,816
That is always weighing us down

2540
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:16,608
This is so close

2541
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:20,960
Do so much of the stuff Alex talks but he talked about going to the stars all the time

2542
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:24,288
He's wanted understand why why people were made to

2543
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:25,312
A few of his guilt

2544
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:26,848
Alex's like

2545
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:29,152
Primary emotional

2546
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:29,920
Driver

2547
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:30,688
Is this

2548
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:31,456
Desire to

2549
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:34,016
To not feel that guilt but he feels like

2550
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:35,040
People are putting on him

2551
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:37,344
There's so much here that if you are a

2552
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:41,184
Committed Alex Jones follower you'll hear this guy and you'll be like

2553
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:43,232
Man Richard Spencer's Macon

2554
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:44,000
Good points

2555
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:45,792
I thought he was a bigot

2556
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:48,864
Right-of-way

2557
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:49,888
Right

2558
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:50,656
Now

2559
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:51,936
Alex

2560
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:52,704
Then

2561
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:54,752
Spencer gets talked about Trump

2562
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:55,520
A little bit

2563
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:56,544
And

2564
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:57,824
Somehow that's

2565
01:55:58,336 --> 01:55:58,848
More

2566
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:05,504
I think this is where their paths diverged a little bit and I don't think they're able to

2567
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:06,272
Define

2568
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:09,088
Not really

2569
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:09,856
But I

2570
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:15,232
I think that their perspectives are fairly interesting because all Alex has is like soda

2571
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:16,512
Surface-level talking

2572
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:17,280
Pinpoint

2573
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:19,584
And I think that Richard Spencer is

2574
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:20,352
A little

2575
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:21,632
Closer to Acura

2576
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:24,448
In terms of what Trump was doing in his campaign

2577
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:27,776
A little bit earlier when you showed that

2578
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:29,824
Give me getting punched

2579
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:31,104
IND

2580
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:34,176
They were creating a dialectic

2581
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:36,736
Donald Trump

2582
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:37,760
Created

2583
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:39,040
Dialect

2584
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:40,320
Donald Trump

2585
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:42,368
Calling upon race

2586
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:45,184
Even if you wouldn't use that word specifically

2587
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:46,720
He told

2588
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:50,048
Directly particulate the RNC that

2589
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:52,352
That I am your man I'm going to stick

2590
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:53,120
America

2591
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:55,680
American Dreams 2

2592
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:56,960
Graichen is out of

2593
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:59,008
Control

2594
01:56:59,264 --> 01:56:59,776
Maybe your guy

2595
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:01,312
This was

2596
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:04,384
Implicitly is it was explicitly Nationalist and let's

2597
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:05,664
Break it was an imp

2598
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:07,200
Illicitly racialist

2599
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:08,992
Meraki has

2600
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:10,528
A white country

2601
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:13,088
Entire political

2602
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:16,160
History that's what Donald Trump was about he was actually

2603
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:18,208
Calling upon these Energies

2604
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:25,120
In a way that no other Republican but he's calling for you and those that want to divide us

2605
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:27,168
It's okay for America

2606
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:28,448
To exist in

2607
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:35,616
All of Alex Alex Alex

2608
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:36,896
Well.

2609
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:39,200
RNC with a rainbow flag

2610
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:45,600
Abby also went and

2611
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:48,416
Unifier but also stand up for human life

2612
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:58,400
Mastiff

2613
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:00,960
United States of 19th

2614
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:02,496
50 could have been Unified

2615
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:05,568
WYD in a kind of nationalist message we were to a very large degree

2616
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:08,896
Cold War we are polarized

2617
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:12,736
Polarize down racial lines to a very large degree

2618
01:58:12,992 --> 01:58:16,576
As opposed to the 1950s

2619
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:17,600
Country is

2620
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:24,256
Fragmenting into small communities

2621
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:25,792
Olympic totally racist

2622
01:58:26,304 --> 01:58:27,840
It's wrong and needs to be decried

2623
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:31,424
Autoimmune response

2624
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,960
Aligning upon race

2625
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:36,032
Just like a warden controls a prison through race that's all

2626
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:39,872
We're going to have to accept this reality

2627
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:42,176
We're not going to come up with some nice

2628
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:44,224
Public and conservative leader who's going to unite

2629
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:46,784
That is more ridiculous

2630
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:53,952
Ito outlandish thing I've ever said minorities

2631
01:58:57,024 --> 01:58:57,536
What color they are

2632
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:02,656
I'm sure you can

2633
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:03,936
Find individuals like that

2634
01:59:04,192 --> 01:59:05,216
General Metals

2635
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:11,104
Highest level

2636
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:12,384
Just don't I just don't

2637
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:16,224
Buying what you're saying I see the media trying it

2638
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:20,320
I see you was playing the part on the other side if you don't know if we'll just come back longer segments

2639
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:23,904
I'll try to give you the floor for at least 5 minutes and see what you have to say goodbye

2640
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:27,488
I think because of Alex's incompetent

2641
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:32,352
Flailing he's going to me to use the terminology of that the community

2642
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:33,632
He's allowing his audience

2643
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:37,472
Be kind of red pill down this road of of like

2644
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:42,080
Yes Alex these are problems but sooner or later you're going to have

2645
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:44,128
I have to accept the reality that

2646
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:47,712
You're not going to get some guy in here is going to unite people

2647
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:51,808
Explicitly what the conservative people are against

2648
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:52,576
Height

2649
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:54,368
And I think the

2650
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:57,184
Whether or not Spencer is right

2651
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:58,976
About what Trump was doing

2652
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:02,816
He is accurately describing how a lot of people heard Trump

2653
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:03,840
Message

2654
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:06,144
And Alex refuses to accept

2655
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:09,472
He refuses to accept that a lot of things that jump a thing

2656
02:00:09,728 --> 02:00:14,080
What specifically tailored to be heard a certain way by white nationalist in White Sulphur

2657
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:17,152
Probably because of the influence of people like Stephen Miller

2658
02:00:17,408 --> 02:00:18,432
Alex

2659
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:21,248
Is constantly said lovezinho

2660
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:25,856
So it's an almost an Ouroboros oh yeah but I don't know

2661
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:27,904
I was trying to think of the word while he was talking

2662
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,488
I think it's I guess it's maybe lessig

2663
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:32,256
Exhausting

2664
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:36,352
To listen to this b******* just because he's saying the quiet part

2665
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:39,168
Yeah you know like I don't have to work

2666
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:41,216
At all and he's just like

2667
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:45,056
Trump is a white nationalist that's why we voted for him and I'm like that

2668
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:49,152
Andy singing Folsom City

2669
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:53,504
And he doesn't jump around to all this like extraneous b******* like Alex does

2670
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:56,064
I'm not tired speaking in Little Nugget

2671
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:59,904
Of like a scattershot

2672
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:00,928
It is almost

2673
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:02,464
Meant to wear out your attention

2674
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:08,864
Absolutely sure of Alexandra

2675
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:09,888
Because he comes off

2676
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:11,424
Smart

2677
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:16,544
Right now

2678
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:18,336
That might be boring

2679
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:22,944
Let's suppose I don't know I don't fully know how people would experience it

2680
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:28,576
But I do think it runs the risk certainly of being heard of that way by his listen

2681
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:30,112
That's a real

2682
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:33,952
That's a real danger that Alex has a responsibility to be aware of

2683
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:39,072
Even if he pushes back a little bit defending Trump calling for Unity or whatever

2684
02:01:39,328 --> 02:01:41,120
Yeah that's not that's nobody's

2685
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:45,216
Going to buy

2686
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:47,264
Trump was calling for you today

2687
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:49,312
It seems

2688
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:53,152
Hard to swallow

2689
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:54,944
Richard Spencer is

2690
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:56,224
Far more attractive

2691
02:01:57,248 --> 02:01:57,760
Right

2692
02:01:58,272 --> 02:01:58,784
On this interview

2693
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:04,160
So if you if you were deserted dominance deflected all of Alex's criticism

2694
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:05,952
Is Big accusation

2695
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:09,536
Look like s*** and now he's suffocating himself before him

2696
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:11,584
With only this sort of

2697
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:13,888
Surface-level talking point push back

2698
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:16,448
Talking over Spencer whenever he's

2699
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:17,728
We are trying to make his point

2700
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:22,848
So in this next clip they get back

2701
02:02:23,104 --> 02:02:25,408
And Spencer starts talking about how he wants homogeneous

2702
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:26,176
Is population

2703
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:27,456
I'm sorry

2704
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:28,992
The globalist want imagine

2705
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:30,528
Populations of everybody

2706
02:02:30,784 --> 02:02:31,552
Intermix

2707
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:33,856
Yeah and Spencer want slaves

2708
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:36,672
Why is everybody confused

2709
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:37,696
It's more accurately

2710
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:40,256
I think we actually have to look

2711
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:41,024
2fa

2712
02:02:41,536 --> 02:02:42,560
To understand what

2713
02:02:42,816 --> 02:02:43,840
Global US1

2714
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:45,376
Cuz we see it everyday

2715
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:48,704
Differentiated Mass

2716
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,728
Of humanity

2717
02:02:50,752 --> 02:02:51,264
The Aulani

2718
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:57,408
Planetary scale all eating McDonald's and shopping and charging things on credit

2719
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:58,944
I hate you so much

2720
02:03:00,992 --> 02:03:03,808
Sacrament agree actually

2721
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:04,576
It gets even worse

2722
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:09,696
They want that version of globalism that is not what I want

2723
02:03:10,976 --> 02:03:16,096
You could call civilization ilysm or identitarianism or racialism

2724
02:03:16,864 --> 02:03:19,936
We have real vril unify

2725
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:20,960
Cultures

2726
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:24,800
How they that are part of an historical tradition

2727
02:03:25,312 --> 02:03:25,824
You can look

2728
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:27,616
Forward to a future

2729
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:29,664
That is connected to their path

2730
02:03:30,688 --> 02:03:34,784
Don't want to turn the planet into a giant shopping mall

2731
02:03:35,296 --> 02:03:38,368
Europeans to be European to pursue our path

2732
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:42,464
Africans to be African I want Indians to be

2733
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:43,232
Indian

2734
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,280
ReDiscover themselves

2735
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:47,072
That is what I am about

2736
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:48,864
How can Alex argue with

2737
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:52,704
What What In His

2738
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:54,752
Serta rhetorical Arsenal

2739
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:55,776
We have to be like

2740
02:03:56,544 --> 02:03:57,824
No country should

2741
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:59,360
Just be one ethnicity

2742
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:02,176
Yeah I know

2743
02:04:02,432 --> 02:04:05,760
Are other ways it's a Spencers frame in the beginning of that argument with like

2744
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:07,808
This is what the globalist one

2745
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:13,184
They want everybody to be cookie cutter all the same one world is a big shopping mall

2746
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:18,816
Alex's gas and hang with him at the beginning

2747
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:19,584
He can't

2748
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:24,448
Then be like I disagree with your conclusion that I helped you arriving

2749
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:25,472
But that's f******

2750
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:26,496
I hate that

2751
02:04:27,264 --> 02:04:31,360
I hate that so much at such an inverted bulshit

2752
02:04:32,128 --> 02:04:32,896
Buick Reatta

2753
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:34,944
What we live in the city

2754
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:41,856
There are people from every f****** culture here we have parades for Puerto Rico's

2755
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:46,208
We have gay pride parade we have food from everywhere we at we celebrate

2756
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:49,024
All of these different cultures all of the same place

2757
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:51,840
Both together and separate

2758
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:57,984
But that's part of the joy of it and I and then he's talking about all these other places where it is

2759
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:04,384
I grew up in a small town of homogenized with nothing but white people and everybody ate a f****** Wendy's and shopped at Walmart

2760
02:05:05,152 --> 02:05:05,664
That is what

2761
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:07,712
He said that he's again

2762
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:09,504
I f****** hate him

2763
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:10,784
I hate him so much

2764
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:11,808
Wow

2765
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:12,576
So much

2766
02:05:12,832 --> 02:05:16,160
You're going to hate Alex more I think in this next

2767
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:21,280
Did Mike down for this cuz I think it was

2768
02:05:25,632 --> 02:05:28,960
The Christian Western ethos was The White Man's Burden

2769
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:35,104
Build a civilization to develop technology to go into all these countries and really not exploit people

2770
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,920
Build them up give them science those population

2771
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:38,688
Load

2772
02:05:38,944 --> 02:05:42,016
Then the modern Corporation technocrat

2773
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:43,552
World

2774
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:47,904
Christian ethos

2775
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:50,208
And then bring the whole thing down

2776
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:52,768
By The White Man's Christian quote burden

2777
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:55,840
Anyways

2778
02:05:56,096 --> 02:05:57,888
Population

2779
02:05:58,144 --> 02:06:01,472
But now that's being used as a weapon against the West

2780
02:06:01,984 --> 02:06:02,496
Wow

2781
02:06:07,104 --> 02:06:09,920
Civilization to all these other countries

2782
02:06:10,432 --> 02:06:11,968
And then be demonized

2783
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:12,736
For it

2784
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:14,528
He could have just stopped

2785
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:18,624
Bright when he finished the Kipling reference once he was there I was like

2786
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:19,392
I got it

2787
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:24,768
Yes you think colonialism is great and definitely not what that leads to is no it's a good thing

2788
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:26,560
We actually did great

2789
02:06:26,816 --> 02:06:27,840
Bright

2790
02:06:28,864 --> 02:06:30,144
God I hate the worst

2791
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:31,168
That's the worst

2792
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:33,472
The help like

2793
02:06:33,728 --> 02:06:34,752
Push back at all again

2794
02:06:35,264 --> 02:06:40,128
The things that Spencer saying like that's not going to be a rebuttal

2795
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:41,664
So

2796
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:43,968
Yeah totally

2797
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:48,832
Spencer saying that globalization

2798
02:06:49,088 --> 02:06:49,856
Is normal

2799
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:53,184
Which is a very unfamiliar conversation on Alex's show

2800
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:56,256
And it actually does eventually Force Alex

2801
02:06:56,512 --> 02:07:00,096
To express that globalization isn't bad

2802
02:07:00,352 --> 02:07:05,984
Global never heard him make on the show

2803
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:06,752
Because

2804
02:07:07,008 --> 02:07:07,776
Spencer's

2805
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:11,360
Clearly think there is a global community that is

2806
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:12,384
Real

2807
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:15,456
We got to get away kind of from

2808
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:18,016
The Nationalist Globe Global it's divided

2809
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:21,344
And move toward the synthesis of

2810
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:24,416
Civilizational racial consciousness

2811
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:26,976
That is how the world is

2812
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:28,256
Breaking down

2813
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:33,632
Are major figures in this economically globalized world

2814
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:38,496
On the basis of civilization and race and culture in the deepest sense of the word

2815
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:40,800
Now

2816
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:45,152
Richard you know at the highest levels of the global system are actually very very race

2817
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:49,760
You notice that

2818
02:07:50,272 --> 02:07:53,088
I'm starting to like these guys

2819
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:57,696
All the scientist

2820
02:07:58,208 --> 02:07:58,720
Project

2821
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:03,072
So they can just accelerate

2822
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:06,912
Yoga challenge

2823
02:08:07,168 --> 02:08:07,680
Hegemonic

2824
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:09,728
System of the

2825
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:12,800
I think Spencer's is letting Alex talk

2826
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:13,568
Honestly

2827
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:16,384
Just rambling about the

2828
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:18,176
Take all the good

2829
02:08:18,432 --> 02:08:18,944
Sucks

2830
02:08:19,456 --> 02:08:22,784
Search keep on going once you're done I'll get back to

2831
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:23,552
The talkin smart

2832
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:29,696
I'll get back to you at least use in sentence structure I will continue laundering white nationalism in

2833
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:31,488
And calling I'm a racist

2834
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:33,280
This Christ

2835
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:35,840
So Alex and his next clip is

2836
02:08:36,096 --> 02:08:40,192
Complaining about the media and MSNBC in particular and he's like they're like

2837
02:08:41,216 --> 02:08:41,728
And

2838
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:44,800
Rich's burgers do not talk about my fuhrer like

2839
02:08:45,056 --> 02:08:46,848
That it leads to an interesting Exchange

2840
02:08:48,128 --> 02:08:50,176
Need to understand ourselves

2841
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:51,456
Europeans

2842
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:52,992
Water

2843
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:54,016
People

2844
02:08:54,272 --> 02:08:55,296
On this planet

2845
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:59,136
Particular Destiny and a particular charge

2846
02:09:01,184 --> 02:09:07,328
Well there's no doubt that the closest thing to Hitler is MSNBC I mean that's just butt butt from the position that

2847
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:09,888
That white people at

2848
02:09:13,728 --> 02:09:14,752
MSNBC

2849
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:18,336
Has the purest Hitler message I've ever seen

2850
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:19,872
It's just from the

2851
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:23,968
Whites are bad instead of other groups are bad for my from an area north

2852
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:27,808
Nordic perspective that

2853
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:29,088
Socialist

2854
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:34,720
It's Hitler but from the other

2855
02:09:35,488 --> 02:09:37,280
And surely I mean you say that

2856
02:09:41,888 --> 02:09:42,656
That what you're saying

2857
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:51,360
It was just a man

2858
02:09:51,872 --> 02:09:52,640
It's Ray

2859
02:09:52,896 --> 02:09:53,920
Baa major

2860
02:09:56,736 --> 02:09:59,040
We need to understand why

2861
02:09:59,296 --> 02:09:59,808
God

2862
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:02,368
Our

2863
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:04,928
Consciousness and also our challenges can be varied if

2864
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:11,840
Let's talk about Hitler

2865
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:14,656
The real Hitler on the other side

2866
02:10:17,472 --> 02:10:22,848
That was me calling on answer

2867
02:10:23,104 --> 02:10:28,224
Possible got your question I can think of everything about Hitler bad

2868
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:29,760
Do you like Hitler

2869
02:10:30,016 --> 02:10:31,296
No

2870
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:37,696
I would go so far as to say I strongly dislike her latest guy

2871
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:40,768
You start with he was just a guy that I know where you're coming from

2872
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:42,048
Yeah

2873
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:45,376
But you see this like this is

2874
02:10:45,632 --> 02:10:47,168
High-status Behavior

2875
02:10:47,424 --> 02:10:53,568
Yeah the way that Alex is like saying you're msnbc's close to Hitler and the he's just laughing off

2876
02:10:53,824 --> 02:10:54,848
Even after

2877
02:10:55,872 --> 02:11:02,016
Used to having something like that like having to defend a position that he just Rambles out

2878
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:04,320
Yeah he's used to working with like

2879
02:11:04,832 --> 02:11:05,344
F******

2880
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:08,672
Two-time losers who need Alex in order

2881
02:11:08,928 --> 02:11:09,440
Exist

2882
02:11:09,696 --> 02:11:15,072
Employees are potential employees are Barnes is going to flub a question like do you like Hitler

2883
02:11:15,328 --> 02:11:17,120
Associate grifters

2884
02:11:17,376 --> 02:11:19,424
Laura Loomer

2885
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:21,472
ALEKS contabil

2886
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:24,800
Yeah msnbc's I K like yeah you bet it is

2887
02:11:25,056 --> 02:11:29,920
They're all evil

2888
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:31,712
Give a s*** about that

2889
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:32,736
He has his own

2890
02:11:32,992 --> 02:11:35,040
Industry or whatever he doesn't need Alex

2891
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:35,808
So either

2892
02:11:36,064 --> 02:11:38,368
What are you talkin about Alex's used to that

2893
02:11:38,624 --> 02:11:40,160
Alex has to explain himself

2894
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:41,440
The answer is ridiculous

2895
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:44,000
A Richard Spencer even after the exclamation

2896
02:11:44,512 --> 02:11:49,632
Yeah I get home to get what you're saying I think you're trying to say MSNBC is bad

2897
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:50,400
And I don't like

2898
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:52,448
You bringing my boy Hitler into it

2899
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:53,728
God that

2900
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:56,800
That should be this simple

2901
02:11:57,568 --> 02:11:58,592
God you're so

2902
02:11:58,848 --> 02:11:59,872
Easily called enough

2903
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:00,896
You're nothing

2904
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:04,480
If your answer to do you like Hitler is not know

2905
02:12:04,736 --> 02:12:06,528
Then you're not see I don't understand how that

2906
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:08,320
A complicated question

2907
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:09,600
It seems like it

2908
02:12:09,856 --> 02:12:12,928
So Alex at the end of the clip said they would get back from break

2909
02:12:13,184 --> 02:12:14,208
What's up with the real hair

2910
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:19,328
We know what that means that means no not not specifically

2911
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:21,632
Is he's no Steve yet

2912
02:12:22,656 --> 02:12:24,704
It is that Hitler was set up

2913
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:25,472
Kind of narrative

2914
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:31,872
So you Rambles for about a minute or two about his normal talking points.

2915
02:12:32,128 --> 02:12:32,896
The Rothschild which is

2916
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:33,664
Weird

2917
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:38,272
I guess that mean that's a big part of this couch clearly said that he's researched

2918
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:39,040
Improving it

2919
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:41,600
But you didn't bring that up he just talks about how like

2920
02:12:41,856 --> 02:12:43,904
You know Hitler was set up by the globalist

2921
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:45,184
Add soy

2922
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:46,464
If you listen to

2923
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:48,000
How This Ends

2924
02:12:48,512 --> 02:12:52,608
I think it would be a fair description to say that Spencer is kind of amused by Alec

2925
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:55,680
There's like an elevated like I look at you

2926
02:12:57,728 --> 02:12:59,008
Hitler was a creation

2927
02:12:59,264 --> 02:13:00,288
Then shut up

2928
02:13:01,056 --> 02:13:05,152
Destroyer up and then bring down that model but then bringing the scientific behind the scenes model

2929
02:13:05,664 --> 02:13:07,712
The IBM and others

2930
02:13:11,808 --> 02:13:13,088
Hitler

2931
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:17,184
That you are controlled you just need to watch out

2932
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:19,744
And I understand that you might be working

2933
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:21,792
By the system by

2934
02:13:22,048 --> 02:13:24,608
How they promote you another thing because you're helping create

2935
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:26,144
One part of that dialect

2936
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:28,448
Class if they're wanting I mean if you ever

2937
02:13:28,704 --> 02:13:29,472
I thought about that

2938
02:13:31,264 --> 02:13:33,824
Diives

2939
02:13:35,616 --> 02:13:38,688
Jurors and roll I might play

2940
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:39,712
Not in a bad way

2941
02:13:42,528 --> 02:13:45,600
Tell you very seriously I am for real

2942
02:13:46,624 --> 02:13:48,160
Passionate about these ideas I care

2943
02:13:48,672 --> 02:13:49,952
About our future

2944
02:13:50,976 --> 02:13:51,744
I'm My Own man

2945
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:55,840
That's all I can say is I mean for better for worse I'm not

2946
02:13:57,632 --> 02:13:58,144
Globalist

2947
02:14:00,192 --> 02:14:01,728
We probably need a

2948
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:07,360
Why Soros out there while we actually

2949
02:14:08,128 --> 02:14:09,408
Serious movement 4

2950
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:10,432
Google change

2951
02:14:12,736 --> 02:14:14,016
From the stage of his

2952
02:14:15,296 --> 02:14:16,576
Sweetest one individual free

2953
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:17,344
Freedom in concert

2954
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:19,136
Tatoosh ilysm and so on

2955
02:14:19,392 --> 02:14:19,904
No

2956
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:22,720
You're actually going to need major

2957
02:14:22,976 --> 02:14:23,488
Asterisk

2958
02:14:24,768 --> 02:14:25,536
We're going to need people

2959
02:14:25,792 --> 02:14:26,560
Behind the scenes

2960
02:14:27,584 --> 02:14:29,120
In order to accomplish this

2961
02:14:29,888 --> 02:14:30,656
You get serious about that

2962
02:14:30,912 --> 02:14:31,680
Add a realistic about it

2963
02:14:32,448 --> 02:14:38,592
So there's a meanie scoffing when I'm not paid by globalist

2964
02:14:40,896 --> 02:14:43,200
He's like oh ho ho you'll learn when you grow up

2965
02:14:43,456 --> 02:14:44,992
U-save-it MSNBC is

2966
02:14:46,784 --> 02:14:50,368
This is ridiculous couple times

2967
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:52,160
And so Alex brings up

2968
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:57,280
Soros is a Nazi collaborator constantly with people

2969
02:14:57,536 --> 02:14:58,816
It's almost a litmus test

2970
02:14:59,072 --> 02:15:04,704
Best of like are you going to go along with this everyone knows it's not true

2971
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:05,472
Seeing

2972
02:15:05,728 --> 02:15:06,752
Universally

2973
02:15:07,008 --> 02:15:09,056
Everyone is on Alex's show goes along with

2974
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:12,640
Richard Spencer

2975
02:15:12,896 --> 02:15:13,408
Hitler

2976
02:15:13,664 --> 02:15:15,968
That is not a smear Richard Spencer

2977
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:17,248
Response

2978
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:19,040
In a way that I've never heard any

2979
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:22,624
Pulling back from that usually needed Soros

2980
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:26,720
Nazi collaborator did help Roundup

2981
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:27,488
Hello Jerry

2982
02:15:27,744 --> 02:15:30,304
On 60 Minutes

2983
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:32,096
Funny that the guy

2984
02:15:32,608 --> 02:15:36,960
You say is the polar opposite I guess of what you're trying to do actually work for the Nazis

2985
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:42,848
Looks it's a Taurus had a beastly it's strange life history

2986
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:44,640
And in Soros also has it been

2987
02:15:44,896 --> 02:15:47,712
Complicated relationship with

2988
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:49,504
Israel war

2989
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:50,784
To be American

2990
02:15:51,552 --> 02:15:53,600
Policy stablish Mehndi opposed the Iraq War

2991
02:15:54,368 --> 02:15:54,880
It's a complicated

2992
02:15:55,136 --> 02:15:55,648
Story

2993
02:15:56,160 --> 02:16:02,048
The notion that George Soros is pro white or or racialist

2994
02:16:02,304 --> 02:16:08,448
Find some win some way is completely ridiculous agree with you for the dialect

2995
02:16:08,704 --> 02:16:10,752
The other side of what you

2996
02:16:12,032 --> 02:16:12,544
Okay

2997
02:16:13,312 --> 02:16:14,080
That is

2998
02:16:14,592 --> 02:16:15,616
Real loud

2999
02:16:16,384 --> 02:16:17,152
Yok

3000
02:16:18,688 --> 02:16:19,968
You can hear the eye roll

3001
02:16:20,736 --> 02:16:21,760
Yeah sure

3002
02:16:22,016 --> 02:16:24,064
Alright Alex whatever

3003
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:24,832
That is

3004
02:16:25,344 --> 02:16:26,368
Funny because

3005
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:28,928
Spencer is a white nationalist

3006
02:16:29,184 --> 02:16:30,976
Oh yeah so he doesn't

3007
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:32,000
Don't need that

3008
02:16:32,512 --> 02:16:33,280
This yet

3009
02:16:33,536 --> 02:16:35,072
Hide behind George Soros

3010
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:36,864
Pretend being an obstacle to

3011
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:37,632
Alex

3012
02:16:37,888 --> 02:16:41,216
Come out here with me we love Hitler let's just say it

3013
02:16:41,472 --> 02:16:44,544
Come on buddy I hear you. Hold hands and walk

3014
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:46,080
Underneath that rainbow

3015
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:47,872
And burn the rainbow to the ground

3016
02:16:48,896 --> 02:16:54,784
At what this demonstrates I think it's some ways is the way in which these narratives like sores is not the

3017
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:59,392
Collaborator and stuff like that those are the things that are used as a mask in order to hide behind

3018
02:16:59,648 --> 02:17:03,744
Yeah and once you're out now and people just know what you are and what you're about

3019
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,840
You don't need that mask anymore makeup b******* about Soros

3020
02:17:08,096 --> 02:17:10,144
I love Hitler you can

3021
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:11,168
You can just

3022
02:17:11,424 --> 02:17:15,776
Open Libby like a pretty complicated figure that

3023
02:17:16,032 --> 02:17:19,872
Is a lot of stuff in his politics in it in terms of his life that are

3024
02:17:20,384 --> 02:17:22,432
That are so complicated

3025
02:17:22,944 --> 02:17:23,456
And and

3026
02:17:23,712 --> 02:17:27,552
The Alex's will premises that Source was a Nazi collaborator and

3027
02:17:29,856 --> 02:17:36,000
It to imagine it has that politics is ridiculous

3028
02:17:38,304 --> 02:17:40,352
That's that's funny

3029
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:41,376
Really

3030
02:17:41,632 --> 02:17:42,400
Many

3031
02:17:42,656 --> 02:17:43,680
Any I think your might

3032
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:47,520
There may be few but I mean baby like Dina Del doctor Dean Adele

3033
02:17:47,776 --> 02:17:50,336
Maybe one of the only people who like really

3034
02:17:50,848 --> 02:17:51,616
That kind of

3035
02:17:52,128 --> 02:17:54,432
Smackdown looks down a little bit news a bit more Joyce

3036
02:17:54,688 --> 02:17:58,784
Yeah then that's where I've not heard many people especially lately

3037
02:17:59,552 --> 02:18:00,832
Come in and just be like

3038
02:18:01,856 --> 02:18:02,368
Almost

3039
02:18:02,624 --> 02:18:04,416
Patronizing

3040
02:18:04,928 --> 02:18:06,720
It is it is so Stark

3041
02:18:06,976 --> 02:18:08,768
In contrast to how simple

3042
02:18:10,304 --> 02:18:13,120
Simple how much more simple your life and explanation

3043
02:18:13,376 --> 02:18:15,168
Get when you're just telling the truth

3044
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:16,960
About you believe instead of

3045
02:18:17,472 --> 02:18:18,752
Hiding behind 300

3046
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:22,592
Complicated conspiracy theory lies and I would freeze you up

3047
02:18:22,848 --> 02:18:23,360
2

3048
02:18:23,616 --> 02:18:25,408
Sort of demonstrate

3049
02:18:26,176 --> 02:18:30,528
Whether or not you're calling people out straight the lying and the deceit

3050
02:18:30,784 --> 02:18:31,808
Someone who is hiding

3051
02:18:32,064 --> 02:18:38,208
Yeah and you can engage with reality in terms of Soros and be like that he's a complicated figure I can say the

3052
02:18:38,720 --> 02:18:39,232
Because

3053
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:41,280
I hate him for Pikachu

3054
02:18:43,072 --> 02:18:46,400
They get to talk about what Spencers view the future is

3055
02:18:46,656 --> 02:18:47,168
Which is great

3056
02:18:47,424 --> 02:18:50,752
But if you listen to this pretty carefully I think you'll see a couple of inches

3057
02:18:51,008 --> 02:18:53,056
Senses where he's directly attacking

3058
02:18:53,312 --> 02:18:55,360
Some of Alex's core beliefs

3059
02:18:55,616 --> 02:18:57,920
And because of the way this interviews gone I don't

3060
02:18:58,176 --> 02:18:59,456
Big Alex has it in him

3061
02:18:59,712 --> 02:19:00,224
To stand up

3062
02:19:00,736 --> 02:19:03,552
I'm self the future and what you thinking on full

3063
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:08,416
I think Maya media view of the future is

3064
02:19:08,672 --> 02:19:09,952
Basically more of the same

3065
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:12,000
United States is suffering from a car

3066
02:19:12,512 --> 02:19:14,560
White death deaths of despair

3067
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:15,328
People who are

3068
02:19:16,096 --> 02:19:17,376
Hooked on drugs

3069
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:23,008
No sense of the future whatsoever and are are literally

3070
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:24,032
Figuratively just

3071
02:19:24,544 --> 02:19:25,824
Doing themselves

3072
02:19:26,336 --> 02:19:29,152
I think there is going to be more of this in the future

3073
02:19:29,664 --> 02:19:32,480
But there will be a reaction to this here I guess

3074
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:34,784
Kind of agree with you

3075
02:19:36,064 --> 02:19:39,904
There will be a point in which white people starve

3076
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:43,744
Collaborating together working together as a team

3077
02:19:44,256 --> 02:19:48,864
Forging their own destiny that we start we stopped unilaterally disarming mice

3078
02:19:49,376 --> 02:19:50,144
I understand

3079
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:51,168
There Is Power

3080
02:19:51,936 --> 02:19:52,704
Collective

3081
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:56,544
The team is going to destroy

3082
02:19:57,312 --> 02:19:58,336
Individual Epona

3083
02:19:58,848 --> 02:20:03,968
Eventually White

3084
02:20:04,224 --> 02:20:04,992
Families are pro-life

3085
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:07,296
Communism if they're racist

3086
02:20:08,576 --> 02:20:14,720
All that's kind of individualism at some level you know about saying we don't want the state power

3087
02:20:15,744 --> 02:20:16,512
You just want to be left

3088
02:20:18,048 --> 02:20:18,816
All that kind of stuff

3089
02:20:21,888 --> 02:20:24,704
We're never going to be left alone we should get

3090
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:28,800
Get that out of our minds we probably won't leave other people alone

3091
02:20:29,056 --> 02:20:31,616
Meanie. No.

3092
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:35,968
Rise to the challenge as opposed

3093
02:20:36,224 --> 02:20:38,784
Just saying oh just leave me alone I'll be okay

3094
02:20:39,808 --> 02:20:41,088
Give me my rights or things like

3095
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:42,880
We need to start being the bad

3096
02:20:43,392 --> 02:20:45,952
Classes of History again

3097
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:47,232
Right direction

3098
02:20:47,488 --> 02:20:48,768
We need to ride to that Chow

3099
02:20:49,792 --> 02:20:55,936
Why do people in general need to push a pro-human

3100
02:20:56,192 --> 02:20:59,776
Anti Human level of takeover debt that Beast

3101
02:21:00,032 --> 02:21:04,896
Admitting their own megalomania

3102
02:21:05,152 --> 02:21:06,688
. and I'm laying down the shield

3103
02:21:07,456 --> 02:21:09,248
And if you look at what you were just talking about

3104
02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:13,856
And then people committed suicide in the death of everywhere

3105
02:21:14,368 --> 02:21:17,440
It is because there is a racial attack on whites being directed

3106
02:21:18,208 --> 02:21:19,744
Bill Tanis come in Hollywood

3107
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,560
Club was combine who are the enemies of all Humanity

3108
02:21:23,328 --> 02:21:24,096
So

3109
02:21:24,608 --> 02:21:25,888
Aces right there

3110
02:21:26,656 --> 02:21:31,520
So what you have is Spencer laying out his view is going to come and that is

3111
02:21:32,544 --> 02:21:34,336
Basically we need to have Collective

3112
02:21:34,592 --> 02:21:40,224
Action in order to take over apparatuses of state power and

3113
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:41,504
Will be in charge

3114
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:43,040
And ruin everything

3115
02:21:43,296 --> 02:21:44,064
With that

3116
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:46,368
That world is you in employee

3117
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:49,952
And what about you know that

3118
02:21:50,464 --> 02:21:52,512
Come down on you if you're into the Second Amendment

3119
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:53,792
These are the most

3120
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:56,352
Deeply held beliefs Alex as

3121
02:21:56,608 --> 02:21:58,144
Richard Spencer says they're weak

3122
02:21:58,400 --> 02:22:02,752
Yep those are weak we need to control the state apparatus we need to embrace

3123
02:22:03,008 --> 02:22:03,776
The state

3124
02:22:04,288 --> 02:22:05,312
The power of the state

3125
02:22:05,824 --> 02:22:07,616
We need to create an authoritarian

3126
02:22:07,872 --> 02:22:08,384
Yeah

3127
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:09,408
System

3128
02:22:09,664 --> 02:22:10,432
And Alex

3129
02:22:10,944 --> 02:22:11,968
Everything

3130
02:22:12,224 --> 02:22:12,992
Everything

3131
02:22:13,504 --> 02:22:14,016
He

3132
02:22:14,528 --> 02:22:15,552
Professes to believe

3133
02:22:15,808 --> 02:22:16,832
That should be

3134
02:22:17,344 --> 02:22:23,488
The single worst insult anybody has ever said that every

3135
02:22:23,744 --> 02:22:25,792
F*** off my show

3136
02:22:26,048 --> 02:22:31,424
You person who you what you would love the government do you want a bigger federal government please

3137
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:35,008
Yeah you should know that you think that you're going to get your

3138
02:22:35,264 --> 02:22:35,776
Cool White

3139
02:22:36,032 --> 02:22:40,128
Hey guys in there for the government but you know that it's just going to be used against you

3140
02:22:40,384 --> 02:22:46,528
Operation you can't allow them to do that it'll like that should be his

3141
02:22:46,784 --> 02:22:48,320
Pro-gas something

3142
02:22:48,832 --> 02:22:53,440
You need to prove that he is the exact Olay I'm just fight for produce

3143
02:22:53,696 --> 02:22:56,768
Chelation

3144
02:22:57,024 --> 02:22:58,816
Yes exactly has been

3145
02:22:59,328 --> 02:23:00,096
Banquet yep

3146
02:23:00,352 --> 02:23:01,120
By Richard Spencer

3147
02:23:01,632 --> 02:23:02,912
Richard Spencer because

3148
02:23:03,168 --> 02:23:03,680
Like

3149
02:23:03,936 --> 02:23:07,008
Like legitimately there is something Alex could have done

3150
02:23:07,264 --> 02:23:08,288
Like he could have argued

3151
02:23:08,544 --> 02:23:09,568
Summit

3152
02:23:09,824 --> 02:23:14,176
Will be difficult with his established position set really really

3153
02:23:14,432 --> 02:23:14,944
F****** hard

3154
02:23:15,456 --> 02:23:15,968
2

3155
02:23:16,224 --> 02:23:17,504
Retain your beliefs

3156
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:19,808
And argue against Richard Spencer

3157
02:23:20,064 --> 02:23:21,344
But he could have prepared

3158
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:24,416
You could have watched any interviews that Richard Spencer is done

3159
02:23:24,928 --> 02:23:26,720
Any of the streams that

3160
02:23:26,976 --> 02:23:29,536
Spencer's been on where they discuss some of these issues

3161
02:23:29,792 --> 02:23:31,584
You could have figured out some of the tricks that

3162
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:32,352
Uses

3163
02:23:32,608 --> 02:23:34,400
You could have figured out what what's a week

3164
02:23:34,656 --> 02:23:35,424
What's a point

3165
02:23:36,704 --> 02:23:38,240
You could ask him about Hitler

3166
02:23:38,496 --> 02:23:39,008
DNA

3167
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:41,568
Like that would even really work that

3168
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:43,872
Do you see what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs

3169
02:23:44,384 --> 02:23:48,224
That's even like attack that he's had many times

3170
02:23:48,480 --> 02:23:52,576
So like you could have done more preparation and been able to handle yourself a lot better

3171
02:23:52,832 --> 02:23:53,856
But like I said I don't think

3172
02:23:55,136 --> 02:23:56,928
I think he was destined to lose

3173
02:23:57,696 --> 02:23:58,208
Because

3174
02:23:58,464 --> 02:23:58,976
Of the

3175
02:23:59,232 --> 02:23:59,744
Beliefs

3176
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:00,768
That are compatible

3177
02:24:01,536 --> 02:24:02,304
With

3178
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:03,584
And Alex isn't good

3179
02:24:04,096 --> 02:24:04,608
Nuance

3180
02:24:04,864 --> 02:24:05,376
Specific

3181
02:24:05,632 --> 02:24:06,656
He's explicitly again

3182
02:24:06,912 --> 02:24:07,680
Nuance

3183
02:24:08,192 --> 02:24:08,704
Spices

3184
02:24:09,216 --> 02:24:11,776
Which might be the only real way

3185
02:24:12,032 --> 02:24:14,336
To have this conversation and not come out looking stupid

3186
02:24:14,592 --> 02:24:16,896
Because I mean if you were to

3187
02:24:17,152 --> 02:24:18,432
Take some of these talking

3188
02:24:18,688 --> 02:24:19,968
Points that Spencer has

3189
02:24:20,224 --> 02:24:22,528
I am trying to differentiate them from your own

3190
02:24:22,784 --> 02:24:26,624
You really need to get into Theory you need to get into like a pretty deep

3191
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:28,928
What's the

3192
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:34,816
Distinction between your version of whites are under attack at mine

3193
02:24:35,328 --> 02:24:38,400
Well and then Alex would have to try and do some heavy lifting in order to

3194
02:24:38,656 --> 02:24:43,008
To try and rationalize why would he is expressing isn't white nationalism and what Spencer is

3195
02:24:43,264 --> 02:24:44,288
Saying is

3196
02:24:44,544 --> 02:24:45,824
And Alex just can't do that

3197
02:24:46,848 --> 02:24:47,360
Even with

3198
02:24:47,616 --> 02:24:48,896
A ton of prep I don't think you'd be able

3199
02:24:49,152 --> 02:24:50,432
To do that

3200
02:24:50,944 --> 02:24:55,040
Enough about being a white nationalist when you've already explicit

3201
02:24:55,296 --> 02:24:56,576
Dudley said there's a problem

3202
02:24:57,088 --> 02:24:57,856
It is it is

3203
02:24:58,112 --> 02:24:59,904
Again so f***** up

3204
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:03,488
How easy how easily Richard Spencer is

3205
02:25:03,744 --> 02:25:07,328
Cuz the ideas that Alex and so many of these guys

3206
02:25:07,584 --> 02:25:08,096
Espouse

3207
02:25:08,608 --> 02:25:10,400
All logically end

3208
02:25:10,656 --> 02:25:13,216
With extermination or enslavement

3209
02:25:13,472 --> 02:25:14,496
Right always

3210
02:25:15,008 --> 02:25:21,152
And Richard Spencer is just out here saying we probably won't leave people alone which is like oh so you know that it

3211
02:25:21,408 --> 02:25:21,920
It's going to end it

3212
02:25:22,176 --> 02:25:23,456
Extermination or enslavement

3213
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:25,504
And you're just out there this place

3214
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:27,552
Or displacement but even then

3215
02:25:27,808 --> 02:25:28,832
Displaces people you think

3216
02:25:29,344 --> 02:25:34,464
But he's in his a world white Nation do you think they stopped at the border

3217
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:35,232
Of course

3218
02:25:35,488 --> 02:25:36,000
Knock knock

3219
02:25:36,256 --> 02:25:37,792
It would end up being pretty a

3220
02:25:38,048 --> 02:25:39,328
Empire Orienta

3221
02:25:39,584 --> 02:25:43,936
That's the only way that they live he wants everybody to look at up at him with a

3222
02:25:44,192 --> 02:25:44,704
Is Bhutan there

3223
02:25:45,728 --> 02:25:46,240
He's f******

3224
02:25:46,752 --> 02:25:52,896
Crazy yep so here's where the interview ends and I think Alex complemented Richards

3225
02:25:55,712 --> 02:25:58,272
Well I got to say

3226
02:26:02,112 --> 02:26:05,696
I would have them back on I want people on the show it just

3227
02:26:05,952 --> 02:26:07,232
Play just turns into

3228
02:26:07,488 --> 02:26:08,768
Trying to like

3229
02:26:11,584 --> 02:26:13,632
But but I appreciate you coming on the show

3230
02:26:14,144 --> 02:26:15,936
And I are you going to be in Virginia

3231
02:26:16,704 --> 02:26:19,008
Next week I'm going to be there in a DC at the women's March

3232
02:26:20,288 --> 02:26:21,056
Well I might come

3233
02:26:21,568 --> 02:26:22,336
If you're there sure

3234
02:26:23,104 --> 02:26:26,176
Yard

3235
02:26:27,456 --> 02:26:27,968
Again

3236
02:26:33,856 --> 02:26:35,136
Yeah that's great

3237
02:26:37,696 --> 02:26:41,024
He's completely laundered this dude to his audience I mean

3238
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:47,424
Jesus Alex do you want him to rub your belly now like what is going on here stop short of offering him a job

3239
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:48,192
Yeah

3240
02:26:48,448 --> 02:26:53,312
He just want them to be on-air personalities that he can interview from time to time

3241
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:54,336
I don't see I don't

3242
02:26:54,592 --> 02:26:55,872
I don't see that being like

3243
02:26:56,384 --> 02:27:00,736
Not possible I think Richard Spencer Mike show up on Alex's show more

3244
02:27:00,992 --> 02:27:02,016
Future I believe it

3245
02:27:03,552 --> 02:27:04,576
This is the worst

3246
02:27:04,832 --> 02:27:05,344
Yeah

3247
02:27:05,856 --> 02:27:08,160
Yeah it's disappointing it's a piano

3248
02:27:08,672 --> 02:27:09,696
But it's not surprising

3249
02:27:09,952 --> 02:27:12,512
The way that Alex has been operating

3250
02:27:12,768 --> 02:27:14,048
In present-day like

3251
02:27:14,304 --> 02:27:16,096
Michael Jones on

3252
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:20,704
Steve pieczenik denying the Holocaust and Alex not batting an eyelash

3253
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:23,520
Like that there's a real Trend that's happening

3254
02:27:24,032 --> 02:27:27,872
Richard Spencer being on the showing and basically just being presented as

3255
02:27:28,128 --> 02:27:31,456
An anti-racist compared to the last I can't I can't

3256
02:27:31,712 --> 02:27:33,504
Bedspreads

3257
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:35,040
In the face that's very productive

3258
02:27:35,296 --> 02:27:37,600
But that's no it's right in line

3259
02:27:37,856 --> 02:27:41,952
It's right in line it's it's the same kind of hail that we've been going down but

3260
02:27:42,208 --> 02:27:44,256
God if you say that anywhere near me

3261
02:27:45,792 --> 02:27:46,560
So

3262
02:27:46,816 --> 02:27:49,888
Spencer's gone now and Alex starts talking about

3263
02:27:50,144 --> 02:27:54,496
Some of the stuff is much more able to stay on WIC

3264
02:27:55,008 --> 02:27:56,288
Perceives to be the message

3265
02:27:57,056 --> 02:27:57,824
When he's not

3266
02:27:58,336 --> 02:27:59,104
Talking to Richard

3267
02:28:00,128 --> 02:28:02,432
There's a movement to end Humanity as we know it

3268
02:28:02,944 --> 02:28:03,456
Opposed

3269
02:28:04,736 --> 02:28:08,320
And that's a little boys and little girls

3270
02:28:08,576 --> 02:28:09,088
Children

3271
02:28:10,368 --> 02:28:10,880
And

3272
02:28:14,464 --> 02:28:19,072
And it's absolutely true that whites are under attack and that the left is pushing it with a marxist-leninist agenda

3273
02:28:20,608 --> 02:28:22,400
But I believe were smart enough to expose

3274
02:28:22,656 --> 02:28:23,424
How's that and change that

3275
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:25,216
We are

3276
02:28:25,472 --> 02:28:26,240
We are

3277
02:28:29,056 --> 02:28:31,360
Submitting to their political agenda

3278
02:28:32,128 --> 02:28:34,432
So now that Spencer's laugh Alex feels more able to

3279
02:28:34,688 --> 02:28:37,248
Stick to the message which is still pretty race

3280
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:38,528
Fairy races

3281
02:28:41,088 --> 02:28:46,976
Yeah it's a fairly consistent spiel about how the globalist are attacking everyone but let's focus on the white part of the equation

3282
02:28:47,744 --> 02:28:49,280
I think it highlights a point that

3283
02:28:49,536 --> 02:28:50,048
Pretty important

3284
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:52,096
And that is what Alex is only differ

3285
02:28:52,352 --> 02:28:55,168
Richard Spencer in terms of how they see themselves

3286
02:28:55,936 --> 02:28:56,704
Spencer's pretty open

3287
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:58,496
In about how he's just focused on wipe

3288
02:28:59,264 --> 02:29:03,360
Alex pretends to care about all people but weirdly every single thing he seems

3289
02:29:03,616 --> 02:29:04,384
Talk about

3290
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:06,176
Pressing issues he covers

3291
02:29:06,688 --> 02:29:07,712
You have to do with white pants

3292
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:11,296
Well that's because they're under attack I mean when the other when the other groups

3293
02:29:11,552 --> 02:29:12,576
And racial groups are

3294
02:29:12,832 --> 02:29:14,368
Are the main people under attack

3295
02:29:14,624 --> 02:29:15,136
I'm sure you'll come

3296
02:29:16,672 --> 02:29:17,184
Right course

3297
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:20,256
Right it didn't see it seems like that's the

3298
02:29:20,768 --> 02:29:21,280
Fake

3299
02:29:21,792 --> 02:29:22,560
Call Vic

3300
02:29:22,816 --> 02:29:23,584
Between the minutes

3301
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:25,120
It said it's only opt

3302
02:29:26,144 --> 02:29:27,936
So Alex starts talking about immigrants

3303
02:29:28,192 --> 02:29:28,704
And

3304
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:32,288
He seems to express that he's fine with second generation

3305
02:29:32,544 --> 02:29:33,056
Immigrants

3306
02:29:33,568 --> 02:29:35,872
The majority of people being brought in right now

3307
02:29:36,128 --> 02:29:40,992
Are being totally made dependent and brainwash and used to drive down wages and Abby racially-based

3308
02:29:42,784 --> 02:29:44,576
People that have been here a generation or two now

3309
02:29:47,904 --> 02:29:48,672
What color they are

3310
02:29:48,928 --> 02:29:50,464
They get what's going on

3311
02:29:50,976 --> 02:29:52,512
Generation Z shows that

3312
02:29:53,024 --> 02:29:54,816
That is the least white generation

3313
02:29:55,072 --> 02:29:56,096
The American history

3314
02:29:56,864 --> 02:29:59,424
And all the poles of studies are the most conservative

3315
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:00,192
See

3316
02:30:00,448 --> 02:30:01,216
How that work

3317
02:30:02,752 --> 02:30:03,520
Brown

3318
02:30:04,288 --> 02:30:04,800
It's because

3319
02:30:05,312 --> 02:30:07,104
They're living in this Clash

3320
02:30:07,872 --> 02:30:09,664
See that it's a load of crap

3321
02:30:11,456 --> 02:30:14,784
Now that doesn't mean you become a bleeding heart and run around apologizing

3322
02:30:15,296 --> 02:30:16,320
Because you're white

3323
02:30:18,624 --> 02:30:22,976
Swastika armbands on either in my view

3324
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:34,240
What

3325
02:30:34,752 --> 02:30:40,896
Giant who invited you

3326
02:30:41,152 --> 02:30:43,456
Choose to run their flags that way they want

3327
02:30:46,784 --> 02:30:51,392
That'll be a group of non-whites that have decided to come at me because I'm white

3328
02:30:51,648 --> 02:30:54,720
I'll be all the other brown people that didn't choose to be with that pirate

3329
02:30:54,976 --> 02:30:59,328
What are you talkin about so so in this scenario

3330
02:30:59,584 --> 02:31:02,912
Did you try inviting

3331
02:31:03,168 --> 02:31:09,312
Are there any non-white people that you were down 42 wiper it out

3332
02:31:09,568 --> 02:31:11,616
Read order to keep everybody else out

3333
02:31:11,872 --> 02:31:12,384
Outside on

3334
02:31:15,968 --> 02:31:16,736
That is f***** up

3335
02:31:16,992 --> 02:31:20,320
I don't even want to address any of that stuff that's it

3336
02:31:21,088 --> 02:31:21,600
But yeah

3337
02:31:21,856 --> 02:31:23,648
Eastern white redoubt is

3338
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:24,416
Right

3339
02:31:24,672 --> 02:31:26,720
He just talks about it anymore like soda

3340
02:31:26,976 --> 02:31:27,744
Abstract

3341
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:31,840
In the future when it comes to it you'll do this

3342
02:31:32,096 --> 02:31:32,608
Spencer's like

3343
02:31:32,864 --> 02:31:36,704
We need to do this I mean obviously I'm going to join with the whites in the coming race war

3344
02:31:37,984 --> 02:31:39,008
But until then

3345
02:31:39,264 --> 02:31:40,544
Hey I love second

3346
02:31:41,824 --> 02:31:46,176
But in the past I found polls that show that there's some conservative identification among Generations

3347
02:31:46,432 --> 02:31:46,944
Z folks

3348
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:51,808
But also that the age group is overwhelmingly in favor of very Progressive politics

3349
02:31:52,576 --> 02:31:55,904
When I look at this question in the past I've always come away thinking that there's a

3350
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:57,952
Complexity in the younger set that pulling

3351
02:31:58,208 --> 02:31:58,720
Must not

3352
02:31:58,976 --> 02:31:59,744
At be able to

3353
02:32:00,768 --> 02:32:06,912
On the one hand you can find like a Forbes article citing a UK study found that 59% of gen Z responded

3354
02:32:07,168 --> 02:32:09,472
It said quote conservative or moderate views

3355
02:32:09,728 --> 02:32:10,496
On social issues

3356
02:32:11,264 --> 02:32:12,800
On the other hand Pew polling

3357
02:32:13,056 --> 02:32:15,360
From last year showed L Progressive leanings

3358
02:32:15,616 --> 02:32:18,176
About even self-identified Republican members

3359
02:32:18,432 --> 02:32:19,200
Generation Z

3360
02:32:19,712 --> 02:32:23,296
For instance they found that 52% of self-identified Republicans

3361
02:32:23,552 --> 02:32:24,064
Zere's

3362
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:26,112
Said that the government should do more

3363
02:32:26,368 --> 02:32:26,880
To solve

3364
02:32:27,392 --> 02:32:29,440
Which is far higher than any other generation

3365
02:32:30,208 --> 02:32:34,048
Genze republican-leaning people are far more concerned about climate change

3366
02:32:34,304 --> 02:32:36,864
Are far more likely to believe that humans have a part in causing

3367
02:32:37,632 --> 02:32:43,264
Also just generally jenzie is overwhelmingly onboard recognizance systemic racism

3368
02:32:43,776 --> 02:32:44,800
Supporting people's pronoun

3369
02:32:45,312 --> 02:32:46,080
And a lot of stuff

3370
02:32:46,336 --> 02:32:48,128
True even among Republican

3371
02:32:48,384 --> 02:32:49,408
I'm leaving members of that group

3372
02:32:50,176 --> 02:32:51,200
What it looks like is this

3373
02:32:51,968 --> 02:32:55,552
There's some people under 24 who identify as conservative or Republican

3374
02:32:55,808 --> 02:32:57,856
But that doesn't mean anything close to what Alex thinks

3375
02:32:58,112 --> 02:32:58,624
Does

3376
02:32:59,136 --> 02:33:05,280
What are the likely outcomes you might expect from the sort of data is that these people will grow up and realize that their politics are not

3377
02:33:05,536 --> 02:33:08,864
Republican-leaning at all and they'll stop identifying themselves that way

3378
02:33:09,376 --> 02:33:13,216
Alternatively if there are enough among the generation to retain their

3379
02:33:13,472 --> 02:33:14,240
Book an identification

3380
02:33:14,496 --> 02:33:17,312
And they're fairly left-leaning ideas along with it

3381
02:33:17,568 --> 02:33:21,408
You could see a GOP being pushed to the left by that

3382
02:33:22,688 --> 02:33:25,248
I have no idea what to expect but I can say definitively

3383
02:33:26,272 --> 02:33:28,320
That laid the Generation Z is not the most conservative

3384
02:33:28,576 --> 02:33:29,088
Regeneration

3385
02:33:29,344 --> 02:33:30,368
And even if

3386
02:33:30,624 --> 02:33:32,672
It's not as liberal as some like to imagine

3387
02:33:33,184 --> 02:33:35,232
It's entirely possible that labels mean a

3388
02:33:35,488 --> 02:33:37,024
Nothing to gen Z then people like

3389
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:38,304
Alex water realize

3390
02:33:39,072 --> 02:33:39,840
His brand of

3391
02:33:40,096 --> 02:33:40,608
Conservatism

3392
02:33:40,864 --> 02:33:42,656
Is not popular among anyone

3393
02:33:42,912 --> 02:33:45,728
Except maybe the silent generation who still alive

3394
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:47,008
That's

3395
02:33:47,264 --> 02:33:47,776
I mean

3396
02:33:48,544 --> 02:33:53,408
And even out that cuz this is Bernie part of the cycle now I mean it's obvious

3397
02:33:54,176 --> 02:33:55,200
It regardless of

3398
02:33:55,456 --> 02:33:59,040
Party affiliation there's going to be a difference in perspective from

3399
02:33:59,296 --> 02:34:00,832
The baby boomer generation

3400
02:34:01,088 --> 02:34:02,880
Who knows they're going out real soon

3401
02:34:03,136 --> 02:34:04,928
And jenzie who knows that

3402
02:34:05,184 --> 02:34:06,208
When they're 50

3403
02:34:06,464 --> 02:34:08,256
They're going to be dying in a giant hellscape

3404
02:34:09,024 --> 02:34:10,816
That's going to change your opinion

3405
02:34:11,072 --> 02:34:12,352
Future policy

3406
02:34:15,168 --> 02:34:17,984
Alex talks a bit about the Democrat

3407
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:19,008
Clinton broken

3408
02:34:19,264 --> 02:34:19,776
Coalition

3409
02:34:20,032 --> 02:34:20,544
Strategy

3410
02:34:21,568 --> 02:34:25,664
And it's interesting cuz he's had Larry Nichols on to yell about it a lot

3411
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:27,200
Actually Larry doesn't yell much

3412
02:34:27,456 --> 02:34:28,224
Serta Rambo

3413
02:34:28,480 --> 02:34:28,992
I bet about it

3414
02:34:29,504 --> 02:34:31,808
But the way Alex is talking about this I don't really

3415
02:34:32,064 --> 02:34:33,344
I think you understand what that mean

3416
02:34:33,856 --> 02:34:35,904
I don't think he understands what the broken Coalition is

3417
02:34:36,416 --> 02:34:38,464
The left have something called a broken

3418
02:34:38,976 --> 02:34:41,280
Coalition strategy

3419
02:34:42,048 --> 02:34:42,816
Alone people

3420
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:46,656
Then throw together

3421
02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:49,216
Right now they're using the attack

3422
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:53,056
And all of white people and white sneaker reject

3423
02:34:53,568 --> 02:34:54,080
And getting the

3424
02:34:54,336 --> 02:34:56,128
I'm getting the face of the left

3425
02:34:58,944 --> 02:35:01,248
Christianity

3426
02:35:03,296 --> 02:35:04,320
Only getting a Trace

3427
02:35:07,904 --> 02:35:10,208
The racist left then talks

3428
02:35:11,488 --> 02:35:12,000
Talk to him

3429
02:35:15,072 --> 02:35:16,352
Worcestershire recommend the racist

3430
02:35:16,864 --> 02:35:19,680
Minority leaders we should get on but behind almost

3431
02:35:20,192 --> 02:35:20,704
All of them

3432
02:35:21,728 --> 02:35:22,240
White

3433
02:35:22,752 --> 02:35:24,288
PhD Ford Foundation

3434
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:25,312
Weird

3435
02:35:25,824 --> 02:35:27,616
Okay well then don't

3436
02:35:28,128 --> 02:35:29,152
Then get the weird light

3437
02:35:29,664 --> 02:35:30,688
YouTube Foundation people

3438
02:35:30,944 --> 02:35:32,992
Right now they're not going to come on

3439
02:35:33,504 --> 02:35:35,296
Course not so I don't care about that

3440
02:35:35,552 --> 02:35:36,320
Stupid b*******

3441
02:35:36,576 --> 02:35:37,088
And his

3442
02:35:37,344 --> 02:35:38,368
Strike to save that rich

3443
02:35:38,624 --> 02:35:40,160
Spencer's on the left or whatever

3444
02:35:40,928 --> 02:35:47,072
Broken Coalition every time I've heard Larry Nichols talk about it this is a strategy that is specifically about prior

3445
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:51,424
One of the things that every candidate would do is prioritize

3446
02:35:52,448 --> 02:35:53,216
Straight white

3447
02:35:53,472 --> 02:35:53,984
Christians

3448
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:58,080
As the largest demographic block that you're vying for

3449
02:35:58,336 --> 02:35:58,848
The clintons

3450
02:35:59,104 --> 02:35:59,872
Realized

3451
02:36:00,128 --> 02:36:03,200
That you could fight for this demographic

3452
02:36:03,456 --> 02:36:05,248
Or you could understand that

3453
02:36:05,504 --> 02:36:06,528
There's a lot of people in the world

3454
02:36:06,784 --> 02:36:07,808
Who have different

3455
02:36:09,088 --> 02:36:10,112
So you could

3456
02:36:10,368 --> 02:36:11,648
Bring in the LG

3457
02:36:11,904 --> 02:36:12,928
G b t q community

3458
02:36:13,184 --> 02:36:14,720
You can bring in the African-American

3459
02:36:14,976 --> 02:36:16,768
Community breaking Hispanic voters

3460
02:36:17,024 --> 02:36:19,072
The psalm of those

3461
02:36:19,584 --> 02:36:22,144
Coalition that are disconnected

3462
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:23,424
Apparently

3463
02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:25,216
Because of their individual

3464
02:36:25,728 --> 02:36:27,520
Create a larger voting Bloc

3465
02:36:27,776 --> 02:36:29,312
Then do you straight white Christian

3466
02:36:29,568 --> 02:36:30,080
Action blocked

3467
02:36:30,336 --> 02:36:32,128
That is how it's always been described

3468
02:36:32,384 --> 02:36:34,176
To me in the way I understand it

3469
02:36:34,432 --> 02:36:35,456
But Alex seems to think

3470
02:36:35,712 --> 02:36:36,224
It's

3471
02:36:36,480 --> 02:36:37,760
Broken people

3472
02:36:38,016 --> 02:36:44,160
People who are like individual Atlanta by one person over here one person over there

3473
02:36:44,416 --> 02:36:46,720
Not at all what the conversation is always

3474
02:36:46,976 --> 02:36:48,768
I think he doesn't understand the topics

3475
02:36:49,024 --> 02:36:49,536
She's talking about

3476
02:36:50,304 --> 02:36:51,584
I don't know

3477
02:36:52,096 --> 02:36:53,888
That's that stupid

3478
02:36:54,144 --> 02:36:55,680
Just a few years later

3479
02:36:55,936 --> 02:36:58,240
G.w. in the conservatives

3480
02:36:58,496 --> 02:37:00,288
Name it better and just call it the big

3481
02:37:00,544 --> 02:37:01,056
Tent

3482
02:37:01,568 --> 02:37:04,128
How do you get so confused at broken

3483
02:37:04,384 --> 02:37:04,896
Coalition

3484
02:37:05,408 --> 02:37:06,688
That's so stupid

3485
02:37:06,944 --> 02:37:07,456
Yep

3486
02:37:07,968 --> 02:37:11,296
So what insects with no wonder the conservatives had to dump it

3487
02:37:11,552 --> 02:37:12,064
Yeah

3488
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:18,464
Alex talks about how you know his whole conception is that the globalist and they create two sides and then make

3489
02:37:18,720 --> 02:37:20,000
I can fight shirt

3490
02:37:20,256 --> 02:37:20,768
Right

3491
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:21,792
But Alex

3492
02:37:22,048 --> 02:37:23,584
Prefers the Russian model

3493
02:37:25,888 --> 02:37:27,936
They create the two sides together

3494
02:37:29,728 --> 02:37:30,240
Fashion model

3495
02:37:31,008 --> 02:37:34,080
I know they been attacked I know they brought in all these other group state rochon

3496
02:37:37,664 --> 02:37:42,528
Russian suicides down Russian for the first time in decades are living longer and they're having more kids

3497
02:37:43,552 --> 02:37:45,856
They're coming back not out of a racist thing the Russians are bad

3498
02:37:47,136 --> 02:37:51,744
We like ourselves Who We Are

3499
02:37:52,256 --> 02:37:54,816
500 years and we're not going to go down

3500
02:37:55,072 --> 02:37:58,656
And we are proud of ourselves you want to work with us to be ready by the group that's right

3501
02:37:58,912 --> 02:38:00,448
What to do

3502
02:38:00,704 --> 02:38:04,288
We're going to throw your ass out that we're going to kill you

3503
02:38:06,080 --> 02:38:12,224
I'm at the poles are doing and that's what the hungarians and Romanians and the checks are doing because they've been in

3504
02:38:14,528 --> 02:38:19,136
When they hear again that white people are bad you better let the Muslims in a run your life

3505
02:38:19,392 --> 02:38:20,416
You know what

3506
02:38:20,928 --> 02:38:23,232
I'm going to run the whole show

3507
02:38:23,488 --> 02:38:26,560
I'm fighting to the death Heather winning

3508
02:38:26,816 --> 02:38:27,840
Willow

3509
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:32,192
Okay lilacs prefers that model what just

3510
02:38:32,448 --> 02:38:37,312
Why is he even bothering to

3511
02:38:37,568 --> 02:38:40,640
Saying is I want a Evo

3512
02:38:40,896 --> 02:38:41,408
Homogeneous

3513
02:38:41,664 --> 02:38:42,432
Is population

3514
02:38:42,688 --> 02:38:44,736
All sharing my exact appearances

3515
02:38:44,992 --> 02:38:49,344
Values and all the stuff that I say and I want them to wipe out everybody who gets in the way

3516
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:52,416
I don't understand what the problem here is why are people calling me erase

3517
02:38:52,672 --> 02:38:58,816
Right at it okay if people come in to the country and they are completely subservient

3518
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:02,912
Jesus

3519
02:39:03,168 --> 02:39:07,264
It is just stop it it's an artificial distinct

3520
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:08,544
Huey

3521
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:10,080
You desire is to make

3522
02:39:10,336 --> 02:39:10,848
Yeah

3523
02:39:11,872 --> 02:39:12,384
Upsetting

3524
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:13,408
I'm almost

3525
02:39:13,664 --> 02:39:17,504
What I what I care most about is the people who are getting hurt

3526
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:18,784
Whenever we allow the races

3527
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:19,552
Systemax

3528
02:39:19,808 --> 02:39:20,832
That's my issue

3529
02:39:21,088 --> 02:39:22,624
All we're doing is fighting all the time

3530
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:28,768
Let's go to a homogeneous whites-only population without nothing bad ever happens when that goes on

3531
02:39:29,024 --> 02:39:30,048
Alex is interested in you

3532
02:39:30,304 --> 02:39:31,840
Samantha

3533
02:39:32,352 --> 02:39:33,376
So if there's one

3534
02:39:34,144 --> 02:39:34,912
Shining

3535
02:39:35,936 --> 02:39:36,960
Brightspot

3536
02:39:39,264 --> 02:39:40,544
That is true second

3537
02:39:41,056 --> 02:39:42,336
Is that

3538
02:39:43,104 --> 02:39:43,616
Analog time

3539
02:39:44,384 --> 02:39:50,272
But Sir Alex brought back one of the hits in this

3540
02:39:50,528 --> 02:39:51,552
But one of his greatest

3541
02:39:52,064 --> 02:39:53,088
Okay so me weed

3542
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:56,160
Might have spent way too much time talking about in the past

3543
02:39:56,928 --> 02:39:58,976
I'm not a big partier but when I was getting divorced

3544
02:39:59,232 --> 02:40:01,536
I would go to Halloween parties and stuff

3545
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:05,632
Women

3546
02:40:13,568 --> 02:40:14,848
White guy I say

3547
02:40:19,712 --> 02:40:20,224
Racist

3548
02:40:20,480 --> 02:40:22,528
You tell me I'm erasing

3549
02:40:24,320 --> 02:40:26,624
Arab men doing it and left us women I'll just laugh

3550
02:40:32,768 --> 02:40:33,536
Baby suck your boots

3551
02:40:34,304 --> 02:40:35,072
That's not going to happen either

3552
02:40:35,328 --> 02:40:41,472
So we get the Nazi Halloween hat story making a Resurgence in Hawaii

3553
02:40:45,056 --> 02:40:45,824
Really weird

3554
02:40:46,592 --> 02:40:51,712
I don't know maybe he's in the mood to deflect criticism that he is

3555
02:40:51,968 --> 02:40:54,016
So Alex talks about how like he gets

3556
02:40:54,784 --> 02:40:55,296
For a lot of stuff

3557
02:40:58,112 --> 02:40:58,880
Is talking about

3558
02:40:59,136 --> 02:40:59,648
How

3559
02:40:59,904 --> 02:41:01,440
Extra-dimensional aliens

3560
02:41:01,696 --> 02:41:02,464
Are attacking him

3561
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,048
Bees on YouTube

3562
02:41:07,328 --> 02:41:10,144
Good point

3563
02:41:10,912 --> 02:41:13,216
Me when I say it's offworld

3564
02:41:14,496 --> 02:41:16,544
Manipulating Humanity, teaches how to destroy

3565
02:41:51,616 --> 02:41:56,480
Are you complaining that no one attacks you for that cuz we we do pretty regularly

3566
02:41:56,736 --> 02:42:02,880
Stupid also based on what we're learning more and more about the Project Camelot stuff

3567
02:42:03,136 --> 02:42:07,232
Interdimensional alien stuff because usually underneath that is a s*** ton erase

3568
02:42:07,744 --> 02:42:10,048
Yeah it does seem like there's a weird overlapping

3569
02:42:11,328 --> 02:42:14,144
Yeah and I also think that other people are mocking him

3570
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:18,240
For this it might not be the most relevant thing

3571
02:42:18,496 --> 02:42:19,776
That like let's say

3572
02:42:20,032 --> 02:42:23,616
A publication like The Daily Beast cover

3573
02:42:24,128 --> 02:42:25,664
It kind of Fades into the background

3574
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:32,064
When there's more pressing real-world issues extra-dimensional demons are causing races

3575
02:42:32,320 --> 02:42:33,856
Cement giving Global a secret

3576
02:42:34,112 --> 02:42:35,392
Space technology

3577
02:42:35,648 --> 02:42:36,928
Yeah that's not for right

3578
02:42:37,440 --> 02:42:38,976
Interdimensional right-wing

3579
02:42:39,232 --> 02:42:39,744
Right

3580
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:41,792
It's a new one I'm starting welltok

3581
02:42:42,304 --> 02:42:48,448
We'll see what happens it's one of those things to the lake I could see you at like an editor just being like this is the least harmful

3582
02:42:48,704 --> 02:42:49,728
His beliefs

3583
02:42:51,264 --> 02:42:52,288
Pascal

3584
02:42:53,056 --> 02:42:55,360
We're in Erte mechoso we make fun of it quite a bit

3585
02:42:55,616 --> 02:42:57,920
Hey Weekend lyrics

3586
02:42:58,688 --> 02:43:00,480
Yeah so I was supposed to call

3587
02:43:00,736 --> 02:43:03,040
WhatsApp

3588
02:43:03,552 --> 02:43:05,088
Answer

3589
02:43:05,344 --> 02:43:06,624
Interesting thing that happens on this call

3590
02:43:07,136 --> 02:43:09,440
But I finally got through happy

3591
02:43:09,952 --> 02:43:11,488
New Year that new decade

3592
02:43:13,792 --> 02:43:17,888
Play roaring 2020s The Roaring 1920s don't be roaring 2020

3593
02:43:20,192 --> 02:43:21,216
Roaring 20 20

3594
02:43:21,472 --> 02:43:26,080
If you notice that caller wish Alex a happy new decade and Alex's

3595
02:43:26,336 --> 02:43:28,896
Very insistent that it is not

3596
02:43:29,408 --> 02:43:31,200
The beginning of

3597
02:43:32,736 --> 02:43:36,064
New decade is a globalist

3598
02:43:36,320 --> 02:43:39,136
Calendars

3599
02:43:39,392 --> 02:43:40,160
This caller

3600
02:43:40,416 --> 02:43:46,048
Does not get corrected I think this color is obviously a global it's because nobody would make a nickname

3601
02:43:46,304 --> 02:43:47,840
Longer than the Roaring Twenties

3602
02:43:48,608 --> 02:43:50,400
That was an already long nickname

3603
02:43:50,912 --> 02:43:52,448
The double Leroy

3604
02:43:52,704 --> 02:43:54,752
2020

3605
02:43:55,008 --> 02:43:56,800
I don't know if this guy is a globalist or not

3606
02:43:57,056 --> 02:43:59,872
But somebody says in this next clip leads me to believe

3607
02:44:00,128 --> 02:44:00,896
Probably not

3608
02:44:01,408 --> 02:44:02,688
Impossibly

3609
02:44:02,944 --> 02:44:05,248
I'm guessing that I am your best customer info

3610
02:44:10,624 --> 02:44:14,976
About $19,000 last year on it

3611
02:44:15,232 --> 02:44:20,352
Underwrite the show so my friend God bless you

3612
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:23,168
Real bad

3613
02:44:25,984 --> 02:44:26,752
How

3614
02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:28,288
Don't know

3615
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:33,920
How do you lose money gambling with his product or something what happened Wonder that's just not true

3616
02:44:34,176 --> 02:44:34,688
I can't be

3617
02:44:35,456 --> 02:44:35,968
Seems very

3618
02:44:36,480 --> 02:44:39,552
19000 what is it everything

3619
02:44:41,088 --> 02:44:41,600
Yeah

3620
02:44:41,856 --> 02:44:45,184
Animated you bought like a like one of those water filtration

3621
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:46,720
Devices that are like

3622
02:44:46,976 --> 02:44:50,816
Oh that's like yeah yeah some of the ones that Alex sells

3623
02:44:51,072 --> 02:44:52,096
Surfer like showers

3624
02:44:52,352 --> 02:44:54,400
Frozen stuff to water

3625
02:44:54,656 --> 02:44:55,680
I could see

3626
02:44:56,704 --> 02:44:58,240
I see you pee

3627
02:44:58,496 --> 02:44:59,008
Possible

3628
02:44:59,776 --> 02:45:01,312
I was sleeping on wise

3629
02:45:01,568 --> 02:45:02,848
Yeah I say that

3630
02:45:03,616 --> 02:45:04,384
I was

3631
02:45:05,152 --> 02:45:10,272
Shocked somebody spent $1,000 on candy crush you like

3632
02:45:10,528 --> 02:45:11,040
You can't even

3633
02:45:11,296 --> 02:45:12,064
You can't do that

3634
02:45:12,576 --> 02:45:13,600
Can you do that

3635
02:45:14,368 --> 02:45:14,880
You did

3636
02:45:17,184 --> 02:45:21,024
So when's this caller says he spent $19,000 last year at Alex's

3637
02:45:21,280 --> 02:45:21,792
Store

3638
02:45:22,048 --> 02:45:24,352
You kind of got to get like this guy's got a

3639
02:45:24,864 --> 02:45:25,888
You got to let him talk yeah

3640
02:45:26,144 --> 02:45:26,912
80s videos

3641
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:28,960
I just want to start with some background

3642
02:45:29,472 --> 02:45:30,496
I believe

3643
02:45:30,752 --> 02:45:32,800
Based on my

3644
02:45:34,336 --> 02:45:36,640
Research over decades now album

3645
02:45:36,896 --> 02:45:43,040
World history in psychology

3646
02:45:43,296 --> 02:45:44,320
Rachel superjeenius

3647
02:45:44,832 --> 02:45:48,672
And I and the thing about him is it with the horrors they were political IQ test

3648
02:45:49,440 --> 02:45:50,464
It would be about a 300

3649
02:45:50,720 --> 02:45:51,232
I mean

3650
02:45:51,488 --> 02:45:53,024
And I've been saying that for years

3651
02:45:53,280 --> 02:45:56,864
He is clearly studied Machiavelli he's clearly study Bismarck

3652
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:58,400
He's clearly study son

3653
02:45:58,656 --> 02:46:01,984
So he's clearly study Claudius and I can get one of those

3654
02:46:04,031 --> 02:46:04,543
Okay man

3655
02:46:05,567 --> 02:46:07,871
I mean maybe you should try reading more recent

3656
02:46:09,663 --> 02:46:11,199
How can you possibly believe

3657
02:46:11,711 --> 02:46:14,783
That I mean how can you spend $19,000 on it

3658
02:46:15,551 --> 02:46:18,111
Nevermind of course he believes that Trump is

3659
02:46:18,367 --> 02:46:20,671
The single digits by mohbad

3660
02:46:20,927 --> 02:46:21,439
Good call

3661
02:46:23,487 --> 02:46:24,255
And I'm not going to

3662
02:46:25,023 --> 02:46:27,327
So Alex is next with

3663
02:46:27,839 --> 02:46:29,119
I got kind of derailed man

3664
02:46:29,375 --> 02:46:33,471
Backstory that I had was supposed to be the main story today

3665
02:46:33,727 --> 02:46:34,495
But I ended up

3666
02:46:34,751 --> 02:46:40,895
Then I was a Nazi for a while anyways let's get back to mainstream Richard Spencer with my audience

3667
02:46:41,407 --> 02:46:41,919
I kind of forgot

3668
02:46:42,175 --> 02:46:43,199
Well I better yell about it

3669
02:46:43,711 --> 02:46:46,015
I probably won't get to the report even though it's our job story

3670
02:46:46,783 --> 02:46:49,855
Sunday I can read Friday covered Saturday is it so huge

3671
02:46:50,111 --> 02:46:52,415
I got you to the whole show tomorrow on it cuz you can't just

3672
02:46:52,927 --> 02:46:56,511
You know you'll be smelling something this big that had you inside the says

3673
02:46:56,767 --> 02:46:57,535
These are killing people

3674
02:46:59,071 --> 02:47:00,351
These are killing people

3675
02:47:01,887 --> 02:47:06,239
We've been covering it up and there's no actual testing and then she's on TV show

3676
02:47:06,495 --> 02:47:09,567
All the other topside is saying you don't want adjuvant

3677
02:47:09,823 --> 02:47:14,431
People are passed and the doctors don't believe it anymore vaccines are hurting everybody

3678
02:47:20,831 --> 02:47:21,343
Intercourse

3679
02:47:22,623 --> 02:47:26,975
It's in the Independent Media and okay if you wanted thousand views on my website the band video

3680
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:32,351
Needs to be everywhere the only way it gets out as you but she

3681
02:47:37,215 --> 02:47:39,007
Wow that's stopping Public Health

3682
02:47:39,775 --> 02:47:41,567
Covering up for drug companies

3683
02:47:44,895 --> 02:47:47,199
Vaccines mandatory

3684
02:47:49,247 --> 02:47:55,391
Nazi just lied you a shot give it to you know how to give you a shot kills your 10 years later he's got to stop talking about going to come out of this

3685
02:47:55,903 --> 02:47:56,415
Violence

3686
02:47:56,671 --> 02:47:59,743
Are they keep trying to force vaccines and people get their kids hurt and they get hurt

3687
02:48:00,511 --> 02:48:04,095
Vaccine had any corporate head today big Tech heads are going to be fair game

3688
02:48:04,863 --> 02:48:05,887
Season

3689
02:48:06,143 --> 02:48:08,191
Whoa that's not good

3690
02:48:08,959 --> 02:48:12,287
That's not good open season on I guess doctors

3691
02:48:13,567 --> 02:48:15,871
The pharmaceutical people because of vaccine

3692
02:48:16,127 --> 02:48:16,639
By that

3693
02:48:16,895 --> 02:48:17,407
Same

3694
02:48:17,663 --> 02:48:18,943
Sort of logic

3695
02:48:19,711 --> 02:48:25,855
You could really see somebody making an argument that people who push anti-vaccination stuff should be killed

3696
02:48:26,367 --> 02:48:27,391
Like it hate there's open

3697
02:48:27,647 --> 02:48:29,695
Season on that because if you could

3698
02:48:30,463 --> 02:48:32,767
Create some sort of a causal

3699
02:48:33,023 --> 02:48:34,815
Inference between

3700
02:48:35,071 --> 02:48:35,583
People

3701
02:48:36,095 --> 02:48:36,863
Disseminating

3702
02:48:37,375 --> 02:48:41,983
Anti-vaccination information in various areas or let's say

3703
02:48:43,263 --> 02:48:47,615
Increased numbers of people getting vaccine waivers on exemptions

3704
02:48:47,871 --> 02:48:50,687
Is and then outbreaks of diseases happening

3705
02:48:51,199 --> 02:48:52,479
If you could do that

3706
02:48:52,735 --> 02:48:53,247
Then

3707
02:48:53,503 --> 02:48:54,015
It would track

3708
02:48:54,271 --> 02:49:00,415
Anti-vaccination is causing people to be hurt and killed

3709
02:49:00,671 --> 02:49:02,975
It's like I don't know that's not

3710
02:49:04,255 --> 02:49:05,791
That's not good

3711
02:49:06,047 --> 02:49:06,559
So

3712
02:49:07,327 --> 02:49:10,911
You just see the canvas sort of lying probably feels good for

3713
02:49:11,167 --> 02:49:11,935
For Alex to say

3714
02:49:12,447 --> 02:49:17,055
But realistically he's opening the door for people who are extreme on the other side

3715
02:49:17,311 --> 02:49:18,591
To justify violence

3716
02:49:18,847 --> 02:49:20,895
Against him it's all very stupid

3717
02:49:21,151 --> 02:49:23,711
And it doesn't take into account the reality of the situation

3718
02:49:23,967 --> 02:49:25,503
It's just blustery nonsense

3719
02:49:26,783 --> 02:49:31,391
Is only meant to escalate and make people not really understand the topics it'll be covered being covered

3720
02:49:31,647 --> 02:49:32,927
But feel intense

3721
02:49:33,439 --> 02:49:33,951
Yeah

3722
02:49:34,463 --> 02:49:36,255
And the violence doesn't then they're man

3723
02:49:37,023 --> 02:49:39,839
Alex starts talking about Fentanyl and

3724
02:49:40,095 --> 02:49:42,655
Now he wants to kill all the Chinese people

3725
02:49:43,423 --> 02:49:45,215
I'm not necessarily but a different group

3726
02:49:45,471 --> 02:49:46,239
1

3727
02:49:46,495 --> 02:49:52,127
Gwayne a fentanyl will kill you and their lacing everything with it and I just everybody I know as people dying

3728
02:49:52,639 --> 02:49:56,991
I am so pissed I must say that anybody in my family gets hurt my Fentanyl

3729
02:49:59,039 --> 02:50:00,575
Responsible

3730
02:50:01,343 --> 02:50:03,903
MPS

3731
02:50:04,671 --> 02:50:09,023
God

3732
02:50:09,791 --> 02:50:14,655
That's a law enforcement understands that didn't like cocaine or somebody let some of the slip through whatever

3733
02:50:15,167 --> 02:50:20,287
Anybody with fentanyl selling it needs to be executed or Singapore

3734
02:50:23,103 --> 02:50:25,407
Millions are getting killed by this crap

3735
02:50:28,991 --> 02:50:29,503
Millions

3736
02:50:30,271 --> 02:50:31,807
So here we find noted self

3737
02:50:32,063 --> 02:50:38,207
Describe libertarian Alex Jones expressing a desire for the state to enact lethal Force against people who are engaging in a market in

3738
02:50:38,463 --> 02:50:40,767
Interaction where they provided dangerous substance

3739
02:50:41,023 --> 02:50:42,815
The people can choose to take or not

3740
02:50:43,327 --> 02:50:45,887
Why doesn't Alex believe the people have individual rights

3741
02:50:46,399 --> 02:50:47,423
Why does Alex think that

3742
02:50:47,679 --> 02:50:49,471
The state has the right to initiate violence

3743
02:50:50,239 --> 02:50:51,775
He should be entirely against his

3744
02:50:52,031 --> 02:50:52,543
Basic

3745
02:50:52,799 --> 02:50:53,823
Political principles

3746
02:50:54,079 --> 02:50:56,639
At least it would be if he were actually a libertarian

3747
02:50:57,151 --> 02:50:57,663
But he's not

3748
02:50:57,919 --> 02:50:58,431
He's evolved

3749
02:50:58,687 --> 02:50:59,711
As many libertarian

3750
02:50:59,967 --> 02:51:02,015
Into into a full-on authoritarian

3751
02:51:03,039 --> 02:51:04,831
The legal system does already recognized

3752
02:51:05,087 --> 02:51:07,647
The selling drugs that result in injury or death require harsh

3753
02:51:07,903 --> 02:51:09,439
Four penalties like longer prison cell

3754
02:51:09,951 --> 02:51:13,535
Are you sure they don't require execution though positive

3755
02:51:13,791 --> 02:51:16,095
What Alex is calling for his execution of drug

3756
02:51:16,607 --> 02:51:21,215
And even in his calling for it he's cognizant that his position is in line with you

3757
02:51:21,471 --> 02:51:21,983
Horrible

3758
02:51:22,239 --> 02:51:23,007
Oppressive States

3759
02:51:23,263 --> 02:51:24,031
But he thinks are the big

3760
02:51:24,287 --> 02:51:25,055
Evil in the world

3761
02:51:25,823 --> 02:51:30,431
And what are the main problems you're going to run into if you try and act a policy like this is where is the line

3762
02:51:31,199 --> 02:51:35,039
Many of the people who are selling opiates with fentanyl in them has no idea there's fentanyl in

3763
02:51:35,551 --> 02:51:37,087
Should these people be killed too

3764
02:51:37,599 --> 02:51:42,975
How do you prove an established that a drug dealer had foreknowledge of exactly what was in the drugs they were the middleman

3765
02:51:43,231 --> 02:51:43,743
A selling

3766
02:51:43,999 --> 02:51:48,095
It's almost an impossible case to Macon I would assume that what you'd end up doing is

3767
02:51:48,351 --> 02:51:50,399
Probably just encouraging summary execution

3768
02:51:50,655 --> 02:51:53,215
And now we're at the level

3769
02:51:53,727 --> 02:51:56,031
You know what I remember based on

3770
02:51:56,287 --> 02:51:57,823
2 amendments

3771
02:51:58,335 --> 02:51:58,847
Constitution

3772
02:51:59,359 --> 02:52:00,383
Prohibition War

3773
02:52:01,663 --> 02:52:02,175
Well I mean they didn't

3774
02:52:02,431 --> 02:52:07,039
Just execute people with booze wasn't that what the Untouchables was about

3775
02:52:09,343 --> 02:52:09,855
Spider-Man Subway

3776
02:52:11,135 --> 02:52:12,671
Further I want to ask this question

3777
02:52:13,183 --> 02:52:17,279
What's so special about fentanyl that makes Alex want to kill people who sell it

3778
02:52:17,791 --> 02:52:19,839
Sure it's dangerous and it could be lethal but

3779
02:52:20,095 --> 02:52:21,119
Soak and tons of other drug

3780
02:52:21,631 --> 02:52:23,935
Overdose isn't that from an overdose

3781
02:52:24,191 --> 02:52:25,215
Regardless of what Subs

3782
02:52:26,751 --> 02:52:32,895
According to the CDC only 67.8% of drug overdose deaths in 2017 were even from

3783
02:52:33,663 --> 02:52:34,943
And that's not all fun

3784
02:52:35,967 --> 02:52:39,039
Approximately 20% of overdoses involve cocaine

3785
02:52:39,295 --> 02:52:40,319
So what did Ike

3786
02:52:40,575 --> 02:52:42,623
It would be important for Alex

3787
02:52:42,879 --> 02:52:44,927
Explain exactly what it is about fentanyl that may

3788
02:52:45,183 --> 02:52:46,975
Makes it okay to kill someone who sells that

3789
02:52:47,231 --> 02:52:49,279
But not okay to kill a cocaine dealer

3790
02:52:50,047 --> 02:52:51,583
This is over the real issue

3791
02:52:52,095 --> 02:52:53,631
Alex thinks he's making the nuance

3792
02:52:54,399 --> 02:52:54,911
Cogent point

3793
02:52:55,423 --> 02:52:57,471
Like this Sentinel is just so much more days

3794
02:52:57,983 --> 02:52:59,519
Sandusky have to kill people who sell it

3795
02:52:59,775 --> 02:53:00,287
This is

3796
02:53:01,055 --> 02:53:03,871
Exact same line of rhetoric at Auntie drug people abused forever

3797
02:53:04,639 --> 02:53:08,991
Yes objectively decided that fentanyl is so dangerous that it merits killing dealer

3798
02:53:09,503 --> 02:53:11,295
But using that same path of reason

3799
02:53:11,807 --> 02:53:13,855
Someone who's universally anti-drug

3800
02:53:14,111 --> 02:53:16,415
To the 20% of odds and 27

3801
02:53:16,671 --> 02:53:17,695
Gina Baldwin cocaine

3802
02:53:17,951 --> 02:53:21,023
It's a the cocaine is so dangerous that you just have to kill people who sell it

3803
02:53:21,791 --> 02:53:22,815
Plus the opiate crisis

3804
02:53:23,071 --> 02:53:24,095
This is not just about Fentanyl

3805
02:53:24,607 --> 02:53:26,399
Tons of people who are dying or dying

3806
02:53:26,655 --> 02:53:27,679
Taking prescription open

3807
02:53:28,191 --> 02:53:30,239
Which could be super dangerous when they're abused

3808
02:53:30,751 --> 02:53:35,871
Using Alex's line of reasoning it would be possible for someone to advance the position that we should kill pharmacist

3809
02:53:36,639 --> 02:53:37,407
Which kind of

3810
02:53:37,663 --> 02:53:39,711
I kind of hope this illustrates how absurd Alex

3811
02:53:39,967 --> 02:53:40,479
Disposition

3812
02:53:41,503 --> 02:53:44,831
This level of Baseline childish and violent positioning

3813
02:53:45,087 --> 02:53:45,599
Is really dead

3814
02:53:46,623 --> 02:53:50,463
Alex is mad about stuff so he's letting off some steam saying drug dealer should be killed

3815
02:53:50,975 --> 02:53:55,583
But the effect of this is normalizing positions that should be way far outside with

3816
02:53:55,839 --> 02:53:56,351
Acceptable

3817
02:53:57,119 --> 02:53:57,631
But then again

3818
02:53:57,887 --> 02:53:59,167
Alex has never really had a problem

3819
02:54:00,191 --> 02:54:01,215
So this is probably just some

3820
02:54:01,471 --> 02:54:02,751
He's been cool with for a while

3821
02:54:03,263 --> 02:54:04,287
You know kept Under Wraps

3822
02:54:04,543 --> 02:54:06,079
I hear I hear two things

3823
02:54:06,335 --> 02:54:07,103
Things going on

3824
02:54:07,359 --> 02:54:08,383
01

3825
02:54:08,639 --> 02:54:09,407
I can hear him

3826
02:54:10,175 --> 02:54:10,687
Like

3827
02:54:10,943 --> 02:54:13,503
Finally reacting angrily to

3828
02:54:13,759 --> 02:54:15,551
Rolling over and letting Richards

3829
02:54:15,807 --> 02:54:16,575
Spencer rub his belly

3830
02:54:16,831 --> 02:54:18,879
It seems like that probably is

3831
02:54:19,903 --> 02:54:23,231
You can't prove it it feels that way

3832
02:54:23,487 --> 02:54:24,255
And then tujhe

3833
02:54:24,511 --> 02:54:25,023
Just dislike

3834
02:54:25,535 --> 02:54:26,815
Because he was talking

3835
02:54:27,071 --> 02:54:27,583
To this out

3836
02:54:27,839 --> 02:54:28,351
Now whitening

3837
02:54:29,375 --> 02:54:30,399
His rhetoric

3838
02:54:30,655 --> 02:54:32,191
Is so much more violent

3839
02:54:32,703 --> 02:54:33,727
And so much more

3840
02:54:34,239 --> 02:54:35,263
Bass round extermination

3841
02:54:35,519 --> 02:54:41,663
I think you might be seeing Court like a coincidence that's entirely possible but he's not talking about like

3842
02:54:41,919 --> 02:54:43,199
We need to put people in prison this

3843
02:54:43,455 --> 02:54:46,527
Straight-up Exterminating you know

3844
02:54:46,783 --> 02:54:52,415
It's also still fairly in line with the escalation that you've been going on there for months

3845
02:54:52,671 --> 02:54:53,183
Schnauzer like

3846
02:54:53,439 --> 02:54:54,463
I can see you

3847
02:54:54,719 --> 02:54:56,767
Psychologically the way Alex operates

3848
02:54:57,535 --> 02:55:01,631
And how f*****-up he often is after an interview doesn't go the way he wants a Jeff

3849
02:55:02,143 --> 02:55:03,935
My sense from listening to it

3850
02:55:04,191 --> 02:55:05,215
Like the entire thing

3851
02:55:05,471 --> 02:55:08,031
It doesn't really track that way necessary

3852
02:55:08,543 --> 02:55:10,335
I think it's more just like this is

3853
02:55:10,847 --> 02:55:11,871
More what he's

3854
02:55:12,639 --> 02:55:13,919
Doing these yeah yeah

3855
02:55:15,711 --> 02:55:18,015
I mean these goats are curated in order

3856
02:55:18,271 --> 02:55:21,087
So obviously I don't have the folks

3857
02:55:21,599 --> 02:55:23,135
Text Aaron

3858
02:55:23,391 --> 02:55:24,415
It sounds like because

3859
02:55:24,671 --> 02:55:27,487
The ones immediately after he was fairly

3860
02:55:27,743 --> 02:55:28,255
Docent

3861
02:55:28,511 --> 02:55:29,279
Linda

3862
02:55:29,535 --> 02:55:30,303
Docile

3863
02:55:30,559 --> 02:55:32,095
Like

3864
02:55:32,351 --> 02:55:34,655
As we get further and further away from it is

3865
02:55:35,167 --> 02:55:35,935
You are like

3866
02:55:37,983 --> 02:55:39,775
I think it's more

3867
02:55:40,287 --> 02:55:42,847
The I think it's more reflection of

3868
02:55:43,359 --> 02:55:43,871
How it's

3869
02:55:44,127 --> 02:55:46,431
Extremely he's selling this un

3870
02:55:46,687 --> 02:55:49,503
Backstory

3871
02:55:49,759 --> 02:55:51,039
Cover it on the show

3872
02:55:51,295 --> 02:55:57,439
So you needs to make up for a little bit that leads him towards this violent right right it carries over into the the Fenton

3873
02:55:58,463 --> 02:56:01,279
I think that's probably but I'm glad you brought that up

3874
02:56:01,535 --> 02:56:02,559
Because I think

3875
02:56:02,815 --> 02:56:03,583
You could easily

3876
02:56:04,095 --> 02:56:07,423
Love you heard by our listeners as like that being the natural conclusion

3877
02:56:07,679 --> 02:56:08,447
And honestly

3878
02:56:08,703 --> 02:56:10,495
We can't know that might be

3879
02:56:10,751 --> 02:56:12,031
What he's going through

3880
02:56:12,287 --> 02:56:13,055
Orbynot

3881
02:56:13,311 --> 02:56:14,591
That's entirely possible

3882
02:56:14,847 --> 02:56:15,359
Yeah

3883
02:56:15,615 --> 02:56:17,151
Unfortunately that's how the worth

3884
02:56:18,175 --> 02:56:19,967
Takes one last call

3885
02:56:20,223 --> 02:56:20,991
Pure on the show

3886
02:56:21,247 --> 02:56:21,759
And

3887
02:56:22,527 --> 02:56:24,063
I think this caller might be in

3888
02:56:24,319 --> 02:56:24,831
Project Campbell

3889
02:56:25,599 --> 02:56:31,743
I have something I want really quickly the crew to just promise me to look up it didn't have to be the day for the next few days look up

3890
02:56:31,999 --> 02:56:33,279
Salvatore Pius

3891
02:56:36,351 --> 02:56:39,167
Before AAA vehicle that

3892
02:56:39,423 --> 02:56:41,215
U.s. Navy

3893
02:56:41,471 --> 02:56:44,031
Opryland enabled and

3894
02:56:47,359 --> 02:56:48,639
Salvatore pioske

3895
02:56:50,175 --> 02:56:51,967
Pais

3896
02:56:52,479 --> 02:56:54,271
The country music

3897
02:56:54,527 --> 02:56:55,551
Literally translates

3898
02:56:56,063 --> 02:56:56,831
Savior of our country

3899
02:56:58,111 --> 02:56:58,879
This is real

3900
02:56:59,391 --> 02:57:02,975
This is really really really real

3901
02:57:07,839 --> 02:57:09,887
46th and

3902
02:57:10,143 --> 02:57:12,703
So over the past few years Salvatore Pious is

3903
02:57:12,959 --> 02:57:15,775
Supplied for patents on behalf of the Navy for a number

3904
02:57:16,031 --> 02:57:17,055
Futuristic technology

3905
02:57:17,311 --> 02:57:19,615
Including machine that would create electromagnetic

3906
02:57:19,871 --> 02:57:20,383
Fields

3907
02:57:20,639 --> 02:57:23,455
A zero loss Electric electrical generator

3908
02:57:23,711 --> 02:57:26,015
And a compact nuclear fusion reactor

3909
02:57:26,783 --> 02:57:30,879
There's literally no reason to believe any of these things have been made there just patent application

3910
02:57:31,391 --> 02:57:33,695
Anyone can apply for patents for whatever they want

3911
02:57:33,951 --> 02:57:35,231
Not required that they pad

3912
02:57:35,487 --> 02:57:37,023
Something that actually exist

3913
02:57:37,279 --> 02:57:38,303
Set the time of application

3914
02:57:39,327 --> 02:57:40,607
Some people theorize

3915
02:57:40,863 --> 02:57:42,655
These patents are part of the misinformation

3916
02:57:42,911 --> 02:57:46,751
Can campaign to make other world leaders believe that the United States either has

3917
02:57:47,007 --> 02:57:48,543
Or is working on particular things

3918
02:57:49,055 --> 02:57:50,079
Which could have the effect

3919
02:57:50,335 --> 02:57:50,847
The redirecting

3920
02:57:51,103 --> 02:57:51,871
Some of the research

3921
02:57:52,383 --> 02:57:56,479
And lead them to wasting a bunch of money down rabbit hole

3922
02:57:56,735 --> 02:58:00,575
Seem like something that's within the realm of possibility but I have no idea what's going on

3923
02:58:00,831 --> 02:58:05,695
That that is just a theory that some people have advanced eight dimensional chest

3924
02:58:05,951 --> 02:58:07,231
And science has proven

3925
02:58:07,487 --> 02:58:09,023
That there are dimensions above

3926
02:58:09,535 --> 02:58:10,047
And below

3927
02:58:10,559 --> 02:58:11,071
All around us

3928
02:58:11,327 --> 02:58:13,631
And evil spirits are real

3929
02:58:14,143 --> 02:58:15,679
This stuff is being pushed

3930
02:58:15,935 --> 02:58:17,471
By people like David Wilcock

3931
02:58:17,727 --> 02:58:18,495
Fox TV

3932
02:58:18,751 --> 02:58:20,543
Exactly what this caller is saying

3933
02:58:20,799 --> 02:58:21,567
Yeah

3934
02:58:21,823 --> 02:58:22,591
People in the projects

3935
02:58:22,847 --> 02:58:23,871
Camelot side of the equation

3936
02:58:24,383 --> 02:58:26,943
Until there's any proof of any of this stuff up that application

3937
02:58:27,455 --> 02:58:31,807
You know once there is that I'll start to give a s*** but for now this is really ignorable

3938
02:58:32,575 --> 02:58:35,135
What does demonstrates very clearly though is that there's a

3939
02:58:35,391 --> 02:58:37,439
Basic lack of reality literacy

3940
02:58:37,695 --> 02:58:38,719
And people like this color

3941
02:58:38,975 --> 02:58:39,487
Into a certain

3942
02:58:39,743 --> 02:58:40,255
Next.

3943
02:58:41,279 --> 02:58:42,815
The caller doesn't realize that a patent

3944
02:58:43,071 --> 02:58:44,351
Doesn't mean the same thing

3945
02:58:44,607 --> 02:58:45,631
As an actual invention

3946
02:58:46,143 --> 02:58:46,911
So he's using

3947
02:58:47,167 --> 02:58:48,447
Completely irrelevant proved

3948
02:58:48,703 --> 02:58:50,751
To claim that the Navy has all this futuristic

3949
02:58:51,007 --> 02:58:51,519
Tech

3950
02:58:51,775 --> 02:58:56,639
Because Alex doesn't really know the difference either he can't explain it to the college he's making a reason

3951
02:58:57,407 --> 02:58:59,199
These two people have different deficiency

3952
02:58:59,711 --> 02:59:00,479
But they come

3953
02:59:00,735 --> 02:59:01,247
Found each other

3954
02:59:02,015 --> 02:59:06,367
The color is a basic misunderstanding would you presents to Alex who supposedly and Authority

3955
02:59:07,391 --> 02:59:09,695
In his capacity as that authority figure Alex

3956
02:59:09,951 --> 02:59:10,719
Completely abdicate

3957
02:59:10,975 --> 02:59:11,999
Any responsibility

3958
02:59:12,255 --> 02:59:14,047
Cossetta's call her straight about Patton

3959
02:59:14,303 --> 02:59:18,143
In doing so he allows his stamp of approval to tacitly attached to this

3960
02:59:18,911 --> 02:59:20,191
It's just bad work all over

3961
02:59:21,727 --> 02:59:23,519
Also there's a slight problem with the translation

3962
02:59:23,775 --> 02:59:24,543
Salvatore pias's

3963
02:59:25,567 --> 02:59:26,079
They are

3964
02:59:26,335 --> 02:59:27,871
Specifying what language

3965
02:59:28,383 --> 02:59:28,895
It translates

3966
02:59:29,151 --> 02:59:29,663
In

3967
02:59:29,919 --> 02:59:31,455
And then they know you think it's

3968
02:59:31,711 --> 02:59:32,479
Savior of the country

3969
02:59:33,247 --> 02:59:35,807
Salvatore does mean savior in Italian but

3970
02:59:36,319 --> 02:59:37,855
Highest is country in Spanish

3971
02:59:38,623 --> 02:59:39,647
There is a word

3972
02:59:39,903 --> 02:59:40,415
4 country hits

3973
02:59:40,671 --> 02:59:41,183
Close

3974
02:59:41,439 --> 02:59:42,207
In Italian

3975
02:59:42,463 --> 02:59:43,743
Spell different

3976
02:59:44,255 --> 02:59:45,279
It's not the same word

3977
02:59:46,559 --> 02:59:49,119
It's not the word that most Italians would probably use

3978
02:59:49,375 --> 02:59:50,143
In that context

3979
02:59:50,399 --> 02:59:53,471
Write this is more for like town so generally

3980
02:59:53,983 --> 02:59:57,055
So he's the savior of both Italy and Spain

3981
02:59:57,823 --> 02:59:58,335
Totally

3982
02:59:58,847 --> 03:00:00,895
Station is complicated and honestly it's

3983
03:00:01,151 --> 03:00:02,175
More fun to use this guy's

3984
03:00:02,431 --> 03:00:03,967
Name the building conspiracies

3985
03:00:04,223 --> 03:00:05,503
Yeah yeah

3986
03:00:06,783 --> 03:00:08,575
So

3987
03:00:08,831 --> 03:00:11,903
A little bit this is sort of how we we end up the show

3988
03:00:12,159 --> 03:00:13,439
I just have one question

3989
03:00:15,231 --> 03:00:17,535
And it determines whether or not I believe anything that he

3990
03:00:18,047 --> 03:00:19,071
What do you think about the Getty

3991
03:00:19,583 --> 03:00:20,351
Do you have a

3992
03:00:22,655 --> 03:00:23,679
Alex I mean

3993
03:00:23,935 --> 03:00:24,703
He's not

3994
03:00:24,959 --> 03:00:26,495
Doubling down on this guy the

3995
03:00:26,751 --> 03:00:27,519
Listcawler but he

3996
03:00:27,775 --> 03:00:31,359
He isn't also bring any reasoning or any rationality into

3997
03:00:31,871 --> 03:00:34,175
Because this is space horses this is the craftivist

3998
03:00:34,431 --> 03:00:34,943
Space force

3999
03:00:35,455 --> 03:00:35,967
Realize that

4000
03:00:37,759 --> 03:00:41,343
A lot of hidden technology they haven't rolled out yet and in front wants to do that

4001
03:00:41,599 --> 03:00:42,623
The innovators out of this

4002
03:00:43,135 --> 03:00:44,415
Out of this job bubble

4003
03:00:44,927 --> 03:00:47,231
I don't even bigger one the big juicy one

4004
03:00:49,279 --> 03:00:52,351
I will look into it yeah there it is that's an article I haven't

4005
03:00:53,375 --> 03:00:56,191
Daily Mail

4006
03:00:56,703 --> 03:00:59,263
So the headline of this article in the Daily Mail begins

4007
03:00:59,519 --> 03:01:03,359
U.s. Navy has been granted a patent on theoretical aircraft

4008
03:01:04,127 --> 03:01:05,919
Theoretical being the operative word there

4009
03:01:06,431 --> 03:01:10,015
The article literally says the representative from the Navy has said that the text

4010
03:01:10,271 --> 03:01:11,807
Described in these pants is not

4011
03:01:12,063 --> 03:01:12,575
Possible

4012
03:01:13,087 --> 03:01:19,231
Quote has corroborated by a letter defending the patent Pain by the chief technical officer of the Navy naval 8

4013
03:01:19,487 --> 03:01:21,023
Aviation Enterprise James Sheehy

4014
03:01:21,535 --> 03:01:25,375
The mode of movement is quote beyond the state of possible

4015
03:01:26,399 --> 03:01:30,751
Also for someone who's made a career selling gold in survival Goods warning that the globalist

4016
03:01:31,007 --> 03:01:32,031
They're going to collapse the economy

4017
03:01:32,287 --> 03:01:36,639
Seems weird that Alex would applaud Trump for escaping the current economic bubble by entering a big

4018
03:01:36,895 --> 03:01:37,663
Juicy or bubble

4019
03:01:37,919 --> 03:01:39,711
That's just a fundamental

4020
03:01:40,223 --> 03:01:41,247
Misunderstanding

4021
03:01:41,503 --> 03:01:42,783
The word bubble

4022
03:01:43,039 --> 03:01:49,183
It seems like if anything you should recognize that the end result of that bigger it's a bigger

4023
03:01:49,439 --> 03:01:50,463
Unless juicy crab

4024
03:01:51,487 --> 03:01:55,071
Use Alex's eyes put a Band-Aid on a resume or work

4025
03:01:55,327 --> 03:01:55,839
Yep

4026
03:01:56,095 --> 03:01:57,119
Do the OSHA

4027
03:01:57,375 --> 03:01:57,887
Center Heating

4028
03:01:58,143 --> 03:01:59,167
Put a lot of ice in

4029
03:02:00,447 --> 03:02:01,983
And that'll solve the problem for a

4030
03:02:02,239 --> 03:02:07,359
This seems like a weird episode

4031
03:02:07,615 --> 03:02:09,151
I think is really actually very salient

4032
03:02:09,407 --> 03:02:09,919
2

4033
03:02:10,175 --> 03:02:11,711
The problem that is going through

4034
03:02:11,967 --> 03:02:12,735
Throughout this episode

4035
03:02:13,503 --> 03:02:14,783
Largest speaking a lot of hours

4036
03:02:16,319 --> 03:02:16,831
Career

4037
03:02:17,087 --> 03:02:19,391
This caller is calling in with a complete

4038
03:02:19,647 --> 03:02:20,159
Bulshit

4039
03:02:20,415 --> 03:02:21,183
Siri

4040
03:02:21,439 --> 03:02:22,975
Easy art misunderstanding

4041
03:02:23,231 --> 03:02:24,511
Of housing

4042
03:02:24,767 --> 03:02:28,351
He believes that they've applied for this patented there for this machine exist

4043
03:02:29,119 --> 03:02:32,703
This would be pretty simple to set straight with Ignacio patents don't work that way

4044
03:02:32,959 --> 03:02:37,311
Look there's a bunch of time machines that have patents

4045
03:02:37,823 --> 03:02:39,359
Doesn't exist can't exist

4046
03:02:41,407 --> 03:02:41,919
Rights

4047
03:02:42,175 --> 03:02:43,455
That would be something

4048
03:02:43,711 --> 03:02:44,223
That Alex

4049
03:02:44,479 --> 03:02:44,991
Should

4050
03:02:45,759 --> 03:02:47,039
Instill in his audience

4051
03:02:47,807 --> 03:02:49,855
A greater understanding of how the world works

4052
03:02:50,367 --> 03:02:52,671
So they can be better critical

4053
03:02:53,439 --> 03:02:55,231
That's presumably with Alex's mission is

4054
03:02:55,743 --> 03:02:58,047
You want smart people out there Absol

4055
03:02:58,303 --> 03:02:59,583
Living in the Rio

4056
03:02:59,839 --> 03:03:00,351
That'll do it

4057
03:03:00,607 --> 03:03:02,399
But because Alex is Maine

4058
03:03:02,655 --> 03:03:03,423
Basic

4059
03:03:03,679 --> 03:03:04,191
Narratives

4060
03:03:04,703 --> 03:03:06,495
Everything that he talks about doesn't stand up

4061
03:03:06,751 --> 03:03:08,543
Any kind of critical scrutiny

4062
03:03:08,799 --> 03:03:12,383
He needs to have an audience that does believe the pat

4063
03:03:12,639 --> 03:03:15,455
It's mean a real spacecraft exists

4064
03:03:15,967 --> 03:03:17,759
He has to have that and so

4065
03:03:18,015 --> 03:03:20,575
He will never do any of the pushing back on

4066
03:03:20,831 --> 03:03:21,599
The callers

4067
03:03:21,855 --> 03:03:22,879
In order to help them

4068
03:03:23,135 --> 03:03:23,647
Reach

4069
03:03:23,903 --> 03:03:25,183
A more critical thinking

4070
03:03:25,439 --> 03:03:26,975
Oriented space

4071
03:03:27,999 --> 03:03:28,511
This

4072
03:03:28,767 --> 03:03:29,279
Nobody has

4073
03:03:29,535 --> 03:03:30,303
The byproduct

4074
03:03:30,815 --> 03:03:31,583
Of having

4075
03:03:32,095 --> 03:03:33,631
A group of people you've brought

4076
03:03:33,887 --> 03:03:34,655
Together to think

4077
03:03:34,911 --> 03:03:35,423
Uncritically

4078
03:03:37,471 --> 03:03:39,519
Exposed to people like Richard Spencer

4079
03:03:39,775 --> 03:03:41,567
Dancing circles around you

4080
03:03:42,079 --> 03:03:43,615
So when you have somebody like her

4081
03:03:43,871 --> 03:03:44,383
Spencer Ron

4082
03:03:44,639 --> 03:03:48,479
And you think I'll just because I'm so great and awesome and smart

4083
03:03:48,991 --> 03:03:52,319
I'm going to have him on here and he's going to Bow before me with my

4084
03:03:52,575 --> 03:03:53,343
Superior

4085
03:03:53,599 --> 03:03:56,159
Points I'm correct 97% of the time

4086
03:03:56,415 --> 03:03:57,183
After all

4087
03:03:57,439 --> 03:03:59,487
I do is interview

4088
03:03:59,999 --> 03:04:02,047
Mutual liars and collaborate

4089
03:04:02,303 --> 03:04:04,095
Basically people are

4090
03:04:04,351 --> 03:04:06,399
Has me so I have a very over it

4091
03:04:06,655 --> 03:04:07,679
Inflated sense

4092
03:04:07,935 --> 03:04:09,983
Of my ability to make arguments

4093
03:04:10,239 --> 03:04:11,519
And simultaneously

4094
03:04:11,775 --> 03:04:17,407
I'm surrounded by co-workers and employees who put up with me barging offset

4095
03:04:17,663 --> 03:04:19,967
Mike not being given

4096
03:04:20,223 --> 03:04:20,991
To me or some s***

4097
03:04:21,247 --> 03:04:26,111
I have outbursts all the time the people have to put up with a situation with my employees

4098
03:04:26,623 --> 03:04:28,159
Wolf course

4099
03:04:28,415 --> 03:04:30,719
I am going to be great at talking with this guy

4100
03:04:31,231 --> 03:04:31,999
Guy comes in

4101
03:04:32,511 --> 03:04:35,071
Completely dismantles all of CounterPoint

4102
03:04:35,327 --> 03:04:36,095
And the audience

4103
03:04:36,351 --> 03:04:37,887
It is trained to be

4104
03:04:38,911 --> 03:04:39,679
Basically just

4105
03:04:41,983 --> 03:04:43,007
You're sitting duck

4106
03:04:44,287 --> 03:04:46,847
I hit 1000 playing in my t-ball league

4107
03:04:47,103 --> 03:04:50,175
So naturally I can bat another thousand

4108
03:04:50,431 --> 03:04:52,223
Playing this minor league shitpost

4109
03:04:52,991 --> 03:04:55,295
Yeah yep cool they're sitting ducks

4110
03:04:57,855 --> 03:04:58,623
Bad actors

4111
03:04:58,879 --> 03:04:59,647
Who are introduced

4112
03:04:59,903 --> 03:05:02,207
Into Alex's face in

4113
03:05:02,975 --> 03:05:06,047
D Michael Jones and Richard Spencer are

4114
03:05:06,559 --> 03:05:08,607
Particular examples of it lately like

4115
03:05:09,375 --> 03:05:12,447
If you did any preparation you would know

4116
03:05:12,959 --> 03:05:13,727
What you were

4117
03:05:13,983 --> 03:05:14,495
Exposing your body

4118
03:05:15,519 --> 03:05:16,031
And

4119
03:05:16,543 --> 03:05:17,055
Alex

4120
03:05:17,823 --> 03:05:18,847
That that's why

4121
03:05:19,359 --> 03:05:21,663
It becomes very difficult and understand where you're coming

4122
03:05:21,919 --> 03:05:22,687
From where it's like there's a

4123
03:05:22,943 --> 03:05:23,455
The plan here

4124
03:05:23,967 --> 03:05:27,807
It becomes very difficult to deny that it appears that there is

4125
03:05:28,319 --> 03:05:29,855
When the behavior seems very consist

4126
03:05:31,135 --> 03:05:32,159
Refuse to be a pattern

4127
03:05:32,415 --> 03:05:33,183
Intuit

4128
03:05:33,439 --> 03:05:33,951
It's hard

4129
03:05:34,207 --> 03:05:35,743
For me to sit here and say like

4130
03:05:36,255 --> 03:05:37,279
Alex is just

4131
03:05:37,791 --> 03:05:39,583
You know he's just bad at this

4132
03:05:39,839 --> 03:05:42,911
Yeah he's inviting these people on like a guy who

4133
03:05:43,423 --> 03:05:47,007
Hates Jews very passionately

4134
03:05:47,263 --> 03:05:50,335
Dispensaries just inviting tomorrow and he's doing a bad job

4135
03:05:50,847 --> 03:05:52,895
It's hard for me to take that position

4136
03:05:53,407 --> 03:05:55,455
And I don't fully take that position

4137
03:05:56,223 --> 03:05:58,527
I only do so because I don't see any

4138
03:05:58,783 --> 03:06:00,831
Like actual hard evidence

4139
03:06:01,087 --> 03:06:01,599
Did this is

4140
03:06:01,855 --> 03:06:02,623
The plan

4141
03:06:04,159 --> 03:06:05,183
Even still

4142
03:06:05,439 --> 03:06:05,951
I can't

4143
03:06:06,207 --> 03:06:07,231
Deny that

4144
03:06:07,999 --> 03:06:14,143
This is kind of what you would do if you were attractive I think that's where we get right back to the

4145
03:06:14,399 --> 03:06:15,167
2013 investor

4146
03:06:16,447 --> 03:06:17,471
I don't

4147
03:06:18,751 --> 03:06:19,519
Functionally

4148
03:06:19,775 --> 03:06:20,799
It is the same

4149
03:06:21,311 --> 03:06:26,687
You know that's one way or the other I mean it's not my job to parse

4150
03:06:26,943 --> 03:06:28,735
How people feel or what they're thinking

4151
03:06:29,503 --> 03:06:30,271
I mean it's

4152
03:06:30,527 --> 03:06:32,831
My Java parts

4153
03:06:33,343 --> 03:06:34,879
That's the difference

4154
03:06:35,903 --> 03:06:38,975
Fair enough I will now advise it

4155
03:06:39,231 --> 03:06:45,375
I take your position entirely as well and in terms of like this function

4156
03:06:45,631 --> 03:06:46,143
Channel difference

4157
03:06:47,167 --> 03:06:47,679
Negligible

4158
03:06:47,935 --> 03:06:48,959
It's not really important

4159
03:06:49,471 --> 03:06:52,287
What the end result is is your presenting

4160
03:06:52,543 --> 03:06:53,311
Hardcore biggie

4161
03:06:53,823 --> 03:06:55,103
Do your audience under the

4162
03:06:55,871 --> 03:06:56,895
Auspices of

4163
03:06:57,407 --> 03:06:59,199
Pretending to push back against

4164
03:06:59,455 --> 03:07:01,759
Explore what they believe

4165
03:07:02,015 --> 03:07:05,343
The same time presenting them in the most positive light imaginable

4166
03:07:05,599 --> 03:07:07,903
The function of that is your Sitting Duck audience

4167
03:07:08,159 --> 03:07:08,671
Is going to

4168
03:07:08,927 --> 03:07:10,463
To think of them in a different way than they

4169
03:07:10,719 --> 03:07:11,231
They might have

4170
03:07:11,487 --> 03:07:15,071
If they were presented based on what they actually believe what they actually die

4171
03:07:15,839 --> 03:07:17,119
So yes I agree with you

4172
03:07:17,887 --> 03:07:20,191
My only quibble is at all like

4173
03:07:22,495 --> 03:07:24,031
From my perspective if he's doing it

4174
03:07:24,287 --> 03:07:24,799
Intentionally

4175
03:07:25,311 --> 03:07:26,079
It does change

4176
03:07:26,847 --> 03:07:27,359
What you should

4177
03:07:27,615 --> 03:07:28,127
You think about Allah

4178
03:07:28,383 --> 03:07:30,431
If your titties doing it acts

4179
03:07:30,687 --> 03:07:31,967
Accidentally and like because he

4180
03:07:33,247 --> 03:07:34,271
White supremacist

4181
03:07:34,527 --> 03:07:35,039
Magoo

4182
03:07:35,295 --> 03:07:36,319
Fumbling through

4183
03:07:36,575 --> 03:07:37,343
His existence

4184
03:07:38,879 --> 03:07:39,391
I mean

4185
03:07:40,159 --> 03:07:40,927
Still looking at me

4186
03:07:41,183 --> 03:07:42,207
Think is pretty bad

4187
03:07:42,463 --> 03:07:43,231
Temperature

4188
03:07:43,487 --> 03:07:48,351
It doesn't excuse his behavior know but I do think there's a different approach you would take in terms of looking at

4189
03:07:49,119 --> 03:07:51,423
Everything is relevant for me

4190
03:07:51,679 --> 03:07:53,983
And it is becoming harder and harder to

4191
03:07:55,775 --> 03:07:59,103
Allow plausible deniability

4192
03:07:59,359 --> 03:08:00,127
I don't I don't know

4193
03:08:00,383 --> 03:08:01,151
I don't know

4194
03:08:01,407 --> 03:08:01,919
I'm mixed

4195
03:08:02,431 --> 03:08:03,967
Yai

4196
03:08:05,247 --> 03:08:06,271
Roi feel like

4197
03:08:06,527 --> 03:08:09,343
It's it's similar a little bit to me to hearing that

4198
03:08:09,599 --> 03:08:10,111
Milo

4199
03:08:10,367 --> 03:08:11,903
Wreck recording of Richard

4200
03:08:12,159 --> 03:08:12,671
Dispenser

4201
03:08:13,183 --> 03:08:13,695
Like

4202
03:08:13,951 --> 03:08:15,487
I don't get I don't care

4203
03:08:16,255 --> 03:08:16,767
I mean

4204
03:08:17,535 --> 03:08:19,839
That is the end result of his white National

4205
03:08:20,095 --> 03:08:24,703
That's part of his white nationalist belief if you just even says I'm a white nationalist

4206
03:08:24,959 --> 03:08:26,495
I don't care if there's a

4207
03:08:27,007 --> 03:08:28,031
Gotcha tape

4208
03:08:28,543 --> 03:08:32,895
He's already revealed that the got your tape is is what he think right but got to take out

4209
03:08:33,407 --> 03:08:34,431
How to tape is implied

4210
03:08:35,711 --> 03:08:37,503
But at the same time it is

4211
03:08:38,015 --> 03:08:43,903
And you shouldn't need that like the New York Times should need that to know that you don't give this f***** a

4212
03:08:44,159 --> 03:08:46,207
Because they were doing that you know and you shouldn't need bread

4213
03:08:46,463 --> 03:08:46,975
Stevens most

4214
03:08:47,487 --> 03:08:50,047
To know that he's a f****** Nazi

4215
03:08:50,303 --> 03:08:52,863
Me too like you don't need all that stuff

4216
03:08:54,143 --> 03:08:54,911
Functional purpose

4217
03:08:55,679 --> 03:08:59,263
As opposed to I'm not going to say that I can prove that at

4218
03:08:59,519 --> 03:09:00,031
Tape like that exist

4219
03:09:01,055 --> 03:09:02,591
But functionally

4220
03:09:02,847 --> 03:09:03,871
It might as well have

4221
03:09:04,383 --> 03:09:05,151
Right right

4222
03:09:05,663 --> 03:09:06,175
You know

4223
03:09:06,687 --> 03:09:08,735
Hybrid

4224
03:09:08,991 --> 03:09:09,759
I think we have

4225
03:09:10,015 --> 03:09:11,039
Similar position

4226
03:09:11,551 --> 03:09:12,575
I'm slightly different

4227
03:09:12,831 --> 03:09:13,343
Places

4228
03:09:14,879 --> 03:09:15,903
Responsibility

4229
03:09:16,415 --> 03:09:18,207
Anyway this was a tragic

4230
03:09:18,463 --> 03:09:19,999
Episode

4231
03:09:20,255 --> 03:09:21,023
I think that

4232
03:09:21,279 --> 03:09:22,303
As we see

4233
03:09:22,559 --> 03:09:24,095
2020 developing

4234
03:09:25,119 --> 03:09:26,655
I wouldn't be surprised if Richard

4235
03:09:26,911 --> 03:09:27,679
Bouncer comes back

4236
03:09:27,935 --> 03:09:30,495
And I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Alex ends up talking

4237
03:09:31,007 --> 03:09:32,799
Irresponsibly with even more

4238
03:09:33,823 --> 03:09:35,359
As as things were all along

4239
03:09:36,639 --> 03:09:40,223
I'm actually going to disagree with you I think I would be surprised if Rich

4240
03:09:40,479 --> 03:09:41,247
Spencer came back

4241
03:09:41,503 --> 03:09:44,063
Not because of anything they talked about but be

4242
03:09:44,319 --> 03:09:44,831
Because

4243
03:09:45,087 --> 03:09:46,367
Alex either

4244
03:09:46,623 --> 03:09:52,767
Is going to recognize that he got his ass roundly handed to him I doubt that he is going to

4245
03:09:53,791 --> 03:09:56,351
I doubt that too

4246
03:09:56,607 --> 03:09:58,399
Entirely dependent on what kind of coverage

4247
03:09:58,655 --> 03:09:59,935
That's probably true

4248
03:10:00,191 --> 03:10:05,311
America gets a lot of new traffic I would assume he's going to keep going down that road

4249
03:10:05,823 --> 03:10:08,383
No I mean like you got

4250
03:10:08,895 --> 03:10:09,919
You gotta a trend

4251
03:10:10,175 --> 03:10:13,247
Growing not good so I don't look forward to

4252
03:10:13,503 --> 03:10:14,271
Where this goes

4253
03:10:14,783 --> 03:10:16,831
But we will be back Jordan

4254
03:10:18,111 --> 03:10:19,135
Yeah

4255
03:10:19,391 --> 03:10:22,207
We have a website and its knowledge

4256
03:10:22,463 --> 03:10:28,607
Girls on Twitter

4257
03:10:28,863 --> 03:10:31,935
Go to iTunes leave a review it said try to go to other

4258
03:10:32,191 --> 03:10:33,471
Castrol apps donate to the

4259
03:10:34,751 --> 03:10:36,799
Yes I will be back

4260
03:10:37,055 --> 03:10:42,943
Until next time I'm Neal I'm Leo I'm dzx Clark and the juiciest

4261
03:10:43,199 --> 03:10:43,711
Bubble

4262
03:10:48,575 --> 03:10:52,159
Alexandra first in color with huge fan I love your work
