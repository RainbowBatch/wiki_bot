And then the other quarter Was A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

64
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,344
So is Mos Def

65
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,744
Hanging around at the moment where they go through the different realities male go poop

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,839
You know they didn't even have any recognition to me referencing Mos Def

67
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
What do you mean

00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,703

00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,591
Of that movie

72
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,663
Today we have an episode to go over

73
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
And all I can

74
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
Can say is

79
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
Protracted litigation

00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,655
Yeah he's back 20 seconds

81
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,679

You was gone that's a good very little to here

83
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,383
From him even to even interview like call-ins or anyting

84
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
Sparse appearances

85
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,455
Give me a lot of stuff

86
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,759
Over that time so I was really excited

87
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
Did the jumping

88
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
Get down to it

89
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
Right we have

90
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,975
Beyond going January 6th Commission

91
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,791
We have

92
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:27,679
Worsening situation with the Uvalde police response

93
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
Absurd

94
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,007
There's a lot that we need to hear what

95
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,639
Got to say about it yeah but it seems kind of obvious to me now that he spent the last two and a half weeks

96
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
Licking toads

97
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,479
The only thing that makes

98
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
Yeah

99
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,087
Could be tripping on a spirit Quest

100
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,207
I'm just going to say this ahead of time because there is no

101
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,231
Reason to

102
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
Tease anybody

103
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,839
He hasn't talked about anything meaningful at all

104
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,399
I was so disappointed

105
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,983
I really hope

106
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,807
In the dark Twilight

110
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:21,439
I really think this is one of my least favorite we had on the show

111
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,975
There's the constant

112
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,511
Push and pull of like

113
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:30,911
Alright he's going to be back

114
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,215

115
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,263
Things on the docket

116
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
And then it's just

117
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
The deflating

118
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
Yep

119
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:44,735
I never like to put out like a under an hour episode even if it was not

120
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,039
P. No you are haunted by it

121
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,111

And then we realized

157
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,319
But maybe something else has been

158
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
Been going on

159
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367

00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423

174
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
Absolute attack

175
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,695
This operation

176
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
The entire country

177
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
Yeah so he's been back

178
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,839
4 days apparently but deleted

179
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
Yeah yeah

180
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,471
So unlikely he had two of their stories

181
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:50,079
This is amazing we need to do with anyone tell the truth ever

182
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,871
No

183
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,967
Turns out my parents are moving out also

184
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,063
Finally can tell the truth

185
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,391
Yeah I don't know what I believe

186
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,463
But Alex's story seems more likely

187
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
I meant Owen Sound

188
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
It's more likely as a

189
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,815
Cover for him

190
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,351
Being back

191
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,423
And is being like a s*** I got to find a way to make this

192
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,447
100%

193
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:21,567
Boat stay afloat or whatever like well I'm sure Alex

194
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
After having

195
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
You told me

196
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,127
To save this

197
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
Will not throw me under the bus

198
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
Tomate immediately

199
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,783
Won't do that immediately nope first thing he doesn't throw up

200
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:37,439
And then the other thing that I really enjoy is he's like yeah I like to thank Owen

201
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:43,583
Great job getting the silent treatment

202
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,935

203
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,079
Buddy buddy

204
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:59,455
Going to the beige is Buddy the billionaire or his wife

205
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
Nope

206
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
The movie star

207
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039

209
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
Nope nope

210
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
I'd like to recast

211
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,487
Gilligan's Island does Infowars

212
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,559
Obvious

213
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,607
Alright so we got

214
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
Then I think that would make

215
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,983
Corsi would have to be the millionaire

216
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:33,247
Super Champ X2 crazy but the professor is wife do I have to turn on the recording whenever they do

Duo

219
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975

220
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
Do professors Rodger Stone

221
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
Okay that makes

222
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,983
He's not rich though

Paul Joseph Watson but this cuz I want to see that silly side I have

228
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:12,159
Your Castor give to see if there is something like this

229
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,951
This is the first time you're casting

230
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:22,143
Robin Williams in a dramatic role I walked your moment of British slapstick

231
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,031
When I was younger

232
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:34,431
I feel like there's just a mr. beams Iditarod

233
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,735
Begging me to come out

234
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,015
Maybe if he was allowed to

235
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,831
Indulgent that then he wouldn't be such a piece of s***

236
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
Yeah

237
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
That is possible

238
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,695
Ironman I guess there aren't really many women

239
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,255
Who don't get fired edit course

240
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:54,655
Plastic Ginger Marianna Marianna

00:12:55,167 --> 00:13:01,311
He's clearly rainbow Snapchatting not there anymore anymore

242
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,871
I would kick those two off the island

243
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Yeah

244
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,687
I mean Savannah Hernandez is around

245
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:12,319
Cannot be an employee at some point

246
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:18,719
Recurring cast no

247
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,815
He's like a recurring like oh my God how did that person fall on the island again

248
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,839
Yeah yeah

249
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,911
All right what was done to the bottom of this I think we've done quite enough

250
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:31,519
How many more minutes do you think we got a few more thoughts

251
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,311
But

252
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,127
Get to them Alex wants to set up a syllabus

253
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
That's what he's going to do for

254
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,687
For the day

255
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,551
And this is because he hasn't prepared s*** he doesn't do anything

256
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,599
He's ill prepared to do the show

257
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
And so he wants to take

258
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
And I intend

259
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,999
The bottom of the hour to give the number of

260
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
Call today

261
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,351

00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,471
You call in on the specific subject

264
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,775
I'm about to lay out which is

265
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,567
How do we defeat the globalist

266
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,127
That's a huge giant subject

267
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,687
You're out of you on that subject

268
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,271
Dolphin emu

269
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:19,135
What is the worst thing they're doing what is the number one thing they're doing we need to stop

270
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,439
Devaluing currencies

271
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
Define the police

272
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
Borders

273
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
Coming after our

274
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,423
War with Russia

275
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,311
Bio weapons

276
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:44,479
Preparing to release new bioweapons they are releasing new by 11th or

277
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
People live

278
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,343
Their bio nanotech

279
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,647
And that is babies

280
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,463
This idea that Alex

281
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,047
Thinks he's being targeted with like what kind of car

282
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
But the two topic

283
00:14:59,327 --> 00:14:59,839
Pixar

284
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:06,239
Do you want to complain about our imaginary enemies doing and what ideas do you have to stop our imaginary enemy

285
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:12,639
Those are so broad, open-ended topics

286
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,599
Be just bring up a topic whatever you want

287
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,439
Add cream storytime our how do we defeat the globos we stopped those

288
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,767
And then they talked about that for the next 45 minutes it does not

289
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
Could be any

290
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,375
It's the silliest props

291
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:40,031
It's just a blank piece of paper basically pretending to be a prompt wouldn't be allowed on an AP exam

292
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,359
Alex is up to

293
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,895
He doesn't is enough

294
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:51,295
Do my job for me is it very interesting way to open our show anything for us to complain about and I

295
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,087
Call rif with you for a little bit

296
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,367
And I will be good

297
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,183
The reason Sports Talk Radio is better than this is

298
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,975
Because it's Sports happens everyday

299
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:05,375
Yeah I don't know what I'm doing today so you guys do and there's things that we are not going to talk about like

300
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,167
Never happened

301
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
Not even hearing

302
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,239
So let's say

303
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
Babies

304
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
And

305
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,687
This is actually kind of scary because Alex has in the past

306
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
Kind of

307
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
Said that that

308
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
Appoint

309
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Edwards

310
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
Which murders

311
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,879
Let's go ahead and start that hot War yeah

312
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
When they come for the baby

313
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
Right

314
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,231
And he also stressed making stuff

315
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,535
Corrupt FDA

316
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
At three different rounds of

317
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
Firings

318
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,751
Because the board would not even authorized

319
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,055
Authorizing his experimental injection

320
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
Do people on

321
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,295
Alburnett boosters

322
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
The dishwasher great

323
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:16,799
So you talked about this story before but just as a refresher course in September 2020 12 ft

324
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,615
Officials resign from the organization over frustration

325
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,407
Administration was

326
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,199
Handling the rollout of booster shot

327
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,039
This was dr. Marion Gruber and her Deputy dr. Philip

328
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
Krause

329
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,183
Their concern wasn't about the boosters being a dangerous conspiracy or anything it was more of an organizational.

330
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:39,071
Dispute with Gruber not agreeing with the white house or the fda's head vaccine officials handling of the

331
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
Situation

332
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,655
Hayden field input was being directed

333
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:46,751
Correct right and that's where all of this stuff happened with nakatomi Plaza

334
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,823
That's the only reality that's behind the

335
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
Entire story that Alex

336
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Does weaving

337
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,223
Two officials resigned in September 2021 and Alex's turned it into a protractor

338
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,039
2 case of removing dissenters from the board over

339
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,111
For the course of multiple rounds of firings Masters

340
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,671
This wasn't even the biggest Reza

341
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,231
Ignatian from the FDA in 2021

342
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:11,327
Back in June advisers resigned over their objection to approving

343
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,143
It was a new Alzheimer's drug

344
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
That they felt wasn't effect

345
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
Yeah

346
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,239
Three people instead of two

347
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
Yeah but that doesn't have the headlines

348
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:23,615
Ends of like oh they're trying to say

349
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:27,199
So there's two things I want to point out about that clip that we listen to

350
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,271
The first is how Alex takes this kernel of Truth

351
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
In this case

352
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,855
Spivak tattoo FDA officials resigned I months ago

353
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:38,975
And then exploit the fact that his audience vaguely remembers that happening to build a gigantic

354
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
Pick narrative on top of

355
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,351
Just about everything he saying he was made up from his storytelling imagine a

356
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
The 2nd

357
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,167
Something I want to bring up his wife

358
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
He's doing this

359
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:54,079
The news item he needs to cover is that the FDA and CDC voted unanimously to approve the covid vaccine

360
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
A children

361
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,895
And Alex needs a way to explain that

362
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:03,807
It's kind of impossible for the argument to be that their well-meaning but misled doctors at this point and the best way to explain to you

363
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,087
Uniformity of their approval

364
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,183
Dissenters were weeded out gradually until this point

365
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
We're the only people left

366
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,255
Committed by a weapon in Susie

367
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
Right

368
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,583
This kind of thing can be important for audience

369
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,607
Control because

370
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,655
If you're Alex you don't want the listener started

371
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
To think about Howard

372
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,007
It's possible for the things Infowars to be saying to be true

373
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,799
Simultaneously

374
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,127
All the official bodies in the world completely disagree

375
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,919
With the story

376
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
Yep

377
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:35,807
Much of the time when you hear a conspiracy theorist a propaganda say something that you know to be untrue

378
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:39,135
It's wise to ask yourself what's motivating them to make that up

379
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:45,535
Sometimes it might just be for no reason but other times you can clearly see the structure of the game they're trying to play

380
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,327
And that reveal some of their priorities

381
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Concerns

382
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
And I think

383
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
You know

384
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
That's

385
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,959
Do that comes out there

386
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,263
Yep yep that one breaks it

387
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,287
Pretty obvious

388
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,359
Hey you know this thing that's

389
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
Listen

390
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,175
I know we're on year 3

391
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,503
Of me trying to pretend that this is not a problem

392
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,831
But I'm going to be honest with you

393
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:16,255
They're all trying to kill us again

394
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
What the f***

395
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Yeah

396
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,351
Yet use this it's cyclical

397
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,375
How many years are

398
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:26,239
Probably few more you're probably right so we got to Alex

399
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,775
You got chemicals on the brain

400
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
And

401
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,079
So he starts talking

402
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,127
Talking about bisphenol-a

403
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,943
That was his favorite chemical again complain about

404
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,735
Plastics

405
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,527
And products like

406
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,695
And give you a massive

407
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
Doetsch

408
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,727
Looks like Marilyn Monroe it makes them look like

409
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,263
Bloated dresses

410
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
So is that the

411
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,823
The most feminine you can get

412
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,615
Walked around the shopping mall

413
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,711
Least you're old enough to remember the girls

414
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,759
Taller than the boys

415
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,720
Tell you all this there are tens of thousands of studies

416
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:24,352
University in medical one of them

417
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,912
Bye

418
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
Design

419
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:33,056
Send the u.s. men and women's height to grown at approximately the same rate 5%

420
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,616
Sorso in the Years between 19

421
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,152
1914 and the Press

422
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,248
In other countries were actually quite variable going in both directions

423
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,064
Women increasing more in some countries and then another

424
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:49,184
This is nothing to do with bisphenol-a but this does reveal an interesting dynamic

425
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:54,048
How it's probably notices taller young women Because he believes that women are supposed to

426
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
To be small

427
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:59,680
He may walk around the mall and see a tall girl that sticks out to him because his ex

428
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,704
Patient events

429
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,984
It's a burden

430
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,384
Instead of asking if his expectations are wrong he stubbornly insisted his biases and gut feelings are reality and then

431
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,408
Women are supposed to be

432
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:15,552
Be small so the fact that this person he saw was tall must mean something is up

433
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,320
6

434
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,344
So there are

435
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,880
Concerned

436
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,464
It's about taking in too much bisphenol-a but they are quite with Alex

437
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
Suggesting

438
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,512
This is one of his classes

439
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
Hyperbole situation

440
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,840
The FDA is done

441
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,936
Constant monitoring of the studies a new research that comes out of a BPA

442
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:36,032
And they found very regularly that low amounts of it could

443
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,568
Theoretically get into food

444
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,616
I ended Asian food packaging

445
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,176
That contains BPA pets

446
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
A safe amount

447
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,480
The reason

448
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:48,576
CPAs in these materials is because it serves as a protective barrier for food

449
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,112
Why do you need this

450
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,416
Well for instance if he comes in

451
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,440
Metal cans

452
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:57,024
The risk of the food being contaminated by the metal itself is a

453
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,048
Much greater risk

454
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:02,912
Oh that makes sense cuz in the past people used to have metal stuff and then they got can

455
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:08,288
Contaminated all the time or liquid or acidic

456
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,592
To bleed to the metal Coronavirus

457
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:17,248
And you end up with food that has a greatly diminished shelf life among other risks sure answer this is General

458
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
Really why

459
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,040
Some packaging has

460
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,112
But a lot of people have forgotten that

461
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
You get a lot of

462
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
Flavor

463
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,208
From

464
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
Exactly

465
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:33,888
Clear that bisphenol-a is as much of a dangerous Alex makes it out to be

466
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
Concerned about it

467
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,680
There are

468
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,008
Fairly easy ways to avoid it with just a little bit of strict

469
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:39,776
Either shopping

470
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,104
If that is something that you prioritize it

471
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,920
I don't think it's the worst thing ever to be like

472
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,688
Hey

473
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,784
I'm going to live a Greener existence or whatever and I'm going to try and avoid

474
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,600
People don't even want to have preserved

475
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,976
Biking I can understand that as long as you're not going too far with a

476
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,256
Like Alex is wearing

477
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,304
Conspiracy to make women big

478
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,912
Yeah there's a part of me with all of those where they are there like this

479
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,192
Chemical is in your stuff

480
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,520
Personally my view on that is

481
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,848
There's really nothing I can do about it if it's bad enough

482
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
People will let me know

483
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,968
You know like I can't know everything about enough chemicals

484
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,064
And I can't know everything about enough not chemicals to think that it's better than

485
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,904
Chemicals I don't know enough of anything about anything

486
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,464
So if you're killing me just let me know

487
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,792
Please have the courtesy

488
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,096
Can I smoke

489
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,632
For years I even stopped

490
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,472
True

491
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,776
Alex might actually be gay

492
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:02,464
I can see Britannic hitting Alex with his hat is nothing

493
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
That is tough

494
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:08,608
So Alex has this complaint about bisphenol-a

495
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:13,728
And there's millions of prestigious studies and hospitals and everything universe

496
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,032
Yeah and so he gets into that

497
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,568
Do you know it's

498
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
Nonsense

499
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:22,176
I tell you all this there are tens of thousands of studies

500
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,528
Prestigious University

501
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,320
Knowing all of this

502
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,368
Bye

503
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
Design

504
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,000
Why do you need that many stuff

505
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:38,816
What they're doing

506
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,096
Fox News

507
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
Adeline

508
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,448
Wrist

509
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,264
Healthy PA says that goes into what it does

510
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,312
Washington Post

511
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,224
Forever chemicals are in name that are given to pfas

512
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,784
Sore / and Polly

513
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,576
Fluor o alcohol substance

514
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,672
Bisphenol-a is not one of these pfas is

515
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,512
There is new information that's been coming out fairly recently that indicates

516
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,584
The pfass are not good at any level

517
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,168
Where is we'd kind of assumed the lower levels of it would be

518
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
Not that bad

519
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,264
And maybe it's not catastrophic

520
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,824
Right they the number of

521
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,456
70 parts per trillion or something would really consider to Safe level

522
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:31,552
So like be the

523
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
The James

524
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,600
It's being

525
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,648
.0

526
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:39,232
000000000 72

527
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:45,888
Point 000000000 infinite repeating chances are it's real bad

528
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,424
Add something

529
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,008
But also the US has been working to phase these out for

530
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
4 years

531
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,872
EPA is a big part of

532
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
Deleting that campaign

533
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,224
Alex's muddying the waters here because he doesn't know the difference

534
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,784
Prince between BPA and pfass

535
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,320
He also knows that the audio

536
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,392
Doesn't know the difference so articles

537
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,416
Can be presented as

538
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,720
Prestigious studies about a separate chemical

539
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
And it doesn't

540
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
Matter

541
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,072
The goal of spreading fear is still achieve and no one

542
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,864
No one will be the wiser

543
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,912
I would say that

544
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:24,032
Instantaneously the moment you say there have been studies at every major university

545
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
Bat bags

546
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
The question

547
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,616
Why

548
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,920
What is it about this Saturday

549
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
Sure but I mean

550
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,784
So was like 50 major universities are done with it

551
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
But f******

552
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:39,392
The University of Wichita I still like god dammit I don't believe these

553
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
Motherfukers for a second

554
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,720
We're going to get Dave

555
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,536
The one guy that we have who does this s***

556
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,864
To run his own double-blind study can I ask you a question

557
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,656
What's bigger than 50

558
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,216
Do you want

559
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,752
What's bigger than 51

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
2

561
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,056
That's

562
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:00,384
You can always have more prestigious study

563
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,664
Doesn't make a difference

564
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:09,088
Suspicious than anything else in the history of the world

565
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:13,184
I mean we've been doing this a long time and I know that you know that Alex is just making this up

566
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,584
Know when called to prevent studies get a Fox News article

567
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,656

568
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,424

Harvard

571
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,496
Stanford

572
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:30,848
You name it University of California and so

573
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,872
Computer universe

574
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,408
Eastern Illinois

575
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,688

576
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
Is Liars

577
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:42,112
I could see so much as being like what let's try and recreate those results

578
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:45,952
Yeah and then you get 50 people doing that

579
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:49,536
EBay tell buddy.

580
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,864
So this is a longer clip

581
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,424
But it's talking about like how he needs

582
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,448
To stay on air

583
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,520
And it's just it's a it's a little bit of a ride

584
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:02,848

I'm in modern

592
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:39,456
There's a small part of me that thought because of the way he's building this up and he's like all right I'm just going to do this now

593
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,992
Begin to talk about

00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:46,112
Infowars

595
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,416
Basically the main

00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,976
It doesn't matter it's not what happened

598
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,192
Populism

599
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,728
Fierce People waking up

Shut us down in silence

603
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,760
False allegations of straw man

604
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,808
And they can

605
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,600
Demon eyes

606
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,184

Mobilizer

609
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,888

Neutralize

611
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:36,800

Unified dislike of him

613
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,736
Benjamin Netanyahu

00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,576
Falling apart

615
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,112

Yesterday

617
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,888
Keisha unifier of the populist movement

618
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,704
Can also be used

619
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,496
Energize opposition

620
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,800
Infowars

621
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,824
He's good at UniFi

622
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,360
Populous

623
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,408
Infowars

624
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,760
You can use it as a weapon against

625
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,904
Everybody

626
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,440
Party done all this

627
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
My work is done

628
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:31,072
Because

629
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,608
False

630
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,992
Products that I used my God

631
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
It was

632
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:54,368
It was all a plug it was all going there I knew it without their eyes

633
00:31:54,624 --> 00:32:00,768
I felt it happening I felt the moment it was going to happen and then when it did happen I was still like I can't

634
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,584
Holy morning

635
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,984
All just a rationalization for why you need to buy his s*** that's all I've heard him

636
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,824
A million times that he's achieved his mission

637
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,128
He's ready to die the Odelay

638
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,432
Do you think it's too late for the globalist

639
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,504
The Awakening at as happened and he has done his part

640
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,552
Like I should quit tomorrow

641
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,368
I'm ready to do it no no no no

642
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,024
He has to stay on air because if he doesn't then a fake version of him will be created in order to demonize the Patriot movie

643
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,792
What it is

644
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,328
It's about protect

645
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
Sing the rap

646
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,376
That's what it is

647
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,680
You know you got it I'm going brown

648
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,240
With my reputation intact

649
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,056
You you guys need to know here

650
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:45,824
Dunedin

651
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,360
I've done my work

652
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,408
And now from now on

653
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:56,064
This is all just fundraising and and me getting mad about

654
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,600
People talking s*** about me

655
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:02,208
It is him very like you just said listen the only reason we're on air

656
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,256
Is just so they can't f*** this up when we're gone

657
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:09,376
Don't use me to attack Trump or DeSantis or whatever

658
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,424
I'm just here as a placeholder so

659
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,752
Give me money till I'm able to stay doing that list

660
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,288
Protected my own image

661
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:21,408
Good protect your own image to who let the people who are already listening to you

662
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,432
It's a lot like

663
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,504
Whenever Netanyahu was running apart

664
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:29,600
You know and people were like we don't want him in here anymore that's a lot like Trump

665
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,624
Because people don't like a part

666
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,904
Right

667
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
Isn't it

668
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
It wasn't like

669
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,488
Mass disapproval of

670
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,512
People it was like

671
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:40,352
Corruption scandals more apartheid

672
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
Yep

673
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,192
So look there's big news haha

674
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,472
This actually is

675
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,288
Alex has more to promote them

676
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,824
Then just as standard bullsh

677
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,360
Okay this

678
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,128
Nelly

679
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,968
Very successful filmmaker

680
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,248
In her own right

681
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,064
Great filmmakers as well

682
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:07,232

685
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560

00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,464
Has a lot of backing

695
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,352
She brought some tears to my eyes but

696
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,704
Here's the first trailer

697
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,496
Infowars.com

698
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,312
Scott Adams

699
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,616
The well-known guy what

700
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,896

Play the trailer in the comments back

703
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,832
Imallexx

704
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,136
You're about to see is true

705
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,672
This is reality

706
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
Queens

707
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,720
Stranger Than Fiction

708
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:17,376
The most medium person in the world

709
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:20,704
He's a performance artist

710
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,544
I need to know about house thorough this documentary about Alex is

711
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,848
This is the first time I'd heard about it

712
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:33,248
This is the first time I'd heard about his well I don't think I'm entitled to be in every Alex related piece of media but I do think that if

713
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:36,832
You're a documentary filmmaker is trying to make a balance documentary about Alex

714
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,392
Stunad contact me

715
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:45,280
Yeah I've been doing a show about him for over 5 years I've watched more of his stupid show then just let anybody on Earth

716
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:49,888
And I've been cited in multiple published books and news articles about Alex

717
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,544
Without sounding too Conceited the fact that I'm not in this documentary is a red flag that this isn't a documentary

718
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,848
The puff piece about Alex

719
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,872
This trailer

720
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,688
Definitely makes it seem like a white boy

721
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:09,344
Alex Moore he's a filmmaker whose most notable work is 2020s TFW no GF

722
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,136
Feeling with no girlfriend

723
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:15,232
It's a documentary

724
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:21,888
Summer criticized by film of covering the subject matter irresponsibly and I would say that all indications are that this is

725
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,912
Even more so

726
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
This is

727
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
Wow

728
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:29,056
Yeah it's not ego and in fact it might be more the most

729
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,080
Indictment

730
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,360
Ends of your character that

731
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,384
There could be that

732
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:36,480
If you're making a documentary and you don't involved and then your urine

733
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,760
You're just insane

734
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,808
Extra sketches crazy

735
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,088
We got plenty of emails

736
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:46,208
Will say no problem

737
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,744
Or maybe

738
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,864
I might have said no to this

739
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,936
My daughter wanted to be involved

740
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,472
Popcorn Time

741
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:00,800
I think it is indicative of a lack

742
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,408
Interest in the topic of interest in seeing both sides

743
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,456
Quite frankly I think that

744
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,040
The number of the criticisms in the information that we provide

745
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,392
Disgust is not what the normal criticisms of Alex r

746
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:19,744
The normal criticism that he gets are very easily deflected by him

747
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,840
And that will probably be the extent of the

748
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
Both sides

749
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,168
Better going to be in the documentary

750
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,448
Will be about his

751
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
Very

752
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,520
L istorie and career lying

753
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,312
Constantly Weathersby

754
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,872
Making stuff up on air

755
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:39,200
From Reading headlines and decided he knows what the story is

756
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,528
Clear clear pattern

757
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,296
Of

758
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,600
Very very racist

759
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,904
Coverage of stories

760
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
Discount Tire

761
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,208
Kind of stuff that's not going

762
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
Tubi

763
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:54,048
Then I going to be covered

764
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:54,816
B flip

765
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,656
Sloppily about various stories

766
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,704
No I mean

767
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,496
Here's here's the thing okay

768
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:05,568
Here's a story of a illegal immigrant

769
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,128
Who found a gun after it has gone off

770
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:08,896
And killed some

771
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:14,784
That's the after he picked it up but

772
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
It wasn't his gun

773
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,136
And here's how Allie

774
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,160
Discovered it

775
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,720
That would be a very simple and short documentary

776
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:27,840
And that's the end of what you really needed absolutely

777
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,864
Coverage of

778
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,400
A racist

779
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:35,520
It's against a non-white person and the way Alex will justify it and be like

780
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
Yep

781
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,432
Going through houses and stuff

782
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:46,528
Racist violence is wrong now there's a reason for This Racist to be racist

783
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:50,624
Right and then you have the coverage of like the Kate steinle

784
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,160
And

785
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:52,928
How he

786
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,488
Made up a story about how this

787
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:59,584
Undocumented immigrants saw this white woman that was so beautiful

788
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,656
And he was so mad that he couldn't be with her so you have murdered her

789
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
Like it

790
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,728
F****** insane

791
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,800
Stuff that needs to be the counter

792
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
Bailing for

793
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,872
In the documentary about Alex

794
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,944
It doesn't need to be like he's a fake character

795
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,344
Or like telling the truth

796
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,392
Too much of the truth about who he really is

797
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,440
Bebe

798
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,744
I think it's almost irrelevant

799
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,096
Victorville weather

800
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,656
He is or is not anything in his heart

801
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:41,568
What he's done what ya the product that he is put out is a certain way and he Bears responsibility for that

802
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:46,944
And that's that's the reason that you can't even put that one example in the night cuz if you're trying to both sides that.

803
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,736
Scale example

804
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,272
So far down like

805
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,808
Oh and now he's

806
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,088
See they called McCloud

807
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,624
No he's a racist

808
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:59,488
Things like the making up operation locked

809
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:04,864
Totally unreal thing that we're talking about

810
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,424
Things you see in memes

811
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,240
B******* like clips from his deposition

812
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,288
Yep it's

813
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,568
I don't know

814
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,640
I will Reserve judgment cuz I obviously haven't

815
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,432
Seen this documentary

816
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:23,552
Text tears I think your judgment is pretty well it is Alex's promoting it it's

817
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,368
Not going to be something that is

818
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,392
Is that worth

819
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,160
The Damned

820
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
But

821
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,464
We will be covering it

822
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,792
I know

823
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,608
Moyer's going to really wish she did is they contact

824
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:40,704
To do a boy

825
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,008
And this guy

826
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,800
That's a weird weird thoughts

827
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,104
Alex women

828
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,128
Volume

829
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,920
And speak

830
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,456
All manners of evil against

831
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,480
Call sleep.

832
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,624
That you have become in the United States

833
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
America

834
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,184
People are

835
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,960
Place where no one

836
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,008
Event

837
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,288
Ashamed

838
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,080

00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,152
Chilling on your show

You're not you're not hiding the fact

842
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,272
Figured you're a flawed human being

843
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,344
You're really defeating them

844
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,160
From them the only weapon that they have

845
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,464
To use against you in that sure

846
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,632
That's not nearly the only weapon wow wow if you think that's the only weapon we've got my friend

847
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
Yeah little boy

848
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,448
Ashamed

849
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,728
Of the things that he

850
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,776
These quote-unquote telling on himself about

851
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:50,080
That shame and unprocessed

852
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,128
Just feeling videos surrounding that guides

853
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,919
A ton of his emotional out

854
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,711
Amazon air

855
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,247
Like this is this is

856
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,039
Premises

857
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,319
What Alex does

858
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:06,975
Just off yeah you remember all those times or he's been like

859
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,303
That's the shame for being

860
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,119
Himself coming out

861
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,655
Because he's a failure

862
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,471
In every meaningful sense and he understands that but

863
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,495
But he does like money

864
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:24,895
Or the the fill your hand Adam shift holding rant have many a number of years

865
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:28,479
My dog died

866
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,527
Yeah it's so Furious and drunk

867
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,831
3 hours on are talking about

868
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,647
Crystal skulls covered in jizan I had to do

869
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,719
Alex gets another call

870
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,743
Oh yeah

871
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,767
This person bike

872
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,303
I don't think the

873
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,863
Necessarily anything

874
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,655
But their existence isn't

875
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,983
John and I are welcome

876
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,127

And man you've been buried

879
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,015
On on my life and I know so many others and

00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,855
I really missed you last week hope you got some

881
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
How is

882
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,671
Is it possible that you could

883
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:11,231
Start listening within the last year I think

884
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:11,999
Betty's on

885
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,023
Something

886
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:17,119
I have a certain amount of empathy for people have been listening for like 5

887
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:20,703
1520 years ago

888
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,727
There was a time

889
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,287
Yeah you could trick yourself into thinking like

890
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,103
This is the same show I used to

891
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,151
Or whatever like

892
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,735
At least pretended to be covering more serious issues in the past

893
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:36,575
I got so like if you started a year ago what the f*** is your problem

894
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,415
What do you hear

895
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:43,231
You know like what is it that you listen to that like click

896
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,023
It's inside your brain that makes you go

897
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:45,791
This

898
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,583
3 hour

899
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,375
Self-love

900
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:53,727
Not often love

901
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,031
Bvsmp

902
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
Yeah it's

903
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,359
So it's something that I find

904
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,383
Amazing

905
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,175
I don't I don't know how that's possible

906
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,479
I think it's

907
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247
Scary

908
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,087
I don't know how bad my life would have

909
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:09,855
Have to be

910
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,135

I mean but

914
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,911
You know content-wise

915
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,959
But it's just not entertaining it's it's

916
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:25,983
F******

917
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,775
It's so boring

918
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,567
Rhea is dumb

919
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,591
True

920
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,919
Screw Alex never tries to recast Gilligan's Island

921
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:42,111
He doesn't have his much Whimsy only weapon the people can use against us that's true

922
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:48,767
Call are really sure but he has a story about wearing

00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,791
Alex

00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,327

941
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,071

What was this like

950
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,223
15 years ago

951
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,551
There is a moment where I really believe Karen L looked at me

952
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,575
And it was like

953
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,855
That's really cool

954
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,879
Now I didn't happen

955
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,159
Or whatever who cares

956
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,183
Right doesn't matter

957
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:54,815
But if that moment of my life where I was idolizing one of the most amazing Rock

958
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,351
Stars of our era

959
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,119
Right

960
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,655
Where instead transposed

00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,215
To Donald Trump jr.

962
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,799
I would be very very sad sure

963
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,591
Horrendously awful

964
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,895
When I was living in Colombia

965
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,271
Me and my brother were front-and-center

966
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,879
I got a high five from Ghostface

967
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,487
It was like. Junior was talking

968
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:28,863

969
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,191
Dammit

970
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,495

00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,871
This shirt

973
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,175
What I hear about this

974
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:47,295
You a rockstar at a very specific place

975
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,087
Like a trump shirt

976
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:54,207
It makes me so hot done Junior can't take his eyes off me my friend

977
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,487
Oh my God

978
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:58,559
Alex does I think he's come up with a branding

979
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,607
Opportunity

980
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,167
You want to see what it's like to be outshone

981
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,447

Police shirts

984
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,295
Because you're going to be off shelves that point

985
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,575
Usher

986
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,623
Adventure for yourself

987
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:29,279
I think he's trying to bring the shirt as an adventure more than anybody is ever sold

988
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:33,631
Mister Ed

989
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,167

This is an Avenue of pitch

993
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,759
That he couldn't take without

994
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,527
The caller

995
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,575
Hey listen

996
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,111

998
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,415
Cuz that would suck stupid

999
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:00,767
Oh my God

1000
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:07,167
You'll feel just like me so persecuted it's so cool

1001

00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:16,895
This is just

1003
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,663
The brand new

1004
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:24,831
The last caller brought up how he warned Alex Jones Is Right shirt in the adventure of the evening announced

1005
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,391
It's a lot of meat on this phone

1006
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,023
Let you know how awake

1007
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,559
Humanity is in your area

1008
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,351
You could wear one in

1009
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:43,263
R1 in red areas

1010
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,079
Chose

1011
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:51,199
The globalist are and how we can win together if we just stand up

1012
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,479
Also you might get stabbed

1013
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:59,391
If we just stand up together and people where my merchandise

1014
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,671

Alex Jones Is Right shirt

1020
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:10,911
You know what I'm saying

1021
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
It's

1022
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,007
I mean it's not necessarily a fatal stabbing

1023
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,543
That's fair

1024
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,591
Good

1025
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,615
Could ruin the shirt

1026
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,943
But that's good for Alex

1027
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,247

Yeah

1030
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:31,391
It almost works better if people have a more negative response to it

1031
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,439
Jeans with the knees already

1032
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,767
You've got a Nightfall with you

1033
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:44,191
Every every shirt they sell comes with a pack of stitches

1034
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,263
Comes with like a Band-Aids

1035
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,567
Blood transfusion

1036
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,151

It's about how to win

1042
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,303
I've got three things

1043
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,095
My mind

1044
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,655
It's hard to answer your question because they're all important

1045
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,679
Justice

1046
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,215
You need to get rid of the DA's

1047
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,031
Bi that's not doing his job

1048
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,567
These people had a fear of

1049
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:24,127
Houston they wouldn't keep doing that things like

1050
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,687
Spraying chemicals on releasing things

1051
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:30,271
Number two

1052
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,575
Phone companies

1053
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,599
Bad breakup

1054
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,415
Me to bring back.

1055
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,951
Truth in advertising rules

1056
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,279
I think we need to deal with the education

1057
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,863
Acting schools,

1058
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,655
Sam's teach the truth not

1059
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,679
Propaganda

1060
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,215
Weather Wonder

1061
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,519
Motorola G3

1062
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,103
I don't know but in my mind

1063
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,943
The rules and laws we have

1064
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,223
Before

1065
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,039
Keep doing what they're doing

1066
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,087
I like to try and find some Middle Ground

1067
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:11,231
All agree that maybe some big media conglomerates should be broken up like Sinclair

1068
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:13,535
Not a hard sell on my

1069
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,583
Hey break up large media Corporation

1070
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:21,983
Not destructive I think maybe that

1071
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,543
Bangla newspapers

1072
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,823
Yeah let's let's

1073
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,151
Diffuse that a little bit I do think that this guy I wouldn't want to

1074
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,943
Team up with that project

1075
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:38,367
Also truth-in-advertising rules still exist a reason that you get the letter from like some

1076
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:43,231
Somebody changes I don't f****** to paste

1077
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:46,303
Specifically true that advertise the girls still exist

1078
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,887
Thing he wants is more truth out

1079
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:56,543
Schools at the bad idea and then I want them to regulate the supplement industry

1080
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:02,687
I think it's dude just mad at the FBI because of January 6th

1081
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:07,807
Cuz they're investigating conspirators

1082
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:12,927

00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,399
True

1088
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,679

00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:22,815
Troubling

1109
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,607

00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:31,263

00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:52,255
Is pretty lucky

1119
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,303
In terms of that timer

1120
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:58,655

We're really excited for the film

1124
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,591
I said to look through the people who their host there

1125
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,615
Following

1126
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,895
Here's some of the notable names

1127
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,175
Alex's wife

1128
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,455
Mike cernovich

1129
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,479
Michael malice

1130
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,759
How's the Red Scare

1131
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:16,319
Documentary propaganda

1132
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:20,415
Superman turned

1133
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,951
Sure Paul Joseph Watson

1134

Jim Dale

1140
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:37,311
There's just a murderer's row of shitbags on there

1141
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,847
Pizzagate veterans

1142
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:41,151
How how long how

1143
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:41,919
How are they

1144
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:44,223
Man they're still around

1145
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:49,087
I'm not optimistic that this is going to be an actual in-depth documentary look at Alex's career because

1146
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:52,159
If it were Alex would never have agreed to be in it and promote

1147
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:55,231
Professional and personal tracker

1148
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,791
Go to being in a bear sing liar I don't believe

1149
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,071
We'll be hearing about it on it

1150
00:54:59,327 --> 00:54:59,839
Absolutely

1151
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,631
But are you welcome

1152
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,191
Albuquerque

1153
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:10,591
I'm going to keep my mind open don't let Lucy put that f****** football down dad

1154
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,151
Lucy walking up with the football and hanges

1155
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,967
Rubbing it gently with a nice little cloth making

1156
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:19,039
I'm sure it's all nice and smooth

1157
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:21,599
I don't think that I need to be in

1158
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,367
NFL

1159
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,671
The point

1160
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,207
That are important

1161
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:30,047
Bring up that I would bring up our things that should be in the film

1162
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:36,703
Documentary about Alex will be lacking if these things were thin it would be perfectly happy if anybody else

1163
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:39,007
Springs those and I don't know that somebody doesn't

1164
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:42,847
So I will I will Reserve judgment until that point but also

1165
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,919
I can't believe that Alex would be a part of

1166
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,687
Something

1167
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,479
That would just

1168
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,015
Have the critiques

1169
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,295
That that that

1170
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:53,087
Need to be back

1171
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:53,855
Looks not

1172
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:56,671
Beat around the bush

1173
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:59,487
Moyer that I mean the number of how not to

1174
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:02,047
To cover Alex Jones episodes we've done kind of

1175
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:02,815
It suggests that

1176
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:07,935
There is a responsibility Gap all across the board whenever it's covering Alex Jones for the most part

1177
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:12,287
Sure it's a concept is there in terms of like

1178
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:15,615
He goes on Rogan and they get like a ton of people watching

1179
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:20,223
It does Stephanie gets attention to the people who have him on

1180
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,551
Flagrant good numbers

1181
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,575
And all this s***

1182
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,879
You could

1183
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:31,231
Reasonably assume your documentary-maker like a big new documentary about Alex

1184
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,511
Tubi

1185
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:36,095
Yeah would be something lucrative

1186
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,655
People who get a lot of it

1187
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,447
I think

1188
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,727
Vet

1189
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,799
You know if you were able to time it right around when the Sandy Hook trials

1190
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,079
What's going on

1191
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,103
Good idea certainly

1192
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,127
It'll be a topic

1193
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:50,431
Conversation that a lot of people are interested

1194
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:53,247
But you also have to know that if you watch

1195
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,551
His appearances on things like Rogan

1196
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:59,391
He's only going to be involved in stuff that doesn't involve heavy pushback

1197
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,207
He can sort of be in control

1198
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:04,511
More or less of the entire

1199
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,535
The entire situation

1200
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,303
Absolutely

1201
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,399
You're never going to be able to get him in a lie Carol Morris style like

1202
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,423
Give

1203
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,983
Type of documentaries

1204
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,263
Absolute

1205
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,311
Confirmation that Alex had milk

1206
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,847
Control over whether or not

1207
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,615
Something woodwind

1208
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:24,223
You know what I'm saying like they didn't film something of Alex

1209
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
It's that Alex Wood

1210
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,807
Want to be in the documentary and then

1211
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:28,831
Be like

1212
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,879
Hey let's just put this in without telling

1213
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,415
That didn't happen

1214
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,695
Certainly.

1215
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,255
So we got another another caller here

1216
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:39,327
Idea about what the most

1217
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,607
Important thing is for the

1218
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,375
Infowar

1219
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:42,655
Most important

1220
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:46,751
Read the word

1221
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,031
Listen to

1222
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,311
Warriors spread

1223
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,079
Read the word

1224
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,103
Videos

1225
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,127
Or you guys

1226
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,407
I just try to keep

1227
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,687
Keep breaking fruity Fran

1228
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,711
Family

1229
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,735
It may take

1230
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:58,783
May not feel like it

1231
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,063
Gotten anywhere but we have

1232
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:06,975
Screw the most important thing in the fight against the globalist is promoting Alex giving money to Alex and alienating people in your

1233
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:09,023
Your life who might be able to help you see

1234
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,303
That this s*** is no good

1235
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,839
I mean Daddy

1236
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:14,143
That is how that is how you do it

1237
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,679
Gases how you f***

1238
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,471
Go from

1239
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,519
That's absolutely no I mean if

1240
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,287
You want

1241
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
Give audience

1242
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,615
Then you literally make them your captain

1243
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,895
And have the

1244
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,175
Believe that the only way to

1245
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:26,943
To save

1246
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,967
Don't world

1247
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,015
Is to promote you

1248
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:30,783
That's a

1249
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,063
That's amazing

1250
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,879
That's like the most evil wait-listed hey

1251
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:35,903
I know you

1252
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,671
Do you want

1253
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:37,951
Try

1254
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,231
Some f****** lucky charm

1255
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:41,023
But if you don't eat Kix

1256
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:43,071
Everyone you know will die

1257
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,959
That's one way to do it

1258
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:51,007
It's weird sales pitch

1259
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,943
Just work enough that it doesn't matter

1260
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,223
People just

1261
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:07,135
Stay in the pattern do you know people are social animals and when they stop feeling social and then they start

1262
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:07,903
To try and find

1263
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,695
And social.

1264
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,743
Trapped in the self-worth

1265
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:12,511
Yada yada

1266
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:16,863
So I've been watching the Jigger e-cig

1267
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,143
Exclamation

1268
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,471
Thursday

1269
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:24,287
But I'm going to have to referee record

1270
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,591
But the prior was

1271
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,871
Really really

1272
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,919
Hard

1273
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:33,503
They interviewed the ballot workers OD'd

1274
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:35,551
The poll workers were counting ballots

1275
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:38,111
It's in Georgia or mother

1276
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,135
Who had been

1277
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,695
Singled out by the right-wing media

1278
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,743
And one of the things that was

1279
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,767
Particularly distasteful

1280
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,535
It's all about it

1281
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:49,631
I'm obviously the stories of how it affected their lives and how they

1282
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,655
You know basically

1283
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:51,935
AR

1284
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:54,239
Afraid of their own names now

1285
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,287
Terrifying

1286
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,615
Really I think is the resonant image

1287
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,407
For me is Rudy Giuliani

1288
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:03,199
And his behavior surrounding

1289
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,223
That

1290
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:07,807
Yeah and the way he put a Target on Zapped

1291
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:12,671
Racist weighs about

1292
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:16,767
And this next clip

1293
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:21,119
Let's go talk to Derek in Virginia

1294
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,423
Hey how you doing Alex

1295
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,495
Hey I'm you know I was wondering

1296
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,383
State

1297
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,687
Selecting Rudy Giuliani

1298
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:35,967
Attorney General

1299
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:40,831
Attorney general I don't believe he would have had Russia

1300
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,879
I don't believe we would have had Ukraine

1301
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,159
I don't believe it would have had

1302
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,951
WrestleMania

1303
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:53,887
Mistake I believe in no one wants to admit that but

1304
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,447
Gravis

1305
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,727
Mistakes

1306
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:01,055
3 Giuliani would have been a lot better

1307
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:04,127
Attorney general than that then the other two yet

1308
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:09,759
I mean yeah disagree but yeah

1309
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:13,343
The idea was consolidating power and all that s***

1310
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,903
Somebody who look like you would be as

1311
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:18,719
Corrupt as they come but then he ended up work using himself

1312
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:23,071
Okie doke close yeah he chose the guy who was famous

1313
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:26,655
For doing the one thing that he did not do that one time

1314
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:31,519
Yeah I mean like this color is correct I mean Rudy would have gone along with any

1315
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:38,175
He would either does he would have helped overthrow all sorts of s*** really feel like what

1316
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,455
What would have really helped

1317
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,479
Cuz if you just over

1318
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,503
The government

1319
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:48,927
Why do you got to go overthrow the government I mean I think that's what store roads have been saying for years

1320
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,207
Not just a pack

1321
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:51,743
This

1322
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,279
Said it

1323
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,839
Yourselfin age

1324
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:57,887
Rudy Giuliani up there

1325
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,167
Anyways 2024

1326
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:02,239
I just need to

1327
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,263
Remind everyone

1328
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,311
Infowars Canon

1329
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,591
According to the story

1330
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:10,175
Rudy Giuliani was instrumental in covering up 911

1331
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,479
So Alex shouldn't never

1332
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:14,015
Be interested in like

1333
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:18,623
Water under the bridge Tower Bridge

1334
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:21,695
None of this has any kind of staying power

1335
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:24,255
These storylines don't mean anything tomorrow

1336
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,303
It's pathetic

1337
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:32,703
But it's what happens whenever you live in like movie Worlds the shifting alliances make things fun you know like all of this

1338
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:34,751
Why is my enemy and we're fighting but we also respect

1339
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:37,823
Maybe later on we'll be on the same team and I like that old bull

1340
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,127
Palace intrigue

1341
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:43,967
Yeah there's an episodic nature to fix

1342
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,759
You know like

1343
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:50,367
Maybe one Sherlock Holmes mystery doesn't necessarily affect your other one

1344
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:53,695
Continuity between them

1345
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,231
Right right

1346
01:02:55,487 --> 01:03:01,631
Exit some of Alex's bulshit Works in that way we did 9/11 to

1347
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:04,191
Start at to the Death Star

1348
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:04,959
Right

1349
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,007
And then later on you find out he's

1350
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,287
He's a good guy so why not

1351
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:19,807
Blonde

1352
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,367
Okay

1353
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:28,767
Close your eyes members

1354
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:35,167
Maybe something was revealed that it was a false flag or something like that later Star Wars movie

1355
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:35,935
Okay

1356
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:36,959
That's a relief

1357
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,751
It's all good so callers have to go

1358
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,799
They're getting replace

1359
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:45,151
Leo zagami

1360
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:49,759
Try to get your calls I appreciate you calling in

1361
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,487
Okay buddy

1362
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,023
Alright I get it

1363
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:03,327
More things we need to buy from you

1364
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,119
Is he

1365
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:08,191
Wellington like that few months

1366
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:14,591
Got surgery and was in a wheelchair

1367
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,383
Stepping down

1368
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:21,503
But I don't think a lot of that is very official

1369
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:26,367
He's got the pope is going to step down

1370
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,671
Stop I was like what the hell is he doing

1371
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,951
It clicked in my head yeah

1372
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:33,279
Now layout as we know we know a lot about Leo's history

1373
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,583
May or may not

1374
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,655
But it's funny to imagine that he does when he says something like that

1375
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,727
Illuminati

1376
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,263
Whistleblower

1377
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,591
What a time to be alive Leo

1378
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:50,175
How you do all this years ago

1379
01:04:55,807 --> 01:05:00,415
If Alex knew Julio zagami was

1380
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:02,719
20 years ago then he would know about

1381
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:09,119
Alright alright BJ We Are Young

1382
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:12,703
He would have been

1383
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:15,775
The leader of the Church of Matrix ism

1384
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:22,175
Is goal was to start the new Holy Roman Empire and overthrow Christianity

1385
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:24,991
Is I'm the only real religion in the world row

1386
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:29,087
He was Jesus

1387
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:35,487
Did 9/11 single-handedly although he worked with Osama bin Laden

1388
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:36,255
You got to have Fred

1389
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:42,143
He went to the Vatican and they said

1390
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:47,263
That's right they were like holyshit Leo

1391
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:51,103
How do you know so much is also said like

1392
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:52,383
Wewo

1393
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,431
It's too much used to Good Taste too good

1394
01:05:55,455 --> 01:06:00,319
Yeah I mean the Messiah is on Infowars right now and that were

1395
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,855
Treating a poorly because he has

1396
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,135
Come into his power yet

1397
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,415
That's the problem

1398
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:06,719
The naysayers early on

1399
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:09,023
Write our retribution will be Swift and so

1400
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:09,791
Severe I'm sure

1401
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:11,327
420

1402
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:17,983
You didn't know you know s*** about this guy until until he came into your life a couple years ago you dumb

1403
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,263
Play fuk how f******

1404
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,311
The Pope's going to resign

1405
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,615
There is not much left to this

1406
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,639
Papacy.

1407
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:27,967
Probably probably end in August

1408
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:33,599
Before that

1409
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:35,903
Because

1410
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,951
He of course you wanted to wait

1411
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,631
About it

1412
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,167
I like

1413
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,447
This

1414
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,727
You know we've been

1415
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:54,591
Saying that he's going to resign for a while and he's been resisting cuz he's waiting for ratzinger.

1416
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:57,407
So I think that would being applied

1417
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,175
Here is that

1418
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:03,039
He wants to wait till ratzinger's that's the right thing or doesn't become a pope again exactly

1419
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:03,807
Implied here

1420
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:08,415
I think I think Leo is warmer Pope's of the understudy of living folks

1421
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,695
I think Leo

1422
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,975
He's not saying this

1423
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,511
Cuz I think it would be insane

1424
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,279
To say out loud

1425
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,327
But I do believe Leo thinks that

1426
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,095
The Pope

1427
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,655
That if he dies before Christmas

1428
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,679
Singer he's going to

1429
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,447
Hit the folks

1430
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,127
That guy

1431
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,151
Right on my heels

1432
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:32,479
Covid-19

1433
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:37,599
Papers.co P continuity

1434
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:43,999

I can find it at the fish hope emeritus

1436
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:57,055
Oh wait wrong with this serious stuff today we need to be considerate

1437
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:00,127
Disparition

1438
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:02,943
Prophesied

1439
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,247
Long time ago yeah

1440
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:10,367
Operation of the Holy Mary

1441
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:16,767
Moscow

1442
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:19,839
Will be the beginning of the end for mankind

1443
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:41,087
I accepted my segments

1444
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:44,927
Portable food is essential

His natural diet I said to him doing a weird Italian

1454
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,359
Pitch accent is like

And I forgot my throat of a food right here it's like whoa that's not okay bad just happened there

Don't know if I text as much of a difference is you

01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,767
Scouts of the beginning of the end

Virgin Mary

1466
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,919
Prophecies turns into a

1467
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:40,223
A chance to sell f****** dehydrated

1468
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:40,991
Good food

Putting the pope on my back and carrying him to Moscow tomorrow let's f******

1475
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:54,815
Can do this

1478
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:07,871
You're supposed to accidentally stumble into it over with man

01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,151
That's what I'm saying

1480
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:14,015

1484
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,279
Haha

1485
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:32,191
$20

1486
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:36,799
Figuring out what a weird coin

1487
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:38,847
20 euros

1488
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,383
Imagine that

1489
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,967
And on top of

1490
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:48,063
Of course

1491
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,599
Texas season

1492
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,951
Do you want are also linked with the elect

1493
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:57,279
Technological world

1494
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,047
End

1495
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,423
Demons with

1496
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,447
Chile

1497
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:07,263
Even sending messages

1498
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:11,615
Incredible

1499
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:15,455
My area

1500
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,503
Ecstasies of this facility

1501
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,367
This is troubling

1502
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,647
Demons can text

1503
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,695
Oh no

1504
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:30,303
You know the the later when the Generation Z gets older they will not believe that

1505
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:32,351
Demons live in technology cuz they've never lived

1506
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,119
Through the modem

1507
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,399
You know they never left do

1508
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:39,519
Demonic

1509
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,055
Alex

1510
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,591
Pedal didn't no response

1511
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:48,991
After Leo

1512
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:53,343
I was going to say a little bit overpriced

1513
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:54,623
The Vatican

1514
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:56,671
Charging people too much for a coin

1515
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,951
What kind of month

1516
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:58,975
Sister would do that

1517
01:11:59,231 --> 01:11:59,743
Right

1518
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:02,559
Maybe maybe Leo didn't read the room

1519
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:05,631
I'm sorry what my slip here and

1520
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,935
It's a little bit of a disagreement

1521
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,471
Between Alex

1522
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:11,007
Sandalio

1523
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:13,823
They have different ideas about what to do about the

1524
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,383
The fact that the cities are all going to burn

1525
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,919
Turn themselves down

1526
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,455
You know the trouble is coming

1527
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:27,391
Leo believes that there is no way to save these cities were going to take control over

1528
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:30,975
So there's a little bit like if we were arguing about what would happen if the Cubs

1529
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:33,023
Murder-suicide of their entire team

1530
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,047
That kind of

1531
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:41,471
The city's unfortunately are in the hands of the enemy

1532
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,799
Of course of the demon

1533
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:48,127
I don't think we need a crack

1534
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:49,151
So we need to

1535
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:49,919
Prepare

1536
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:53,759
The city's this is something I always say

1537
01:12:55,551 --> 01:13:00,415
Global's can't help but abused and suck off of a destroyer

1538
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:03,487
Remove ourselves

1539
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:05,791
He'll destroy the cities we will then inherit

1540
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,935
And then they'll burn themselves

1541
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:19,871
That the seat is might become smart cities in the handle side

1542
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,407
Bible Satan and he's a robot

1543
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:24,223
Ono Ono

1544
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:27,551
Yeah

1545
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,087
If the pope ever comes

1546
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:32,415
Chicago working to be heads of Cypress evening is robots dad

1547
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:34,975
This this is the

1548
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:40,095
Roller coaster that is a Leo zagami sentence that is what it is because

1549
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:44,703
You're like what you do want the city

1550
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:46,751
Can come in and take control of their

1551
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:52,895
That sounds bad why would you want that because the alternative

1552
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:53,919
Of course

1553
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:57,247
Organize the tools of cyber Satan and his robot army

1554
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,271
Absolutely

1555
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:03,391
All of our cities are going to go to the way of Sodom and Gomorrah cuz we weren't hospitable enough

1556
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:09,023
To Leo zagami and Alex Jones you mean that we didn't book

1557
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:11,327
Leo zagami to do a DJ de Noel

1558
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:16,959
And Alex's film didn't play at the music by I think that is going to wind up being the downfall of fall

1559
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:17,983
Probably

1560
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,519
Probably

1561
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,543
Let me

1562
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:23,359
Idiots live in their fun little Chris

1563
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,383
Christmas Carol

1564
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:29,247
Sandwiches return

1565
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,319
Yep I don't know what to tell you

1566
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:36,159
Are you know what I feel like you left out the word triumphant

1567
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,439
I didn't

1568
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:41,279
I mean that it wasn't if if I did leave it out it was intentional

1569
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:45,375
Cuz I don't

1570
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:47,167
Auto trying to sell things

1571
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:50,495
And just

1572
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,031
Calls to avoid

1573
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:57,407
Really exposing that you don't want to cover any of the stuff that's going on

1574
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:00,735
I mean

1575
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,015
Yeah cuz once he

1576
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:03,551
He starts talking about any of it

1577
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:05,087
If he doesn't have come

1578
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,623
Control Chicken Go Wild

1579
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:07,647
You know

1580
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,183
Yeah if he doesn't know any of the

1581
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,719
The story is totally

1582
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,279
Beatles

1583
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:15,071
I also think

1584
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:18,655
We're applying and projecting rationality on anybody listening

1585
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,191
Lifespan

1586
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:23,007
Just making s*** up all the time why would he speak

1587
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:26,847
Awareness of the stories he's covering Natalie doesn't

1588
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:28,127
You're right it doesn't

1589
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,407
Probably just a comforter

1590
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:32,735
Birthing like a personal sense of

1591
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:39,135
Pride the very least some sort of level of space like I ain't know a new guy

1592
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:39,903
Disagree

1593
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:40,927
I think it's like a half

1594
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:46,559
Easing back into a show cuz you like the listeners will really just do most of it with

1595
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,583
Call Jay

1596
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:53,983
I'll just be able to play around with that right most part stay back from vacation trailer for this documentary over

1597
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,799
Over and over again and then have Leo zagami

1598
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:58,335
Say a bunch of stupid s***

1599
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:00,639
And yeah so that's

1600
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,687
That's one way to do it

1601
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,711
Hey dudes

1602
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:09,087
Advise but but that is definitely a way

1603
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:09,855
Yep

1604
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:12,671
Come back Alex I'm glad he's

1605
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:15,487
Studio cuz I feel like there's a bit more normalcy

1606
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,767
Yeah you know I

1607
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:17,535
I feel like

1608
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,583
Is there a Wii now 10

1609
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,607
Confirm he didn't

1610
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:21,887
Right

1611
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:22,911
You know right

1612
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,471
Open question is

1613
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,239
Open close

1614
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:32,639
We can also confirm that some of that $8000000 went to a nice two week vacation

1615
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:34,175
Probably somewhere

1616
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,527
See if he gets back into shape

1617
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:41,599
Gets himself to a place where he can be interesting

1618
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:47,999
Next week

1619
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:52,095
We are on Twitter that intelligent or fight night go to bed Jordan

1620
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:52,863
But until then

1621
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,887
Emilio Emilio

1622
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:57,727
I hope you all have a wonderful day

1623
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:05,663
Alex

1624
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:08,479
Birthstone colors
