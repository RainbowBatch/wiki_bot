1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:13,568
McDonald's beverages

3
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:17,920
That that boy Alex Jones

4
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,688
Dan

00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,456
Oh boy

6
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,808
Lest I tell you what never

7
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:29,184
Original Gameboy red or blue

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,512
Never never really had a game for you to speak of

9
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,192
But it's a trend

10
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:46,336
Two times it went to the torch red

11
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,384
Pokemon go

12
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,456
Bernards I thought about getting

13
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,736
The Pokemon go

14
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:53,504
For one second

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,552
Came out in

16
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,576
Dude

17
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,112
I'd rather read on the bus

18
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,696
It's Ultraman love polka

19
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,512
That's fine I'm level 35 Dan

20
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,584
Can be how many feet

21
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,312
Do you have to catch them all okay what about the pressure

22
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:22,432
Hell yeah I started with a Charmander

23
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:25,760
In 1990

24
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,552
I didn't mean to set you off

25
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
I only know about

26
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,368
3

27
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:41,888
DiGiorno's a lot about Pokemon and think about Pokemon

28
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:47,776
Bulbasaur

29
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,616
That is correct

30
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,152
The Jordan before we started

31
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,808
Probably one of my favorite episodes of Alex's show that I've ever heard

32
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,648
You listen to and then collectively

33
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:10,048
Over 200 episodes of our Show episodes

34
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,584
Alex's show

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,496
I would I would absolutely

36
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,776
Cuz of all the ones that

37
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,080
We haven't talked

38
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,688
Consider all the times all the times that you listen to 3 episode 78

39
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,272
Conservative States

40
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,320
Listen to

41
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,624
Before we ever started the show

42
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,280
I was aware of him there's wasn't paying it

43
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,032
White supremacist clown

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
That's true

45
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,384
We will see

46
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,408
Do the expectation

47
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
I think it will but

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,992
No matter what

49
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
You know what does live up to

50
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,576
I don't know

51
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,600
Pandora listeners

52
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
Oh so very

53
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
Look

54
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:18,400
What working for today

55
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,680
People help

56
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,520
Support the content that they like being put out into the world may enjoy

57
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,312
That's the business model that we have

58
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,920
Is ever probably going to sponsor our Shelf

59
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Very generous

60
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992

61
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016

Visible on reference

83

Let's get down to business rather go with

84
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,815
Barry Manilow

85
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
Lexus

86
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,007

87
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,543

00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,015
Perfect

90
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:42,367
Someone who I believe has

91
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,415
Pictures of I have not heard her say

92
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:54,655

93
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
Thank you so much

94
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,799
Call Shannon

95

To Port sure we would appreciate the stirring in your loins

96
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,199
Go for it

97
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,599
I don't know

98
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,391
Joint

99
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,791
We forget about the live-action Mulan

100
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,839
I'll do it I know you will

101
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,143
This is this is not an idle threat

102
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
Jordan

103
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
Friday

104
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
You know

105
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,567
What we do

106
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Sometime

107
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
On Friday

108
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,919
We check-in what the f*** is going on with Alex

109
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
In 2018

110
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,015
He's been kicked off everything

111
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
Pretty much

112
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
Apple

113
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,159
Apple's app

114
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
Will you aren't

115
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,351
The iTunes Store

116
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
Kicked off a Twitter

117
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
I think the last time we checked in was just at

118
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:07,103
He went to Washington

119
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,175
Kind of assumed this is

120
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,735
Just going to be diminishing returns

121
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,503
Situation

122
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
Paint himself as a

123
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
Any Bruce type

124
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,087
Free Speech Warrior

125
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
Whatever

126
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,463
I'd probably lose his mind as his qualities

127
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
I felt like

128
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,215
He's barnone

129
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
The best

130
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
Proof

131
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,543
That he is f****** done

132
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,151
Like I do he's going to keep going

133
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
But like

134
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
He is

135
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
Straight

136
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Horse f******

137
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
Himself

138
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,551
Goodworks

139
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
Because what he's doing

140
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,375
I don't mind

141
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,191
I don't mind taking pleasure in this

142
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,215
Level of

143
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,495
Awful

144
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
We're going to hurt other

145
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
People by doing what

146
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:13,151
Episode

147
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,199
Understand fully what I'm talkin about

148
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:19,039
You'll laugh to this is a lot like it's on fire right now

149
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
Maybe

150
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,927
Yeah I might

151
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,999
I don't know.

152
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:36,959
Somebody

153
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:44,383
Something like a Charmander over there

154
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
A show

155
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,479
Freakishly large

156
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
Okay

157
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:58,975
Evaluate himself appropriate

158
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,279
Good unrelated to widen

159
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,559
This is one of my favorite episode

160
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
There's a stretch of this

161
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,959
Sure where Alex is trying to work out somebody images

162
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
Bucked up

163
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,055
Where is Alex start

164
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,383
Which hey guys guess what now that I like

165
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
Most

166
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
Had to worry about before

167
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Turns out

168
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,831
You takes a real hard trip back into blood libel territory

169
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,439
The stress level you can cut with a knife right now

170
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
Almost

171
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,071
Because of

172
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,911
The magnitude of espresso just how serious things are for me

173
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
How's it official

174
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
Beneficial

175
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,991
Of all the

176
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
As

177
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Big case

178
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,279
Almost as much as

179
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,095
Every woman on Twitter saying things

180
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
But he should

181
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399
He should up his

182
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,191
Up his claim here like I'm attack

183
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
GameStop

184
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,807
Position

185
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,343
Coward we haven't gone to the bloodline

186
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:39,071
Because the globalists are evil and they're taking our country and our world over it's the only chance we've got

187
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,191
Music

188
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,519
50 100

189
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,847
Yards

190
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,391
Wake up by themselves trying to not be a Slave

191
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:22,079
That's a spoiler for later but you would try and be a part of it

192
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,487
All about adopting I'm all about things are better

193
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,423
Are really nasty

194
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,823
Devil worshipping

195
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:00,735
You see that all of it

196
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,783
It's in the medical literature

197
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,447
That's why they hate me

198
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
Has got our number

199
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
Oh yeah

200
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:30,431
I don't know what the retail or wholesale price

201
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,247
MSRP

202
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,831
The Fad among rich people of like blood

203
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,183
Younger people real

204
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,255
But it's like people who go to oxygen bars

205
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
It's just some sort of thing

206
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,935
Weird

207
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:58,335
It's just it's just proof that there's no reason that these people are richer than us up

208
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,151
Confluence of luck and events

209
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,783
Really stupid people

210
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:13,183
There isn't any other Walk of Life

211
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Is with on

212
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
Unlike

213
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
Will you call it

214
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
Listen to some of them talk

215
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,287
Review like all you don't know all that much

216
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
Unabridged

217
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
You know when you're rich

218
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Some like really

219
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
Comes along

220
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
How many rich people do

221
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
You think

222
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
Thousand-dollar

223
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
Krystal's

224
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,879
You know like it got Pruitt

225
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
Nothing like when you're really

226
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,463
You run

227
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,511
To spend your money on that you actually mean

228
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,047
Are you start investigating right

229
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,119
Hello

230
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Cumin

231
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,191
You might say well I'm never going to be able to

232
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,983
Spend all of this money I have

233
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:02,591
$10,000

234
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:08,991
Crystal I could just give it away

235
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,415
Starting to the pledge

236
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
Children's Place

237
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,351
Literally

238
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,679
Mystery

239
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
Direct

240
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,751
Using historical anti-semitism

241
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Shoe paint

242
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,055
The globalist

243
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
Demonic

244
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,847
Pedophiles

245
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,383
Who drink children's blood

246
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
Which

247
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,943
We don't need to get into it again

248
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
It's just

249
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
That's over

250
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,343
There's no other way to describe that

251
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,135
Because that's not what they're doing

252
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,439
Knowing the drinking blood

253
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Transfusion

254
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Stupid novel

255
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Multi pochette for

256
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
A drink

257
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Only my own

258
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:01,471
You know like if I had caught it would be something that's easy to get through

259
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,287
No no

260
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,591
I don't I wouldn't I would want to take a

261
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
Tomatoes

262
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,319
Probably less delicious tomato soup

263
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:21,951
What other red liquid people.

264
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,839
Cranberries

265
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,375
Have you ever had

266
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,167
Corrupt

267
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,751
That might be the Pokemon of

268
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,799
It may not have got that one yet

269
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,871
I don't think I've had beaches

270
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:46,271
Now we've got a real sponsorship right there anybody who sells beet juice

271
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
The new slogan

272
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
The Pokemon of Judas

273
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
The victory

274
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:58,303
Of them winning me over you know just like I never had

275
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,887
Advertise a product that we don't believe in

276
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,703
I'm guaranteeing if we get a beet juice

277
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,567
Then we got it done right

278
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
This is not Alex's Maine

279
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
Rambling about bulshit

280
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,479
Almost immediately after

281
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
He does get into

282
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,063
Varsity narrative

283
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
For this episode

284
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:32,095
There's a hurricane

285
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:40,287
Camouflage coming across the u.s.

286
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:54,623
Oh boy I don't mean to

287
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
Is right away

288
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:01,791
Cuz I'm sure there's more to it

289
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,607
I'm just saying

290
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,143
That maybe

291
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,935
If you're riding on horseback

292
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,519
Camouflage

293
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:16,127
Sure

294
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,455
Silver Stallion

295
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,527
The Highwaymen

296
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:26,111
Filthy hide

297
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,159
Filthy hide

298
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,255
Sure

299
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:36,607
Look we're going to get into what he's talking about

300
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
Thousands of

301
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,263
Rush to break

302
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,103
Very dramatically

303
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,663
Across America

304
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:57,855
I've no way to deal with the threat of this thing about this because it's

305
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
So stupid

306
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
Why

307
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,975
But like legitimately if that's what he's selling to his audience

308
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,767
We only

309
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,607
Right I mean like this is an infection

310
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,655
Everything eventually

311
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,959
All of his rhetoric would lead to the

312
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
Being

313
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Find me

314
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,847
Kill them now you don't need to kill them

315
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:24,735
Because as I imagined is Alex's screamed over and over again we will give them no quarter

316
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:34,975
Pretty easy to capture a lot of dudes on Horseback what with the whole modern world we live in

317
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:39,583
Like I imagined one battalion

318
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,143
Go back in time when everyone

319
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
Oakwood Guns

320
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,151
Shoot the horses legs and make them dance

321
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
Compete with that

322
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,743
Are they using ropes

323
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
What

324
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:12,095
I like these men on Horseback they're not using roads where they're going

325
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
Dago

326
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,799
Exactly what you talkin about I believe

327
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
In a couple of cliff

328
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,127
But Alex's got to percolate on me

329
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,407
Unless he's got a really ruminate

330
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,687
About how why

331
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
This is

332
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,015
Just like the movie The Road Warrior

333
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
Amex

334
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,087
Busy talking about people coming across

335
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
Spoiler alert

336
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,719
Even in the movie The Road

337
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,143
Spiritually

338
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,751
Describing them as literally coming over on horse

339
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,543
Part is literal

340
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:03,039
Okay

341
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
Stroke

342
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,111
Videos

343
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
Is reporting on

344
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,207
To show people crossing the border

345
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
From X

346
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,511
Mexico and there were a couple of hours

347
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
Horses in the video

348
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,351
Express1040

349
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,167
Mentioned in that took going out to break that it

350
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,215
If people coming across the border

351
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,031
They're coming across America

352
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,687
I realize that it's only fair that I

353
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,503
Back to the Road Warriors

354
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,647
Thousands of illegal immigrants inside of horses and walking across the border

355
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,183
Easiest way to do it

356
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,023
Here's where we get to the road warrior metaphor

357
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
Gets bad before it get

358
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
Get better

359
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,631
Literally

360
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,127
Mexico

361
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
Okay

362
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,879
Shooting at each other attacking blowing up running over people

363
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,743
50 cal machine gun

364
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,983
And surely thoroughness at the Mexican cartel

365
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,895
Warrior

366
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:38,271
Humongous going live

367
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:46,463
Punk rock

368
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:54,399
Is Mexican with huge satanic tattoos that worship Satan

369
00:20:54,911 --> 00:21:00,543
Sleeper children

370
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:09,247
That's also free blood libel adjacent

371
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
Really bad

372
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:15,391
We're pretty much the most racist thing you can do

373
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,024
And their demonic Mexico

374
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,608
Punk rockers no

375
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:28,448
They're really lost

376
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,520
Kind of credibility when he called people demonic

377
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
Just kind of like a

378
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
Still in

379
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,336
Insult

380
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,360
That here you can use

381
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,384
Misaligned

382
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,200
They do listen to a lot of Morris

383
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,016
In this next clip

384
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:47,904
Because he gets back to the road warrior thing a little bit later and he also combined with another movie reference

385
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
That is

386
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,168
Visual caught on camera

387
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:03,264
Arizona Ranch

388
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,384
Illegal alien

389
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,064
Yeah

390
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
Sure

391
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,304
Road Warrior

392
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,864
Horseback

393
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:36,800
Nice save

394
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,872
Alex

395
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
So

396
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:47,296
It's like this

397
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,832
Subspecies of apes

398
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,880
And it's not that I'm

399
00:22:54,208 --> 00:23:00,352
Species

400
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:06,496
So I found this video is a 25-minute video

401
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,264
This is from like

402
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
Eclipse

403
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,056
This guy is

404
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,104
Had hidden cameras up at his house then

405
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
2016

406
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:16,992
So it's the course of what could be 22 years and 9 months now

407
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,600
Thousand

408
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,488
Poor wandering around in the

409
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:33,120
There's no timestamps on any of this stuff

410
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
Caucasian

411
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,544
Very imprecise stuff going on

412
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
You know what

413
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:49,248
Fair enough to watch this entire video account literally every person

414
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,136
Baywatch to the 10-minute Mark before I saw

415
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,160
Good footage

416
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,256
And also if you watch it it's like

417
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
Visa

418
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,328
And you see the same people from different cameras

419
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,376
Like it's the same group of me

420
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
People at different

421
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
Point

422
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,192
Along the way

423
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:13,824
No s*** but in all of these videos

424
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,104
Are unique person

425
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,384
Within 10 minutes

426
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,408
I counted

427
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,432
307

428
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
Before people

429
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,224
So

430
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,248
Extrapolate that out

431
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,296
Multiply that by two and a half

432
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
You got what

433
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,344
Maybe

434
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,160
People

435
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,696
There's a repeated peep

436
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,976
It's nonsense

437
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
This is all bulshit

438
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,792
Gun

439
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,072
But the vast majority

440
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,608
You know I'm saying

441
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
Just have big packs on

442
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,728
They're back and like Alex is saying that's all drugs

443
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,544
But it's equally likely that its rations

444
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,848
Is equally likely that the lot of these people haven't

445
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,384
Supplies in order to get

446
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,456
Through this journey through Central America

447
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,248
Map to the United States

448
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
There's nothing

449
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
These videos

450
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,856
Really leads me to believe that first of all this is

451
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,392
Is an invading Army on horseback

452
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,720
Like maybe three or four horse

453
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,608
Well

454
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:13,984
You can try

455
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,008
Fair enough

456
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,288
Hutches good tax

457
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,592
Text answers incredible

458
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,152
There's incredible exaggeration going on here

459
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,176
Incredible

460
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,480
Clearness of what the video even is capturing

461
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,040
It's very irresponsible the way Alex's

462
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,064
Because

463
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,856
Like I said in that first clip

464
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,648
The only reasonable conclusion

465
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,720
Kill these people

466
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,792
Third invading Army on horseback

467
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:42,400
Mrs. white supremacist propaganda

468
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,616
Tucker Carlson

469
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,432
I'm not sure if I caught.

470
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,224
It's just some guys house

471
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,016
Some Rancher

472
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,832
Hidden cameras around

473
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,136
So he sends in the raw footage

474
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:09,280
Probably

475
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:12,352
Maybe

476
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:18,496
I was a little bit confused cuz I I was just imagining

477
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,776
This dude who has a bunch of hay

478
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,336
Hidden cameras for editing this footage

479
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:25,152
And that's just a guy who's filled with so much hate but

480
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,176
We can't even get past

481
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
The fact that

482
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,224
It's not a big deal

483
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,016
And his own

484
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,040
Well

485
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,064
You're the fifth

486
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,112
50000 square acre

487
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,672
Ranch I believe Brett

488
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,048
Around that

489
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,864
Over the course of almost

490
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
3 years

491
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
Maybe

492
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,448
800 people

493
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:52,032
Assuming that they aren't the same people at different locations

494
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,432
That's not impressive to me week

495
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,968
If some of them have guns

496
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
Yeah but again

497
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,784
Rancho

498
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:10,720
You don't have proof that these people are illegal undocumented immigrants

499
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,304
Oh you have his video of people walking around

500
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,840
It's so they do have gun

501
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,632
Better to prove

502
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,936
What you're saying is the reality

503
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:25,056
Before I'm going to get mad about a couple of them having guns

504
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:31,456
If he just said you know what I think there might be some people hunting on my land

505
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,552
Carry gun through this

506
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:39,392
Florida

507
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,184
You want to file a complaint about

508
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,560
To the other issues

509
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,864
Camouflage

510
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Give a s*** about that

511
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,912
Like

512
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,312
Iran army

513
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,592
Or something like that

514
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:00,896
Florida bulshit

515
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:08,576
And moving very very slowly like if all of this hidden camera footage showed

516
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
Was like a

517
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,136
Whole bunch of hay bales

518
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:17,280
Just slow over the course I would

519
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:23,680
Perfect

520
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:29,056
I could get behind and publicized help you with that

521
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,616
And that's his sort of Varsity narratives Ramos.

522
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,920
The show

523
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,992
It leads to this

524
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,016
Next clip

525
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:38,784
Relics

526
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,064
Conspiracy about what

527
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,600
Going on with immigration

528
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
Do you make

529
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,208
Very bold

530
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
Very bold claim

531
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,536
And the UN

532
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,840
Guatemala

533
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,144
Alright we're a good start

534
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,704
Migrant centers

535
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,984
The world

536
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,824
Thousand dollars a piece

537
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:07,200
Food and other necessities

538
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:17,952
With the Democratic group

539
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:24,352
Quiet

540
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:36,384
Bacon Lover's

541
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,016
Completely forgot that I left and right click with the commercial

542
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:52,256
Perfect jarring

543
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:56,096
Lovers Unite

544
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:59,168
First

545
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
I got a guy who can hook you up

546
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:05,568
Put some buckets you don't need both of them

547
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,592
All over

548
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
Display Absol

549
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
Hell yeah

550
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:11,456
People are helping immigrants

551
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,736
Ants on their way up

552
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,016
Through

553
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,552
America or anything like that

554
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,904
The ideas it without

555
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,512
What Christianity

556
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,536
Anything like that

557
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,328
You're not going to stop

558
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,608
I'm trying to see

559
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,376
Refuge

560
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:35,776
In America you're not going

561
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,568
Do America that's just true but you

562
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,616
Your long as

563
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,896
The world operates

564
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
It's in the way that it does

565
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,456
You're never going to be able to stop him

566
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
To try and come

567
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,088
Come to America

568
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,112
And if you

569
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,696
Crackdown you're like your evil for giving the water along the way

570
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,512
All you're going to do is make sure the more of them die

571
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,584
You weren't going to stop the Imp

572
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,608
Just to come

573
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,888
To America

574
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,984
You're not going to be cruel to the people

575
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,008
Who are desperate in

576
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
Leaving about 2

577
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
Situation

578
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:13,920
Everybody knows that when you ban abortion

579
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:19,040
No babies ever get the perfect analog you get rid of legal abortion

580
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,064
In all you do is kill with

581
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:24,416
Just as Jesus said the way you treat

582
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:27,232
The least of these is f****** dope

583
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:31,584
Keep on doing it sir

584
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,168
Dealership bacon

585
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,568
The Jews could not be having somebody

586
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:47,968
Shipping free bacon I'm into this conspiracy analysis version of stupid

587
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,784
I just want Democratic voters

588
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,832
No white nationalist rhetoric

589
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,464
Democrats

590
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,912
Anyway

591
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,448

593
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
Alex's

594
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:12,800
Has been

595
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,872
Back in the day

596
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,176
Maybe I might be a little bit wrong about

597
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
From listening to

598
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248
A lot of stuff

599
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,272
2008/2009

600
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,808
How to pretty against

601
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
Profile

602
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,856
Because at least

603
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,160
Baseline level he understands

604
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,440
Ability

605
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,208
Not

606
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,744
A way to proceed with

607
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
You is Hope

608
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,560
Night I believe that

609
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,840
Do I don't know if

610
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,120
Day is perfect

611
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,912
Systems in that fact

612
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,984
I get a strong sense from him that like

613
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,520
You don't you don't come into composition

614
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,080
Group is represented

615
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
Individual

616
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:52,480
Unfortunately in 2018

617
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:58,112
Islamic extremists.

618
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
Problem-solve

619
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,912
Your partner

620
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:15,520
You're but you're going to get pulled

621
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,080
You're going to get extra screen

622
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,360
What you do

623
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:26,016
I don't think first of all I don't trust Alex's assessment of what constitutes a radical Islamic group

624
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,808
Conversation

625
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,832
Shuffle Murphy

626
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:35,232
The awful quick

627
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:39,072
Just like if you were too I don't know

628
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:45,472
Say that everybody who looks like a member of a radical militants white supremacist group

629
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:49,824
Should be profiled problems radical White

630
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:54,176
Logic

631
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,200
Prove it it's stupid

632
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,808
Disgraceful

633
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,368
Today feel like

634
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,952
Terrible

635
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,768
For Alex

636
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
Cuz I mean

637
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,352
He's not but there was a time

638
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,144
I think

639
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,912
Advocate

640
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,680
4 out

641
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,448
Out

642
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
Racial profiling

643
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,008
Because he's afraid of Muslim

644
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,544
Is just pathetic

645
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,408
For someone who wants to act like you have principles

646
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,176
Standing up

647
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,736
For America and what it stands for

648
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,272
To hear this kind of

649
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,552
Dribble come out of his mouth

650
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,320
Is just like

651
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,600
Just go home man

652
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:40,768
Yeah

653
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,864
Your usefulness even to

654
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,888
Your world

655
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,960
And that's bad

656
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
Peoples

657
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,520
Old assholes

658
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,312
Jerome corsi

659
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
I'm saying

660
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,664
Anywhere

661
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,456
Certainly

662
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,480
Anyway

663
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:04,832
I suppose I suppose he does have a he does have one point

664
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:08,160
Wichita Airport

665
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,696
Immigrants from

666
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,000
Escaping their terrible situation

667
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,024
To come to America

668
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,352
It's to turn America into a s******* they don't want to come to

669
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,424
I think what you're doing pretty great

670
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,216
Right now

671
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,520
Just like that make it illegal to

672
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,544
Different

673
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:30,176
The difference in heavy quotes

674
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,992
Nobody hates America more than people who call themselves

675
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:36,064
So I might be a little bit wrong

676
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,624
You're giving Alex

677
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,648
It's the sort of pasta

678
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,416
Credibility

679
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,464
Past selves

680
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,232
Profile

681
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,512
But this next clip

682
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,792
Is absolutely

683
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,584
Anathema

684
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,864
To what he would have

685
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
Ever

686
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,656
Believed in

687
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,152
Trump

688
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,944
Is a dereliction of Duty

689
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,504
2 years

690
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,064
Military

691
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,928
200000

692
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,024
1 billion percenter

693
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,816
In the past

694
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,632
Alex has called for the National Guard

695
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,704
Lisa border

696
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,752
No

697
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,520
He's not

698
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,312
Because that is something that can be done under

699
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,848
Direction to the governor of

700
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,688
Texas National Guard

701
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,968
It would not be again

702
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
Alex's

703
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,576
Him saying that the federal f****** government

704
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,344
To do it

705
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:46,208
Very much against Mexico

706
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:51,072
Would be operating within the state

707
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,424
About when we're looking at

708
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,704
2009

709
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,240
10th Amendment resolution

710
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,520
Like that

711
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,288
All of them

712
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,080
Completely counter to it

713
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:06,176
He doesn't even bring up the governor's support

714
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,992
4

715
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,112
Federalization it's an argument for tyranny don't you remember how much you loved

716
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
Loved

717
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:22,048
Don't you remember how many times the federal government has mobilized troops to do something very innocuous exercise

718
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,352
Compulsion

719
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:31,008
Bring federal troops into my state says Alex Jones

720
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,824
I don't know all the governorship Salonga

721
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,616
Border

722
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:38,688
Mario wearing one of them is

723
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
Democrat

724
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:45,600
Bring in the Federal

725
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,136
Then what you have is a

726
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:54,304
Should be on the side of the governor's but now will not be absolutely will face

727
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,328
This is

728
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,632
Is where people should be calling him at 8

729
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,912
Like before

730
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,936
There were articles in

731
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,216
The publication

732
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,520
Right wing watch

733
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,336
I was just calling for the National Guard to come in to stop that

734
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:09,664
Train of immigrants that were coming up even though that trained of immigrants

735
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,224
Something that happens every year at the symbolic

736
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,016
Sort of protest

737
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,552
Thing that not even

738
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,832
Threatening

739
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,392
Group of immigrants coming up from Central America

740
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,440
But they wrote about how Alex was saying bring a

741
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,768
If they understood with Alex.

742
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
They would know.

743
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
Problem for him

744
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,096
This f****** you

745
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,144
It bothers me

746
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,728
Talk about it well the only other way that could make sense

747
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,752
For his prints

748
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,288
As if he wants

749
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:39,360
The federal army on the other side of the Border

750
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,176
Which would be declaring war on Mexico

751
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,528
Interventionist

752
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,576
Paul Boehner would be

753
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:52,160
It would be quelled by that idea

754
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,536
It is fine if you are on horseback

755
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,096
That is true

756
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,144
In a video that's on The Daily Caller

757
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:03,936
Very

758
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,472
Reasonable to go to war absolutely

759
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
We know

760
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
Looking back at

761
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
2002a

762
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,360
9 that Alex

763
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,896
Did not know who George Soros

764
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,688
Ray's globalist

765
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,736
Said he would talk about where the Rockefellers

766
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,504
Sportsound

767
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,576
Child

768
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,624
Absolutely they were in play back then

769
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,928
People that were his big enemies

770
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,976
Most recent

771
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,512
Netflix episodes

772
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,840
George Soros be brought up

773
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,120
Almost confused

774
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,656
Spy it is not

775
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,192
Play

776
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
Makes

777
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:39,776
Is b*******

778
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456

794
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,640
Sometime in 2009

795
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,920

796
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,944

The letter L

804
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,576

That's cuz they don't like

And there's no reason that they wouldn't like him

833
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:14,047
Other than if they were

834
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,911
Shooting their brains on the wall

835
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,471

00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
Send it

974
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,447
Email or whatever

975
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:50,495
The powers-that-be at Facebook

976
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,383
Here is your account.

977
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,943
This all happened

978
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,711
Before

979
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,479
Thursday

980
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,039
This is the Thursday

981
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,831
Is the Thursday September 13th

982
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,647
By the morning of Thursday

983
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,695
He's had his account back open

984
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,719
4

985
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,743
Tonight

986
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:14,559
Before Wednesday night whenever

987
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,839
He got all of his ex

988
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:22,495
Yeah cuz it Works customer service

989
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,799
Unfortunately

990
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:27,103
It's still going around everywhere

991
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,407
Showing up on Alex's show on Thursday

992
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,455
Trying to pitch the idea that

993
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,247
You just said it

994
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,039
And he got banned for 30 days

995
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,831
When in reality by this point

996
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,855
He has his account back

997
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,391
They apologized for them

998
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,159
Mistake they made

999
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
Everything

1000
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,207
Should be fine

1001
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,767
Because Alex wants

1002
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,351
But if you say Infowars

1003
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,375
Your bam

1004
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,703
He's having them on and let him start his b*******

1005
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,239
Which is really about him trying

1006
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,263
Raise money

1007
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,543
Free walk away March

1008
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
He's trying to run

1009
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,783
Always looking for

1010
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:23,167

1013
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:41,855
You should email get your f****** account

1014
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:46,463
This is such b*******

1015
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:48,511
Oh I've been because I have

1016
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,047
Enterprising

1017
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,071
McDavid versus

1018
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,631
Goliath I found a workaround to get my account

1019
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,911
Be able to access

1020
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,447
Talk to people when techno

1021
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:59,007
Facebook recognize that they made a mistake

1022
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:03,103
Whatever it was whether it's dump capricious

1023
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:07,199
Employee who put his account on a suspension

1024
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:09,759
Some sort of automated today. Caught somehow

1025
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,599
F***** up here is your cats are locked

1026
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,159
And he's

1027
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,231
People

1028
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,255
No you're not

1029
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,279
Stop it

1030
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:26,655
I do like the I do like anytime anytime somebody uses workaround

1031
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:27,679
Like

1032
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:32,799
You're going to need to give me specifics on your quote-unquote work around cuz it makes it seem like

1033
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,847
We outsmarted them

1034
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,639
That's not what a workaround

1035
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,175
Yeah he's acting like

1036
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,199
Is a hacker

1037
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:43,295
No

1038
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:46,111
Like in the movie Swordfish

1039
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:46,879
Nope

1040
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,415
Facebook said Mia culpa

1041
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,463
Appropriately

1042
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,743
So

1043
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,559
He's talking about cuz it's not

1044
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,583
Quite frankly

1045
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,119
Read me we got a bit

1046
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,935
Of the best

1047
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:04,031
Alex

1048
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,311
About what's going to happen

1049
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:10,431
Video

1050
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,303
From

1051
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:29,631
You are going to have oceanfront property in Arizona.

1052
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,423
What's going on

1053
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,711
And they said we're ready

1054
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,503
Add just Unity right

1055
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,367
Operation

1056
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:00,095
In March

1057
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:11,359
Man on Horseback with drug package

1058
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,663
Divorce.com

1059
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:15,967
Whoopi Sher

1060
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,503
Call confirm

1061
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:20,063
The game

1062
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:26,719
He's like saying the first of all

1063
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:33,119
Recognizes that Steve pieczenik has been burned

1064
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:37,983
So then he comes

1065
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,007
In March

1066
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:39,775
Kill Trump

1067
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,543
Bye

1068
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,591
Everything can change

1069
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:48,223
They can change their China's behind just know that I said

1070
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,759
Things can change

1071
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,975
I think he was trying to evoke The Ides of March

1072
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,791
Because in the past he has

1073
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,839
Refer to Trump as our Caesar

1074
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,631
He has he has

1075
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,935
Used either as a analog

1076
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:11,007
Really bad thing

1077
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:11,775
You think

1078
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:18,175
Because Alex has big book that he basically said that the government military across

1079
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,455
What's our goddamn Nation

1080
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:23,295
I think there might be some sort of

1081
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,855
I don't know

1082
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:31,487
But I don't care about that

1083
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,535
None dare call it

1084
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,839
The book that Alex Jones

1085
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:36,863
Ron

1086
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,143
Beaver is

1087
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,423
Used as an example

1088
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,191
Of what

1089
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,727
Happens when a psychopath

1090
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:42,751
Is born

1091
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:43,775
Super rich

1092
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,103
In the book Gary Allan is

1093
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,383
Describing the ideas

1094
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,151
Hey

1095
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,199
There are these people who go out and murder

1096
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:53,503
You know cuz David Dearborn crazy

1097
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,271
There's just

1098
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:57,855
Vicious Psychopaths out there

1099
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,135
They are only

1100
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:01,951
Like one or two three four five

1101
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,231
Because they were born

1102
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,023
Humble circumstances

1103
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,559
But what happened

1104
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,327
Psychopath

1105
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,887
Lap of luxury

1106
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,471
Either I can't imagine

1107
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,263
The one Alex

1108
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,055
Trump

1109
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:22,943
Well it's a good thing either she hasn't read the book that he's basing his life on

1110
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:24,991
Completely lost

1111
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,271
Track of any

1112
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:29,599
It's a good thing that this is purely a hypothetical

1113
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:34,463
That we have no real-world concrete examples

1114
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,023
Of psychopaths

1115
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:43,167
A laughable situation Dan bring it up to me

1116
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:48,543
I understand

1117
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:49,567
Gary Allan

1118
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:50,591
It is a little bit

1119
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:52,639
Baseline

1120
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,407
Real surf

1121
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,431
But

1122
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,015
Sometimes

1123
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,295
What you end up with

1124
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,951
Sublimated

1125
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,975
Into like

1126
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,047
Getting their jollies off of crush

1127
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,071
Competition

1128
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:12,863
Do actually murdering

1129
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,655
Isn't

1130
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423
Accessible to

1131
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:18,495
If you're William Randolph Hearst

1132
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,263
Sure

1133
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,079
But be there

1134
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,359
Stupid

1135
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,431
Even going to be killed

1136
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,967
But Alex already knows

1137
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:33,087
Is also a good time to say

1138
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,903
Now because then you got a long wait

1139
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:38,719
And people will forget that mug

1140
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:41,023
Forget you even bring it up

1141
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:44,095
Then you can at least 3 months

1142
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,631
Pretending it's going to happen

1143
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:47,423
4 months of time

1144
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,727
Exact

1145
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,287
Money with a panic

1146
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:58,943
The summer of Rage

1147
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,807
Let's talk about the immigrants that are in Europe

1148
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:04,831
As opposed to the immigrants

1149
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:05,855
Hatesphere

1150
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,487
80 + percent

1151
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,767
Islamic

1152
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,559
Middle Eastern North African

1153
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:17,119
Invaders brought in Last 5 Years in Europe

1154
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:22,239
What percent never get a job if you know they deport

1155
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,055
Convert to Christianity

1156
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,335
What's in the news

1157
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,127
Get the job

1158
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:42,463
I don't like that believe that all that is actually slightly better

1159
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,095
You are

1160
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:51,935
Alright

1161
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:54,495
This is the most

1162
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:59,615
I've heard from from

1163
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:03,967
Like we were covered a lot of

1164
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:09,087
Heavy

1165
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:15,487
Spectrum oh yeah after Mexicans get out of their North African food

1166
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:22,399
He's going to think that our prediction of like

1167
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:26,751
He's going to have no reason to hold back anymore like it's fairly Act

1168
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:29,567
Call immigrant Invaders

1169
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,359
I mean does that anyway that's right

1170
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:36,223
But he seems to be relishing it a lot more to enjoy his

1171
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:38,783
New lb

1172
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,551
Yap

1173
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,623
Yeah.

1174
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:43,903
Here in this

1175
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,439
Text Cliff about what happened

1176
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,463
That you are against

1177
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,255
And it's

1178
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,023
Someone who's against

1179
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:49,791
Infowars

1180
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:50,559
Has been putting out

1181
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,375
Long podcast

1182
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,679
Very thing every week

1183
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,959
For two years

1184
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:00,031
I will say

1185
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,567
When you are against Infowars

1186
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:02,847
Not true

1187
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,383
Are you sure not true

1188
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:06,175
Well I will withhold judgment

1189
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:10,527
Because I am also against it but I don't know what he's about to say so maybe he's right

1190
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,959
Realized

1191
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:36,127
No one is pushing out

1192
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:03,007
We all go down the rabbit hole we all go together this talk

1193
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,543
This whole situation

1194
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:08,639
Alex's all the time we hang together or we hang Zephyr

1195
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,663
How is that

1196
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,711
Anyway difference

1197
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,759
Qanon

1198
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:17,087
Now beyond that this is so f****** funny to me

1199
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:22,207
Because he's been vaguely anti qanon for the entire time

1200
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:27,583
More important to be the one that goes viral

1201
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,143
About that

1202
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,935
But at the same time

1203
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:34,239
Jerome corsi has been on his payroll

1204
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,519
Jerome corsi was writing

1205
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,287
Goddamn

1206
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:39,359
Book about decoding the truths of Cuba

1207
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:48,575
I'm not going to lie to you very simple explanation Alex

1208
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:51,647
Here's why qanon

1209
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:52,927
Is more popular

1210
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,743
It's a non

1211
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,791
And your dude is named exact

1212
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:04,703
Fairy

1213
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:07,775
He was on Saved by the Bell man

1214
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:11,615
Nobody's going to 4th wall break this b******* and also

1215
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,175
It appealed to people about qanon

1216
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,199
The idea that you have to put

1217
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:18,271
Pieces together yourself. There is an element of like

1218
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:21,087
Circle mystery I think you said it on a reason episode

1219
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,111
Make make me

1220
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,391
Me feel like I'm smart for

1221
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,951
Figuring this out

1222
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:26,975
Desire to

1223
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:27,999
To pretend they're detect

1224
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,559
And I figure out what is this cryptic nonsense

1225
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,607
Announce doesn't provide them

1226
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,375
He's just like

1227
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,895
Two specific to specific Becca

1228
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:46,687
Harper

1229
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:55,135
Game changer

1230
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:59,743
You don't have any subject mystery to figure out

1231
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,535
And that's why whenever we go back in

1232
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,327
Episodes to train train

1233
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,607
Pathan

1234
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,887
It's not that hard

1235
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,167
It takes a long time

1236
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:13,823
Because you have to listen to the episodes you have to digest what he saying

1237
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:19,455
The only people who listen to maybe but I don't think

1238
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,247
The only thing you really have to

1239
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:23,295
Do is be able to stop us out when he's telling me

1240
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,087
Flying in Brighton

1241
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,367
Like that

1242
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,135
I think if you listen to

1243
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:27,903
Enough

1244
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:28,671
Kind of get the

1245
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:30,207
His voice

1246
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,487
There's there's

1247
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:35,583
I feel like even without any of your research

1248
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:40,191
I would be able to just bite your be like

1249
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:45,823
Do you know it sounds like it might be possible but guess what

1250
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,615
I heard that I heard the lilt

1251
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:50,943
Alkali

1252
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:54,783
Wellsbrooke

1253
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,319
Morlock

1254
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,599
F*** off

1255
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:59,391
So I'm going to skip this next book

1256
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,183
It's not really all that important it's just Alex

1257
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,719
The Border Patrol

1258
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:03,487
Nice smile

1259
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,791
Are they

1260
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,071
I don't think he said to now

1261
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,887
Oh are they

1262
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:16,287
Are there more children in detention now than there were just a few short weeks ago

1263
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:19,871
Whenever whenever the justice system

1264
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:28,063
The children who are being held

1265
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:31,391
It's good that they are

1266
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,671
ACLU

1267
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:37,279
I don't care

1268
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:42,143
But I give a s*** about the people who

1269
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,423
You know mistreated

1270
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,471
Stuff like that but I don't really care

1271
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:51,103
Really

1272
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,407
But at this point

1273
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,967
Why is Owen Shroyer there because

1274
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:04,415
And he needs to sit down with Owen Shroyer and get to the bottom up

1275
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,695
This

1276
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:07,231
Jordan

1277
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:10,559
This is the bike down for it

1278
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,863
No no

1279
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,167
To cover a little bit and then we will have

1280
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:18,751
DeGraw

1281
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,287
This made me laugh

1282
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:21,823
F****** hard whenever

1283
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,919
Nothing like some Good Ole Country on the open road huh

1284
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:37,183
Like an alpha male

1285
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,743
How does a person with gout

1286
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:43,327
Alphabet

1287
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:49,215
Power

1288
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:57,663
Freakishly large

1289
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:06,111
And my chest is freakishly large

1290
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:08,415
Is it high school

1291
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:25,311
Wizard

1292
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,111
Everybody was looking at me

1293
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:45,279
Is a factor attack

1294
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,167
Because I was

1295
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,639
Try to make me ashamed of myself

1296
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:03,455
Now because they're doing that

1297
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:23,679
Columbus.gov

1298
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:27,263
As the wheel has the spirit has the future

1299
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:33,919
We are reserved because

1300
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,647
Could you please play the first

1301
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:46,463
I don't know 30 seconds

1302
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:53,631
Nothing like some good old country on the open road

1303
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:58,239
Around

1304
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:04,383
The alpha male

1305
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,943
I was the person that was child

1306
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:10,015
Okay now you can stop right there

1307
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:12,575
Stressed out

1308
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,855
Annoying

1309
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,135
Looking annoying

1310
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,207
Funplex

1311
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:24,607
Have you ever heard the second f****** half of that cup

1312
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:29,215
And ladies, Ramen

1313
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,263
You

1314
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:37,663
I'd like to remind you feel like one of them

1315
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:44,063
I've ever heard earlier in the episode Alex said that there's an invading Army coming from Mexico

1316
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,671
Be hit by a hurricane

1317
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,119
Cuz Owen represent

1318
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,399
It's what he's lost

1319
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:01,215
Cohen representative

1320
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:06,847
Why would he know the exact price of a quart

1321
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:09,407
Other child but if not

1322
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,967
Five children

1323
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:14,015
Seems like it might having a

1324
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:16,319
The market

1325
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,855
Really I think I touched on some

1326
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,623
Something there hear up

1327
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,159
Presents that thing that Alex

1328
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,183
Cannot get back

1329
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,463
I think you

1330
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,023
The two of them have this weird

1331
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:25,791
Turn off

1332
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,839
Child relationship.

1333
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,399
Alex

1334
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,679
And Alex really wants

1335
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,447
Impressive

1336
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,727
Like you're either

1337
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:39,103
It's not employee-employer relationship

1338
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:43,711
I don't have a clip of it but there's a point where Alex Alex

1339
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,991
Alex you are a

1340
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:56,255
Just like reassuring

1341
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,023
No

1342
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:03,423
You are a bad as your son was the best boy you are

1343
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,983
Play the reason to do and supposed to be on

1344
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,287
Is because that video that was on The Daily Caller

1345
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,871
And Owen went to a I guess

1346
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:14,175
Liberal

1347
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,967
I don't know

1348
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:23,135
Speaker about it about the like what about all these armed men coming across the border and also

1349
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,415
What about abortion

1350
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:31,839
Looks like Infowars is here

1351
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:36,447
What's really funny is that after that Owen is like I've got a stack of news here

1352
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:43,103
He's literally use that he has never been prouder

1353
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:51,551
Expressions

1354
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,599
Also the other thing that I thought was

1355
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,391
Locked up

1356
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,183
Wheel locks

1357
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,231
Owen

1358
01:11:59,487 --> 01:11:59,999
Says

1359
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,535
If you kick us off Facebook

1360
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,815
Will come into

1361
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:05,631
3D reality where God is in charge

1362
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:12,031
Usurp

1363
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,311
What would you

1364
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:17,407
Man now I really want to find out more about Owen Shroyer

1365
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,687
Very clear.

1366
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:22,271
I would say if there's something going on

1367
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:25,343
Drift on the wrong side of the Goldwater rule

1368
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:27,135
I do know that the hero wears

1369
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,255
It's going to be it's going to be

1370
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:35,071
Shroyer is cruising for like the worst

1371
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:37,375
Decade of his life and have a

1372
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:43,775
Albert

1373
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:45,823
Can't remember the name of the movie

1374
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:48,383
No we're not supposed to talk about

1375
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:51,967
It's the one where you goes on the ship

1376
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:54,783
Seven Years in Tibet is the other one

1377
01:12:55,295 --> 01:13:01,439
He's on the ship he was smoking opium and grew his hair real long and his wife was a native

1378
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,719
American Freight

1379
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,999
Okay you're right that was

1380
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,815
Alex

1381
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:07,839
Just having a bull session

1382
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,375
This is like they both

1383
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,655
Really need to talk to

1384
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,679
Somebody about their body

1385
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:15,263
Unfortunately it on are to each other

1386
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,287
This is

1387
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:18,335
You should probably talk to a therapist

1388
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,895
Dysmorphia

1389
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,687
I don't want to judge them for

1390
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,295
Immigrants are Invaders

1391
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,575
Like that right

1392
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,855
Go f*** off you don't really get

1393
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:49,567
Because there's this whole Trend right now happening about body shaming

1394
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:55,967
And so it's like if you're overweight and obese women

1395
01:13:56,223 --> 01:14:02,367
Wearing like yoga pants now that illegal

1396
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:14,655
Probably something like that

1397
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:15,679
It's like

1398
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:22,591
If you walk

1399
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:35,391
Instead of walking and stuff like that like

1400
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,415
Real quick

1401
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,439
You think Auntie for meeting

1402
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:41,279
But that's the exact same thing he claimed about when he would protest abortion rally

1403
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:43,071
He's just

1404
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:43,839
This is hacking

1405
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,375
This is like

1406
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,447
This is what if there was a sketch

1407
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,215
Where

1408
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:50,239
Woody Allen

1409
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,263
Warren Arnold

1410
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,031
Schwarzenegger stay

1411
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:56,127
Like this is exactly the kind of neuroses that would come out here

1412
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:59,711
It's super weird

1413
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,503
HuHot people hate

1414
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:07,903
About

1415
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:12,255
Is dumb that it's dumb now you're not getting any smarter why are you

1416
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:17,631
Why are you coming we're all of these people are the bench

1417
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:20,191
Shapiro's of the world the Jordan Peterson

1418
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:21,471
Harrison

1419
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:23,007
The Stefano molyneux's

1420
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,543
Dark web

1421
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:27,103
All of their stock-in-trade is really

1422
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,151
Rephrasing

1423
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:34,015
Conversations we've already had it out of here

1424
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,343
What if

1425
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,879
Masculinity

1426
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,671
I'd like it was smart

1427
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:48,863
Stupid

1428
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:52,447
Qualitative differences between

1429
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,775
What is

1430
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:59,359
You know like really whoever wanted his judging is people who

1431
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,127
Too hot

1432
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:07,295
They the real victims here damn real victims

1433
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,927
People's physical appearance

1434
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:19,327
The next thing you know we're going to be in Harrison Bergeron. Going to have to wear glasses to make me blind because my vision good

1435
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:23,167
Baby

1436
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,191
You know what

1437
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,727
I feel so bad

1438
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,519
That we should outlaw

1439
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:30,591
People wearing tights

1440
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,359
Close

1441
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,271
And actually it.

1442
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,295
Semi political

1443
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:48,255
Beto O'Rourke name

1444
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:03,615
Concert with Willie Nelson Willie Nelson is now

1445
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:10,271
Which is bad

1446
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:14,879
Tony Democrat

1447
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,159
You can't

1448
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:18,463
Excuse

1449
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,279
I know you got a inflated view of yourself

1450
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:24,095
Still not going to

1451
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:24,863
Now

1452
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,399
I will say that

1453
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,959
Absent any other information

1454
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:33,311
Is that her real name I don't know he's an expression of rape

1455
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:36,895
Absolutely

1456
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,663
Cuz you're not

1457
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,199
You know what is very easy

1458
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:39,967
Need to find out if something

1459
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,247
Someone's real name

1460
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,271
You look that up

1461
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,807
You can't

1462
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,343
Especially public figures

1463
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,159
Name one way

1464
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,695
Google it so you can do that

1465
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:51,743
I don't care I'm going to look into that purse

1466
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,071
I believe that's

1467
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:59,423
Any less Owens going to present me with some sort of evidence that it's not

1468
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,215
I just see that as an expression

1469
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:01,983
Quest

1470
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:05,055
Somebody is a minority

1471
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,847
Beto O'Rourke

1472
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,663
Because his real name

1473
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:12,223
His birth name is Robert Francis O'Rourke

1474
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,783
You started going by Beto and its primary school days

1475
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:15,807
It's because Beto is

1476
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,575
Spanish

1477
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,599
Robert

1478
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:18,623
Probably had something

1479
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:20,159
Going to do with the fact that he grew up in El Paso

1480
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,439
Which I'm not sure if you know this

1481
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:24,511
Is literally on the border of Mexico and 80.7

1482
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:27,071
The population of El Paso had some sort of Hispanic

1483
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:30,655
He went to Carlos Rivera Elementary School in El Paso Heights

1484
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,471
That's cool by the way El Paso High School

1485
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,519
Is it

1486
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,543
Houston High School at 9

1487
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:40,127
Great good guys

1488
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:43,967
Has grown up surrounded by an immersed in latinx

1489
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:46,271
And the idea that most of his friends

1490
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,295
Grown-up or probably

1491
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,575
Hispanic

1492
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,879
End up with the Spanish

1493
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,415
Inspired

1494
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,695
Beto's

1495
01:18:54,207 --> 01:19:00,095
I don't think there's anything wrong with that

1496
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:04,959
I'm a little bit know he's great

1497
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:07,519
I would support a second potatoes on the ballot again

1498
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,799
Ted Cruz Beto

1499
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,615
The bassist in a band

1500
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:13,151
Oh yeah

1501
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:20,319
Bixler-zavala from at the drive-in

1502
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:26,719
Drive-In

1503
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:32,607
That's not so

1504
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,167
President

1505
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:38,751
Actually

1506
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,519
Scratch that

1507
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:41,823
At the drive-in

1508
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,615
As a concept president-for-life

1509
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:45,919
I don't know about that

1510
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:49,247
Anyway

1511
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:56,671
Amen

1512
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,231
What's the name of it

1513
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,791
Rats in the Sanitarium

1514
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:05,631
That sounds great

1515
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:07,935
Later album

1516
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,495
Little self-indulgence

1517
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:15,104
From the jump a little Philadelphia earlier but

1518
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:18,688
Great drummer

1519
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,456
Anyway

1520
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:25,856
Can't get too bogged down in the world of of old old timey

1521
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:26,880
Iraq

1522
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,928
I don't know what's going on

1523
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:31,232
By the way that's not my genre at all but my friend

1524
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,512
At the drive-in

1525
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,048
I'm glad they worked

1526
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,960
I'm always going to go with it

1527
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:47,360
Whether they're good or not

1528
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,896
Jordan

1529
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,176
Yes daddy

1530
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,968
Until we come to it

1531
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:52,992
You come to the point

1532
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,016
Where

1533
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:54,784
Your life

1534
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,064
No

1535
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,088

Definitely

1538
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:03,232
Strongest indication that Alex Jones is

1539
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:05,536

1540
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:06,560

1542
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:11,680

1543
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:12,704

01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,912
It's bad news

1560
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:49,472
Merle Haggard

1561
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:54,848
Does anybody know who owns Infowars note

1562
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,664
I think maybe his ex-wife bought

1563
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,224
Kelly made about a workout

1564
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,504

1565
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:05,344

1566
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:08,160
Do not like I mean he didn't own infowars.com

1567
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,184
But he started it

1568
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:14,304
Write like someone else was sitting on that for a really long time so that he wouldn't cover his base

1569
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:23,776
I mean if it was me and I was going to come up with knowledge fight yes.com we would also

1570
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:27,872
Possibly

1571
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,664
Knowledge fight in determined

1572
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,224
It's just good planning

1573
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:33,504
So

Conrad Padilla

1578
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,584
To talk about

1579
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,608
I had a really tough time

1580
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,888
Figuring out who Conrad

1581
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:52,448

1582
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:55,520
It's not him

1583
01:23:57,824 --> 01:24:03,200
Obviously this is something good to get it on the ground

1584
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,736

1637
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:24,928
To do with

1638
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:26,464
People not being necessarily

1639
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,256

Witches you know I mean

1677
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:59,296
I don't think that's necessarily the main problem

1678
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:02,112
I would be

1679
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,904
With someone if they were

1680
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:05,952

1681
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:06,720

01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:10,560
Position to be

Do they have language

1685
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,616
I mean I think you could make an argument that

1686
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:24,896
You know you got to have

1687
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:25,664

Outside of college party outside

1698
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:50,240
Beneficial

1699
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,264
For them to prepare

1700
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,800

And they'll do a good job

1708
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:13,024
The buck back further

1709
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,816
Wherever you do with people should be for

1710
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:15,584
Prepared in some way

1711
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:18,656
High School

1721
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,096
For someone to step

01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:50,144
To teach entrepreneurship

1723
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:58,336

No

1738
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,968
So

1739
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:42,368
This profession came around network marketing

1740
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:45,184
Actually now that it's been around for over 100 years

1741

The biggest the owners of the successful business

1750
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:38,176
4

1751
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:40,736
So if you are not putting

1752
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:43,808
Together

1753
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:45,856
So Alex

1754
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:51,232

You betcha he's not even running his own MLM anymore

1757
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,752
He is just a contractor for a multi-level mark

1758
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:04,800
And that's what

1759
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:07,104
It's a funnel to get people to sign up to

1760
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,640
To be Distributors for

1761
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:15,040
Can't be real that's the saddest thing I've ever heard it's pretty remarkable

1762
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:21,184

Infowars

1764
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,488

Forwards yes.com you scroll all the way to the bottom there's a

1767

1773
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:43,200
People to sell jeunesse products

01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,760

01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,672
Generative formative experiences

1776
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:54,464
Alright alright

1777
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,256
When my when I was like

1778
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:57,280
9

1779
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:59,328
My dad bought a timeshare

1780
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,448
Somehow even then when he was explaining it to me I was like

1781
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:06,496
Is a bad idea

1782
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,800
It's not valuable

1783
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,664
And then again when I was like 22

1784
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,712
My dad started telling me about this

1785
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:18,272
Okay so

1786
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,552
Right is that

1787
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,392

1789
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:29,280
You know tell other people about this

1790
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:30,560
Membership and they get this

1791
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:33,632
Membership do I have to pay a small fee

1792
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:39,264
But the more people you tell the better discount to get Edmund actually you get like a kickback

1793
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,056
For every person who signs up

1794
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:47,456
Using your information I can't imagine how your dad ended up in a cult

1795
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:54,112
Weird how

1796
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:57,440
When I was 18 years old Cutco

1797
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:03,072
I remember I was working at a movie theater

1798
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:04,864

1799
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:07,680
Movie theater popcorn

1800
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:08,704
Rat working the concession

1801
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:09,728
And what have you

1802
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,264
I would like

1803
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:14,080
Hero of the Forum

1804
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:18,176
Selling knives Albans all the way

1805
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:21,504
My car and someone had put a flyer

1806
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,528
A Cutco in there

1807
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:28,416
Maybe I'll go check out this seminar or whatever

1808
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:30,208
Now with the same time

1809
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:33,024
Reality show about my life

1810
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,816
Because I was completely out of control

1811
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:38,144
Bad little digital camera

1812
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:40,960
Will be fun if I got

1813
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:41,984
Drunk

1814
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,264
And went to this Cutco

1815
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:46,080
Because the cattle call it's just

1816
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:49,152
That was going to be

1817
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:50,688
Wasted

1818
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:51,712
And then we went

1819
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:52,480
Pedro

1820
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:57,856
We were saying we brought a video camera

1821
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:58,624
You cannot video

1822
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,928
Rotate

1823
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:13,984
And there's always the guy who

1824
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,008
Who's like now

1825
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:15,776
You might

1826
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:17,056
You might say to yourself

1827
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:20,896
There's no way this is too-good-to-be-true I'm going to bring up

1828
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:23,456
Mr.and.mrs Derrickson

1829
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:27,552
They are going to tell you exactly how

1830
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:31,904
From having some sort of regular real estate real estate

1831
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:38,304
To making $38,000 per month

1832
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,328
There wasn't

1833
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:41,632
Anyone like that but the guy was running

1834
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:42,400
That was his story

1835
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:46,752
It's me myself

1836
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:48,288
There was obviously one person

1837
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:49,312
In the audience

1838
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:53,408
Stuff like that

1839
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:58,528
I can't make eye contact with the guy or anything I'm like

1840
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,344
Probably had like

1841
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:02,368

1842
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:06,464

There might have been closer cat might have been around 78

1846
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:15,424

I got to get out of here

1856
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:42,816
It went on for like an hour

1857
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:43,840
Happy hour

1858
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:44,608

He brought everyone into his office

1863
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,408
Two at a time

1864
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:00,992
And he gave the speech that he obviously gave

1865
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:04,320
Every single group of to bring you guys in here

1866
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,088

01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:22,240
Pointing at Herzig

1901
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,544
Belittle impressionable

1902
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:37,248

01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:54,912
Consider how alienated they are from everybody

1912
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,192
Either friends

1913
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:56,960
Because I do

1914
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:01,056
To go down

1915
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:02,592
Piss off your family

1916
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:03,360
You might get some

1917
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,384
Petey purchases

1918
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:05,408
And then you're going to get

1919
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:06,688
With all of these

1920
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:07,712
Use expensive knives

1921
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:11,808
He ended up

1922
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:13,088
Thousand

1923
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,112
Thousand dollars

1924
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:19,232
So now this is what Alex's

1925
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,512
Well I don't like

1926
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,280
Teasing pyramids

1927
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:23,584
Pyramid scheme has a really negative

1928
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:25,120
I prefer

1929
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,656
Multi-level marketing

1930
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:30,496
Define

1931
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:32,544
Pyramid

1932
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:37,664
Is that like

1933
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,432
Attracted

1934
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:40,736
The founders of it

1935
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:42,016
Came in with such the

1936
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:43,040
Success in business

1937
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:45,088
You know like they were very

1938
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,112
People people

1939
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:48,160
Now Jordan

1940
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,696
Is a multi-level marketing

1941
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:52,000
Team started by Wendy Lewis and Randy Ray

1942
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:53,280
Starting to

1943
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:54,816
Scam company

1944
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:56,864
Operated mother multi-level marketing

1945
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:00,960
Called fuel Freedom International

1946
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:04,032
Where they sold the product called

1947
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:10,944
Which allegedly helped your Gotta Have It

1948
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:15,296
Ultimate

1949
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:16,064
Bulshit

1950
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:20,672
Truth in advertising 2009 record

1951
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:22,464
CEO and co-owner of this fuel

1952
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,000
Freedom

1953
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:24,768
Voluntary

1954
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:25,536
Compliance with

1955
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:26,304
Florida's office

1956
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,864
Attorney General

1957
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:33,216
Thousand dollars promised

1958
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:34,240
For making false

1959
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,008
Claims and thereby

1960
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:39,104
Send pic a no longer legally make false claims of full fuel freedom

1961
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,128
They close down shop

1962
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:41,152
And started jeunesse

1963
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:46,016
Because regulation of the supplement industry is nearly non-existent

1964
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:51,648
You can just start selling b******* and call it something that's got health benefits because there are

1965
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:58,048
Billion-dollar companies that have lobbied Congress to ensure that they're not covered by the FDA

1966
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:02,400
So these people Wendy Lewis and Randy Ray who started a multi-level marketing

1967
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,168
Company

1968
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:05,216
The fraudulent product

1969
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:06,752
Got them $100,000

1970
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:08,800
Find by the Attorney General of Florida

1971
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,592
These operations

1972
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:11,872
Because the jig was

1973
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:17,248
Did you next

1974
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:24,160
I'm going to give them credit for that.

1975
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,184
Here's the problem

1976
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:28,000
Nobody gets scammed quite like a scammer

1977
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:32,864
What was happening right now

1978
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:36,192
So hard doesn't even know

1979
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,288
You can even imagine

1980
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:41,312
Like right now

1981
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:43,104
This show Infowars

1982
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:44,128
At this point

1983
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,408
On this episode

1984
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:46,688
Turns into a Janessa

1985
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:48,224
No

1986
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:54,880
Sponsored

1987
01:43:56,416 --> 01:44:01,536
What comes up to the info

1988
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:03,328
Real quick all the product

1989
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:06,144
Infowars store now on harsh disc

1990
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:12,544
And some of that is pretty normal to Easter sale might still be in effect from 6

1991
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,872
Marked down a lot of stuff

1992
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:17,920
And Alex earlier this

1993
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:19,712
Got on there and said that

1994
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:22,016
The situation with his

1995
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:24,064
The iodine

1996
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,600
August 6th

1997
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:26,624
The survival Shield

1998
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:28,160
Sure

1999
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,440
The crystal iodine

2000
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:35,584
Earth Earth iodine

2001
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:38,144
No s***

2002
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:38,912
Say that before

2003
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:44,544
Multi-level marketing

2004
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:45,824
You think this is going

2005
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:46,848
To fund the operation

2006
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:49,408
I think that he's not working with Doctor group any

2007
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:53,504
I think the probably a lot of the old product

2008
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:58,112
Well I would if I were him his our yeah I know you would absolutely finishing like crazy

2009
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:59,136
Toxic brand

2010
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:07,584
So Alex probably minutes

2011
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:10,656
Doctor group was very happy to be in this

2012
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:13,472
Where he would rename product

2013
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:15,520
And let Alex

2014
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:20,384
So Gone

2015
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,920
It's on YouTube is not able to promote

2016
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:22,688
Product

2017
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:27,040
On Facebook and Twitter and all these places

2018
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:30,112
Private label all this stuff and I will have to be able to sell

2019
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:31,392
When was the last time dr. group

2020
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:33,184
I have no idea

2021
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:39,072
I wonder if whoever comes back

2022
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:39,840
But this is just a

2023
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:41,888
Of my I have nothing to back this up

2024
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:45,984
This is the last X2 thing

2025
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:48,800
Yeah he's not doing that in some way

2026
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:50,592
In the past we've heard him say that

2027
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:52,384
He's not

2028
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:53,664
Like that on this

2029
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:58,272
And you'll get it if you want it

2030
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:00,832
We got some in the warehouse

2031
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:02,368
Where to move it cuz we got to get that juice

2032
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:04,416
Taking up space

2033
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:05,696
So I'm

2034
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:12,096
And he was already running ended monthly multi-layer with

2035
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:16,448
Is operation

2036
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:18,496
You never really sells at all that hard

2037
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:19,776
But you just mentioned

2038
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:20,800
Get discounts

2039
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:22,336
If you

2040
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:24,128
But he wouldn't he wouldn't be like

2041
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,152
I would be great if you

2042
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:27,968
Getting people on auto-ship

2043
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:31,296
Cancel auto-ship

2044
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:34,112
For now

2045
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:35,904
Anyway

2046
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:38,976
Is a powerful Ally for us

2047
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:41,024
Another

2048
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:42,560
Bad

2049
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:55,872
Hydrocele

2050
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:04,576
ICare

2051
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:05,600
Okay

2052
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:12,000
70% of Americans

2053
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:34,272
We live in a society right now who doesn't have it

2054
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:40,672
Nala Gianna, I mean literally all day long I mean

2055
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:45,536
All over the place right

2056
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:51,936
The might be helpful

2057
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:58,592
Alex

2058
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,560
You should not be making all those decisions

2059
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:24,960
There's two big decisions

2060
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,824
What a pile of s***

2061
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,104
Ridiculous

2062
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:31,872
Is heartbreak

2063
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:35,456
Yeah really hard phrases to print

2064
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:42,112
Just just go look you lost

2065
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:42,880
Kill his legacy

2066
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:48,768
Yeah overall of his listeners along with this day are going to blame him for

2067
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:55,168
No quit just just right off to the side not the action of somebody who intends to be

2068
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:55,936
Around 4.

2069
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:58,752
Prudently and this will catch up

2070
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,544
Absolutely

2071
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,384
Customers is listeners will sign up

2072
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,432
And you will end up losing a bunch

2073
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:09,760
Money or making none and losing it because they've had to pay into

2074
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:13,344
Yep and then they're going to blame Alex and then go be why did you

2075
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,368
Misdirection

2076
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:15,392
You son of a b****

2077
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:17,440
This is this is a really bad thing

2078
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:18,464
But

2079
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,488
You know like

2080
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,024
This the right one of Hickory

2081
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:22,048
But I think you stop

2082
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,840
Which actor group or intends to

2083
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:26,144
Is that list of product

2084
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,168
They're all dupla

2085
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:30,752
The product yourself

2086
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:35,104
Solutions that Alex already offers with the global

2087
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:36,128
Center products

2088
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:36,896
Betty cell

2089
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:38,432
So I don't see a reason to

2090
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:40,224
Duplicate

2091
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:41,504
But they're only

2092
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:42,528
Cannibalize each other

2093
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:44,320
If you want to sell

2094
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:45,088
Something

2095
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:46,368
They will help with sleep

2096
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:47,648
You sell p.m.

2097
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:48,416
Knockout

2098
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:52,000
Now a little bit later in this infomercial Alex talks about

2099
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:53,280
PM is better than

2100
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:54,560
Really

2101
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:55,584
That leads me to believe

2102
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:56,864
For sure

2103
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:58,912
Newzjunky

2104
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:00,192
Which is probably a SmartThings

2105
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:01,984
Do because you don't need the rmd

2106
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:03,520
You don't need the production

2107
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:04,288
Capabilities

2108
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:05,824
You can cut costs on that end

2109
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:07,616
Whatever

2110
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:08,896
Chipping into doctor group

2111
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:09,920
Develop the product

2112
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:10,688
Whatever

2113
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,456
Paying him

2114
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:12,480
4

2115
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:14,272
Branding and license

2116
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:15,552
Like that

2117
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:17,088
Maybe some of that goes away

2118
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:18,368
I don't know

2119
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:19,904
I don't know what kind of deal he's worked out with

2120
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:21,696
Do not but probably a sweetheart deal

2121
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:22,976
But also

2122
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:24,256
Genesis the only kind

2123
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:26,304
The company that will probably get in bed without

2124
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:27,328
Yeah

2125
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,608
Volumes about both

2126
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:35,520
So all this is bad

2127
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:38,848
Not a multi-level

2128
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:40,640
Products

2129
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:42,432
Fortunately with

2130
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:43,456
A minute

2131
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:44,480
The same clip

2132
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:45,760
Then explain

2133
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:48,320
Multi-level marketing

2134
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:49,856
He contradicts himself within the course

2135
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:53,696
Blisters to know

2136
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:04,192
I think people

2137
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:16,736
Lifestyle

2138
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:29,792
To dominate in the United States

2139
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:31,328
Western

2140
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:36,960
About to get novice

2141
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:43,360
We know what's going on

2142
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:44,128
Business model

2143
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:46,688
Person

2144
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:54,624
Where where

2145
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:02,816
Right off into the sunset

2146
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:08,448
Also the business model is really the big product

2147
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:11,008
The big product is

2148
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:12,288
The business the business

2149
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:17,920
Now I want to talk to you

2150
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:20,480
So we already talked about how the owners

2151
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:21,760
Founders of Jeanette

2152
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:23,552
I also got in trouble for running

2153
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:25,344
Fraudulent

2154
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,112
Before this

2155
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:28,416
But also according to truth-in-advertising

2156
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:29,696
Quotes close to

2157
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:31,232
Complaints have been filed with

2158
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:33,536
Florida Attorney General's office

2159
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:34,816
Regarding jeunesse

2160
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:36,352
The vast majority of complaints

2161
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:37,376
Concern problems

2162
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:38,400
Refunds

2163
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:39,936
Enclaves at Janessa's a pyramid

2164
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:40,704
Endorphins

2165
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:44,032
Jeanette is or has been involved in at least six

2166
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:44,800
Lawsuits

2167
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:46,080

Class action lawsuit

2169
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:48,896
It alleges the company is operating

2170
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:49,664
Pyramid scheme

2171
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,456
Aging and racketeering

2172
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:53,760
This

2173
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:54,784
Tobias

2174
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:56,064
Is very

2175
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:57,600
Very clearly setup

2176
01:52:59,136 --> 01:53:01,440
Quote new genesse Distributors are required to

2177
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:02,720
Battery starter

2178
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:04,000
For 4995

2179
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:08,096
Next are encouraged in the strongest possible way to jump-start there

2180
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:08,864
Business by purchasing

2181
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:09,632
The product pack

2182
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:12,192
Which ranges in price from about $200

2183
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:12,960
To 1800

2184
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:13,984
Flag

2185
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:18,336
Not surprisingly many Distributors are encouraged to buy the most expensive $1,800

2186
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:21,920
Successful

2187
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:22,688
Operators

2188
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:25,248
Explains it's a no-brainer

2189
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:27,808
Because it's

2190
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:29,856
Catapults for levels up

2191
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:36,512
Compensation structure of Fire

2192
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:46,240
Steven Universe in addition to this there's a 1995

2193
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:52,640
Flag was a minimum $85 a month

2194
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:55,200
Distributor discount

2195
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:58,016
$1,000 a year not including the introductory package

2196
01:53:58,528 --> 01:54:00,576
But you have to pay for the privilege of annoying your friend

2197
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:02,112
And here's the issue

2198
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:04,416
I just pretty much always the case with business

2199
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:06,208
Is there setup is multi-level marketing

2200
01:54:07,488 --> 01:54:08,768
Their products are very

2201
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:11,328
So buying them yourself doesn't really make sense

2202
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,352
But it starts

2203
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:15,168
Look more appealing when you consider the discount you be making

2204
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:16,192
If you were distributor

2205
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:20,544
Agreed to sell the product to your friends and family makes a product that we're want

2206
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,336
Come within your price range

2207
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:24,384
This is a very intentional strategy

2208
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:25,408
Because businesses

2209
01:54:25,664 --> 01:54:28,480
Like jeunesse are not looking for customers to buy their product

2210
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:29,504
They're looking for people to

2211
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,528
Become distributors

2212
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:31,552
Because weather

2213
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:32,832
Succeed or fail is

2214
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:34,112
Distributors

2215
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:35,904
As that Tavares

2216
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:36,672
Successful

2217
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:39,232
Business owner through jeunesse Kim

2218
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:43,328
It's not about one person selling all the

2219
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:44,608
Cuz that's littering

2220
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,656
Trading time for money

2221
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:52,032
But this business model

2222
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:54,848
She even use the word linear

2223
01:54:55,104 --> 01:55:00,224
Somebody doing something he's in a straight line

2224
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:00,992
However

2225
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:03,296
If you have somebody at the top

2226
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:07,648
With multiple lines going down

2227
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:14,304
Almost some sort of triangle or

2228
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:16,352
Dimensional

2229
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:17,376
What would you describe

2230
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:19,168
I don't know if I could legally

2231
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:20,960
But

2232
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:23,264
Also trading time for money

2233
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:34,272
This business model is about building distribution in about creating well

2234
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:36,064
And then the third thing to do is to

2235
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:37,600
People how to teach other p

2236
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:41,184
And so

2237
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:46,048
Probably called you they don't have the quote from her

2238
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:49,376
Now another

2239
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,936
You know we is distributor

2240
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:52,704
You know we is

2241
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:57,056
Distributors we get product at wholesale and then they buy it

2242
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:02,944
So

2243
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:07,552
We get a little retail Commission

2244
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:13,952
Now that will be the smallest are you ever get okay

2245
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:19,328
I forgot about retail commissions for me

2246
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:24,704
I'm not in this to sell product I'm here to build a global distribution

2247
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:32,640
Search very clear what the business is about

2248
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:39,040
Pep talk elections

2249
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:43,648
In 2014

2250
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:44,672
19.6

2251
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:45,952
Distributors

2252
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:47,488
Income of $0

2253
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:48,768
66

2254
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:51,328
Earned under $1,000 an average of

2255
01:56:51,584 --> 01:56:52,096
230

2256
01:56:52,352 --> 01:56:53,120
Dollars in 92

2257
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:57,728
Only 1.1% of all Distributors made more than

2258
01:56:57,984 --> 01:56:58,752
$5,000

2259
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:01,824
And when you consider that 85

2260
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:02,848
Dollar

2261
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:05,408
Monthly minimum that you have to buy

2262
01:57:06,432 --> 01:57:08,992
Keep on board which is almost $1,000 a year

2263
01:57:10,016 --> 01:57:12,832
66% who earned under $1,000 a year

2264
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:15,136
Physically breaking even or still losing money

2265
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:17,440
6% of people

2266
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:21,280
Who have an income of 0 from there are several thousand dollars

2267
01:57:22,048 --> 01:57:22,560
Most likely

2268
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:23,840
You know it's sad

2269
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:24,864
That is

2270
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:26,400
Maybe the eggs

2271
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:27,936
Exact income structure of

2272
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:32,288
In 2017 they disclose their Commission in

2273
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:33,312
Information from

2274
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:35,104
Other information

2275
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:36,128
2014 is

2276
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:37,152
Publicly available

2277
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,432
It's not a good sign

2278
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:41,248
From Canada in 2017

2279
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,784
Do we find it

2280
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:43,552
3% of

2281
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:45,600
Distributors made under $1,000

2282
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:47,904
45%

2283
01:57:48,416 --> 01:57:48,928
Nothing

2284
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,720
Navigate none of those figures.

2285
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:53,280
To get the product

2286
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:54,048
Yeah of course

2287
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:57,632

I got a lot of these f****** products are over $140

2320

For some sort of like skin care cream

2321
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:12,640
Or something like that you could get something

2322
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:13,664
As good

2323
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,432

2324
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:16,480

Yep

2327
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:22,624
Or even go buy a boutique one for like 40 bucks

2328
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:25,440
Go to town

2329
01:59:25,696 --> 01:59:26,464
Yeah this is

2330
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:28,000
It's very discreet

2331
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:30,816
I got hate Alex

2332
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:33,120
2 years of my life talking about how are you

2333
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:41,824
Nick. Pity it's not.

2334
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:44,896
In the neighborhood of

2335
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:45,664
Disgust

2336
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:48,992
Like I know I've always been disgusted by his racial rhetoric

2337
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:50,016
Stuff like that

2338
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:53,344
Charmed

2339
01:59:53,856 --> 01:59:54,880
But he seems like a rap

2340
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:56,672
Stallion in many ways

2341
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:57,440
With his leg

2342
01:59:58,976 --> 01:59:59,744
But we laugh at all the time

2343
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:01,536
Like it's embarrassing

2344
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:03,840
Desperate but there's kind of a tart

2345
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:05,632
The Griff

2346
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:06,912
The Grinch

2347
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:11,008
Pyramid scheme

2348
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:14,336
No

2349
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:15,872
Yeah yeah yeah

2350
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:22,272
Really I'm willing to sell out all of my friends and fam

2351
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:25,344
Family

2352
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:26,880
Makes more money

2353
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:30,720
And then the guy that told him

2354
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:34,048
Giving up everything

2355
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:37,376
Payless

2356
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:39,424
For Alex it's not your friends and family

2357
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:40,704
It's your audience

2358
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:46,848
His wife's Tupperware party friends

2359
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:48,384
By the way

2360
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:52,480
We are about to launch our new knowledge by Tupperware

2361
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:58,880
Open up one side of it you burp it and then

2362
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:00,416
But I don't know how Toepperwein

2363
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:04,256
I'm very distracted cuz one of them

2364
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:07,584
Half of one of my eyes is going swimming

2365
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:09,376
I'm not sure why that is

2366
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:13,472
Talking about Tupperware I'll do that to a lot of

2367
02:01:13,728 --> 02:01:14,240
Perhaps

2368
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:17,568
We also have a line of makeup

2369
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:24,224
Drive around in a pink Corvettes sell makeup dismount on this here in a little bit

2370
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:25,248
Before we do we have to

2371
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:26,016
Two more clips

2372
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:27,296
Are just

2373
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:28,064
A bummer

2374
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:28,832
Disheartening

2375
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:29,856
Plexiglass

2376
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:33,184
This one isn't this one is Alex revealing a little bit too much

2377
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:35,232
Raise is a bunch

2378
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:36,000
Very serious

2379
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:50,336
Sponsorship drumming

2380
02:01:52,384 --> 02:01:58,528

2381

Everything

2382
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:03,392
Literally defeated

2383
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:05,440

2384
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:07,488
We're going to get a good Prada

2385
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:09,024
Pono

2386
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:10,816

2387
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:17,216
Become a distributor

2388
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:23,104
I feel good at a gut level

2389
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:32,320
God dammit

2390
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:37,696
Compressed multi-level marketing scheme

2391
02:02:39,232 --> 02:02:40,000
That's crazy

2392
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:45,632
I don't know if I've ever heard of a like a radio

2393
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:48,960
You've never heard of radio host who's personally selling

02:02:54,848 --> 02:02:57,920
This is banana it's pretty wild

2396
02:02:58,176 --> 02:03:04,320
This is a guy who's literally at the lowest he could possibly be in 2009 was not make

2397
02:03:04,576 --> 02:03:06,112
Working anywhere near as much

2398
02:03:07,136 --> 02:03:08,672
Even that Alex

2399
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,208
Real

2400
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:14,816
Pyramid scheme there's got to be a better way you want me to jump into pyramid scheme

2401
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:19,936
I'm selling jeans that might be the right size I'm fine with that

2402
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:23,008
I'm fine with that.

2403
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:24,800
It could be the right side

2404
02:03:25,312 --> 02:03:29,408
Pyramids

2405
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:31,200
Let me go probably veto that

2406
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:36,320
This is weird this is actually not both of

2407
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:39,136
Very concerned

2408
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:43,488

02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:48,096
O'Reilly's

2410
02:03:48,352 --> 02:03:48,864
Definitely

2411
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:51,424
You're missing one of the big points

2412
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:55,264
The millions of dollars

2413
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:56,800
To promote

2414
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:00,128
But also

2415
02:04:02,688 --> 02:04:03,200
Who

2416
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:05,760
Who's offering you that money Alex

2417
02:04:06,784 --> 02:04:09,856
And you're he's even recognizing in there that I got out of the lot of these

2418
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:10,624
Pump-and-dump

2419
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:11,904
Yes

2420
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:12,672
Yes Alex

2421
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:13,952
Yes

2422
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:15,232
And you know

2423
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:16,768
Who's running them based on

2424
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:23,168
Who was trying to get you to promote them because Alex Jones promoting it would be part of the pump

2425
02:04:24,448 --> 02:04:27,264
If Alex work to promote those

2426
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:30,848
He would be the one who would

2427
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:32,384
No

2428
02:04:32,896 --> 02:04:35,456
Would be letting on Wednesday

2429
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:38,016
Do you think you would I think that's why he's

2430
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:44,416
I think that's why he's more susceptible to the 36th Street

2431
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:49,792
Of the scam the scam being scammed on this

2432
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:52,864
Can actually understand

2433
02:04:54,912 --> 02:04:56,192
Bitcoin cryptocurrency

2434
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:59,008
He wasn't willing to jump in on the ground floor the scam

2435
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:00,288
But this scam

2436
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:01,312
Is supplement

2437
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:03,616
He's like this is my skin

2438
02:05:03,872 --> 02:05:06,432
Braintrace giving me a new way to scare mice

2439
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:12,064

Look we're going to Warehouse

2445
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,872
We can talk about the present-day much anymore I think

2446
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:37,664
Maybe too much of a bummer and Alex

2447
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:39,200
Pathetic shell of a man

02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:41,248
Yeah

2449
02:05:41,504 --> 02:05:44,576

Most people are out there they wanted

2475
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:44,128
Walmart

2476
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:50,784
My God

2477
02:08:03,072 --> 02:08:09,216
Who in the world

2478
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:14,080
Alex I think send it to

2479
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:16,384
Oh my God

2480
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:17,408
Goodbye Alex

2481
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:19,200
Oh my God

2482
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:21,248
Heartbreak

2483
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:23,808
This is really heartbreaking

2484
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:27,904
The river basically like what you have

2485
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:31,488
Like I said already it in the episode his audience is going

2486
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:33,280
Going to Fair exactly as well as

2487
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:35,328
Is the average Junior

2488
02:08:35,584 --> 02:08:36,352
Distributor does

2489
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:38,656
Fairway worst

2490
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:41,472
Caswell because

2491
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:43,008
Terrible average already

2492
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:47,616
Let's

2493
02:08:48,384 --> 02:08:49,408
They're going to blame Alex

2494
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:50,432
And he deserves it

2495
02:08:50,688 --> 02:08:51,712
Because he just sold them

2496
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:58,112
To do not blame

2497
02:08:58,368 --> 02:08:59,392
Did is transmute

2498
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:01,440
All of his audience

2499
02:09:01,696 --> 02:09:02,720
Is attention that he has left

2500
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:05,024
Whatever haven't shipped

2501
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:06,304
He just took that

2502
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:08,608
And said jeunesse will you buy this

2503
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:11,424
Will You by The credibility that I have left

2504
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:12,192
With my audience

2505
02:09:12,448 --> 02:09:13,984
Yeah in order to get them to

2506
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:17,312
Try it maybe sign up for your thing through website that is

2507
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:19,104
Call Infowars yes

2508
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:23,456
You still thinking has the Alex Jones credibility

2509
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:24,992
And once you do that

2510
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:30,368
I don't know I don't know how you can get it back once it goes bad for so many people

2511
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:31,136
Cuz it's going

2512
02:09:31,392 --> 02:09:37,536
Like I don't know you can do you know what this is the end for Alex Wright

2513
02:09:37,792 --> 02:09:39,840
I can see this going down a direction where he

2514
02:09:40,352 --> 02:09:45,216
Recover from that but this is what I think is fascinating about the multi-level marketing

2515
02:09:45,472 --> 02:09:47,520
Scheme being applied to Alex

2516
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:48,544
Is that

2517
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:54,176
For the first time that I again I don't know of radio host are like

2518
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:58,784
Tucker Carlson isn't f****** part of a Avon or whatever it is right

2519
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:01,088
I've never seen this before where in

2520
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:02,880
The blank can be shifted

2521
02:10:03,648 --> 02:10:04,160
So

2522
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:04,928
Easily

2523
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:06,464
To the f****** glue

2524
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:08,768
To the f****** globalist or whatever

2525
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:09,792
See I don't see that

2526
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:13,376
I don't see it I don't see it being possible either but his listeners

2527
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:14,400
Stupid

2528
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:17,984
Start losing

2529
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:20,800
Scant amount of money that they owe

2530
02:10:21,056 --> 02:10:23,616
Did they put into this I don't see you

2531
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:25,664
Hey Alex

2532
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:26,688
Why did you

2533
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:28,736
Start researching

2534
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:32,064
Into other reviews of the company

2535
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:35,392
If you're Alex Jones listener you're not researching a goddamn

2536
02:10:35,904 --> 02:10:37,952
Generally not but if some company

2537
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:42,048
You lose a bunch of money to realize you got caught up in a base

2538
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:44,096
Exploit

2539
02:10:44,352 --> 02:10:46,656
Business relationship I think you might look at

2540
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:50,240
Did this happen to a bunch of other people and then when you see that yes

2541
02:10:50,496 --> 02:10:51,008
It does

2542
02:10:51,264 --> 02:10:52,544
Announces every read

2543
02:10:53,824 --> 02:10:54,336
The exact

2544
02:10:54,848 --> 02:10:55,872
Percentages that I read

2545
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:59,968
That are real that are from disclosures from jeunesse themselves

2546
02:11:00,224 --> 02:11:00,736
Alex

2547
02:11:02,016 --> 02:11:03,296
And the fact that he's still

2548
02:11:03,552 --> 02:11:04,064
Trying to get

2549
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:05,088
His customers

2550
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:05,856
His listeners

2551
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:06,880
You are custom

2552
02:11:07,136 --> 02:11:07,648
Yeah

2553
02:11:08,928 --> 02:11:10,208
To get them on board with it means

2554
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:12,256
He's fine with the idea that 80

2555
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:13,536
We're going to get fuc

2556
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:17,120
I've never seen a pyramid

2557
02:11:17,376 --> 02:11:18,400
Scheme applied to a

2558
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:22,496
That's the fascinating thing about this

2559
02:11:22,752 --> 02:11:25,824
It's never like

2560
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:29,152
If you don't buy these knives then the globalist win

2561
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:32,480
Like I've never heard

2562
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:37,600
Because that's real pictures

2563
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:39,392
Work on Alex's audience

2564
02:11:39,904 --> 02:11:42,208
And it's not going to work the next step

2565
02:11:42,464 --> 02:11:43,232
Which is the audience

2566
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:44,512
Trying to sell it to other

2567
02:11:44,768 --> 02:11:47,328
Of course not

2568
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:50,912
Get their friends

2569
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:53,216
Family to listen to Alex

2570
02:11:53,728 --> 02:11:55,520
He's right there's no way they're going to be able to you

2571
02:11:55,776 --> 02:11:58,336
Use Alex's rhetoric to sell them product they don't need

2572
02:11:58,848 --> 02:12:00,128
It's going to be a disaster

2573
02:12:00,896 --> 02:12:01,408
But that's

2574
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:07,808
Who gives a s*** about them having obviously obviously

2575
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:10,112
Eventually was going to be

2576
02:12:10,368 --> 02:12:11,392
There's going to eventually

2577
02:12:12,416 --> 02:12:17,536
But that's the insulation that Alex has that other pyramid schemes don't have is that

2578
02:12:17,792 --> 02:12:21,120
The blowback has to go towards someone else it doesn't go back to

2579
02:12:21,376 --> 02:12:27,520
Infowars it goes back to the globalist it goes back to

2580
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:28,544
Spelling of Dan

2581
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:31,104
I think because of the economic

2582
02:12:32,128 --> 02:12:33,152
To come to his listeners

2583
02:12:33,408 --> 02:12:34,176
They're going to try

2584
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:35,200
Differently

2585
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:36,480
Then the Ops

2586
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:38,272
Can do in general

2587
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:41,344
I don't think that he's going to be able to weasel out of this

2588
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:47,744
I don't know dear Republicans consistently root weasel out of age

2589
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:48,512
For the rich

2590
02:12:48,768 --> 02:12:51,072
I understand that and I don't know my predictions are

2591
02:12:51,328 --> 02:12:52,352
Generally officer

2592
02:12:52,608 --> 02:12:53,120
Who f****** nose

2593
02:12:53,376 --> 02:12:55,424
Who f****** nose when is my eyes really

2594
02:12:55,936 --> 02:12:58,752
Starting to freak me out

2595
02:12:59,008 --> 02:12:59,520
Because I

2596
02:13:00,032 --> 02:13:01,312
Think I'm going blind

2597
02:13:01,824 --> 02:13:07,968
Call Chacha.

2598
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:12,576
For now but will see you when I wake up tomorrow tomorrow

2599
02:13:13,344 --> 02:13:14,880
I don't know what I mean

2600
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:16,928
Yeah but

2601
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:21,280
But it's f****** really weird right now you had a lot of caffeine

2602
02:13:21,792 --> 02:13:22,560
You just drank a kick-start

2603
02:13:23,584 --> 02:13:29,728
Are you a hundred percent believe that's what started it still f****** with my hair

2604
02:13:36,384 --> 02:13:42,528
Brilliant that's where you should go really it's really great I I jump in and out of the group

2605
02:13:42,784 --> 02:13:43,296
They're like

2606
02:13:43,808 --> 02:13:45,088
The most amazing thing

2607
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:47,136
To me is whatever somebody to

2608
02:13:47,904 --> 02:13:48,416
Shows up in his eye

2609
02:13:49,184 --> 02:13:50,720
I just found the show

2610
02:13:50,976 --> 02:13:57,120
I'm a part of the group

2611
02:13:58,400 --> 02:13:59,936
Who sign up for the

2612
02:14:00,192 --> 02:14:01,216

02:14:19,392 --> 02:14:19,904
Getting better

2620
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:24,512
It's starting to wear off

2621
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:29,120
Add somebody who is my God

2622
02:14:29,376 --> 02:14:35,520
I do 36 years old

2623
02:14:35,776 --> 02:14:38,592
I work glasses for having like

2624
02:14:38,848 --> 02:14:41,664
A little bit of blurry vision in all you do

2625
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:45,504
You don't know what this was it look like a dragon

2626
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:51,904
In the corner of my eye

2627
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:53,184
It was still there because like

2628
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,280
Coronavirus

2629
02:14:57,792 --> 02:14:59,328
Red Dragon

2630
02:15:00,608 --> 02:15:01,120
No

2631
02:15:01,632 --> 02:15:03,424
Sort of

2632
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:06,496
This is really troubling I shouldn't have brought it up

2633
02:15:06,752 --> 02:15:12,896
Yeah I know but it's it's a bit more severe than General

2634
02:15:13,152 --> 02:15:14,688
I'm sorry

2635
02:15:14,944 --> 02:15:19,296
ITunes

2636
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:20,576
Alex

2637
02:15:20,832 --> 02:15:26,464
Is there something important we should know about this pyramid scheme loving motherfuker I almost feel like this is worse

2638
02:15:27,232 --> 02:15:31,840
But something else that he's done that might not be as bad as selling out his audiences

2639
02:15:32,608 --> 02:15:33,632
I would probably kill today

2640
02:15:38,496 --> 02:15:42,336
