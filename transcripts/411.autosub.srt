1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important sweat it

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for its knowledge by now I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,832
Dollartree.com

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,720
Hey everybody welcome back to the fight knowledge I'm Jordan

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
This is a podcast where I start making up nonsense about people and we see what

6
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,656
What happened okay

7
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
Hi Jordan

8
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,240
I got a question for you what's that

9
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
What is your thing for the day that is brightening your spirits in this trying time we all find ourselves

10
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,200
Are you I have been

11
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,992
It is

12
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,320
Good to spend time with my partner

13
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,368
I love her very much

14
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,160
Cheese

15
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,720
Kinda you know we're all kind of getting used to this

16
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
Circumstance by

17
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,072
Having her

18
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,864
Has really made this a lot

19
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,912
Lot easier

20
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:47,264
How about you happy for you

21
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,688
Emotionally resonant I stumbled across some videos on YouTube

22
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Motocross videos

23
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:59,296
On YouTube by this this pro skateboarder from

24
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,832
Jonny Giger

25
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:07,232
Okay and what are you does is a series of videos where he he's a professional skateboarders

26
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:13,632
Okay he's trying to recreate the tricks that Rodney Mullen did these really gif

27
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,400
Difficult tricks

28
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,728
From my classic skate videos to do them himself

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,544
And I I find them so

30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,568
Endearing

31
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,920
Seems like a pretty cool guy is good bright personality

32
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,504
And one of the things I really like about these videos is that

33
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,808
The really a celebration of process

34
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,368
Okay you see him fail like repeatedly

35
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,440
I like trying to figure out how to do the trick

36
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:42,816
It was like a long learning curve through it and then the eventual payoff of

37
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,840
Hard work

38
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
Love

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,264
You know winning out and he does the tricks right so it's going to be impossible to write

40
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,664
Right and perseverance pushing through when you fall over and over and over and over and over again

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,456
The other thing too

42
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,528
Is like through that failure you see the

43
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,064
The incremental progress

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,464
You see you like oh that little part of the trick he's figured out now how to do that still falling at the end

45
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
Brighton

46
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,072
Really I really enjoy it

47
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,632
Just posted the successful trip

48
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:24,288
He probably would have gotten a s*** ton of use out of that people watch all those little Clips at on your way better in the

49
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,336
Structure

50
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:32,736
And enjoyed it's been night it's like outdoors and Switzerland gorgeous it looks nice

51
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,528
Music

52
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:40,928
I've no idea who this dude is I never heard of him until a couple days ago but I can't stop watching these videos

53
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
We tried to recreate these tricks

54
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
That's really cool

55
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,560
Shout out to Jonny Giger do you know him

56
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:54,752
That's a different place. I don't know what that means

57
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
That's my bad

58
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,312
Yeah that's alright

59
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
Anyways

60
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,688
Dan I've taken over

61
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,784
Yep that's true doing a reverse fight knowledge episode

62
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,832
And I figured

63
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:15,232
That since we talked almost done I'm done with Marc Moreno by the way

64
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,375

I'm a policy wonk

75
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:05,151
I just learned as a man posted that Rodger stone is on Cameo and

76
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,711
If you can pay him to record those messages

77
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,807
Very close

78
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,647
It's over for Humanity

79
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:20,511
I've been trying to think of what I would want Rodger Stone to say and it's

80
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:25,631
You know I feel like there's already a body of a lot of things I want to hear it

81
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,703
I think I would just want to have him read a list of words

82
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
Just like completely out of

83
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,567
Poopy pants

84
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,359
I just enjoy it I would love

85
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,151
I think I might end up

86
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,967
And I can't justify that furniture.

87
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,343
Thank you so much

88
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:50,463

89
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,487
Arbonne

90
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
Thank you so much

91
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,655
You are now ecology walk

92
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:06,335
Website dollartree.com

93
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:12,735
Here we go

94
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:17,343
This is your third

95
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,743
Listen to of them have been complaining about Marc Martel

96
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,839
Expecting that that's what you're going to talk about and honestly name

97
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,935
I have no idea what you're about to tell me about

98
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:38,335
Here is here's what I want to talk about since we have talked to almost exclusively about people who

99
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,359
Who either

100
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,663
Don't believe in what they're saying

101
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,295
Maybe believe in what they're saying but either way are acting completely differently and then what the

102
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,391
I wanted to see what would happen if we talked about people who actually believe what they're taught

103
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,719
I also I see your name

104
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,303
And here and I hope it's who I think it is but I'm sure it's not

105
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:04,703
Might as well go ahead and play

106
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,151
Okay you know we're talkin about

107
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:19,551
I'm not entirely sure I'm a night that he has the voice of the televangelist he is a televangelist

108
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:25,695
I went the opposite direction with this day actually believe what they say I thought you meant it was someone who has a good

109
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:32,095
Absolutely no I thought this was going to be like an uplifting these people are

110
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,679
Not sure who this fella is

111
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
I know it's not Pat Robertson

112
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,055
I know it's not Jack Van Impe

113
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
I don't know

114
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:50,015
It is Robert Jeffers okay I heard that name of that guy

115
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,551
Baptist Church of Dallas

116
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,599
And I

117
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:58,975
I started looking into him because I wanted to talk about

118
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:03,327
Religion or something along those lines I was looking for something to talk about

119
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,375
And I have this idea of what if we

120
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
What are we talking about if we

121
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
We talked about somebody who believes weather

122
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:15,103
So when I talk about belief I don't know if dr. Robert Jeffers or any I'm going to talk about a few televangelists

123
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,199
I don't know if they actually in their heart of hearts believe this b*******

124
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:25,087
But the guys that I am going to talk about have all actually live

125
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
Their lives

126
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,903
According to these

127
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
So

128
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,231
All the time

129
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
Sort of like Bill Cooper

130
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,071
Dying the way he did

131
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Kind of

132
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:41,727
Indication of living by the things I don't know if they believe it or not but they are

133
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,519
Professional believer

134
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
Walking the walk

135
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,871
Every single day they are paid to wake up

136
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,175
And acts as though they are

137
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,247
The most Christian people in the world and that's that's what they do

138
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
So as far as

139
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,111
Belief goes that's what I'm talkin

140
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,647
Talking about knots do they think that is

141
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
It's 104

142
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:06,559
All right and I'm talking about specifically dr. Robert Jeffers

143
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,863
Is a Fox News

144
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,959
He is the TV Guide that you go to if you want

145
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,007
Any defense of trump

146
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,567
From any religion any attack

147
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,383
He will defend Trump doing

148
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,783
There's a lot of religious folks has less toxicity to him then like Jim Bakker

149
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:33,439
Okay absolutely you can slot him in on a TV show

150
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,279
Color clean

151
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:42,143
I've researched this guy for like the past 2 days Non-Stop

152
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,191
And by all accounts

153
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,751
He is an incredibly sweet

154
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,311
Nice kind human being

155
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
Who has the most

156
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
Vicious awful

157
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
Thoughts and like

158
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,967
He has Charmed journalists after

159
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,503
The journalist was Gone with him

160
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,831
Like I'm going to work with a guy named Michael Muhney

161
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,879
A lot of his work and he's

162
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,487
Basically like lived with Jeffers for a while to see what's going on

163
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,631
Do you know where you get that sense from like what does Louis Theroux documentaries he goes in the

164
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,215
Like all these people are terrible but some of them are kind of nice to write

165
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,519
This guy is a

166
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
Sleep cycle

167
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,639
Like what these televangelists do is

168
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
TV

169
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
Like they do it

170
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Cuz they're good at

171
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,039
You guys aren't like guys who love the Griff

172
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,135
They're like like Alex is like a kamikaze

173
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
Hustling all the

174
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:40,255
Trying to sneak onto gigs trying to find every possible way

175
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,071
Selling merch after the shows that kind of stuff

176
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,911
The televangelist that I'm talking about are more like

177
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,007
They're just really talented performers I didn't want the spotlight Zach

178
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,847
They're really good at and they're paid because they're talented performer

179
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,151
To your point though

180
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,431
I think the Alex

181
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,831
Primarily is only grinding and selling merch after the shows because he was pursuing the Limelight

182
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:11,231
Overextended himself to the point where he now has a giant Studio

183
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:17,375
That's probably true of a functional thing probably would be

184
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
As

185
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,703
Like attention grabby

186
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:33,503
As far as that goes that's it that's an interesting question except these guys are the ones who took the steps that get you there

187
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,783
Alex

188
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,343
So he was

189
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,951
That's probably true maybe I'll douching for a movie The Devil like

190
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
Mark Dice

191
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:50,655
Yeah I mean this guy is the guy who goes on Fox News and says Democrats worship Satan Mormonism is a cult

192
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:57,055
Got do a huge fight with Mitt Romney in 2008 because he said that Mormons were a cult and we could never vote for him

193
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:03,455
Jon Huntsman was a better Mormon exactly Steve song Steve

194
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,735
Vote for Mitt Romney

195
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
Is that car

196
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,111
And like all the televangelists he's written

197
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
A ridiculous number of book

198
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,183
Books that

199
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
I don't think anybody reads

200
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:21,119
Ever had one of those like a bulk purchases thing

201
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,447
Not clickbait titles like the most recent one is courageous

202
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,263
10 strategies for thriving in a hostile world

203
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:33,919
Then there's how can I know answers to Life's 7 most important question

204
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,271
Or God 7 secrets for success

205
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
Something like

206
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:45,951
Nobody's Renminbi Habits of Highly Effective People almost exactly I don't think anybody is ready

207
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,023
And all televangelists right this the exact same book

208
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,143
I bet I will have read it and I bet their Church small groups

209
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,679
I bet that certain groups

210
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,007
Churches like to get together and have a book study

211
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:05,407
Well and he's he's the pastor of a megachurch so he does have a captive audience there where it's like he can he owns the printing

212
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
Press the princess books

213
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,479
Sells them to the people who

214
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
Work at the printing press

215
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,855
That kind of thinks good good grip

216
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
Good

217
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,743
So I I wanted to find out where this dude comes

218
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,095
And as far as his early life there's really not much

219
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,167
Detail going on the biography that you keep getting his

220
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:30,751
Jeffrey's was Jeffers was raised in Dallas

221
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:35,103
At the age of seven who joined the First Baptist Church of Dallas

222
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,199
He was saved by

223
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,759
OT 64 now

224
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,807
So that puts us at

225
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
Houston Auto 7 years ago

226
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,183
So how long was he in Dallas

227
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:55,839
His whole career know not his whole career he was Raising Dallas up to Hills overlap with Alice

228
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Either

229
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,935
He's raising Dallas he goes to Baylor

230
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,495
So he's either Waco guy

231
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,567
This dude is First Baptist

232
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
All the way

233
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,407
And he was saved by legendary televangelists

234
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,711
Benny Hinn wa Criswell

235
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,759
The guy who established

236
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:18,623
Turn to the First Baptist Church of Dallas into basically the 1st

237
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Megachurch

238
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
And

239
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,743
I love you

240
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
Here's a little bit of crazy

241
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,839
We have a full program tonight

242
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,887
Shall We Begin

243
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
On the car

244
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,775
Liberalism

245
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,871
Sure that's how he starts

246
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
There you go

247
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,903
That's that's basically what we're talking about when you get down to it

248
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,719
And Criswell is

249
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
Like one of the biggest

250
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
Televangelists

251
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,351
And he's got that southern baptist tradition

252
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,911
That I absolutely

253
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:09,055
Mystify but I like I love it I really do I love listening to Southern Baptist preacher

254
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:13,919
As an energy to just just listen to him tell a story

255
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,735
Oklahoma and Texas play football

256
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
In the Cotton Bowl

257
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:23,647
I got it I got to stop already

258
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
Wear it in front of me

259
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
What's an Oklahoma fan

260
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
All about horse

261
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,703
Where he was

262
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,319
Didn't have any takers shutdown after

263
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:04,095
Nobody

264
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,895
He-Man

265
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,711
Ingeteam

266
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:30,719
Sounds like a little plumber sign became so sweet

267
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
That's very very Dusty Rhodes

268
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,351
Yeah is your name yelling about hard times

269
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:45,311
Daddy you putting up the road through some hard times

270
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,895
I'll times

271
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,479
Oh yeah but that is like

272
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
The good version of it

273
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:03,487
You do kind of scary preachers it's a bummer because it is a really infectious seductive

274
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
A manner of speaking

275
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,095
When is the pro wrestler who is the American dream

276
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:14,495
Perfect maybe his belly is a little too big maybe tiny little too big doesn't look like the athletes of the day but you know

277
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:20,895
No brother he's bad and they know he's bad and Ric Flair

278
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
Now you see why it's

279
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,527
Yeah it's so fun

280
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:33,183
It's almost in your DNA. Kind of like it's really

281
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:38,559
The Tent Revival in the world

282
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,887
I grew up in

283
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,191
Church background my family is a cult

284
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,983
Increase well was absolutely

285
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
In fact

286
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,615
Billy Graham was a member of Chris Wells Church

287
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,455
Like he brought Billy Graham into the fold and then I went to turn heel

288
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,975
I think Billy Graham might actually tried to put up the

289
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,279
Maybe try to get more watch

290
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,583
So yeah so griswell

291
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,119
Creates the modern maggots

292
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
Basically

293
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
And he's doing this

294
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,471
To build a

295
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
Compound

296
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,567
He is not building a megachurch he's building like 80

297
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:25,151
Sweet fertilization Baker's Morningside Zack

298
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
Jim Bakker

299
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,711
Is a fan of Criswell

300
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,807
But this is from

301
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:35,391
To give you an idea this guy is creating a Christian separatist

302
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,207
Compound essentially and this is from a sermon he gave in the

303
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:45,119
Christian education is education and environment of the mind and heart and will of our blessed

304
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,399
Lord it isn't inst

305
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,799
Tuschen it's a school where the faculty and the administration and the trustees and the classes in the environment and

306
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,335
Most of the student body are all Chris

307
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,127
I don't know why I said most

308
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,919
51 doll of Idaho Drive

309
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:04,575
Putting most in there seems so ridiculous to me in a couple non-christians in order for there to be game

310
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,439
Yeah like 5% non-Christian

311
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,255
End of the term

312
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,095
The 97%

313
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:21,727
Voted for me where you need

314
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:26,335
To keep things interesting that he's turning the school into a into a

315
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:32,479
The Most Dangerous Game

316
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:38,879
Spiritually I know from my time at a Baptist mega church that a lot of the

317
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,671
Thing that seem to animate

318
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
The faith

319
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:47,583
Folks within the church evangelism part of it really seemed

320
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,863
To give it meaning

321
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,679
So I would believe it if you wanted to create this

322
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:55,263
Christian only environment in your someone like this guy

323
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,591
You let in five 8% non-Christian

324
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,871
In order to give people

325
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:04,223
Convert you got to have somebody to chase feeding pets

326
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:10,879
Well I mean there's a certain section of the the student body that's probably going to need that I'll record dealers snakes

327
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,463
Until every now and then you got to throw a mouse in there for them to I got you

328
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,047
You're not wrong

329
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,375
And he basically created that

330
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,703
He created this and Robert Jeffers

331
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,983
Is the result

332
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
Of an education

333
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,335
Completely controlled by wa Chris

334
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,919
He I swear to you he is like an experiment

335
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:38,783
The more I've looked into him he was groomed by Criswell from the age of seven

336
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,319
He is an absolute.

337
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,343
Otamatone

338
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,159
He's not a human being he's a psychopath

339
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,463
And he is the most terrifying man alive

340
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,255
Cuz he believes

341
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Everything

342
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
I bet he is told

343
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,351
Viagra's

344
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
So

345
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,191
He's raised by Creswell

346
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,239
Goes to Baylor

347
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:03,359
Immediately out of Baylor gets hired right back at First Baptist Church in Dallas

348
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:08,479
Works there for a few years then he goes to become the head pastor at First Baptist in East Windsor

349
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,783
Which course will help him get the job

350
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,159
Then after that he becomes head pastor at First Baptist Church in Wichita in Texas

351
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
Which he

352
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,488
God because of the grizzly

353
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
Wichita Falls

354
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,536
Yeah

355
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,328
And then in 2007

356
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,632
5 years after Criswell died

357
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,448
Jeffers became head pastor of First Baptist

358
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,264
Doesn't Dallas and took over like this was

359
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,336
The king coming home to this is f****** Simba

360
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,616
I'm in Baton Rouge

361
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,640
Yeah

362
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,688
And he is relentless

363
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,968
Andynsane

364
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,064
And I couldn't find any early sermons of his whenever he was

365
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,856
You know before

366
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
First Baptist

367
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
However

368
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
He did go on

369
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
Card sharks

370
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,512
I like that game in 1986

371
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:59,168
Have a great game and you wouldn't find it charts the one where it's just high low

372
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:04,288
It's absolutely just I love I love that no it's great but here's the thing that I forgot about car charger

373
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,128
Like survey questions like Family Feud

374
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
And

375
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,456
Everybody is I think incourage

376
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,480
To give a weird

377
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:18,624
Personal tidbit before they give their answer for the survey question

378
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
So

379
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,696
You find out a lot of weird information about people

380
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:29,888
People eyes were surveyed how many people eat tacos in the last month is it over 40% or

381
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:36,288
Thunder and then they put out like the playing cards and you have like a 7 on there

382
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,152
That's a whole game

383
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,432
Yep I

384
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,968
Love it

385
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,784
It is incredibly stupid

386
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,064
You can't go back and watch

387
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,160
Children behavior like that if you win you get like

388
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,464
I don't know

389
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,864
How do you get a beach ball Ono at the end of this he went on like a few episodes

390
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,168
Roundup winning about $4,500

391
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,472
Region 19

392
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,752
That's not bad

393
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,056
It's it's wild to go back and watch shows

394
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
From the 80s

395
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
Can't do it

396
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:16,480
They they wind up doing all kinds of weird cuz I can't watch any kind of stuff from like

397
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:21,344
Any any of those

398
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,232
It's like oh my gosh I absolutely

399
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,048
The the post of the show

400
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,608
Has kissing people

401
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,656
You got 10

402
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
And who knows them as such

403
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,216
10 college co-ed

404
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:42,080
Who are asked to sit up next to the stage like Price is Right

405
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
Oh yeah

406
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,664
All right that's why they're called college co-ed

407
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
The 80s that you knew what the

408
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:52,064
Never understood that co-educational means it's men and women I know but it's always

409
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,952
It always describes I think it's more like I think it was popularized Maybe by playboy because

410
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:04,352
It was women that you wouldn't actually went to school with and not Audible

411
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
Some like that

412
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,936
10 ladies and women

413
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,216
They were surveyed

414
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,032
How many of you would kiss on the 1st

415
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,568
Okay

00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,104

66 women

420
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,808
Would actually kiss on the first date

421
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,368
The guy a Starboy Robert

422
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,928
Robert says the number is higher and then this

423
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,048
Everybody

424
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,400

But

435
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,720
It is wild to me that

436
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:09,376
David Buster who would later on go on Fox News who would give a sermon about homosexual should be killed

437

482
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,728
In the in the course of asking questions

483
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,752
They'll ask you like

484
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,568
We surveyed 100 people

485
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:03,968
One of them said how many do you think said they send you say well as it's 60 or more but you have to give a personal

486
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,504
Note to your tacos

487

To date a lot of college

494
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,248
I'm convinced they were in love

495
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,272
With more than one person

496
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,040
At that time

497
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,624
Navigation and they

00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648

00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,072
Marriage

In counseling people and I think I'm a pretty good judge

509
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,336
Character

510
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,896

511
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
Frisby doctor

512
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
Egotist

00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:09,760
Soap operas

515
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,856
Today and some into and they tend to fantasize a lot

516
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,160
I used to live in an apartment

517
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,464
And things got pretty

518
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,744
Grungy there

519
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:26,656
The grungy the audio is

520
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:30,496
From YouTube there but I don't find anything

521
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,264

522
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:36,128
Weird about it I mean it's a little grandiose who like I'm basically a psychiatrist

523
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,272
Dated a lot of ladies and that's just Alex and you f***** all the satanic cheerleaders stuff

524
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,296
But

525
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:49,696
The only details that I can find from anybody about his young

526
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,464
Younger years

527
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,144
No I don't know I don't know how much of anything is true but this is this is all stuff that he believes that

528
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,192
Part of this end this entire time

529
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,984
He is TV ready

530
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,824
And you see it the moment he goes on the show because

531
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
He was trained

532
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,664
By the televangelist

533
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,504
He was raised to be on TV this is a guy who is up

534
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,784
Sast with TV

535
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,320

00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,752
Alien creatures have landed on the Earth

547
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
Imagine a lot of

548
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,872
Converse

549
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,944
Look at that new TV The Killing

550
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,224
You're doing but

551
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
Probably not one

552
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Want to admit it

553
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,320
Even if they did believe

554
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,112
Because of the wreck

555
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,392
Applications

556
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,928
Bi-Lo number of

557
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,464
22

558
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,256
22 out of 100

559
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:02,144
That's a pretty good that rationalization for your gas if he's TV ready he's Direct

560
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,960
He's got the timing down

561
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,240
The The Host

562
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,520
F****** love song

563
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,592
They are cracking jokes back and forth the entirety

564
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,688
Now he's he's got a person you'd want on their armies against type

565
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:17,504
He's charming and charismatic

566
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:23,904
Seems to be fine in that setting of no he's a preacher going to like it

567
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
Unique

568
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,720
Contestant absolutely

569
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,816
And while he's doing all of this he is preaching the most homophobic

570
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,376
Like HIV is gods

571
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:39,776
Plan for gay people like this is all going on in Macon on Karcher

572
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,616
All of this stuff is happening at the same time as this incredibly nice

573
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:47,456
Charming and funny guy is on TV doing what he is the best

574
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,504
And I like I said I

575
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,832
Read a lot from Michael Muhney about him and he's

576
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,904
This is one of the quotes that he gives from a 2012 Proto

577
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
Profile

578
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,976
This is me Monique

579
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:03,072
In the days I spent with him sometimes from sunrise to sunset

580
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:06,656
He convinced me that that bright-eyed Schoolboy Persona is not a nap

581
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,472
He decided very early on that he was a Christian

582
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,264
And though he's grown intellectually

583
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,056
Yes several postgraduate.

584
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
Degrees in theology

585
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,128
He has never changed his mind

586
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,408
On anything

587
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
Ever

588
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,504
That said he still enjoys the company of people who see the world

589
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
That guy

590
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
Very scary

591
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:30,464
We are so used to disingenuous people in this world

592
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,816
Specifically that you can see why it's easy to be Charmed by a guy like

593
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,352
Dr. Robert Jeffress

594
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,632
Because he's

595
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,400
He's getting

596
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
Like

597
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:43,008
This guy has spent this is a journalist who has worked with

598
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,824
He's a Dallas journalism

599
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,384
Been through the whole ringer with all of these f******

600
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,432
Liars in

601
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,968
Bulshit artist in that

602
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,504
Jeffers

603
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,528
Absolutely

604
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,832
Like without question

605
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,392
Because

606
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,672
He is

607
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:04,256
Genuinely genuinely believes all this s*** he is

608
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:07,840
Open-hearted and clear-eyed whenever he says

609
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,632
All of this awful stuff that he believes

610
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,424
And you can crack a joke while he's doing it

611
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:18,080
I'm only slightly exaggerating when I say that even though I know he is not committed a crime in his entire life

612
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:22,176
He is a dangerous society that needs to be quarantined like the f******

613
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,224
Joker this guy is

614
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,248
Terrified

615
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,808
And it's all because Criswell

616
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,344
Created him

617
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,928
Okay that's why I know he hasn't committed any crimes or done anything like that

618
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:35,232
He was created in criswell's lab

619
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,256
To do all

620
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,072
And the reason that I

621
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,096
Thought about Jeffers

622
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,632
Is not because

623
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:48,032
Of his appearances on Fox News where I mean I know you're a regular Watcher I know you love

624
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:54,432
Read I love threading

625
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,736
It's so funny the right is getting really good

626
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,088
He hit another reason that I'm talking about him

627
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,160
Is because he recently

628
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,952
Got into a disagreement

629
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,024
With a guy named

630
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,048
Randy Rhoads

631
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,352
Now

632
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,168
He's the guitarist

633
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,472
Quiet Riot right

634
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,688
5th episode

635
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:31,808
400 episode

636
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,584
Randy Robeson is also a television

637
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:47,168
But he is the son of maybe the best Southern Baptists

638
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:47,936
This preacher

639
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,216
I've ever heard

640
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,008
Benny Hinn James

641
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,056
Cuz I'm

642

This is a this is

644
00:34:56,128 --> 00:35:02,272
James Robertson this is not from too long ago

645
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:06,368
He is 40 years old and he has honed this into a f****** knife

646
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:10,464
The story is basically let me give you the story this is the entire store

647
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,256
There's a carpet cleaner

648
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,792
Named Milton Greene

649
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,328
Alright Milton green

650
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:19,680
Invites are boy James Robison to sit in a chair

651
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,704
He says

652
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,752
I

653
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,824
Think that you're in torment and I'm going to get rid of demons

654
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,104
He does that

655
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,384
Everything's fine

656
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,200
What a nice guy this is how the greatest Baptists

657
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,224
This preacher tells this story

658
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
Do you know who your

659
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,912
Do you know

660
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:00,896
So help me

661
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,200
How to lean it up against

662
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
Holiday Inn

663
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,552
If I ever seen some

664
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,160
I could see stuff

665
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,952
Anyone

666
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
I heard

667
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,632
What are the good things about that like the style of talk

668
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,400
King is just like

669
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,448
It's so awesome that they

670
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
Seem

671
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:29,312
Completely comfortable being out of breath

672
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:33,920
He's always always very appealing I don't know why

673
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,736
Because it seems unhealthy but there's something about it that Justice

674
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,272
What movie tickets

675
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,320
Add sincerity to attack

676
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
It's like this is

677
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,160
I'm digging down to try and tell you

678
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,976
No he's a runner from Marathon literally

679
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,816
I'm giving you this information to save your life

680
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,608
That is how important is it

681
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,216
Here is what he say what he saying is a guy address to sit him in a chair

682
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,288
And this is a Titanic life-or-death struggle

683
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,824
And it continued

684
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,872
If I had ever known

685
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,640
A map

686
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:05,920
Ever since

687
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
Would you come

688
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,528
All the king's horses and All the King's Men

689
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,296
Could not

690
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,368
Ashame how we intimidate people

691
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,512
Beaten-down people coming to church beaten down

692
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,424
Warring against the principalities and Powers

693
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,384
We Bangla

694
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,200
Is there something I don't understand about this chair

695
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,992
Okay

696
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,832
Of the kind you might imagine

697
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,856
I don't

698
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,672
Understand with aluminum

699
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,720
Don't notify

700
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,744
Cool

701
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,048
What was he what was he even talk

702
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,072
About right

703
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,632
Stopping principalities new song about demons

704
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,752
That's about all I got to share you want to run through a f****** brick wall

705
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:09,152
I'm not sure I'm having the same response to you

706
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:14,528
I think it's good in terms of like oratory okay

707
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,320
Eventually he sits in the chair

708
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,136
And now Milton green starts the X

709
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,464
Fart

710
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:24,768
Criminal

711
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,584
And he is screaming at ever found

712
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
Bondage

713
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,704
Rejection compulsion

714
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,688
I said that man is talking to them

715
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:45,504
Only one in the room

716
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,808
What is my friend finder

717
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,088
What is the preachers

718
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:52,160
What I did I guess I baby

719
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,952
Didn't realize that he's talking about an ex

720
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,768
I thought it was just sitting in a chair

721
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,304
There's a little bit of

722
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,072
Okay

723
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:04,192
Neither of them actually believe in you

724
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,776
That that is there is that the reviews they are b*******

725
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,592
Later on Milton green guess what he becomes

726
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,896
Televangelist

727
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,224
They are working together

728
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,784
And

729
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,600
Here is here's the way he's just killing with this

730
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,648
These people are eating it up

731
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,232
And then he ends it with this f****** kicker

732
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:28,768
Speaking

733
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,424
Amanda

734
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,008
And he walked over to the

735
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:39,776
Side of the room

736
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,056
Honey grab the chair

737
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,848
He walked right beside me

738
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,968
Pray for you

739
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:54,368
Might be some pay my way to come 600 miles to get here he said here's the care

740
00:39:54,624 --> 00:40:00,000
Freak

741
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,472
He has the power of

742
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:13,312
Story is

743
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,336
Just him

744
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,152
Getting his demons exercise

745
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,200
Right and then later on he goes to a conference

746
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,504
And people all bring their own chair to

747
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,064
To him cuz now he has the power to X

748
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,088
Society

749
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,904
This whole thing is that long journey.

750
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,440
And it is

751
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:35,840
He f****** demolishes this real

752
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:42,752
So James Robison is a fascinating guy whose son Randy Rhoads drop by right

753
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,312
So I was looking

754
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,104
James Robison and either contemporary

755
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:53,248
Contemporary with the spiritual dad of

756
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:59,648
They got you forgotten the main person's name because

757
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:04,000
I'm talking about four guys the first generation on the second generation

758
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:11,168
I jumper is is the one that I am aware of already and that's the name I couldn't remember

759
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,216
Clogging my brain with

760
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,800
With card sharks pictures

761
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:22,944
Dusty Rhodes reference

762
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,504
Too much to juggle yeah I know tell me about it

763
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,320
The the inverse is also true

764
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,160
So Robinson

765
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:37,280
Tell me it's hard to get their information with somebody to write to you

766
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:41,120
Right

767
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:45,472
Robinson is coming up in the world of conservative charismatic

768
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,568
Okay this is way back

769
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,895
Criswell's older games coming up I got you

770
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,455
James has become a because James is the f******

771
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,247
Can preacher he's the preachers preacher

772
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:01,343
You know he's the guy that guy who's got like a multiple rags

773
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,135
Does mop his brow

774
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:07,231
Oh yeah somehow I imagine him being in o'brother Where Art Thou

775
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,071
Early career is

776
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,607
Just that like he's hustling

777
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,911
He's going from place to place getting

778
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:21,311
Finding little things to jump in and get more famous off on places where people have chairs

779
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,103
Stuff like that yet

780
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,407
Like

781
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
Then

782
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,735
Sometime in the mid-80s

783
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,527
He stopped

784
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,599
He doesn't stop preaching

785
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,903
But he stopped trying to climb the conservative

786
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,671
Christian rap

787
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,975
And he just kind of

788
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,999
Almost settled

789
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,279
In create a modest

790
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,303
TV Empire

791
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,607
He creates the life that Alex

792
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,959
Or do you like sort of the sustainable Jim Bakker absolutely

793
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:55,103
He's not he's not screwing anybody over he's trying he's not being a good guy in the sense of like

794
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,151
You know doing anyting

795
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:00,735
Two positive he's got a charity that by all accounts and purposes

796
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,015
Is it okay

797
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,319
You know it's not a scam but it's not like

798
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,599
But also might be

799
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,391
Well

800
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:13,791
Charity watching people like that is evaluated it and said it's not if I call Jose for casting aspersions

801
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,327
No problem and

802
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,863
He just kind of

803
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,887
Creates this

804
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,911
Stable

805
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,935
Modern

806
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,703
TV Empire

807
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,007
He's got multiple talk shows

808
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,543
He preaches he

809
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,079
He's not trying to get too big

810
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,871
I he's

811
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,919
He's got a

812
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,711
Everything that he wants any

813
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,527
Stays just like a little under-the-radar like you don't know about

814
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,295
I'm right

815
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,879
Not not to off the top my head now

816
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:39,903
Worldwide

817
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,511
People all over the world watch him he's got his own channel like all of this s*** and

818
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,791
He

819
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,839
Again since the 80s

820
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,911
For some for whatever reason has live this life that

821
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,447
Suggest he believes what he's

822
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,799
Just like Chiswell created Jeffers

823
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:01,151
You correctly noted it that James Robinson created his son Randy Rhoads

824
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,175
Literally

825
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,527
Randy is not

826
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,087
Randy is not a televangelist

827
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:12,415
Just like a like a guitarist for quiet

828
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,743
Everybody

829
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,791
Randy is

830
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:20,095
A bit of a doof

831
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,423
He's a nice guy I'm kind of obsessed

832
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,703
I really am

833
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:30,591
He has his own like internet talk show on James Robinson's Network and it feels exactly like

834
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:33,663
A televangelist giving his kind of a Duke's on a talk show

835
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,967
Okay it gets downright

836
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,527
Chris Farley Show at times like

837
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,551
Do you like it

838
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,575
Okay

839
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,367
Easy does mainly like

840
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:47,231
You know reformed born-again Christians that kind of sucks because he has that

841
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,511
Kind of interview and of course

842
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,815
If somebody famous becomes a born-again

843
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,095
Christian you get

844
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,959
Welcome to life today I'm Randy Robinson

845
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,239
Can I have the heart

846
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:01,823
Exactly

847
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:03,871
Sean Michael

848
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,711
Many years

849
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,247
Anybody

850
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,271
Is wrestling

851
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,551
You know who this

852
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,623
Faerun

853
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:20,767
That's it you know what you are a real son-of-a-b**** let me explain to you why

854
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:24,863
Did you watch this video because you

855
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,399
You have

856
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,703
Introduced Shawn Michaels to the proceedings

857
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:35,103
And you didn't include his theme song I'm sorry I'm sorry I did not listen to

858
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,639
Michaels

859
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,599
Alright

860
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:51,999
The girls

861
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:05,567
Attitude

862
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,847
You know who sings that

863
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,383
Randy Rhoads

864
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,175
Sean Michael

865
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,967
Noah schnapp

866
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,527
That's hilarious

867
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:20,671
No that's not my fault Randy should have been playing that theme song

868
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:25,791
Expulsion stone cold on your show

869
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:29,375
That class is got a break

870
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:32,703
For Showmanship

871
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,727
Down again Christian

872
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:38,847
His tag team match that he had with Vince McMahon

873
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,407
Hamburger what pay-per-view

874
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:44,223
No it was a long time ago in the you like maybe

875
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:44,991
Sometime it's

876
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
2000

877
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:52,415
When Shawn Michaels became a born-again Christian it became sort of a thing in the storyline did Vince

878
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:59,583
Because events at this megalomaniacal I'm more important than God came to think

879
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,911
Who is tag team partner was Shawn Michaels

880
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,471
Add John Michaels tag team partner was God

881
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:13,407
Literal. Well they did it wasn't invisible you had to have a spotlight

882
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:18,271
I don't remember all the wrestling is great

883
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:23,647
One of the more goofy things that

884
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,951
I've definitely

885
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:29,791
Coming to the faith allowing it to be portrayed that way and television

886
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,327
Seems very weird hilarious

887
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,631
But yeah

888
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,911
Drug problems

889
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,007
It's one of those things like that so pretty good

890
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,823
Root for him to go down as close to dying

891
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,871
So of course he wrote a book and it goes on rant

892
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:51,039
Hey wrote a book it is all of eight

893
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:54,111
This interview is really boring but it has one of my

894
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,647
My favorite like I watch

895
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:58,719
All of Randy's interviews are incredibly boring

896
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,767
But even when they're interested

897
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:08,959
But he is a genuinely curious person who's also a bit of a dude like this is him asking Shawn Michaels

898
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,983
A big question

899
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,055
What is Sweet Chin Music

900
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,103
Remember the arena where you

901
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
I do it was in feet

902
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,199
The Phoenix Arena

903
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,223
You said so

904
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
Instruct me in

905
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,063
141 you obviously

906
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:24,831
Attached

907
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,367
You know

908
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,231
Out of your life

909
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,559
You made a statement

910
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,655
The only time

911
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,423
I like

912
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:44,799
You made me

913
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,359
What is what is

914
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,919
Well

915
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,479
Unfair

916
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:58,879
I love that it's a pretty decent I know that's what I'm saying I love this guy no

917
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,647
Just the way he

918
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,487
He probably could have framed it a little better

919
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,791
Yeah it is a little Direct

920
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:12,191
Chris Farley Show question

921
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:18,591
He seems really not I would have preferred to ask what it meant when Shawn Michaels lost his smile

922
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,895
He's not there not curiosity

923
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,431
Michaels

924
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:27,295
Super kicking people Sweet Chin Music

925
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,575
Shawn Michaels has

926
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:34,207
What are you do is you'd be like coming up

927
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,999
You get knocked down on the side of the Ring

928
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,303
Will you be getting up

929
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,351
Struggling to get up

930
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:44,191
And has your slowly getting up he be in the corner at the turnbuckle

931
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,727
Stop his foot

932
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:52,383
It's like a bullet to give like the audience so you know it's, okay

933
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:59,039
Tune up the band then hit you with the Sweet Chin Music and then right when you were finally standing up and that's when the cake would come right

934
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:08,255
It's a good theme song

935
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:11,327
I was younger I hesitate to give you my

936
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:18,239
I don't know you showed up at a WrestleMania a couple years back out of nowhere and

937
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:25,151
Boy I celebrated pretty cute even expect myself to

938
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:30,783
Michael's fan excited

939
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,111
Well

940
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:38,207
Just like like the reason that he has Shawn Michaels and and those types of gas

941
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,743
Probably about

942
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:44,863
Not that many wrestlers a lot of come around to like being

943
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,143
Create

944
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:54,079
Lex Luthor not Lex Luthor Lex Luger was on the 700 Club

945
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:56,383
Okay and I almost didn't episode

946
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:03,039
Think I might have done I got half episode

947
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,391
But

948
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,671
User

949
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:15,583
The million dollar man to Ted DiBiase

950
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,607
Robert

951
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:19,679
This guy

952
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:26,079
Cycle through wrestling I didn't see too many with wrestlers but that one was funny

953
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:34,271
Realize tugboat was a wrestler

954
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:40,671
Yeah is it not using cuz we might not even have used their stage names on his show so Darwin piche

955
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:44,767
Irwin R schyster IRS

956
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,327
Oh man use attacks guy

957
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,631
I think I got it

958
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:54,495
I think I guess that wrestler

959
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:57,567
I really do around you I apologize

960
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,103
It's

961
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,639
But the reason he has

962
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:06,015
Like guys like Shawn Michaels on is because he fancies himself something of a bad boy

963
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,855
He's a little bit

964
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:12,671
This is the type of s*** that he really wants to get in

965
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,231
In Green Bay Wisconsin

966
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,279
And now he's got a new book called

967
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,303
Battle

968
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,071
Over

969
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,119
Yes the battle over rules

970
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,935
And you can talk about that online today

971
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,959
Check it out at like today

972
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,727
Play. Org

973
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:26,495
But

974
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:27,519
For this

975
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,799
Particular interview

976
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,079
You're fortunate enough

977
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,103
To be watching the bonuses

978
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,127
Or we can go

979
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,407
Out of the bounds

980
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:36,735
We're going to discuss the topic that was rejected

981
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,015
For the broadcast

982
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:38,783
Show

983
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:39,807
Because it was

984
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,831
Just a little

985
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,855
Over The Line

986
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,623
And I've got

987
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,951
We're going to talk about

988
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,487
I did not tell him to

989
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:52,607
We're going to talk about the bead method this is your own visitor

990
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,399
This is your

991
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,679
I did all that

992
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:58,495
Yeah you did and then next time you know

993
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:01,311
They said no we're not going to discuss it

994
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,591
Is this anal beads

995
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,639
Really

996
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:12,319
So we thought I was going to say there's going to be a joke it's be like no it's crafting

997
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:16,927
Dude actually straight up onto okay that is a little bit

998
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:19,487
Intellivision

999
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:24,095
You you get away with saying

1000
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:30,495
Well it's not quite a little beads it's it's a it's in a marriage this this pastor has this idea of like

1001
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,055
Okay we all want it we all need to have sex

1002
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,615
Sprite but it's tough to have sex when you're older

1003
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:41,247
And sometimes we don't want to do it so we created this bead method which is like a barter C

1004
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,271
Like

1005
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,063
Here is some beads

1006
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,343
Now we talked for awhile

1007
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,623
Then you're done

1008
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,671
I'm out exactly

1009
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,743
Also not that rebuild anymore this isn't that exciting

1010
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,535
What is controversial

1011
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:57,375
This is just transactional

1012
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:01,727
That subject was rejected

1013
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,079
For the broadcast show at 2 from my own show

1014
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,383
But he's just obsessed with being this like

1015
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,919
Kind of a bad boy

1016
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,455
Brightness in this world like

1017
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,735
So he of course

1018
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,015
Has written a s*** ton of books

1019
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,295
Like everybody else in the

1020
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,087
But

1021
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:19,391
Unlike most people one of his books

1022
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,159
It was fiction

1023
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:25,279
It's called scavo or I don't know how to pronounce it is sceva

1024
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:28,607
And here is the blurb for it that was

1025
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,911
Let me see if you can find out

1026
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,959
Who wrote this letter for her okay

1027
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:39,615
In the Supernatural Thriller the seven deadly sins threatened to destroy the lives of seven Bible college students after

1028
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,383
Ill-advised

1029
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,151
Attempt

1030
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,943
Cast a demon out of a man

1031
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:47,551
Now you can read the book Praise by Publishers as quote intense

1032
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,831
A great read

1033
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:50,623
And quote strong writing

1034
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:54,207
But rejected for being too edgy for Christian readers

1035
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,023
Who wrote the review or do you think I've two guys

1036
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,559
Okay sorry I don't

1037
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:03,935
No dad

1038
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,471
Yeah

1039
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:11,103
I kind of love I also would have guessed the host of card sharks but I could remember who I was

1040
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,895
I think it is

1041
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:17,247
Oh man I can remember bill it's like a bill Mitchell

1042
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,271
Something along those

1043
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,831
Qanon

1044
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:21,855
Rebuilding

1045
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,439
This guy

1046
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,231
And

1047
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:28,511
Robert Jeffrey

1048
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,327
Are both second generation televangel

1049
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,631
And my

1050
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,191
That's

1051
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:36,959
That's so weird

1052
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:40,799
Isn't it there's a legacy business

1053
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,335
It makes sense

1054
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,383
It just took me back for a second to pick like

1055
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,431
Hearing about one of them

1056
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,223
That is what

1057
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,247
But like here

1058
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,783
Multiple I can think about like

1059
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:58,975
I mean to Baker's kids are exactly

1060
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,999
Right that's

1061
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,023
Yeah

1062
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:01,791
Steph

1063
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,071
Except weird

1064
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,423
And it's in within Caesar wrestling

1065
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:11,519
2nd generation on 3rd generation wrestlers

1066
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,287
Write like

1067
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:17,151
Any any or any comparison to TV is what these guys are all

1068
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,431
TV creator

1069
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:21,247
And their eyes are all for TV

1070
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:26,111
And it's between these two second-generation televangelists

1071
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,671
That I try and explain the question

1072
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:32,767
Why does the religious right support Trump no matter what

1073
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,559
Why is

1074
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:39,167
Is that because I see that article written 300 million times over and over and over

1075
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:43,007
Why are these supposedly moral upstanding people

1076
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:45,055
Supporting a monster like

1077
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,359
It doesn't make any sense

1078
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:51,199
And I will give you these two characters

1079
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:53,759
Is to second-generation televangelists to try Annex

1080
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,551
Explain it away Randy Rhoads

1081
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,855
And

1082
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,879
Jeffers

1083
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,647
Alright

1084
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,695
One of them

1085
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:05,535
The bad-boy it's one of them the pristine article

1086
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,303
Exactly

1087
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,655
You know what's one do you think is worse though

1088
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,959
Probably the pristine article

1089
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:16,287
Absolutely what do you what do you feel about Randy so far

1090
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:20,383
Everybody was saying I was Shawn Michaels can't be all bad he's not a bad guy

1091
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,943
I don't know why that's not actually true. Michael said some

1092
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:23,967
Kitty friends

1093
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:25,247
Of the wrestlers

1094
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:32,415
I don't know why I can't really get a sense of him from the like a limited amount of information I have I mean I know like his dad seems

1095
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:36,255
To be a guy who likes to have exorcisms on chairs and is a

1096
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,559
Like a classic old-school lasek

1097
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,351
Huckster type preacher but

1098
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,119
I mean

1099
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:46,239
Seems were formed the sins of the father are bestowed upon the son

1100
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,007
In my my

1101
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,031
My conception Center

1102
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,079
Yeah I don't know I don't I don't

1103
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:52,127
I need more information

1104
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,407
Well as far as his

1105
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:58,783
Vocal patterns and all that stuff goes gifted

1106
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:02,623
Compared to these other guys in the same time he's talking like a person

1107
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,671
Yes so there's a

1108
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,439
You know

1109
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:08,255
It's not as gifted in the genre

1110
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:11,839
But there is more of a there's also relatability about someone who speaks like

1111
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:14,399
Well what about this thing that you're not like people like

1112
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:17,983
Like that real f****** stupid on podcast 2

1113
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:18,751
People like

1114
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,799
Yeah I know and I like him

1115
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,847
I genuinely do I

1116
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,383
I mean I don't know what he's like

1117
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,407
Private life but

1118
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:29,759
Everything that I see through all of this stuff is just him like

1119
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,295
He's just a guy

1120
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:35,135
He's a guy who believes in all of this crisp

1121
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,183
And he's

1122
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,231
Struggling within this

1123
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,279
There's this like

1124
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,327
Constant push and pull with him

1125
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:47,935
Between what he is told by mainstream Conservative Christian

1126
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,215
Like dr. Robert

1127
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:52,799
And what he thinks is a moral stance

1128
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:55,103
He doesn't he doesn't believe

1129
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,639
In the same God

1130
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,663
Then Richard Jeffrey

1131
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,199
Not even

1132
00:58:59,455 --> 00:58:59,967
Close

1133
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,527
They are of course friends and

1134
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:05,087
Randy basically agrees with everything that Robert Jeffrey

1135
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:05,855
Says

1136
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,903
But anytime you get that little

1137
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,439
Bright spot of him like

1138
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,023
Well I don't think we should be evil too

1139
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,071
Gay people but

1140
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,095
You could like

1141
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,887
It's that over and over and over again

1142
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,423
And these little bits of him

1143
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,703
Coming really close

1144
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,239
To the saying like

1145
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,775
I don't believe

1146
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:24,799
What you believe

1147
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:27,871
And then just being like you sound right

1148
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:28,639
Let's go

1149
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,503
This the reason that I'm talking about the

1150
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:35,295
You guys have because It Came Upon

1151
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,575
Randy

1152
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,367
Putting out a live stream

1153
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:40,415
Entitled does evil rain

1154
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:43,999
Which is based on an interview he recently did with

1155
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:44,767
Dr. Jeff

1156
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:51,167
I thought it was with

1157
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:56,287
Gangrel vampire demon

1158
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,311
From

1159
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,079
What you want

1160
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:04,479
Literal vampire tamanrasset

1161
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:10,879
People

1162
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:12,927
Use a vampire.

1163
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:15,487
You're the lights go out and then there be

1164
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,767
I got candles

1165
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:20,095
Complained

1166
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,655
He I was hanging out with the original Hebrew

1167
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,423
Zedge

1168
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:29,823
Christian right there is to sort of enforcer later on when to have their own

1169
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,127
Very successful

1170
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:35,199
Tag team in both world champions in their own right

1171
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:38,015
Amanda

1172
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,295
And then

1173
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:44,159
Where was Gangrel and then they laughed and then Matt and Jeff Hardy became the new brood

1174
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,951
Hung out with Gangrel minute run

1175
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,999
We shouldn't hang out

1176
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:53,375
Lame ideas fixies of them

1177
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:59,775
I wish wrestling would like that just suddenly started

1178
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,543
They broke

1179
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:06,431
Hey babe the moment that it was time to sleep

1180
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:13,599
Just introduced that new wrinkle

1181
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:19,999
That's like that's like an ocean swell when Julia Roberts plays a character that looks like Julia Roberts

1182
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:26,399
You're f****** with me and I don't like the introduction of like half realities worse than

1183
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:29,983
You tell me that you think he might not be a vampire we all know

1184
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:32,543
Fun though

1185
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,871
That would be fun only only in the world of kayfabe

1186
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:38,687
If you were to disagree though

1187
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,735
You would probably have a

1188
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,759
A better conversation

1189
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,551
Then

1190
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,111
The way that Randy did

1191
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:51,743
Oh yeah this is Randy introducing the idea of disagreeing with doctor

1192
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,535
End

1193
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,559
It's not real nice

1194
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,863
When you invite people into your

1195
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:00,703
Facility on your show and you just to argue with

1196
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,263
It's kind of rude

1197
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:08,639
Did the flip side of that is if they say something that I disagree with

1198
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:12,479
And I don't say anything people assume that I'm in agreement with the

1199
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:18,879
And so I'm always having to measure okay does that rise to the level that I need to say something

1200
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:19,903
And

1201
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,439
If you watch closely you'll

1202
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,463
See sometimes

1203
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:25,535
When I say something I might I might politely

1204
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,351
Push back and say you know his

1205
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:30,911
You know any

1206
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,191
That sounds like an adult

1207
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:35,519
Eva nice guy

1208
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:38,079
This is him politely

1209
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,103
Like

1210
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:44,479
Going through this he's like I'm doing a show I don't want to be ungracious but

1211
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:47,039
At the same time if I disagree with somebody I want to

1212
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:53,439
Be polite and then I'm going to measure whether or not I need to say something if I don't say anything he's recognizing that there is like a tacit

1213
01:02:54,719 --> 01:03:00,863
Understanding the audience as they like while you must agree with that otherwise you would have said something absolutely that's like recognizing you respond

1214
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,679
Possibilities listen to that

1215
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:06,495
Refreshing

1216
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,263
It's very

1217
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,287
Yeah

1218
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:12,383
Now this is him going out of his way

1219
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,919
To even when he does this

1220
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,687
Agree with Robert J

1221
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,711
2

1222
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:18,783
Point out that he's like I don't want to offend anybody

1223
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,831
Just know

1224
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:21,855
That I mean

1225
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,135
0

1226
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,927
To the doctor Jeffy

1227
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:25,951
As I

1228
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:29,023
Offer you an alternative view of

1229
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,839
But I want to bring his view because it is

1230
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,143
Probably the dominant view in

1231
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,423
Evangelical

1232
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,191
Churches right now

1233
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,751
An n

1234
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,031
The only thing is I'm not

1235
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,567
Convinced that I'm 100

1236
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,871
All the time I feel like

1237
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:46,687
I'm constantly learning which is why I love having all this

1238
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,455
People in here

1239
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:50,271
I am getting too, tap the brain the same as I push

1240
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,831
I'm more difficult issues because

1241
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,879
I'm sitting there learning and I think that the

1242
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,159
That's good for an audience

1243
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:56,927
Just watch

1244
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,695
And learn

1245
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,231
That's pretty humble

1246
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:00,767
Now

1247
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:04,351
Who are we talking about in contrast with that guy

1248
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,911
The guy who has never been wrong

1249
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,703
Once in his entire life

1250
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,239
Jackie babe

1251
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,543
This is what Jeffrey's sounds like

1252
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:13,567
On that

1253
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,335
On the show

1254
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,407
Ryan what you drive I don't know if

1255
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,199
Stereotypical

1256
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:20,991
Let's play

1257
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,807
I'm guessing you don't have one of those coexist

1258
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,343
Bumper stickers

1259
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:27,647
My wife actually almost got

1260
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,671
Me one is a joke

1261
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,463
Vacation Thursday anything's

1262
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:35,583
The opposite of my worldview it's that coexist so she almost put it on my

1263
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:38,143
The Joker yeah

1264
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:38,911
Yeah

1265
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:41,727
His worldview is the opposite of

1266
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,543
He is one hundred percent right about everything

1267
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,335
And he has no interest in Europe in

1268
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,359
And he has no in

1269
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,151
Can anything you have to say

1270
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:52,223
That is why he is so dangerous and

1271
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:56,063
Evil and that is also why Randy is a different person

1272
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,367
Randy is humble and

1273
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,135
Curious

1274
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,415
He wants to know

1275
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:04,255
He has his own opinions but at the same time he's always trying to learn

1276
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:09,887
Yeah that is the difference between these this is the the war in Christianity as far as

1277
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,935
And it is being

1278
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:12,959
1 by

1279
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:13,727
Robert Jeff

1280
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,519
Like An Enderman

1281
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:19,871
Randy is 1 mi / like here's Randy talking about

1282
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:23,455
There's a certain difference in philosophy he has with Robert

1283
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,271
Okay so he starts with the c.s. Lewis

1284
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,039
Twitch

1285
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:28,575
I love c.s. Lewis

1286
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,927
Any points out that we are in a battle well we

1287
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:36,255
If you don't know this by now couldn't

1288
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,559
I'll just tell you we are in a battle

1289
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,327
Where am I

1290
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,351
Spiritual bath

1291
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,375
We don't wrestle against

1292
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,399
Blood

1293
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,679
Common mistake I think

1294
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:44,959
People make

1295
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:45,727
Even Christian

1296
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:48,543
Thinking that though you over there you're my enemy

1297
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,591
No

1298
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,127
No

1299
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,663
Spiritual

1300
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,431
Okay

1301
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:57,503
Make a lot of people take that to be like

1302
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,039
Spiritual battle and I'm against

1303
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:02,879
Your spirit absolutely feel like that's what he's saying

1304
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:05,183
But that's

1305
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:11,071
Delivered slightly differently yep exactly what you hear from Alex it doesn't have the same feeling

1306
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,607
And also I want to say that

1307
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:13,631
He doesn't like

1308
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,423
Louis

1309
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:19,519
I heard that so much background to church

1310
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:25,919
Ever read Mere Christianity the problem of pain none of those m************ reading

1311
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,967
Out of the Silent Planet once and they called it a day

1312
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:34,367
Hey read a couple of bucket paragraphs and they're like good enough

1313
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,391
Because it's

1314
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:41,791
Understand it deeper because I read all this other l

1315
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:49,215
I Christians love because

1316
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,239
Appreciate

1317
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,543
Tony from him

1318
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,823
In there but I still don't

1319
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:57,151
Alexia Lewis

1320
01:06:57,407 --> 01:07:03,551
Dentist Knoxville never know

1321
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,831
Like non

1322
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:10,463
Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe

1323
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,999
I don't know I'm unaware of that

1324
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:17,887
Oh man the the second book in that trailer G is essentially a retelling of

1325
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,655
Genesis

1326
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,935
But it's

1327
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,727
Adam and Eve on Venus

1328
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:25,823
Oh and it is essentially a retelling of Genesis and it is

1329
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,359
So much longer

1330
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,639
And so much more boring

1331
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:33,247
It is incredibly amazed myself whenever I read it because I

1332
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,783
It's so boring

1333
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:40,671
And then the third book weird to it have space religion be more boring

1334
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,439
Right

1335
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,719
And then the third book is

1336
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:43,743
Unreadable

1337
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:49,119
Like even The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe

1338
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,655
It's like no one read

1339
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,191
Past like

1340
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:58,847
Maybe actually a really good book I Remember Loving that but no one read a horse in his

1341
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:05,247
Boy Oliver I read I don't know man so terrible

1342
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:07,807
Google didn't read all of them

1343
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:14,207
Turkish delight

1344
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:17,279
Church who loves c.s. Lewis

1345
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,815
Because I've read all of

1346
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,583
Is

1347
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:22,911
Eyeliner Wichita

1348
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:27,775
The order

1349
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:32,383
Prince Caspian the second Silverchair

1350
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,407
How to say it's 5

1351
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:37,759
Last battle is

1352
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,319
But yeah

1353
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:44,415
Listen to the way this dude is is putting everything it is this

1354
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,207
This idea of like

1355
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:48,511
He is you

1356
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:52,095
Hearing the same words that Jeffers is saying just like you put it you know

1357
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:54,911
You say it a little bit differently and it's exactly what I like

1358
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,983
That's right but he's he means it in the

1359
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:03,359
I don't know I'm more genuine way I hear what he's saying when he's saying it's a spiritual battle meaning

1360
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,639
Within your own

1361
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:07,455
You are having a like it is a

1362
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:10,783
If the test is within all of us and

1363
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:13,599
You have a responsibility to fight this battle

1364
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:17,439
Within yourself to rise to the occasion absolute that's the battle

1365
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:23,071
When I hear Alex talk about we do not fight against flesh and blood it's a spiritual battle

1366
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,887
I hear him saying kill that person cuz there's a demon in

1367
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,679
You got ya

1368
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:31,775
It's a big difference but it is the same intrinsic idea

1369
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,615
Words being used

1370
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,151
Express different thing absolutely

1371
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,991
That's exactly it

1372
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:48,415
I feel like I'm hearing this and maybe I have way too generous at opinion of this dude because it's the way you're

1373
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:52,511
Presenting I worried about that but I'm trusting you

1374
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:56,351
I mean I guess it's I guess it's easier

1375
01:09:56,607 --> 01:10:02,751
To have a negative opinion of somebody with very little information about them than to have a positive

1376
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,799
Opinion with only

1377
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:09,919
Disgaea

1378
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:14,271
Could be a trap it could be as far as I can tell like he believes

1379
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,319
Here's here's my

1380
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,343
Here's my thing about him

1381
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,647
And this is the thing that I

1382
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:23,487
I was really struggling with while I was I was thinking of this idea which

1383
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,255
She's like

1384
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,327
I've known my parents

1385
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:31,935
I know that they do not want people in cages at the border

1386
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:36,031
But I don't understand how they can justify it

1387
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:39,615
And I know that Randy

1388
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,407
Is that

1389
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,943
Same type of Christian

1390
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:44,991
That I like

1391
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:49,343
Hear it in everything he says and everything you've does I've watched all of those over and over again

1392
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:51,903
He's your parents version of Christian

1393
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,671
Exact

1394
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:56,511
He is that person and I think I think the large majority of

1395
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:59,583
I think the large majority of them

1396
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:01,119
I do not want that

1397
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:03,167
But they are trapped

1398
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,983
They are trapped by guys like dr. Robert

1399
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,823
And here's another that here's what's going to

1400
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,615
India are you

1401
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:14,687
To Randy I think a little bit more than he's live streaming this

1402
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:16,735
So there are people in the twitch

1403
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:19,295
Osher

1404
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:25,695
That's weird yet there people in the twitch Jesse like playing Dark Souls

1405
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,327
But

1406
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:35,167
I got this is how this dude responds to trolls showing up in history

1407
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,519
Welcome All You trolls on Twitch

1408
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:40,543
I see you guys at

1409
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:42,079
And

1410
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:43,871
You're welcome to live

1411
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,407
That's why I'm on

1412
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:46,687
You're not going to

1413
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:50,271
Also that

1414
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:52,575
You know he wasn't a nice guy that's the right

1415
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,599
Move exact

1416
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,903
Trolls are going to come up more freaky

1417
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,207
They're always going to existing

1418
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:01,023
You know like if you just have that approach then like

1419
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:04,095
People don't get a rise out of you they don't get what they want

1420
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:05,631
Do you just

1421
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,935
Yell at somebody and you're going to end up

1422
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,471
Attracting

1423
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,007
It's fun we could poke him

1424
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,823
A knowing that

1425
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,359
At least or even if it's just

1426
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:19,711
Like instinctual he continues to deal with rolls her out the lights

1427
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,503
And it is

1428
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:24,063
It is very funny ho ho like

1429
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:28,671
I just don't know how more

1430
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,951
Just like

1431
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:30,719
I kind of like

1432
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:32,255
General

1433
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,303
Doofy good dude could react

1434
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,839
Then the way that he does

1435
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:38,655
It's just like this General sense of a guy who's just like

1436
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:39,679
I'm

1437
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:41,215
Satisfied with my life

1438
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:43,519
I'm trying to do what I think is right

1439
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,823
And you guys are being mean and you know what

1440
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:47,359
To right to be mean

1441
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,639
I understand

1442
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,687
Like he's doing that whole thing

1443
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:51,967
Weather

1444
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,503
Later on he gets

1445
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,807
My favorite recurring bit on his show

1446
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:56,831
Is

1447
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:57,599
He writes book

1448
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:02,719
Sure and no one knows about it and no one is read them and no one really believes that he write

1449
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:06,815
So in so many of these interviews you wind up having a situation like this

1450
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:07,583
That's where he does that

1451
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:10,399
Interview when he when he gained

1452
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,423
The idea of happiness

1453
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,447
That

1454
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,215
I said

1455
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,495
Well you haven't read my book

1456
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:17,567
Call God wants you to be happy and he laughed we thought I was joking but

1457
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:22,687
I'm not joking or what the book called God wants you to be happy

1458
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:26,783
You know be a great bet he had never written a book

1459
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:31,647
Everything's alright

1460
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,439
The rider

1461
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:36,255
That'll be awesome this happens like

1462
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,535
3 or 4

1463
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,303
I watched

1464
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:40,863
I am maybe 5 maybe 10 of these

1465
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:47,263
Do you have any insight on why No One Believes you wrote a book I don't know I don't know if anybody's ever actually published

1466
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,031
Physically

1467
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:53,919
Nature a lot of people sell public and I definitely don't think anybody knows about this

1468
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,455
So you probably probably

1469
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,295
It's not good

1470
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:06,207
But this happens if there's an interview with another woman who wrote that that's super weird as an act

1471
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:07,487
Accusation or like

1472
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:12,607
How much do you think of that is actually people thinking he hasn't written a book and how much is

1473
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,143
Him being insecure

1474
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,423
About his book sales

1475
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:19,263
Think about that other people don't think he's written a book

1476
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:25,663
It happens over and over and over very weird he brought it up on one interview this woman

1477
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,431
Wrote a book

1478
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:28,223
About how

1479
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:32,063
Christian women need to understand that men like to look at with

1480
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:34,367
And that it's not a bad thing

1481
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:36,159
And that interview gets

1482
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:38,719
Weird and horny and

1483
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,999
Brandy's

1484
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:45,631
I'm glad I'm not a teenager anymore like doing all kinds of weird stuff in there and then eventually he's like

1485
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:50,239
Oh happiness I wrote about happiness in my book I want to be happy

1486
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:52,031
I'm sorry what

1487
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,847
You did know I wrote a book

1488
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:55,871
Happen

1489
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:01,759
Over and over and over again this happens in almost every issue it is

1490
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:02,527
Very funny

1491
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:05,599
So yeah the disagreement that

1492
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,391
Randy and

1493
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,671
Robert have

1494
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,439
What is

1495
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,207
On

1496
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:10,975
Happiness

1497
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:12,767
That's what Randy is saying

1498
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,815
He wrote a book

1499
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,351
Call God wants you to be happy

1500
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,375
Robert

1501
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,703
Did not even I don't even know Robert believes in

1502
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:24,031
That's the fundamental

1503
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:27,103
Right now Randy is

1504
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:29,919
Is a doofy guy who just wants to Live and Let Live

1505
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:34,527
And this is the type of stuff he does agree with this is how we deals with trolls in that

1506
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:36,831
We've known this

1507
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,415
Belinda said she takes pleasure in looking at

1508
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,207
And you know

1509
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:43,231
Something interesting

1510
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,255
I started the Reformation

1511
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,023
In a bit because

1512
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,071
I didn't really get that at

1513
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,095
School

1514
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,631
And one thing that that

1515
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:52,447
The Catholics and those who were protesting the Catholic Church

1516
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,519
Didn't argue about because they agreed on

1517
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,799
That was the god reveals

1518
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:57,567
Self through nature

1519
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:58,591
Belinda

1520
01:15:58,847 --> 01:15:59,359
I100

1521
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,639
Agree with you

1522
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:03,455
I take

1523
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:04,735
In in the mountain

1524
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,271
I love the snow ski

1525
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,295
Stand up there

1526
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:09,343
You're at the Keystone to Breckenridge

1527
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,623
Continental Divide

1528
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:13,695
And I'm like this is

1529
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:14,975
Beautiful

1530
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,255
Temple

1531
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,279
In the world

1532
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,815
God's creation

1533
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:19,839
So yes

1534
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:20,863
Percent Judy

1535
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,655
He might have Red Sea as well as

1536
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:26,239
Maybe I was not judge too harshly

1537
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:28,287
That is true

1538
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:34,687
Babies that is a belief of like if you've never heard the name of Christ and you'd recognize him

1539
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,991
Through nature that is salvation

1540
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:38,271
Good enough

1541
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,551
What is a position

1542
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:46,463
A lot of schools of Christianity you help getting a little bit trolled with like

1543
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:54,655
I like to look at flowers

1544
01:16:54,911 --> 01:17:00,799
I think I think I think that

1545
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:01,823
I think that

1546
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:05,407
The reason I think that is I think Belinda pops up later on

1547
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:08,223
Okay yeah I got another context art sorry my bad

1548
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:12,063
This is before belindapop sitting but that's that's what he's

1549
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,855
He's he's

1550
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,135
Very simple

1551
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,671
He's doing this is what we agree

1552
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:19,487
And here's where we disagree and there are more trolls

1553
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,815
So I'm getting trolled hard today

1554
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:24,863
About time

1555
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:25,887
Introllsive left me alone

1556
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,703
So here's the part

1557
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,471
Where

1558
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:30,239
Dr. Jeffers

1559
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,775
I have a disagreement

1560
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,055
And this is where I want you

1561
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,335
Your input

1562
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:35,871
Constructed in

1563
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,407
I'll just ignore it

1564
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:39,967
Just trolling but

1565
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:41,759
And this is

1566
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:44,575
It kind of goes to

1567
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,599
Eschatology

1568
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:46,879
In other words

1569
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:47,647
How we

1570
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,927
View the future and

1571
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:53,279
The dominant in the evangelico churches is a futuristic

1572
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,071
Other words things are going to get worse and worse

1573
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:55,839
Warriors before they

1574
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:56,863
Better

1575
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:57,631
And this

1576
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,399
This is where

1577
01:17:58,655 --> 01:17:59,935
I actually just don't

1578
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:03,263
Don't agree I was raised that way but I don't agree more and we're going to get into it

1579
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:10,431
He doesn't he doesn't believe in the the progression towards

1580
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,199
Good

1581
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,735
The downward progression

1582
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:14,015
2

1583
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,039
Sharp

1584
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,063
Exactly

1585
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:18,879
Randy is a chill

1586
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:20,415
Chill guy

1587
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:25,535
He's pretty much like he sounds so much Bob Rossi to me like so much of that just like

1588
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,815
I like to look at them

1589
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,607
The grill Tampa

1590
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:32,191
Yeah yeah it's a religious show Bob Ross

1591
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:32,959
Basically

1592
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:33,727
And

1593
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:37,823
What he is getting to is that when he says that eschatology is

1594
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:38,847
Fundamental disc

1595
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,151
He's not even getting to the real

1596
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:46,271
They have no shifts is the fundamental

1597
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:49,087
And he thinks it's just them disagreeing about how

1598
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:50,623
2

1599
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,927
Allegedly wrote a book about

1600
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:55,743
I have not read it

1601
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:56,511
He may not ever

1602
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:59,839
Not exactly might not exist I went to his website and it's there

1603
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:05,983
You can buy it on Amazon but I don't know if I'm going to go through to the car

1604
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,823
But he thinks they're talkin about happy

1605
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:12,383
He thinks they're talking about happiness and whether or not

1606
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:15,455
You're supposed to be happy or you're supposed to wait until God

1607
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:18,015
You know replaces the world or whatever right

1608
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:20,575
What they are actually talking about is

1609
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:23,647
The literal replacement of the world like here is Doctor

1610
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,415
Jeffers

1611
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,951
This is what his

1612
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,487
Is on the

1613
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,255
The side of

1614
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,327
This world is

1615
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,095
Not the word

1616
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:34,911
And this world

1617
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,519
But until then

1618
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:41,311
Who is going

1619
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,151
Filter I mean that sounds like

1620
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:47,199
Lot of the religious things ever

1621
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:49,759
How does the imperfect

1622
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:50,783
Meet world

1623
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:52,831
The difference here

1624
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:54,623
Is what.

1625
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:57,695
We get back into the words can mean different

1626
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,743
Dr. Jeffers

1627
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:01,535
Is not talking about

1628
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:07,679
How the you know eventually the world Satan going to rain and then God will replace the world in all of this

1629
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:09,983
Yeah actually talk

1630
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,799
Talking about how he wants to replace the world

1631
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:16,896
He criswell's idea of a Christian separatist

1632
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:17,664
Compound

1633
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,944
The main goal of

1634
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:21,760
Was to create a completely separate

1635
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:26,112
Christian world that would eventually grow to be the world

1636
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:28,672
He could not do that and what he realize

1637
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:30,464
Was that that was not possible

1638
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,512
And it wasn't going to be possible to be left

1639
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:33,536
Delon

1640
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,560
Unless

1641
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,864
You are the only thing

1642
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,424
So he created dr. Jeffers

1643
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,192
And

1644
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:41,216
This is

1645
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:44,544
The reason that I find him so terrifying

1646
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:50,688
And it goes back to Randall rail bomber wrote an article in Politico

1647
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,272
About the creation of the Christian separatist

1648
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:57,600
How people always talk about Roe v Wade as

1649
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,928
Inciting factor to getting the Christian right

1650
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:03,232
To mobilizing

1651
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:05,792
Right

1652
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,328
What

1653
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,656
Was born out of though was the

1654
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:13,984
Court decision in Greenville Kennedy

1655
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:18,848
Which later became Greenville Connolly when Connolly became the Secretary of Treasury

1656
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:22,944
This happened about five to 10 years before Roe v Wade

1657
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,760
The situation boils down to

1658
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:29,856
If you segregate your private school

1659
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,904
You do not get tax-exempt

1660
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:33,952
That's it

1661
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,232
Bright.

1662
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,280
And the goal for Criswell

1663
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,584
Whether or not it was racial segregation

1664
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,376
The goal has always been

1665
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:43,424
To completely segregate

1666
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,704
Christian's away from ever

1667
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:48,032
So they took that idea of

1668
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,592
They're going to make a

1669
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,872
Has become public schools

1670
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:57,760
And they turned that who is Jerry Falwell and Bob Jones and all of those guys

1671
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:00,320
Into this and then they

1672
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:02,368
Teamed up with away riches

1673
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,904
Burgeoning heritage

1674
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:07,744
All of these guys turned into what the right is

1675
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:08,768
Today

1676
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:12,096
All of it just like knee-jerk an awful reaction

1677
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:14,656
When's two Notions of civil right

1678
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:16,704
With one mangle

1679
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:19,776
And that is creating a completely

1680
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:21,056
White Christian vehicle

1681
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:22,592
That is the purpose

1682
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:24,896
Price of this and that is what Jeffers was raised

1683
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:28,224
So when he starts talking about how

1684
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:30,016
Reno

1685
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:34,112
We we the this world is not the world of God

1686
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:34,880
Like that kind of

1687
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:37,184
And we need he's not about waiting

1688
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:41,024
For God to come back with a world of God

1689
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,560
He wants his world

1690
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,584
Yeah absolutely

1691
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,376
It is interesting

1692
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,680
I don't know how much of it is

1693
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,448
Just like

1694
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:52,288
If i Kin trinsic suspicion of things

1695
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,312
But like

1696
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,336
Does field if

1697
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:57,152
Even without your presentation

1698
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:57,920
I think I would

1699
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:59,456
Your him say those things

1700
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,992
Jeffers say those the

1701
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,528
Differently then

1702
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,552
Randy Rhoads

1703
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:04,320
Right

1704
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:06,368
Robinson

1705
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,696
Disagree

1706
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,488
It is its interests

1707
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:13,536
It's it's

1708
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,304
It's

1709
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,352
I think what it speaks to is the

1710
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,632
Like

1711
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,680
The inherent

1712
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,984
Neutrality of religion

1713
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,008
Itself

1714
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,056
Because these people are both expressing

1715
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:27,104
Like really religious ideas

1716
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,384
And one of them is expressing

1717
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,664
That man away that's like

1718
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,688
Alright

1719
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,968
And the other one thing

1720
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:36,832
Billy similar kinds of things like that are 180 degrees

1721
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:38,880
It's about what's packaged on it

1722
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:41,184
Right it really is the the

1723
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:42,976
What will becomes a problem

1724
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:45,280
And Randy

1725
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:46,560
Is a

1726
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:48,608
Absolutely

1727
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,144
They're both raised

1728
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,168
Second generation

1729
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:55,264
They both have this incredibly intense

1730
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,080
A religious education both of them can toss out

1731
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,616
Anytime they all have that

1732
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:02,944
Televangelist way of talking words like

1733
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:09,344
Say where's where's where's where where was Hebrews 918 where is where where where you know that that whole thing big quotes

1734
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,624
From from memory

1735
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:12,928
Neither one of them has any greater

1736
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:14,208
Command of the Bible in the

1737
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:16,512
And both of them say almost

1738
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,792
Exactly the same thing

1739
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,840
And both of them disagree on ever

1740
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,400
Randy is the only one who does

1741
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:24,704
That's the thing that fascinates

1742
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:25,984
About all this

1743
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:29,312
So basically

1744
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:31,104
Disagreement there having

1745
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,640
Is that dr. Jeffers

1746
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,712
Wants to get rid of this one

1747
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,808
Terry's got a dippy ology

1748
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:40,832
Yeah yeah

1749
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:44,160
I don't know I I go back and forth between just calling him

1750
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:44,928
Robbery

1751
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:46,976
Jeffers or. David

1752
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:49,024
Big Bob

1753
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,352
But yeah it to your point

1754
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:57,472
I find him so terrifying because the guy who is trying to be the bad boy

1755
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:59,520
Is calm quiet

1756
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:00,544
Humble

1757
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,312
Karen

1758
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:03,872
And the guy who is the pristine

1759
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:10,272
Never been in trouble always enthusiastic that guy waving around and

1760
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:11,552
I'm so happy all the time

1761
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:12,320
Is

1762
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:16,672
A tool created by a guy who wants to build a

1763
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:18,464
Christian theocracy

1764
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:22,816
And so now he is that perfect tool for Trump

1765
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:25,120
It is almost like Jeffers was

1766
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,912
Created by Criswell

1767
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:29,472
To be used by the first fascist

1768
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:34,080
Dictator they could that could show up in order to solidify

1769
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,616
The Christian right

1770
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:36,384
And

1771
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,432
Because Jeffers is

1772
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:41,504
Genuine and Brilliant and real

1773
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:43,296
And Trump is a lying piece of s***

1774
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:45,600
Jeffers is going to trick Trump

1775
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:47,392
Essentially into creating it

1776
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,416
As a Christian

1777
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:50,208
Fascist

1778
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:50,976
Dictatorship

1779
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:51,744
Instead of just a

1780
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:53,536
He is

1781
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:54,304
Terrifying

1782
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:57,632
The history of Christianity is literally

1783
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:01,472
The world is we need to end the world in order to create our world

1784
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:03,776
And then on the other side you have

1785
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,336
Randy Robinson

1786
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,872
Dealing with trolls

1787
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:14,272
Loving his life and this is this is just like I I listen to this clip and I was just like this

1788
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,552
This is the guy that

1789
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:17,344
I think of whenever I think of like

1790
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:19,904
The Christianity that I

1791
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:22,464
Someone admire a little bit like listen to this

1792
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,000
Charlie

1793
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:24,768
Charlie sister

1794
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:25,792
The Staten rules

1795
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,328
Because Charlie came out

1796
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,096
Spell satan

1797
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,912
He's telling me God doesn't exist

1798
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,192
There's a problem Charlie

1799
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:34,240
You might as well tell me my wife doesn't

1800
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,080
Latin does rule

1801
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:41,664
Satin rules cuz you don't know how to spell Saint doesn't have that like

1802
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,712
He doesn't have that you don't know it's just

1803
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:46,784
You don't know how to spell Satan

1804
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,320
Yeah I know

1805
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:51,392
You're trying to tell me God isn't real

1806
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:55,232
Tell that to my wife like it's it's so much just this

1807
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:02,144
Benign kind of this guy that like you were saying that is a z

1808
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:05,728
He's just trying to say I got exist in the same way my wife does

1809
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,264
Laurence Powell

1810
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:09,824
He's he's just a nice guy

1811
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:10,848
I think

1812
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,384
To me like

1813
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:15,456
In my experience cuz I've spent so much time in

1814
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,248
In Christian world and say love you

1815
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:19,808
I know Jeffers

1816
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,856
I've seen that guy

1817
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:22,624
Everywhere

1818
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,208
But the large majority of people that I have met in so many

1819
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,000
Is

1820
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:28,768
Randy

1821
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:29,792
I would agree with

1822
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,328
That kind of depth

1823
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:32,352
And so

1824
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,888
Whenever people talk about

1825
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,680
Why is it

1826
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:36,960
That

1827
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:39,520
You know

1828
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:40,800
Christians follow Trump

1829
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:42,080
I see it as

1830
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,872
A function of this

1831
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:44,896
Kind of

1832
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:45,920
Scism yeah

1833
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,248
And the guy who trained the faccia

1834
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,272
Was

1835
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:51,552
Baby the best

1836
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:53,088
Televangelist

1837
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:59,488
The time and the guy who trying to chill guy with Dad was just sort of kept a low-profile

1838
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:05,632
Yep you're bothering me out I know right and it's not because

1839
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,656
There

1840
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:10,240
Jeffers is so good at using the same words

1841
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,264
Is the Christians

1842
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:15,360
Used to mean positive things and twisting them into something horrific

1843
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:17,664
All the while believing it's good

1844
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:20,992
Like that's why he's such a powerful tool

1845
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,528
Is because Criswell got him

1846
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:23,808
At such a young age

1847
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,368
And controlled every aspect

1848
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,136
Of his life

1849
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:30,976
And I'm sure you know yeah whatever about his own motivate

1850
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:31,744
But it's

1851
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,768
Fairly clear

1852
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:33,792
That if you were

1853
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:34,560
If your

1854
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:35,328
Captured

1855
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,608
By Criswell

1856
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:40,192
And taken under his wing personally at 7 years old

1857
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:42,240
You're not going to be unaffected

1858
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:44,800
Yeah it's going to be a tough

1859
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:45,568
Course correct

1860
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,872
Very least absolutely

1861
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:50,944
And you're not fully developed in your being

1862
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:53,504
You know bombarded with a lot of like

1863
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,296
Really heavy stuff

1864
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:58,624
Give me hard to process the stuff that's coming in in addition

1865
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,392
Shinto

1866
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:02,720
Adolescence growing up yep

1867
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:05,792
Now that's a bummer

1868
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:07,840
Yeah and it's from the guy who's

1869
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:08,864
The best at it

1870
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:09,888
Bike

1871
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,448
Criswell is a brilliant cult

1872
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,984
Dew point

1873
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,288
The closest the closest like

1874
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:19,360
Analog for Criswell and

1875
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,896
Jeffers that I can think of

1876
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:23,200
Is El Ron Hubbard and

1877
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:23,968
Miscavige

1878
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:25,504
Like that's the type

1879
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,528
We're dealing with

1880
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:30,112
Jeffers believes all of this

1881
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,672
To the point where it's indistinguishable

1882
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:33,952
From

1883
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:34,720
From reality

1884
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:35,744
Like its

1885
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,512
It's amazing

1886
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:43,168
But most people like and here's the here's what I'm saying again with Randy kind of having that sense of

1887
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,472
I know something's not right

1888
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:47,520
But I don't know

1889
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:50,592
Why I'm fighting it like it in this in this club radio

1890
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:54,432
In the futurist view we believe that

1891
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:56,736
A new world's going Jesus will come and set up his

1892
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:57,504
His kingdom on Earth

1893
01:29:58,784 --> 01:29:59,552
And then there will be no

1894
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:02,112
Here's my question for you

1895
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,160
In a

1896
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,184
The

1897
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:08,768
That I would have with

1898
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:09,792
Futurist Buick

1899
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,560
Which Doctor Jeffers

1900
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,656
And in that is when I look at what

1901
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:15,936
Jesus didn't his work on the

1902
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:16,704
Across

1903
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:20,800
I believe

1904
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,824
He gave us every

1905
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,848
Good thing we need to

1906
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:23,616
To establish his

1907
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:25,664
Okay

1908
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,248
Is the kingdom here on Earth is already ready to go

1909
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,808
Randy wants to make the world a better

1910
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:35,392
Randy thinks we have the tools to make the world a better place

1911
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:39,744
Huh well I mean I guess that is the difference in depth

1912
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,536
The definition of like what

1913
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:43,840
The promise of the Cross was

1914
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:46,656
Is the promised already fulfilled

1915
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:47,680
In the act

1916
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:49,472
Of the crucifixion and Resurrection

1917
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,800
Or is it contingent on some

1918
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:54,080
Future of that

1919
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:56,128
That does seem to be

1920
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:58,688
A profound difference

1921
01:30:59,456 --> 01:30:59,968
Opinion

1922
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:06,368
I know it at that stuff I'm always down for the religion that takes the shape of

1923
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:08,672
Things that will create a better world for everybody

1924
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:10,464
So

1925
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:13,280
Without knowing any of the other stuff that he believes cuz I

1926
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:17,632
I really feel like I might be stuff I don't know about this really f****** here's the thing though

1927
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:18,656
That's again

1928
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,448
That gets to my point exactly

1929
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:24,544
I will guarantee enough I know

1930
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,360
Randy believes in obviously

1931
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:29,408
Like conservative right-wing bulge

1932
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:31,968
He will say it he'll repeat it

1933
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:35,040
And it's just so clear to me

1934
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:37,344
That what underpins his beliefs

1935
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:40,416
Have him saying that stuff in order to stay in lockstep

1936
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:42,208
With the people that he thinks there is two

1937
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:45,536
All of these all of these people

1938
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,352
Goes into that kind of second generation

1939
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:50,912
Televangelist the difference between them

1940
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:51,680
Is

1941
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:53,472
Randy is

1942
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,240
Like

1943
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:56,032
He was raised in this

1944
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:58,848
He knows the language he knows what he's supposed to believe

1945
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,152
And there's a part of him that is fighting again

1946
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:03,200
There's a part of him somewhere that's like

1947
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:06,272
I know it's bad to do this

1948
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:07,296
But

1949
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:08,832
I'm told by

1950
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:12,160
Guys I respect guys who are the kings of the world

1951
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,696
Leader of the biggest

1952
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:15,488
Of the first megachurch

1953
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,512
Right now

1954
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:20,352
He's telling me that this is what we have to say is what we have to believe

1955
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:21,376
That kind of s***

1956
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:26,240
I mean was it Criswell or Jeffers who

1957
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:28,800
Started their speech off by saying

1958
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:31,872
The evils of liberals

1959
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:33,408
Yeah so he taught Jeff

1960
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:37,504
It wasn't necessarily the mentor for

1961
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:39,808
Randy Rhoads so it makes I mean like

1962
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:43,136
Did the rejection of liberalism in the rejection

1963
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,928
Look like a humanistic perspective

1964
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:45,696
Is

1965
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:47,744
Going to ultimately leave

1966
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,512
Towards

1967
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:51,328
Not

1968
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,608
Recognizing

1969
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:54,400
United

1970
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:56,448
Society

1971
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:58,240
It's going to always are towards

1972
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,264
Utopianism

1973
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,800
The future of like weird

1974
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,336
Create this this perfect thing

1975
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:04,128
Once this liberalism

1976
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:05,408
Where people have freedom

1977
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:07,200
Game of choice and they can send

1978
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:10,272
They're allowed to send once were free of that

1979
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,832
Yeah it makes sense with that dude

1980
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:16,672
The dude who is a sort of mentored by that guy

1981
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,440
Tubi

1982
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:21,024
Barbara down that site then

1983
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,304
Then someone else

1984
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,072
He's

1985
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,096
Far more effective

1986
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:26,656
Like this is this is what

1987
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:28,192
What's amazing to me

1988
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,216
Is that

1989
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:30,496
Jeffers

1990
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,264
Is

1991
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,032
Trained

1992
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,824
As a weapon

1993
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:35,616
Jeffers was weaponized

1994
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:36,640
From a young age

1995
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:39,712
And it's very clear that Randy was just raised in the

1996
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:43,040
Like that is so much the difference to me

1997
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:44,832
A between the two of them

1998
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:47,136
Jeffers is here

1999
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:48,160
To remake

2000
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:48,928
All of Chrissy

2001
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:50,464
Unity increase Wells

2002
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,232
Image

2003
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:53,280
And Randy is here because

2004
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,048
His dad is a

2005
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:54,816
The televangelist

2006
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:56,864
And he got a little guy he got a little gig

2007
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:02,240
Shawn Michaels and here's the other thing like Randy's on Randy's website which is

2008
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:05,568
Very cute it is essentially an Angel Fire page

2009
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:08,640
It's very funny he has these little

2010
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:10,944
Like devotional isn't stuff that he's written

2011
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,224
Before there's like five things

2012
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:14,528
Almost all of them are about

2013
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:15,296
TV

2014
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:16,576
He just loves TV

2015
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:22,208
He's eat like here's how we can make Christian TV shows you watch TV shows and when they're Christian your life

2016
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:23,488
TV shows suck

2017
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:26,560
Here's what we can do to make them better and that kind of

2018
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:28,608
This guy just wants to work in TV

2019
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:29,888
You have no idea

2020
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:32,192
He's like he just he just loves TV

2021
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,728
Like that's what he was raised up

2022
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:34,496
Loving

2023
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:39,616
Jim Bakker absolutely I think Randy

2024
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:41,920
Sums up my views on

2025
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,968
Jeffers pretty easily right

2026
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:45,504
Craigslist

2027
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:46,784
Satan is a bully

2028
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:47,552
Hundred percent

2029
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:50,112
You got milk he's a liar

2030
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,392
Before crap

2031
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,744
That's cute the bad boy

2032
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,584
Can I can I see that

2033
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,192
God I know Randy I know so many Randy

2034
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,984
Daisy McQueen

2035
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:07,264
He's very cute

2036
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:11,104
And he's going to get eaten alive by dr. Jeffers

2037
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,128
Every f******

2038
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:19,808
Probably yeah I mean if there's a if there ever is call for a head-to-head confrontation

2039
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:21,856
Is this close to the call for a head-to-head

2040
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:22,624
Confrontational

2041
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,904
Can get this from

2042
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,952
A couple weeks ago

2043
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:32,352
Space

2044
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:35,424
Might have to do a part 2 on that

2045
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,496
This is interesting

2046
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:40,032
I don't know what I think about this

2047
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,896
I get criticized a lot for not being like more aggressively atheist

2048
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:45,920
In my position

2049
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:48,736
Like anti-religion oh my background

2050
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:49,504
Suggest I should be

2051
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:54,880
You heard me a very stringent anti-atheist

2052
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:59,232
Slowly and gently very stringent atheist

2053
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:02,048
Slowly and gently fall in love

2054
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:03,328
With a Bob Ross a Christian

2055
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,608
Like

2056
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:08,704
This guy is is what I've always thought that Christianity

2057
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,240
Like wants to be

2058
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,776
And he is in thrall

2059
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:13,824
That's what I think of

2060
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,176
Absolutely

2061
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:23,040
Not so boring

2062
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,576
You so boring

2063
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,928
That's what I'm saying that's why he lose

2064
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,976
It's why he loses

2065
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:31,744
Like any

2066
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,864
Can we go back to the wrestling thing like that's why heels are often more like

2067
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,144
Exciting than fat

2068
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:42,240
And I like the good guys are often kind of Dopey and like

2069
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:44,800
I am a little bit boring or his

2070
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:47,872
Wii characters that are allowed in the bad guy

2071
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:53,248
Arizona always a little bit more they have urged to them they're more interesting

2072
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:56,832
But they're assholes and you want to see them get beat by the good guy eventually

2073
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:58,112
That's how you make the money

2074
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:59,392
Right but what if

2075
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:01,184
You're the ass hoe

2076
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:06,304
You're the Healer who says all the interesting things you get so much press attention all the

2077
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:10,400
And yet when people want to look into you and find out where you're a liar

2078
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:12,192
Find out where you're full of s***

2079
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:13,472
And really explosion

2080
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:14,752
And it turns out

2081
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:17,312
You're the sweetest kind of human being

2082
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,336
Alive

2083
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,872
You're incredible

2084
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:26,528
There's just nothing bad to say about you personally you live that life that you say that you you do like

2085
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:27,296
Like that whole thing

2086
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:32,672
I mean Marty come both Marty Underhill and the the hero

2087
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:33,696
Party dresses

2088
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:40,096
Was going to kick my ass but I'm sure there's a wrestling analogue for that

2089
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:40,864
Character

2090
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:48,288
I'm sure that is a character I can't think of it but that's that's the thing that I think is so attractive

2091
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:50,080
To Chris

2092
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:51,872
Shinto otherwise would never

2093
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:52,896
Go along with

2094
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,432
Such a moral bulshit

2095
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:58,016
Is that the guy spouting amoral bulshit

2096
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:01,344
Is living the moral life that most of the most Christians

2097
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,112
Hitler

2098
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:08,768
Like most Prosperity aspect of the lot of these like a

2099
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:10,816
TV preachers who live these

2100
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:17,216
Largely comfortable affluent lives and leaves create like

2101
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:23,616
An image that there that it becomes aspirational almost to their to the light to the audience in congregation

2102
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:24,896
What is the buttocks

2103
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:25,920
That's what I'm saying

2104
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:31,808
Jeffers is different even from that if I wanted to talk about that you know we could talk about Paula white-cain all day

2105
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:33,600
Like this

2106
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:36,928
Some of these people are those guys

2107
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:37,952
Who are

2108
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:40,768
Selling you something and trying to win money from the grill

2109
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,584
And I genuinely don't think Jeffers is

2110
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:45,888
Jeffers is not trying to Griffith

2111
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,680
Political he is

2112
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:50,496
Yours is working on a political project absolute

2113
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:51,776
Jeffers is a

2114
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:52,544
True Believer

2115
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:55,104
And the one thing that he truly believes in

2116
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:58,944
Is getting rid of the rest of us and creating a white Christian theocracy

2117
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:01,248
And you will say anything

2118
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:02,784
Defend anyting

2119
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,320
Do anything

2120
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:05,856
To make sure that that

2121
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:10,208
Let's hope Randy Rhoads wins that I know right

2122
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:13,280
Got your back Randy come on buddy

2123
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:16,352
Man Randy Robinson

2124
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:18,656
He's at most of his

2125
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:23,520
Stuff has like a few hundred views he's just a nice guy

2126
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:25,568
Mommy's trying to enter a space

2127
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:27,104
It's not made for what

2128
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:27,872
He's doing

2129
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:28,640
You know like

2130
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:29,920
It's

2131
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,456
I like to s*** on

2132
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:35,808
Like Dave daubenmire for having like 35 use

2133
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,088
Would be fair like

2134
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:39,648
YouTube streaming isn't the place for

2135
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,952
It's not a huge popular place for

2136
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:44,768
Christian extremism

2137
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:49,120
Necessarily so it's got to be even

2138
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:49,888
Vore

2139
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:51,936
A waste

2140
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:53,728
And or no man's land

2141
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:55,520
Religious

2142
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:58,080
Sitting around chatting

2143
01:39:58,336 --> 01:40:00,128
I mean good on him no because I mean

2144
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:02,176
I mean again

2145
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:03,456
Hey I'm hesitant

2146
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:04,224
Say anything

2147
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:05,504
To committal because

2148
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,296
I don't know anything about the I guess

2149
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:12,160
Like the idea that like he's carving out a space l on Twitch

2150
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:15,232
It like no one is doing that

2151
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:19,328
There is a place for it in terms of streaming Platforms in if it's

2152
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,352
Him doing it

2153
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:27,264
Genuine person then unfortunately

2154
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,056
Monsters will gravitate towards a

2155
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:33,152
And exploit the work he's done and then his kid will become the Antichrist

2156
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,992
I think that's the only thing we can only think that we can say

2157
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:38,528
Is for 100% going

2158
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:40,576
You heard it here

2159
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:42,112
Randy Robinson's kids

2160
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,160
Will destroy here

2161
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,976
I mean if it skips a generation

2162
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:47,744
Alright

2163
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:49,792
No I mean

2164
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:51,072
If that's but that's the thing

2165
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:53,632
All four of these televangelists

2166
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:55,680
Absolutely hold of Horrid View

2167
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,496
There's no doubt in my mind

2168
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:00,800
To varying degrees

2169
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:02,080
There is

2170
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:02,848
But

2171
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,896
James Robison

2172
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:05,920
First

2173
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:11,296
Started by like just going like I don't want to be part of this anymore for whatever reason

2174
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:12,832
Pretty much

2175
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:20,000
In the Christian televangelists world

2176
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,536
He believes in Opelousas

2177
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,072
Randy Robbins

2178
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:26,656
Absolutely in the Christian televangelist world

2179
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:28,192
He believes a lot of horrible ship

2180
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:31,008
But when you listen to Randy talk

2181
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:32,288
You can see that he is

2182
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,568
He doesn't want to

2183
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:38,432
I think there's so many people who just don't want to believe this horrible s*** but they are

2184
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:40,992
Because part of the teachings of Christianity is like

2185
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,784
Shut the f****** and listen to your pastor

2186
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:45,088
You know it's that kind of thing

2187
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:46,624
So

2188
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:50,976
I don't know if I fully got my point across but I feel like I did all right

2189
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:52,256
How big is a lot of points

2190
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:54,560
Linda

2191
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:59,168
Yeah it's it's at me thinking I think there's a lot of reflection

2192
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:03,264
I don't know why I would I would say they would I see from this is like two

2193
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,080
French ejector he's going through time. Like

2194
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:11,200
The one that seems to be working towards a better outcome and one that seems to be working

2195
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:15,040
Toward the worst you haven't both of them believing

2196
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:17,088
That they're working for the better out

2197
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:21,184
Yeah I think almost everybody does it even Alex

2198
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:25,536
It's hard for me to say this

2199
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:33,472
Cuz I'm not sure I believe it I know right that's why it's so refreshing for me to study people who do believe what they say

2200
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:37,056
X I do think that he probably thinks he's doing what's right

2201
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,616
There's at least a part of him

2202
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:48,576
These guys probably fully think that what they're doing is 100%

2203
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:49,344
Yeah

2204
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:51,392
I'm fascinated by these guys

2205
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:55,488
Or I think that you're always going to find that whenever

2206
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:56,256
The

2207
01:42:56,512 --> 01:42:58,048
The genre is religious

2208
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:00,864
Yeah you know that you're always going to find people who

2209
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:01,888
Armoire

2210
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:03,936
Believing that what they're doing is right

2211
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:04,960
It's

2212
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:07,264
You take the the framework

2213
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:09,568
Of politics and replace it with

2214
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:10,592
Religion

2215
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:13,408
Grated Alex is a crypto

2216
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:16,992
Religious religious beliefs

2217
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:18,528
Behind political message

2218
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:19,552
And also alien

2219
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:22,368
And

2220
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:23,392
Delano movie reference

2221
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:27,232
There's there's still like

2222
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:30,560
There's still the political veneer to it that allows do you like

2223
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:35,168
Committed

2224
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:40,032
Saint Paul and Rand Paul and then spark Trump God

2225
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:42,336
If you're in a religion for

2226
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:45,408
Where's your ears one of these televangelists you can't be like

2227
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:50,784
My candidate is God and I'll hold on

2228
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:57,184
Another another guy you know contenders showed up and God is not doing it for me so guys you should vote for

2229
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:00,768
Yeah that does make it harder doesn't it

2230
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:06,656
So yeah that's that's televangelists damn I think I like what I made her run

2231
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:10,240
And this is this is what we talked about as far as me doing episodes is

2232
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:12,800
After the last one with Mark Moreno

2233
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:15,104
I never want to talk about Mark Marino a

2234
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:20,736
I think the feeling is mutual same thing is true of Robert Jeffrey

2235
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:26,880
Alright I never want to talk about Robert Jefferson baby we open up a whole new series where you start taking on some of these

2236
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:33,280
Televangelist that I don't want to f****** tell her we got a lot of requests to people out of town.

2237
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:34,816
Recover like Rick Wiles

2238
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:37,120
Some of these

2239
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:39,936
Maybe that's maybe

2240
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:44,288
Maybe that's the new genre of Jordan Take the Wheel

2241
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:48,384
