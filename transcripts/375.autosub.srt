1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Air Jordan

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge B

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,832
Sprite.com

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,720
Bourbonnais weather

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
Size around a little bit about Alex Jones

6
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
Do you have a

7
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,472
A regional saying that you appreciate the most

8
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,544
Like I know we talked about the proof of the pudding is in the

9
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,360
That's not reasonable

10
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,384
Is the correct

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,224
I'm just saying is there one that you recall that was like

12
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:30,112
Maybe you brought it out into the larger World in Chicago and somebody's like I have never heard that crazy

13
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,904
You said before

14
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,184
I don't know boy howdy is

15
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,488
Goodwin

16
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,256
Did the greeting

17
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,560
Knee high to a boll weevil

18
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,168
I've always heard knee-high to a duck

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,984
Reminder like weird things

20
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
Like

21
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,288
Bitten

22
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,592
Like a cigarette

23
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,200
To do that it was pretty big in Missouri I don't know if

24
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,224
I don't know

25
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:03,136
I don't know I'm not very malleable by way of

26
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,952
If you will it's not how I would put it I just don't

27
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:06,976
The slang

28
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,632
Right it's not I feel silly wait did you say you don't cotton to slang too much yeah okay well that seems

29
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,912
I don't know

30
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,240
Oxymoron I feel silly using these things like

31
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,776
I make a joke out of

32
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,968
My personality doesn't fit well with slime

33
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
I don't know babe I feel like region

34
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,016
Colloquialism

35
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,808
Anyway but I don't know

36
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,088
Understand probably is

37
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
Sticks out too much

38
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,720
Edgar from this area

39
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,048
I'm from Southern Illinois

40
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,864
Which is not too far away from

41
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,960
But yeah I remember all of them were about fishing

42
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,776
Because my grandpa was my grandpa was huge and

43
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
Inefficient

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,872
To the point where he took my grandma fishing on their honeymoon

45
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,664
Cuz she was six

46
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
And

47
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,552
Leave that alone.

48
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,344
The 1930s right there right

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
That's a great depression man

50
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
But it was always like a

51
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,024
All the crappy you're really biting today in your life I don't know what you're talk

52
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,304
About we're not fishing right now

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,072
Now so

54
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,864
What's that sounds

55
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,960
Like

56
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,544
No I wasn't awake yeah but that was just an example

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,336
Something far more

58
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,616
Inscrutable

59
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,432
To the point where I can't remember any of

60
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
I don't know

61
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
I apologize

62
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
Little bit

Money off that heroin

89
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,927
Freakishly large

90
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,375
Angel with these gents to I'd like to

91
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,103
Jordan today we are going over November 29th

92
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
2019

93
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,199
Teen and actually we're not going over the whole episode because

94
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,247
A lot of it is not nearly as important

95
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
As

96
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,807
And interview that Alex has

97
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
On that

98
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
Yeah yeah yeah

99
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,487
We are last episode we saw Alex go pretty hard against

100
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:56,607
Jdl the Anti-Defamation League in the process of doing that some of his callers

101
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,191
Call Dan expressing kind of more overt

102
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:06,079
Anti-semitic ideas

103
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,639
When's the door up with this sort of language

104
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:14,527
Caller calls there's an investigation by the larouche people

105
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,343
Another caller calls in and says hey you really need

106
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,367
Need to talk to this guy

107
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,391
Play Michael Jones

108
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
Okay

109
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
And Alex

110
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
Super aware of who this guy

111
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,255
The caller is like

112
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,815
What is right on ya

113
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
You hoped that wouldn't go anywhere

114
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
But

115
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
Alex

116
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
Within a matter of days

117
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
4 days

118
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
In four days

119
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
3 days

120
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:40,127
25th is one day or whatever

121
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,943
Three business days

122
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
Alex has

123
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Michael Jones

124
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
As a guest

125
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,831
Really problem

126
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
I don't know

127
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
Play problematic

128
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
Because that seems

129
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,231
Trade there's some real problems with him having to have on the show

130
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,047
The word atrocious pops into my mind

131
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,863
Right there's some issues with ever having him on your show.

132
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,399
Which will discuss

133
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:08,799
But there's some secondary issues that are unique to Alex Jones Infowars having him on as a guest

134
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,079
That I think make this

135
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
Way worse

136
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,175
Okay and I hope that we'll be able to get through this

137
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
We'll do our best

138
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,319
Because it's going to be very

139
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
Do you know folks

140
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,159
Kristen and singularly pointed on

141
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,487
This interview I thought we'd get warmed up

142
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:32,351
By Sasha Banks theme song

143
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,887
We could use it

144
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,447
Warmed up here with the Clippers

145
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
Text talking about a headlight

146
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
That he is putting out

147
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,311
Okay no just to get our toes where at

148
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,871
There has been a bill introduced to ban

149
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
Krav Maga

150
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,271
Brazilian jiu-jitsu

151
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
In Virginia

152
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,647
And again that shows you where all

153
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,183
Is going

154
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
They want an outlaw

155
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,791
Citizens being able to defend themselves

156
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
Antifa

157
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,863
From the top

158
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,655
All the rest of it where I live in Austin

159
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,191
There are

160
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,519
Giant packs of Communists in black and red mask

161
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
Beating people up

162
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
Attaching building for white people live

163
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,175
White people by the way almost all of them

164
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,783
But if you have a cat sanctuary in East Austin

165
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,575
Did you build a new building there then

166
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
Gentrification

167
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
They're going to city council members home

168
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,767
Putting people's heads open in Austin

169
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,071
The police indicted one of them

170
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,631
And the city dropped charges under orders

171
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,935
The prosecutor is on board with them

172
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,239
Once they get the police in place

173
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
Prosecutors employee

174
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,663
Your only recourse will be defending yourself a deadly force when they try to kill you

175
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
Wait you're so pissed

176
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
And so

177
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
Remove by Banning

178
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,463
Krav Maga training

179
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,767
All of that okay

180
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,839
Defend all Brazilian jiu-jitsu

181
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,911
Alright

182
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
It's like dodging

183
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,567
But Mom mainly through mad still out

184
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,871
No surprise that Alex

185
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
Who's lying about

186
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
Virginia Bell

187
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:28,319
This is a recording that is based on a story was originally put out by Mike Adams natural news that argued that a proposed bill would

188
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
Would outlaw firearms training

189
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
And all martial arts

190
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,463
You could get that sense from the bill if you don't read it

191
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,279
Sent it does say that it would be unlawful if you quote

192
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
Assemble with one or more person

193
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
Thanks for the purpose of

194
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
Who traded with

195
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,143
We're being instructor

196
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,983
The use of any firearm explosive or incendiary device or technique

197
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,263
Capable of causing death

198
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Pasta person

199
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,847
That could definitely include a lot of martial arts

200
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,895
Some definitely cover pretty much all shooting range

201
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
Glasses

202
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,503
Butterbean I really feel like that

203
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,295
The hammer is going to come with like

204
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:05,695
To create a paramilitary force hell-bent on destroying the entire Union

205
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,743
Bill sharpen blades

206
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
Because

207
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,327
Ends with a qualification to Wood Circle

208
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
Open stance is under which those active

209
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,399
Would be illegal quote

210
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:20,799
Intending to employ such training in use in or in furtherance of a civil disorder right right

211
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
Also this has been on the books since

212
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,127
Since 1987 all the time

213
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,199
Now that there's slight changes being made to the language of the Bell

214
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,015
For instance to include marching with weapons with the

215
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:35,391
Intent of intimidating a person or group of persons right as prohibited paramilitary activity

216
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,183
Well I mean

217
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:41,535
I would argue that would also count against the Black Panthers

218
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
In the lights

219
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
I think

220
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
That

221
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,775
This bill comes down to the interpretation of what intent to intimidate a person or group

222
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,311
Right right right I don't

223
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
No

224
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:58,943
What would fall under that but I would assume that The Oath Keepers would still be able to march with weapons

225
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
Valley Fair

226
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,015
I assume.

227
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,063
I assume that the Black Panthers would not be

228
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
And The Oath Keepers would

229
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,927
I'm not sure very possible

230
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:13,535
At this at this point when I was looking into it still a proposed bill I have no idea

231
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:19,935
The thing about this is you can find tons of right-wing blogs picking up historian reporting on it as tyranny,

232
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
Coming out into the open

233
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
Very similar tone

234
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,823
There's a write-up about this on tacticalshit.com

235
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,407
Includes a picture of an Instagram post about the bill saying quote

236
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,943
You want to start the book

237
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,247
This is how and why you start the bug

238
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
Comments on political bullpen

239
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
And says quote

240
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,367
This might this just might be what

241
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
Kicks off the second Civil War

242
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,951
These two people are saying the same thing

243
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,487
Since Boogaloo has Reese

244
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
Become short

245
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
And the right-wing extremist use to flip it

246
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
Only discuss the coming

247
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
Second Civil War

248
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,679
God they're so stupid

249
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
Children

250
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,335
It's just another in a long string of ways that these dangerous bucks

251
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,895
So tried to normalize the fantasies of Justified Violence

252
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,223
Discussion of the

253
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,527
The great idea of

254
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:11,391
Killing Eve are we murdering hundreds of thousands of people if not Millions

255
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,207
No we're just starting the book.

256
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
That's all we're doing

257
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,303
Alex knows what he's doing by selling this fake narrative about this bill

258
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
He's trying to raise the temperature

259
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,631
And help

260
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
Disseminate something

261
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,215
That will provide that reaction from

262
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
These communities

263
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
So

264
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
That's great

265
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,871
We get to the center Dakshin

266
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
Here we go

267
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,759
Joining us this

268
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,063
Where is Michael Jones

269
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,647
And on a few times

270
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,439
I forgot my head

271
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,487
One of his books years ago

272
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,047
Monsters from the ID

273
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:54,655
Oh no, he was a professor

274
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
And he was removed

275
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,007
Because he was paralyzed

276
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,615
He's been massively persecute

277
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,175
Arrested they don't submit

278
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
Purging

279
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,271
Come on

280
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:15,903
About this big move for total censorship total control but really he's an expert on

281
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,463
Societal collapse

282
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:23,071
The plan to take our morals away so we can be easily enslaved and control

283
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:28,703
Code and one clip my worst fears about the direction of Alex Jones's show the way it's trending or completely

284
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
Confirmed

285
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:36,127
The very idea that you would have Michael Jones on as a guest and give him that sort of any reduction is so revealing about the way things are going

286
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,455
1 thingy Michael Jones is a well-documented entice

287
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,831
When Alex says that this guy is an expert on societal collapse it would probably be worthwhile.

288
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:49,439
Point out to his audience that he thinks Society is collapsing because of the Jews

289
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,023
It is publication the Jews and moral subversion

290
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,095
Michael Jones says there is quote

291
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:00,191
A group that is responsible for virtually every social in our day

292
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
From the wars in the Middle East

293
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,519
Pornography and gay marriage at home

294
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,591
Namely the Jews around whose evil machinations

295
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
History turn

296
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,687
Okay so it's not the Buddy comedy that I was

297
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
Moral subversion

298
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,135
Gotcha not that one

299
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:25,535
When Alex went off on his Jag the other day about the ATL and Sacha Baron Cohen speech you can very clearly see that his audience took that is green

300
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,351
We'd like to bring some hardcore anti-jewish talking points into

301
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
The conversation

302
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,935
Better than of itself isn't really surprising

303
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,751
Nor was it really that surprising that one of the callers would

304
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Would suggest that

305
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,799
Interview e Michael Jones

306
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,871
What is surprising is that Alex not only said nuts

307
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Like a good idea

308
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,943
Any followed through with the booking

309
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,967
In a matter of days

310
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
This tells me a number of the

311
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,551
Any which could be possible

312
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,855
It may be the case that Alex knows who the

313
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
This guy isn't still wanted

314
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,415
To have him on what to be f*****

315
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,207
It may be the case that he didn't

316
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,023
No we was but decided to book it without doing any research

317
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
Also

318
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
Pretty f*****-up

319
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:03,935
But even if that is the case that means that there's literally no one working at Infowars who decided

320
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,215
To step in and say Alex

321
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
This is not a good booking

322
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,055
I know you're mad at Sacha Baron Cohen right now

323
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,847
But this is not the way to go about doing

324
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:15,455
Yeah I assume if you just Google is name at least one of the whole being a All-Star

325
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,247
This dude is a f****** nut

326
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
It's very

327
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,063
Find

328
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:26,463
I'm inclined to believe that if you're considering having e Michael Jones on your show there's no way you can possibly claimed ignorance of who he is and what he's

329
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,791
It's Records Long and very over

330
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,095
In 2070 give a speech to the

331
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,655
The Press Club at a memorial for Samuel t

332
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
Francis

333
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,983
Himself a profound racist alleged journalist

334
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
This event was supposed to be aired on

335
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,567
C-SPAN it never aired

336
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
According to people who are in a tent

337
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,175
It's because e Michael Jones gave a shockingly offensive speech

338
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,735
I should point out the people who called the

339
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
Shockingly events

340
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,807
Where people who work for organization

341
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,111
Like the white nationalist publication video

342
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,927
Even though you thought Jones was way out of line

343
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:03,327
Yeah Himmler was like Jesus man, down they were at a memorial for a man who once wrote quote

344
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Breaking down

345
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,935
The sexual barriers between the races is a major weapon of cultural destruction

346
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,495
Michael Jones made them say well that's a bit

347
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
Okay alright

348
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:18,175
So they've so segregation now segregation forever is even that dudes like

349
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,223
Eggnog

350
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,503
Okay

351
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
Gotcha

352
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
I couldn't find video of the speech

353
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,111
But it did find a version of an imprint the Joneses

354
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:26,879
Self-publish

355
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,207
And I would say I can see how someone would find this very offensive

356
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,279
Here's some Choice passages from his speech

357
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,559
Quote as the gospel of

358
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,607
Play John makes clear the Jews became the

359
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,655
The Jews the minute they rejected Christ

360
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,215
As such there only identity is negative

361
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,263
Boy that doesn't sound right

362
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,663
Quote if what's left of the WASP establishment or the Paleo conservatives are other men of good will want to do something effective

363
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
In the culture wars

364
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,271
They will have to understand just who the enemy is in this battle

365
00:16:54,783 --> 00:17:00,159
In case you're curious you later clarifies quote The Real Enemy that turns out was the Revolutionary Jew

366
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:05,791
That's that's not the the twist ending that I was expect

367
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,119
From this Agatha Christie mystery

368
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,239
Quotes many if not most of us are here today because our careers have already been to

369
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,311
Destroyed by the Revolutionary Jew and is goyish frontmen

370
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,967
The Jews spy on us through our computers they suborn fellow Catholics to betray us get us fire prevent us from speaking

371
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,503
Our backs are to the wall

372
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:30,623
And when was this was a 2007-2017

373
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
Jesus

374
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:36,511
This was a big deal in conservative circles 12 years ago and John says not toned it down at

375
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
At all since that

376
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,607
There's literally zero excuse to have them on your showing

377
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Anti-semite

378
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,679
Or possibly in the rare circumstance

379
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,727
But you think you're capable of having a concert

380
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,007
Rotational interview with them

381
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,543
Even though I really don't think that's

382
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,359
Stephen a great idea

383
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
Do that

384
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,431
Yeah I could I could see that

385
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
But

386
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,991
I would say they'll advise

387
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,783
I'm really disappointed in our

388
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,599
Ever since he was kicked off social media today

389
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,159
His feelings about Trump and started to Waffle a little bit

390
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,951
Cardi B like watching a coin flip

391
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,511
Had to go back to being a coded speech

392
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,047
Conspiracy guy was mad

393
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,095
The three people voted in the Federal Reserve and you

394
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
I get to hang out with Ron Paul's brother

395
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
Tails he becomes the worst version of

396
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
Himself possum

397
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:22,079
When I was doing some research for a 2013 episode I came across an article in The Daily Beast

398
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,615
About the tendency of people to

399
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,895
Describe two conspiracy

400
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,967
The main thesis is a familiar one

401
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,503
Basically

402
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,831
Describing guilt for a largely random event to a defined

403
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,647
Anime you can subconsciously feel more in control of your

404
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,231
However the article includes a quote from Stephen Lewandowski

405
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,279
A professor of Psychology from the University

406
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,303
The Western Australia

407
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,351
Who is he's dedicated a good bit of

408
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
It's time to study

409
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
Conspiracy community

410
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,959
And I think his comments are particularly relevant right

411
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,799
Lewandowski is discussing the dynamic it play with

412
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,591
Conspiracy paddlers like Alex

413
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,359
Glenn Beck

414
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
And healthy

415
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
Music

416
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,943
Economy is comprised of both these

417
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,735
Peddlers and of consumers

418
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
Of the information

419
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,807
And these groups their motivation

420
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
Spring gauges

421
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,623
Conspiracies might be completely

422
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
We different

423
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
He suggested

424
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,439
It's possible that these be

425
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
People like Alex

426
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
Glenn Beck

427
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,023
Maybe motivated by money or attention

428
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
Going on today

429
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,839
Say quote I can't look inside their head

430
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,863
It's but there's a lot of snow

431
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,447
Suggestive evidence that people say crazy things sometimes just to be notice

432
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,495
I know this from my work on climate

433
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
Because if no one is listening to these guys

434
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,359
Or fewer people are listening

435
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,687
To them the more over-the-top they go and the crazier their pronounce

436
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,711
Come

437
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,015
I think they're watching themselves being ignored

438
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,807
And that's the one thing they hate

439
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,879
So they crank up the volume and spread their falsehoods and Anza

440
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,207
I think that might be some of what's going on here as well

441
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,255
Yeah talking about Glenn Beck's Behavior

442
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,535
After the Boston bombing

443
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,095
This is well he's suggesting that that was

444
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:51,423
Play there I would also argue that that dynamic

445
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
Is true for bachelor in

446
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,263
I've not watched it but I'll take your word for it

447
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,103
I fear that the situation we found ourselves in the 29th

448
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,895
Is one where Alex's experience

449
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,663
Himself be

450
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,015
You can get local protesters to Gallatin when he shows up to rallies and it

451
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,087
But you can't really translate that into marketable attention

452
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,135
He's no longer than me machine

453
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,159
Triggering

454
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
Bricks don't really

455
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
Work anymore

456
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,743
No one's really interested in

457
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,095
Dumb s*** to buy his book to make it out of the

458
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,143
Play the number one seller

459
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,423
Really

460
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
Many books

461
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,471
Begin with

462
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,519
Riding harder

463
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,823
In many ways we've already seen this playing out on a

464
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,383
Show in the past year is rhetoric has escalated in

465
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
A lot of horrifying ways

466
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,455
The disgusting over-the-top

467
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,503
Obsession with delivering elaborate Fanta

468
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,039
Disease about kids being murdered and

469
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,575
His demon voice is just one of

470
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,855
Money manifestation

471
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
That

472
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,719
I don't know how else to describe so much of what Alex is doing these days other than

473
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,511
I'm cranking up the volume

474
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,327
Zied seems to be being ignored and

475
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,351
Tolerate that

476
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,887
Yeah embracing the void

477
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,191
And I think that this interview

478
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
Accepting it

479
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
Doing it

480
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,543
Can't see it is

481
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
Much elves

482
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,359
Other than that also

483
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,663
Things you can't really claim ignorance

484
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
I mean you can

485
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,991
But I'm not sure I believe you

486
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,623
Before we get into this I need to make clear that Alex Jones and E Michael Jones are not capable of having a cold

487
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,391
Conversation

488
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,184
Because they're both playing game

489
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
But they're kind of

490
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
Different games

491
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,328
Alex Jones a super into white identity and Christian identity

492
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,120
Extols the virtues of the West

493
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,960
Which we've heard him explain repeatedly is more or less just code for white culture

494
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,032
There's a heavy racial element what drives out

495
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,872
Well it's true that his worldview is structurally supported by historical

496
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
Semitism

497
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,712
It's not so clear that he necessarily hates Jewish be

498
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
Yeah

499
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:44,064
Conversely e Michael Jones is Not primarily concerned with Ray

500
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:48,672
In fact he believes that if you identify by your race you're falling for a Jewish trick

501
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,208
As he put it quote

502
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,000
You lost the battle when you became White

503
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
Because they get to Define your identity

504
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
And you didn't

505
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,400
He adheres to a fundamentalist version of Catholicism

506
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:02,240
Infuse most of the world's history of the battle between Judaism in the Catholic Church

507
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,312
We're all the criticisms you might have about the Catholic Church

508
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,616
I really just things that the Jews were at fault for

509
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:14,528
Sure there was that whole thing about priests molesting kids but they only did that cuz the Jews sexualize Society

510
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,576
We're not so we're talking about torquemada

511
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,368
That's what that's what we're doing right now

512
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,648
We're going there

513
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,768
You'll find a lot of arguments like that

514
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:29,120
One of the Hallmarks of Jones's rhetoric is the idea of logos

515
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,680
If you listen to another anti-semitic leaving right way

516
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,472
When content like Owen Benjamin

517
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,288
You'll hear the word come up a bunch

518
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,104
Generally is someone saying that logos is rising

519
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,896
And when you do that's a reference

520
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
Stewie Michael J

521
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:45,504
The foundation of his worldview is that the Jews killed Christ

522
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,808
She was a pure manifestation of logos

523
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,600
Essentially reason in the unit

524
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,880
And that kind of thing

525
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,440
All right because they did that they're all

526
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:57,280
Alright literally Express this on a podcast called red pill religion

527
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
Insane quote

528
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,352
The Jewish people as a group called for the death of Jesus

529
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,912
Is Christ the Jewish people as a group killed Christ

530
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:07,520
And they are enemies of the entire human race

531
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,104
Essentially every Jew was at bat

532
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,128
F******

533
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:12,896
Speech

534
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:16,224
Jesus man what an

535
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
It's

536
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,576
Jewishness

537
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
It's it's

538
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
It's a mess

539
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,464
So what we're dealing with here if I understand correctly is

540
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
Alex Jones

541
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,304
Is it possible that he's anti-Semitic

542
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,328
Incidentally

543
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,656
As a as a result of his white identitarian

544
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,216
Where is e Michael Jones

545
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,496
Is f****** in it

546
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,544
Yes and it's f******

547
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,872
But his version of anti-Semitism was a little more complicated then

548
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,920
What you might find on

549
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:50,528
Just some run-of-the-mill Neo-Nazi kind of

550
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
He has

551
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
He has this

552
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,856
Religious aspect

553
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,880

554
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,184
YouTube

555
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,952
It is

556
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,488
It's more complicated

557
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,768
I hope I think

558
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,048
And as we go along but

559
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,584
It's

560
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,632
And as far as Alex Goes

561
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
You know

562
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,936
I don't want I don't want to say

563
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,960
Incidentally

564
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
That

565
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,056
Whether or not he's aware of it

566
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,104
His world is based on

567
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,688
Incidentally is not the word I think I was more going with consequence

568
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,272
In that regard

569
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,296
He's at every opportunity

570
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,320
Opportunity in the course of

571
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,624
His career to understand where his beliefs

572
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,160
Come from and he has

573
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,208
Is either refuse to or

574
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,232
Never

575
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,768
So

576
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,584
Whatever the case is about

577
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,424
The beginning of their conversation through between the two Joneses

578
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,216
Centris primarily around the edge

579
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,520
Which adds an extra layer of difficulty

580
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,544
I'm trying to parse out

581
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
People are saying

582
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,848
For Alex bohica

583
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,920
Complains about the ebl he's really complaining about the globalist

584
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:54,784
Free Michael when he complains about the edl he's talkin about Jews

585
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
In general

586
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,880
View others even further blurring the complicates

587
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
Wednesday

588
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,232
And that is the E Michael Jones plays kind of fast and loose when he's

589
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,536
Is talk about what we means when he says the Jews

590
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,608
He doesn't believe that Jewish is an ethnic identity

591
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,680
This position seems to be that he's only against religious Jew

592
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:16,800
But that doesn't make any sense given that so many of the Jewish organizations that he's in

593
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,104
Conflict with aren't religious organization

594
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:23,456
It's all very complicated I promise I'm going to try my best to maneuver some of this

595
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,736
Pretty dicey territory

596
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,528
But I want to apologize upfront

597
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,808
And if I make any missteps

598
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,744
A lot of mess so could you get away from him if you're like not a non-practicing Jew

599
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,792
Or even if you're like no I'm more of a Christmas

600
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,864
What's an Easter type do you know I don't go to church all day

601
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,680
To it along the road I know that

602
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,960
He doesn't have a problem

603
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,984
With Jews

604
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:51,104
Jews have converted to Christianity I know that much

605
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,480
Ultimately for Alex Annie Michael both of their positions are rooted in historical and

606
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
Semitism

607
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:00,064
So they're able to have a conversation there on the service

608
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,088
Surface appears to

609
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
Scents to both of them

610
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,416
But they're talking around different

611
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,024
And I don't know how much I believe Alex isn't aware of

612
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
My advice for Alex

613
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:14,912
If I wasn't employed Infowars let's say maybe his dad who works

614
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,472
I don't know if his dad still works in HR but I like to imagine

615
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
He still does

616
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:22,080
Work at an invoice and I was Alex's dad I would have told him

617
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,104
If you're going to go on the

618
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,688
Since the edl the last guest you should have on

619
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:30,528
To help you get someone with decades-long history of overt

620
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,064
Agro antisemita

621
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
This is a

622
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,624
Horrible decision

623
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,696
Itself

624
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,720
Speaks volumes

625
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:44,352
Dad died I respect your opinion but I need to find out if he's my real

626
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:49,472
Same last name according to Alex that's proof enough for

627
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:54,080
Bandsaw a whole bunch of other people so introduction

628
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,664
Michaels.com

629
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,712
Joining the infowar today

630
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:03,296
Thanks for coming on with us you got the floor here to start

631
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,832
Wherever you'd like first

632
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,880
You could make the argument

633
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:11,488
You know like he doesn't look at this from an external perspective you could make the argument

634
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:16,608
Alex just wants to have this guy on the same way he wanted have David Duke on back in 2015

635
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,960
Either way of trying to debate someone who also they both believe in

636
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
Immigrant

637
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,008
Different

638
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,800
Ideas about the nature of the

639
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,104
If you listen to that intro

640
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,408
That is not the sort of thing Alex's doing

641
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,736
Is a friendly very respectful introduction

642
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,272
Is not confrontational

643
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,808
Adam Eve is a massive disappointment

644
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,624
Is couple years ago Alex at David Duke

645
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,672
And all he wanted to do

646
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,952
Let's try and be like hey

647
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,488
We both believe in this stuff

648
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,560
But you're bogged down in the race

649
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,352
And now you're someone who

650
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,472
I don't know favorably or unfavorably could be compared to take put to Kenny's like anybody

651
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,032
That's no good

652
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
That just

653
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:00,128
So this is not a situation where he's bringing them on to try and

654
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,920
Flush out the finer differences

655
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
Between our worlds

656
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,016
So like I said they start off by talking about the Ada

657
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
And it does

658
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,600
It doesn't take the entire it goes off

659
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
But it does start

660
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,440
With some complaints

661
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,000
Mostly about Sacha Baron Cohen seed or

662
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,840
Again I regret to inform you these guys are mad at Borat

663
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,680
Great major move on the part of the

664
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:28,288
ATL just this past week they gave an award to Sacha Baron Cohen

665
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:32,640
And he in response gave a speech that I thought was kind of chilling

666
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:37,760
He starts in demanding that the censorship be imposed on the internet

667
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,576
And the 380 lb in charge of the censorship

668
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,368
And then he goes on to say

669
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,976
If you big check people don't do it we're going to throw you in jail

670
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,816
This was kind of a shocking turn of events

671
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:57,216
Organization that suddenly is supposed to be put in charge of what we are

672
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:02,848
Thinking about what we're allowed to say on the ATL

673
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,968
So the first lie here is I'm saying that Sacha Baron Cohen speech included him saying that there needs to be

674
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,760
Censorship online and demands

675
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,296
That the 80 lb

676
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,064
Be in charge of that

677
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:19,488
You probably make an argument that he was calling for a form of online censorship and is much as a platform like Facebook and very easily

678
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
Strike things like

679
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,304
Holocaust denial from their platform easy

680
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,096
Without infringing on anyone

681
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,120
Is right to free speech

682
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:29,216
It's a matter of disentangling the idea of censorship from the idea of Oppression

683
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,008
What time censorship is appropriate

684
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:36,640
All that aside in his speech Cohen was not demanding that the ATL be in charge of online sensor

685
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,712
That's probably have someone like you Michael Jones my

686
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
Beetle

687
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,504
Watching the speech

688
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,784
But it wasn't

689
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,088
While he was speaking to a

690
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,464
A Jewish lad organization so naturally the only thing that he could assume

691
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,792
Is that he wants batl to control all cents

692
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,608
Adult speech anywhere Dan

693
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:01,472
Second Life Jones is very clearly trying to play fast and loose with who is doing what to whom

694
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,776
Sing the Cowan was saying that

695
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,848
If he's tech companies didn't go along with the edl censorship

696
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,128
And then we're going to

697
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,152
Throw you in jail

698
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,688
It specifically Mattis

699
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:14,528
Subconsciously in plant the idea in the listeners had the authority to

700
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,552
Send you to jail

701
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,600
In reality it's very clear to listen

702
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:24,000
The speech Nicole was advocating for the passage of laws or regulations that would play some responsibility on these social media platform

703
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,816
For atrocities that are facilitated by them

704
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,608
I know again

705
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,632
Someone Like You

706
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,656
Michael Jones that

707
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,240
Feels like the ATL sending you to jail if they don't like your free speech

708
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,264
But it's complete

709
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,080
Misrepresentation of what's being said this is the difference

710
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
Between

711
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,128
Feeling

712
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,176
Versus reality narrative

713
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
Versus

714
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,040
What would a narrative versus critique

715
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,088
Here's what I

716
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,160
I hear a sentence like

717
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:52,928
Hey

718
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:57,280
If you facilitate another genocide you should go to jail

719
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,560
And you here

720
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,120
Well they're just going to throw us all in jail

721
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,680
That suggests something very specific

722
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,984
Sure you're for

723
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,544
The whole you know that stopped

724
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,872
So he has some other things

725
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,640
To say about the 8th

726
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,408
CDL

727
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,968
I don't like

728
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,736
The way this is

729
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,320
Who is the idea what is this organization

730
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:24,928
It's an organization that was founded to protect a pedophile

731
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,000
The name of the pedophile soundtrack Frank

732
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,840
1913 he was arrested

733
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:37,984
Sexually molesting and then murdering a thirteen-year-old girl who worked in his Pencil Factory

734
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:44,640
At this point the he went on trial he was found guilty and then a series of

735
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:48,736
Attempts to overturn appeals took place

736
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:53,600
The appeals went all the way to stream Court every single appeal

737
00:31:53,856 --> 00:32:00,000
Reaffirmed the original decision and at that point the governor of Georgia community

738
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,816
One day before he was leaving office

739
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:08,960
At this point the people Georgia rose up an army of about two thousand armed men approached the

740
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,240
Governor's Mansion

741
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:16,640
Is that point that Governor fled to New York City where the call Jewish media basically created

742
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,920
Him as a hero

743
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:23,040
This is this is an organization that began by protecting a pedophile

744
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:26,624
And then continued in an operon operation where

745
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,744
The main point of this operation was to make sure that Jewish criminals did not go to jail

746
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:36,096
I think you can tell by this man's motive speech that he might have some more

747
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:39,424
Extreme positions that he's leading on on air

748
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:46,080
Sing that the governor flight to New York whereupon the Jewish media turns him into a hero is a bit of a red flag on its own

749
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,688
Didn't realize it already only a minute into this interview he has every reason

750
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
To think he's in

751
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
Deep trouble

752
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,016
This guy is clearly a

753
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:58,112
Boulder brand of anti-semite than he's used to dealing with and he's also very slow

754
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:04,000
The real important piece of the case of Leo Frank that e Michael Jones is kind of glossing over here

755
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,792
And that's after these men.

756
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,608
He's talking about and as far as I can tell they were less than

757
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,632
2000

758
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,216
I'll bet the way he's putting that they could approach the governor's mansion

759
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:17,312
After that they broke into the prison Frank was being held in sees him and Lynch

760
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,872
They were proud of themselves

761
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
Stephen Posen

762
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,456
Four pictures along the way and it disgusting display of Malbec

763
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,224
Activity

764
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,576
Why what is true that Leo Frank was convicted of the murder of this thirteen-year-old Mary phagan

765
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,904
And it is true that his appeals were rejected

766
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,744
It's almost Universal consensus among his story and said he was probably in a

767
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,024
And it very least

768
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,048
Did not get a fair trial

769
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:43,168
The case of Leo Frank is endlessly complicated and it'd be pretty impossible for me to lay out everyday

770
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,192
Detail about it here

771
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,472
So the best I could do is

772
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:49,056
Point out some places where you Michael Jones version are less than

773
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,080
Honest

774
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,896
He says that the ATL was quote founded

775
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,920
To protect a pedophile

776
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,736
In this case Frank is the alleged pedophile

777
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:00,320
There's no evidence other than rumor that Frank was sexually involved with

778
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,088
Girl

779
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,416
Though he was convicted of murder sexual assault charges were never brought again

780
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,184
Dance them and that's it

781
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
Improving

782
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,512
Jones's further saying that the ATL was founded

783
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,536
To defend Leo Frank

784
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,816
That's somewhat disingenuous

785
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:16,960
It is true that the ADI was founded after Frank was convicted and that his conviction was one of the issues cited when they formed

786
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,264
It wasn't like they created this organization

787
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,288
Specifically to protect

788
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,336
But now it's grown into what it is today

789
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,920
If you look at the history of the case and the trial that led to

790
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
To the conviction

791
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:31,808
You can easily see how this is the sort of thing they could be a signpost about some dangerous societal attitudes

792
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,880
Regardless of the outcome or even Frank's person

793
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
No guilt or innocence

794
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:40,000
For instance as the trial was proceeding groups of people would rally around the courthouse

795
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,536
Chanting hang the Jew

796
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:47,424
The environment and Georgia was so openly hostile to Jews that according to the Times of Israel after Frank

797
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
Lynching

798
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,984
Half the states Jewish population

799
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:57,408
This is more with a DL was formed in response to and it's absurd to imagine that he Michael Jones doesn't realize

800
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:02,016
He's creating a scapegoat out of Leo Frank in the same way that Lynch Mob did back at 9

801
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
1915

802
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,624
Interesting Lee Jones seems to ignore the other group that grew out of

803
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,672
Which is the second Ku Klux

804
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,000
Which has relaunched in Stone Mountain Georgia at a meeting

805
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,024
Flash cross-burning

806
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,072
It was attended by some of the very men

807
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,608
Lynched Leo Frank

808
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,168
These are elements of the story that

809
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,192
Michael Jones

810
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,728
Intentionally leaving out because he

811
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,752
You trying to recruit

812
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,152
This is the stuff that's fine to know once you're in the door but you don't want people to know it when they're just first taking in the message

813
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:32,480
You want to ignore the fact that Leo Frank was probably innocent

814
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,808
And was lynched by a number of people who go on to be a part of the formation

815
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,832
The second plan

816
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
Because those details with tent

817
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,648
Turn uninitiated

818
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,672
People off

819
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,440
From the message

820
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,720
Did your trying to push

821
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
And Alex is letting

822
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,864
I am glad for that

823
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
Extra contacts

824
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,448
But if you just said 1913

825
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,288
Trial and non-white out of been like he was probably

826
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,128
There's no

827
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,432
There's a lot of Dynamics in play

828
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,200
Interview the case

829
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,224
It's far too,

830
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,760
Of course of course

831
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,552
So he goes on

832
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,832
Jones Goes On

833
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,392
It's very complicated because his last name is Jones

834
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:16,512
Pretty much throughout this if I say Jones I'm referring to eat Michael Jones

835
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,072
But so do another

836
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:19,840
Criminal

837
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,864
The ATL

838
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,144
It's supposed to protect

839
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:27,520
The main point of this operation was to make sure that Jewish criminals did not go to jail

840
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:34,432
Meyer Lansky is an example of one person I'm talking about gave the ATL a lot of money it didn't work at

841
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
Time

842
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,784
So weird free Michael Jones to use Meyer Lansky is his neck

843
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,600
Example of a Jewish criminal the ATL tried to defend

844
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:46,464
Berlinsky was a big-time mob figure is associated people like Lucky Luciano

845
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,488
When was IMDb

846
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
With organized crime

847
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
To be sure

848
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:53,120
He was mostly operating gambling rackets and made a ton of money in that Hustle

849
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:59,264
In 1970 facing prosecution a flight to Israel which is exactly what neo-nazis say all Jewish people get to do

850
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,056
Because of the right of return they can just

851
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:04,128
Commit whatever crimes they want and when it gets too hot to go to Israel

852
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
I can hide out there

853
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,432
That's not what happened

854
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,736
Israel deported Lansky back to the United States

855
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,272
Stand trial where he was acquitted

856
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:13,856
And most sources I can find say was because he was too ill to stand trial

857
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:18,208
I guess the fact that he got extradited is what Jones means when he says

858
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:21,536
It didn't work that time but honestly I think his point is just a

859
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
Incoherent

860
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,120
It might be worth noting that the neo-Nazi

861
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,400
T crowd really

862
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,192
Really doesn't like mayor Lance

863
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,264
I have a suspicion please folks might be a little biased

864
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,336
Because outside of being a famous mobster

865
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,152
He's been a good amount of his time busting heads in American not

866
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:42,016
Here's Lansky describing how you disrupted a brownshirt rally in Manhattan

867
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,856
The stage was decorated with a swastika and a picture of Hitler

868
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,392
The speaker started ranting

869
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,952
There were only fifteen of us but we went into Act

870
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:54,304
We threw some of them out of Windows most of the Nazis panicked and ran out

871
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,840
We chase them and beat them up

872
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,400
We wanted to show them the Jews and not always sit back in

873
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,168
Acceptance Auto

874
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:04,032
Interesting will you can see how Publications like the national Vanguard Spinda

875
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,360
Lansky's gang took time off from clipping

876
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,664
Suckers and burger and Rivals to breakup purple

877
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,456
Legal meetings of the pro White

878
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:14,016
Pro National Socialist German American Bund

879
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:18,112
Being presented as a case of these these white rally-goers being a

880
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,648
Deprived of their free speech

881
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,672
Which

882
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,976
That rhetorical strategy of course has Deep Roots

883
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,768
And continues to this day

884
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
And these

885
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:31,680
F****** awful circles it's really cool how you used to be able to say very

886
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:35,520
Currently the pro-white pro nationalist socialist boond

887
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,568
Why would anybody object to that

888
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,848
That's not

889
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,384
Something that used to be

890
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,432
National Vanguard

891
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,712
Concurrently

892
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,248
Yeah it's f****** p

893
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,272
Yeah

894
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:52,928
So you know you can even see overlap with that like these the this National Vanguard ideas like

895
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,208
He'll Hades

896
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,768
Nazis just wanted to have a rally

897
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:01,632
And I need you

898
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:05,984
You can even hear a sort of Echoes of that in the

899
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,776
Hades

900
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,848
The abl wants to say hey you guys shouldn't

901
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,640
Hate speech of like

902
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,176
Holocaust denial

903
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,712
Are depriving me my free

904
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,296
Kind of see how it isn't never really change

905
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,088
You guys know what you're defending is

906
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,136
And you know damn well would it be

907
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,928
Go fuc yourself

908
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,744
So far the two criminals e Michael Jones

909
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,536
280 H setup

910
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:34,144
Protector I probably wrongly convicted man who subsequently Lynch by Future klansman

911
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,472
And by far the most prominent person who fought back against the American Nazi

912
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,008
Tea party during World War II

913
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:42,336
So far so good Coca-Cola

914
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:47,456
Near the third example a guy named Moe dalitz who was a bootlegger and eventual Casino guy

915
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,504
I don't really understand the point John's trying to

916
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,272
How to make about him

917
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,856
I think it's just at the ATL awarded him there torch of Liberty award

918
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
And Jones

919
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,672
This convinced that it's just because you gave him a bunch of

920
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:04,096
Show me the Bears mentioning is that where Michael Jones is putting out unchallenged on Alex's show right now is identical to its putter

921
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,376
Stop by the national Vanguard

922
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
Their article about the eight

923
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:10,240
CDL uses all of these same examples and has almost an identical

924
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,568
The national Vanguard isn't explicitly Neo-Nazi Oregon

925
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,336
Translation

926
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,640
Alex legitimately might as well have the Nash

927
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
Vanguard

928
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,432
Madagascar

929
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,712
He's got nothing

930
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,784
Simple but I know what you're

931
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,576
So Alec

932
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,856
Has a response

933
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:26,880
Do this

934
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,184
I think it's telling

935
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:35,840
Santa is real I'm not anti-jewish anything this is a group's got an ally it Mafia

936
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:39,936
Knowing that Americans don't want a give people for religion or race or anything

937
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:45,056
A money-laundering operation for international Mafia International crime

938
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,872
To go after anyone that exposes any of these Criminal

939
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,832
Just like the mafia says I'll burn down your grocery store if you don't pay me protection money

940
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,904
Mark Zuckerberg is a Jewish man

941
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,256
If he doesn't give this group of pirates

942
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:07,584
Full control over his company so it's a very dangerous Mafia

943
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:12,960
That rebuttal is really dumb but the only reason Alex's saying this I believe

944
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:16,032
I think is that he can tell he's talking to and

945
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,824
Anti-semite about the ATL

946
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:23,200
That's why you stressing me that he's not anti-jewish or anti-israel and has ucker Burgers Jewish

947
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,504
I suspect that's a subtle way for Alex.

948
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,344
Stewie Michael to speak in the queen's English if you will

949
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,416
Kind of way of saying don't say the things you want to say without having to

950
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,464
Discomfort of that actual conversation on air

951
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,816
Anybody want to get that sense

952
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:39,840
I

953
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:40,864
Fuel that

954
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,632
Away

955
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,680
Cuz it'll be really hard to hear the things

956
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,984
Is that junk something up to this point

957
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,752
And not be like

958
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,032
Kind of ghetto

959
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:48,800
What your

960
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,848
Laying down

961
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,640
Yeah you did

962
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,479
That's like the ATL specific

963
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,247
TV channel

964
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,015
Okay

965
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,807
He's talking about exactly what he's talkin

966
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,879
And if you know anything about the case of Leo Frank like

967
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,927
The fact that he's describing the events

968
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,231
That way and leaving out the part where he was

969
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,583
I think that speaks volumes on its own to

970
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,887
So

971
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,935
I remember

972
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,215
Like when I was

973
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,007
In my really early 20s

974
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:22,847
Like 20 22 something like that watching Sealab 2021

975
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,639
Which is

976
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:28,479
One of it like love that show and there's an episode that centered around all these

977
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,295
And the joke was

978
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,575
Set the people controlling everything

979
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,599
Where the 5G

980
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879
Right

981
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,159
And I thought that was funny

982
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:36,927
Because that's

983
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,487
Seems so over-the-top and stupid

984
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,511
Really

985
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
That's what you think that's

986
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,327
Hilariously stupid

987
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,887
Now I know what that that was

988
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,423
That was f******

989
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,007
Wow

990
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,311
So we go off

991
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,079
Yeah I know

992
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:56,127
It's not great there's a lot of bad stuff

993
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,175
So Alex Goes On

994
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:58,943
To complain

995
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,247
I don't even know how

996
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:08,671
Clive ladies and gentlemen Michael Jones gizzard I want to just remind

997
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:14,047
Without you will not be on here we are

998
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:25,567
The pogrom against

999
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,943
Injustice 2 things of Martin Luther King jr.

1000
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:34,015
F*** you

1001
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,831
They call me white supremacist they call

1002
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,903
Stephen Miller a white nationalist call for his firing

1003
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,207
It really is defamation

1004
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,279
I would everybody can be saved by

1005
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,583
Budget

1006
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,983
Forget we have the biggest sales the Year this is our biggest

1007
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:00,895
That was weird just can't I just can't do that

1008
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,663
Do that

1009
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,455
That's a lot but also lazy

1010
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,759
That's all I hear that's a lot

1011
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,551
On your on your

1012
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:11,647
Here's what we got a an explicit anti-semite

1013
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,975
Who's saying that the Jewish media is control and s***

1014
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,279
And they're trying to run a pogrom against us

1015
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,583
Also we got the biggest sales on right now

1016
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,119
F*** off

1017
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,655
SMS

1018
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
Pretty bad

1019
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,239
So also Tim Cook was given the

1020
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,055
Hey Tour by the ATL and 28

1021
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,615
But it's complete bulshit for Alex the climate of Gattaca

1022
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,639
Silence Dalek

1023
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,967
The reason cited for his receiving the award where that

1024
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,759
He matches his employees donations

1025
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,783
Charitable organization

1026
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:43,903
The fact that you responded to the United right rally in Charlottesville head-on with the employees at Apple

1027
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,183
In condemnation

1028
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,975
Amanda vet

1029
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,535
He's been a voice of support consistently for lgbtq

1030
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,559
BBQ in Emigrant right

1031
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:54,911
All the reasons that Tim Cook received this award are things that Alex stands against

1032
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,191
That is fair enough

1033
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,983
But I was trying to turn this into some

1034
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,055
Transactional thing with ATL wanted Alex silenced

1035
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,591
The Tim Cook did it for them so he gets

1036
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,639
A childish bulshit

1037
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,199
52 5th Ave

1038
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,759
So

1039
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,551
You might go goes on

1040
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,575
To complain

1041
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,367
I bet about how it's on

1042
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
Unfair

1043
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:15,903
What's happened to

1044
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,439
I don't agree

1045
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:23,839
That the problem is you can't object so it was Jose they attack me on Monday last week

1046
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:30,239
And then I go on another YouTube show and I said look the ATL just attacked me

1047
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:36,639
This is not fair I don't think they should have this power over who gets on the Internet or not so guess what hap

1048
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,943
YouTube video gets gets

1049
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
Wait a minute

1050
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,271
Can I objected

1051
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,575
To what these people just did to me

1052
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:48,415
I have no idea what he Michael Jones said recently to draw this rebuke

1053
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:51,231
Goodbye based on the sort of things you said in the past I really do

1054
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,767
Don't think it was not deserve for Buick

1055
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:01,471
So he can claim all you wants that it's just as Jewish organization that the

1056
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,007
It's everyone

1057
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,287
Anti-semite

1058
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:08,127
In 2004 the Catholic League put out a statement saying quote

1059
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:11,967
The Catholic League condemns Jones's antisemitism repudiates his efforts to

1060
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,015
To justified in the name of Catholic theology

1061
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:17,599
One thing is clear there are many Choice terms one can use to

1062
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,903
Describe Joneses view of Salvation history

1063
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,439
Catholic is not one of the

1064
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:26,303
See I just don't see any Catholic voices out here denouncing this kind of behavior

1065
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,351
I don't see why is it that every time

1066
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:34,751
We have some kind of radical Islamic terrorists all of Islam comes out and announces to everybody that we don't suppose

1067
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:38,591
For this kind of behavior but that a Catholic does it and I don't hear any voices

1068
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,383
I'm not complaining about Catholic

1069
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,455
Salt Lake up that I think

1070
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,271
The game is pretty simple with this sort of

1071
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:50,111
Assertive provocateur s*** like you say something that's in defense

1072
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,135
Cebollin bigoted

1073
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,927
And then some organization

1074
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:59,327
Is like hey indefensible and bigoted and then in order to defend yourself you have to say something worse

1075
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,863
Beach and that's because

1076
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,399
Would you date me

1077
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,471
That's the sort of game that's being played at

1078
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,239
Whatever

1079
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:09,567
If you need to really cut through the b******* I should probably tell you that a 2000

1080
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,359
3D Michael Jones with Addison

1081
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,639
CD called watching it

1082
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,407
MTV

1083
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,199
Neo ethnic songs and dances

1084
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,247
Which included a track called

1085
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,527
Fear the Jews

1086
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:25,439
This man is not interested in any sort of corruption in the edl or not being able to respond or anything like that he's a pure

1087
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,975
Or to his core anti-semite

1088
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,791
And what else is doing here is selling him to his audience

1089
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:30,815
The disgusting

1090
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:31,839
Display

1091
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,887
And I honestly generally

1092
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,191
Do you know what say I can't say I'm super surprised

1093
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
But I am kind

1094
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,495
Is that a

1095
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,263
Is that a like

1096
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,567
Parody version of Don't Fear the Reaper

1097
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,687
I didn't listen to it the greatest Weird Al Yankovic

1098
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,063
Then I got to be specific

1099
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,087
He's not white Nashville

1100
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,111
I understand

1101
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,415
He's adopted by a lot of ointment

1102
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,511
True but he himself

1103
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,559
He has a singular Focus

1104
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,583
Yes

1105
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,351
Scaccia

1106
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,375
So

1107
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:09,727
Michael Jones start speculating here about what's going on

1108
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:13,055
Between the ADL and

1109
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,335
Like Facebook

1110
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,359
Of them

1111
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,895
And I don't

1112
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
His theory

1113
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,503
So I think I think what we're saying it is push back

1114
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:28,159
Because they should have been insiders here in the tech World there was a big Grant they got in 2017

1115
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:31,743
Team up with all the big players

1116
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:35,327
And why are they saying that they're going to send them to jail

1117
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:41,215
If you're on the inside why you doing this to the people you're working with I think what we're saying here is push back

1118
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:47,615
But he said the people at the tech people are saying wait a minute we're the ones who were taking the full-year

1119
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:51,455
For these guys they get all the credit they determine what hate speech is

1120
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:55,295
They get to fight their enemies and we get to pay the bill

1121
00:48:55,551 --> 00:49:00,415
We're the ones who look bad because we're censoring people dancing to their tune

1122
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:06,815
So I think that notice you'll notice it notice that Sacha Baron Cohen said nothing is enough it doesn't matter what you do you have to let us

1123
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:13,727
So if you listen to that clip one thing it's very important to point out as the only evidence for E Michael Jones as fiery as his imaginary

1124
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,031
He's decided that it's a case that

1125
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,567
This is pushed back because he thinks

1126
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,103
The tech companies are getting mad at

1127
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,895
The ATL for being so controlling

1128
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:23,967
Look like that look like the bad guys are censored people

1129
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,759
Jones is just assuming

1130
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,295
That because of his own feelings

1131
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:32,159
Clear instance of Jones pushing a sort of Jewish

1132
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,439
Puppet Master narrative

1133
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,231
Traditional antiques

1134
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:39,327
From the protocols on down to everything Alex Jones says about

1135
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:43,935
George Soros the notion that the shadowy group of elite Jewish people control things from behind the scenes

1136
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,215
If I do it bankers

1137
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,519
Is one of those lingering characterization

1138
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,055
It's used to incite people again

1139
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,431
He preys on resentment and unfulfilled desires transforming what isn't going right

1140
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:58,527
Your life from being a product of circumstance into the result of Jewish Medellin

1141
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:03,903
That's a worldly that's being perpetuated by John's on this show not being supported seconded

1142
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
And sold by

1143
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,975
This is something I want to make crystal

1144
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
Clear

1145
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,047
Michael Jones isn't outright anti-semite

1146
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,607
Alex Jones may or may not have actual feelings

1147
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,375
Songs about Jewish people

1148
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,423
Structurally built on

1149
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:20,543
That is why these two can have this sort of a conversation where they see eye-to-eye

1150
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,591
So long as things don't get to blonde

1151
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:27,711
So long as he Michael doesn't bring out his rhetoric about synagogue shooting victims deserving it

1152
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:31,039
Alex can hear everything you saying is being about the globalist

1153
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,599
Because you can do that he can allow his audience

1154
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,623
Things to do the same

1155
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,647
Weather in

1156
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,415
Intentional or not

1157
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,695
Alex's feeding izadi

1158
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:42,303
This man and no matter what the reality of the situation is Alex's responsibility

1159
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,327
Not to do that

1160
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,399
Situations like this are 14 Alex's the greatest

1161
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
Responsibility

1162
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,727
Because these are the situations with the most damage

1163
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:50,495
Is possible to

1164
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,263
Who is audience

1165
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,287
And Alex is failing

1166
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:57,151
Listen to me this is like a situation where you know it like

1167
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:03,807
Somebody who's older who can't hear as well wants to watch Downton Abbey but they can understand them so that I we got to watch subtitles whenever

1168
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,575
Watch this.

1169
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,159
Like on the broadcast of this

1170
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,207
These guys need subtitles

1171
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,743
To explain what their actual

1172
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:16,095
Well I'll look into

1173
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:18,143
I mean you have to assume someone dead

1174
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,167
Right I mean

1175
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,703
You can't you can't assume

1176
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:24,031
Just did this interview blind no one at Infowars Google

1177
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:24,799
No one

1178
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
Anyting

1179
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,103
But you can't

1180
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,895
I don't understand

1181
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,735
This facade

1182
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,039
Is so difficult for me

1183
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,319
Hold up

1184
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,903
What does the right way to put it

1185
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:43,231
That the sort of excuse of like I stupid

1186
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:46,047
Yeah yeah really really tough

1187
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,095
For me to look at an interview like this

1188
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,119
And think

1189
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,655
Anything other than

1190
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:51,679
He knows exactly

1191
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,983
I just don't

1192
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:54,751
I'm starting

1193
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,519
Catalina Direct

1194
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,287
Can pretty heavily

1195
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:00,383
Well it's like that

1196
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,687
It's likely the fuc

1197
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,223
Climate dude that I talk to

1198
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:04,991
About where it's like

1199
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:08,831
You know who he is if you book them on your show you know what your

1200
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,367
That's what you're doing

1201
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,647
Well

1202
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,951
Badoo and anti-semitism

1203
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,975
How long but

1204
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:15,743
If you

1205
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,767
Google him

1206
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,559
And and I don't care

1207
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,327
If you

1208
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,167
I don't care if you've never heard of the guy and you Google him before he

1209
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,703
He steps onto the f******

1210
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,471
Stage

1211
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:32,639
Google help me put the difference between that example and Alex is that like you're talking about Mark

1212
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,663
Moreno being booked

1213
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,711
On like Fox News where there's

1214
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,783
Competent staff

1215
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:41,087
The guy who makes me videos hitting stuff with hammer

1216
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:48,511
I could you know he's right away he runs the show is so unprofessional and shity that you could be led to believe

1217
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:54,143
He doesn't give a s*** right but it like I don't believe that anymore

1218
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:58,239
It will probably only to see what kind of social media Rishi have

1219
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,007
Exactly

1220
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:03,615
And if you were just doing that about you Michael Jones you my black guy is a lot of fun

1221
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
Alright

1222
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,431
I don't know but that illusion is falling away

1223
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,735
So in its neck

1224
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,551
Flip going to use talking about the ATL send

1225
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,831
Sending people to jail

1226
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:16,159
I think this is his rationalization for it I'll say

1227
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,975
You can't have this type of

1228
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:25,375
Basically tyrannical rule over the internet and then say well we're a private

1229
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:30,239
Organization even though you basically have the force of law you can overturn laws

1230
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:33,311
That's we we've entered a new era of History

1231
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:37,151
We're basically the oligarchs can if they want to overturn your law

1232
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:43,295
They bring in that the shock troops might mainly groups like The homosexual activists

1233
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:49,695
The overturn the law in the state of Indiana they're doing the same thing in Ireland that they're doing the same thing as Silicon Valley

1234
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:56,607
No news to you but I mean we're in a war and these are one of the people who have for them

1235
00:53:56,863 --> 00:54:00,703
Directors of the of that Warfare against the people of the United States of America

1236
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,311
And now the internet's gone for being millions of diverse side

1237
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:10,431
6 having 96% control we're now in a panopticon prison

1238
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:13,247
The leftist Wardens

1239
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:18,623
In all our personal messages all our data we've invested all our promotion into their platform

1240
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,743
If you platforms they don't control

1241
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:26,047
This is a very dangerous combination of evil

1242
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,399
Yeah and that's why we have to stand up to it right now

1243
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:36,287
So that clip is really important because I think it really illustrates first of all how on the same page

1244
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:39,871
In this interview there in agreement

1245
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:42,175
But if you understand

1246
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,455
What they're saying

1247
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,503
They're not they're not supposed to

1248
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,623
Are not supposed to be in agreement because

1249
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,927
Michael Jones believes

1250
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,951
It's the Jews

1251
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,975
Alex

1252
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,535
Says that's not what he believed

1253
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:01,375
Right who are definitely not the Jews cuz I'm not against the Jews

1254
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,399
One of the things

1255
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,959
Incredibly clear about this

1256
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:06,751
How they're the same

1257
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:11,615
The ideologies something we've talked about

1258
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,383
Light on in the

1259
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,151
The past

1260
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,687
And I think it's on Stark

1261
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,455
Display

1262
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,223
In this interview

1263
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,271
That's something that really troubles me

1264
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:23,135
Yeah I'm really trouble to find out that we're entering a new era where oligarch

1265
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,183
Sharks can overturn laws that they don't like that

1266
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:26,975
Terrible thing

1267
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,023
That's the other thing

1268
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:32,351
A lot of times when you're dealing with people like this

1269
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,655
One of the strategies

1270
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:38,751
That uses making valid criticisms and then perverting what the point

1271
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:43,871
He was with his oligarchs

1272
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,919
Controlling things in overturning the laws

1273
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,687
But he doesn't

1274
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:49,247
But he's not fine with

1275
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,039
People

1276
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:55,135
So in that last clip Jones talked about Ireland

1277
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,415
And

1278
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,463
That if you talk a little bit more about

1279
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:01,535
About this and maybe one of the closest

1280
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,559
Things too funny

1281
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,863
What episode is Alex keeps trying to butt in

1282
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:05,887
EduCare

1283
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,423
And

1284
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,959
Also this

1285
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,495
With Alex new

1286
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,543
Hey i e Michael Jones believe

1287
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,567
This would have been a time

1288
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,591
2

1289
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,271
This is not going to go well

1290
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,879
I'm interested in article on Ireland

1291
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,159
Ireland

1292
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,439
What's Concord

1293
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:36,095
It was conquered by a combination of of multinational firms tax-exempt foundations and big

1294
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,887
Paycheck like Google and Facebook

1295
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:44,031
Didn't need an army they just come in there they got a beachhead because of low taxes they invited all these firms in

1296
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:49,407
And then suddenly tired that firms are telling him you have to overturn the constitution of Ireland

1297
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:55,807
The first thing they did with the family then they gave him homosexual marriage and then the last referendum was

1298
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,087
That one abortion

1299
00:56:57,343 --> 00:57:00,671
All those rights were just taken out of the Irish Constitution

1300
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:03,999
Now it's late grown man

1301
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:10,143
Coronavirus Ireland

1302
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:16,031
Play freedom of speech that's in the Irish Constitution this is the way war is waged in our day

1303
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,335
Exactly

1304
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:24,991
This is how Wars wage and the new Sacrament is full grown man with our children it's really needed to get that in

1305
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:26,783
Really had to get that one in 802

1306
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:32,159
I really need you to reconnect your lies that into

1307
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:35,999
Michael if you heard my Rifts about to drag queen story time

1308
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,047
Cuz I really like to do one right now

1309
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:44,959
Find the article that Michael is talking about here but I did find an interview did recently about Ireland with a noted

1310
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,263
Far-right provocateur name to Rowan cross

1311
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,311
It's fresh and

1312
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:54,175
To be circling around the idea that Jews are sending immigrants to Western countries to attack logos

1313
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,199
He's got a

1314
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:55,967
He's got a focus

1315
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:58,271
Yeah the things that he Michael is talking

1316
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:02,879
Think about happening in Ireland or very specifically things that he has blamed the Jews for in the past

1317
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:08,767
For instance as it relates to homosexuality he said that the Jews are responsible for promoting marriage equality in

1318
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
The United States

1319
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,303
Many times

1320
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,887
Event says that Ireland has passed laws providing access to abortion

1321
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,959
In a video posted to YouTube John said of the United States

1322
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:19,519
Quote if it weren't for Jews we would not have abortion

1323
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:25,919
Examples using what he thinks are evils that are befallen Ireland were curiously exactly the same things

1324
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,943
He blames the Jews

1325
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,735
We're having promoted in the United States

1326
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:33,087
It's painfully obvious what he saying here is that the Jews of taking over Ireland

1327
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,623
Alex's letting him

1328
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,903
Because Alex

1329
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:39,743
To pass that off as he Michael just saying that the globalists are taking over Ireland

1330
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,023
You can agree with that

1331
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:43,071
You Michael Jones is Not

1332
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:43,839
Saying that

1333
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,863
You saying that

1334
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:51,007
Because I went to the lamb this and agreed with it it has the risk of mainstreaming eat Michael s*** to a large portion

1335
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:51,775
One of his audience

1336
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,591
Also the Irish Constitution doesn't guarantee

1337
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,175
Until last year it was illegal to publish

1338
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:58,943
Blasphemous

1339
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:02,271
It's still an offense to publish content that's deemed to be

1340
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,295
Seditious rndc

1341
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,111
They have a group called The censorship of publication

1342
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,415
Board that reviews content refer to them as objection

1343
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,463
They were film centers office

1344
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:13,023
Ireland is a really bad history Bad Country

1345
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:15,583
Free to choose if you want to talk about Free Speech being eroded

1346
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:20,191
They've a very long history of being a country that's pretty into censoring things

1347
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:22,239
If you want to learn more about that look into the

1348
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,263
The troubles

1349
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,311
No no they were fine

1350
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,127
That's not a great example

1351
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,151
It's really

1352
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:29,919
Stark

1353
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,199
The way that he's using

1354
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,479
Exact same examples

1355
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,503
But he talks about in the

1356
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,271
United States

1357
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,039
Is being things

1358
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,063
The Jews have done

1359
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,879
And you can see the way they like he bakes

1360
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:42,207
Palatable by saying multinational corporations

1361
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,743
Special interest

1362
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,511
Groups

1363
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:47,583
Where you do that is that the language of Infowars

1364
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,375
I just I

1365
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,447
It should be against the law for them to be like

1366
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:54,495
See they're taking rights away

1367
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,031
When there

1368
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,055
Giving a

1369
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:57,823
Access to abortion

1370
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:04,479
Like when they're giving access to equal rights for marriage equality

1371
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,247
Breakthrough

1372
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,575
Take on that is

1373
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:12,671
Is that they're taking a right to murder those people

1374
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,439
Catholic

1375
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
Yeah

1376
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:18,047
Extremist Catholics to live in a country where there is no

1377
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,095
Acceptance yeah there is no abortion

1378
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,911
And I would say that so miniscule

1379
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,239
But

1380
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,007
Alex

1381
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:27,775
Is

1382
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,847
Adeline Adeline

1383
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:34,687
But when the ATL says they're going to destroy you if you don't submit we bend over

1384
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,991
Well I'm done bending overlays gentleman

1385
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,015
Stay out of this

1386
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:41,343
Unify American

1387
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:45,951
Around freedom and Justice Autocare old Ian black white Jewish whatever

1388
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,047
You like the pre-market

1389
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,095
You're great

1390
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,655
Hopefully you don't wanna kill babies

1391
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,679
But

1392
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:58,239
Our Guest

1393
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,543
Was it University academic

1394
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,567
Tell me a faster

1395
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,383
And he got removed at a Catholic University

1396
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:07,455
Because he was pro-life that was decades ago

1397
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:10,271
That's where this reign of tyranny is

1398
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,831
That's where it is

1399
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:19,743
We need to get upset at motivated but Americans are so used to

1400
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:23,071
Anyways

1401
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,887
Bennett so don't say homosexual

1402
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:30,751
What's a scientific name for your feelings I won't do that

1403
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:38,175
Play mother father don't stay there two genders don't say America should exist don't say illegal alien do what we say to what we say

1404
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,271
Point out the shop cribs

1405
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,463
The Last Frontier give us control your children

1406
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,999
Public schools in Texas day

1407
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,815
Men dressed as women come

1408
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,631
Silver labs

1409
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,655
We're going to have

1410
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,447
Time alone with your kids without you knowing

1411
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,751
Same group

1412
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,799
Chain groups taking over the Boy Scouts

1413
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,591
It's a pedophile ring

1414
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,383
Very important point

1415
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,663
Michael Jones didn't

1416
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,431
Say the shocks

1417
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,455
For the pedo Lobby

1418
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,271
Specifically said the shock troops were homosexual

1419
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:19,135
Yep Alex is rewriting comments Jones made earlier the show to make Jones's comments more closely

1420
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,159
Wii Fit his worldview

1421
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:22,463
He's not trying to find areas of disagreement

1422
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,487
The distance himself

1423
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,023
John's are clarify things

1424
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:27,327
He's seeking to make him more compatible

1425
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,119
With the rhetoric that Alex

1426
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,143
Put that on the Shelf

1427
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,423
Which is terrifying

1428
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:36,031
Also when he says it's the same group that took over the Catholic Church

1429
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:40,383
Be aware of what you Michael Jones

1430
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:42,943
Think about that

1431
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,223
Fun bingo

1432
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,247
Man

1433
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:51,391
It lives a very simple life I suppose that's pretty predictable when you want to guess

1434
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:54,719
Convenient to me in any way guess who did it

1435
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,743
Yep

1436
01:02:56,255 --> 01:03:02,399
Alex also largely in the eclipse Peak inflating the ATL with literally every problem he has with modern

1437
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,167
Culture

1438
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:08,031
I don't think that the ebl has anything to do with people telling him that is language surrounding gender is

1439
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,871
No one is saying that he can't use the words mother and father

1440
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:14,943
Like he's talking about a nightclub but the imaginary people chastise

1441
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,479
Infer that have nothing

1442
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,271
Things to do with the ATL

1443
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,063
Successfully change the name of Thanksgiving

1444
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,343
Whatever it is

1445
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,903
If Alex wants to make some good faith

1446
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:26,207
Complaints about the ATL he's absolutely Within

1447
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:28,511
Is right to do so but that's not what he's doing

1448
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:34,143
He specifically talking about the ADL as being part of a and maybe one of the most important

1449
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,167
Parts of the large

1450
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,703
Scale worldwide globalist

1451
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:42,079
He's not speaking in his any specifics but he's using just enough concrete terms that if

1452
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,103
Point does get across

1453
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,151
He's tired of bending over today

1454
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,455
They're trying to get control of language

1455
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,479
I'm not there going to

1456
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,247
Corrupt your kids

1457
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,015
Is in the schools

1458
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:52,319
This is very much protocols s***

1459
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,879
U4 protocol number one

1460
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:57,695
Quotes that are used as ground stupid on classicism

1461
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,487
Formerly immorality

1462
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:02,815
Into which it has been inducted by our special

1463
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,351
By tutors Lackey

1464
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,119
Governesses

1465
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,143
The houses of the wealthy

1466
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,167
Bikeworks another's

1467
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,215
Or we could go to protocol number 9

1468
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:15,103
We're fools been used in corrupted the Youth of the goyim by rearing them with principles and theories which are known

1469
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,127
Westerby false

1470
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,663
Although it is by us

1471
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,943
That they have been inculcated

1472
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:24,575
Quote Maria educating youth the new traditional religion

1473
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,343
Then afterwards

1474
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,415
Consider how often Alex talks about the

1475
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,463
Like the state being a new religion

1476
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:31,743
Talk to your kids

1477
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:32,511
By the globalist

1478
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:35,327
This is the conversation to absolutely

1479
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,095
We cannot have

1480
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,375
What he's trying to

1481
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,143
To have about

1482
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:41,727
We're tired of bending over to the ATL you cannot have that conversation

1483
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:44,031
In good faith when your guest is e Michael Jones

1484
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:47,359
I've absolutely zero patience for this low-rent normalizing

1485
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,639
Vicious anti-semite

1486
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,175
And I have even less patience

1487
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,199
Alex Jones right now

1488
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:52,991
If he doesn't know what he's doing

1489
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,783
Use the most oblivious person in the world

1490
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,575
And some of that oblivious

1491
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,343
Having an audience

1492
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,623
Is a risky thing

1493
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:01,439
Also e Michael Jones claims that he was fired

1494
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,463
St Mary's College

1495
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,767
Bookscool first positions on abortion

1496
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,815
You said that I don't believe him

1497
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:09,887
This is a Catholic School in the late seventies early eighties

1498
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,167
That's going to be a pretty

1499
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,191
Conservative place

1500
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:12,959
Politically

1501
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:15,263
Or could be his stance on abortion is I

1502
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,799
Should Outlaw abortion

1503
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,591
They were like great that's wonderful

1504
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,383
And if somebody gets an abortion I think we should

1505
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,687
Did you tell him they were like back off

1506
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,223
YogaSource away could pass

1507
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:24,991
Possibly

1508
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:27,807
I'm so Alex's discusses how the Warriors here

1509
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:28,831
And

1510
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,159
Nothing good

1511
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:34,719
Michael Jones you were explaining were in a war

1512
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,023
Dewar's here

1513
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:40,095
And now it's the hate speech laws

1514
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:42,911
By the ATL on American soil

1515
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,959
We're going to arrest anybody

1516
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:48,031
That doesn't do what we say and if you point out

1517
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:52,383
These groups are staging hate crimes against themselves we're going to arrest you for that too

1518
01:05:56,735 --> 01:06:01,343
So what Alex is talking about is more of his preemptive false flagging themselves

1519
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,367
Rhetoric

1520
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:05,183
I just think it's real bad

1521
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,463
This is real terrible

1522
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:11,071
I'm super easy trying to ask you Michael about like there's a war here

1523
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,351
And in this clip

1524
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,887
This next clip is where everything

1525
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,703
Up to this point it's been

1526
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:19,007
Complaints about other things

1527
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,543
Being presented as

1528
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,823
Complaints about the Ada

1529
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:22,591
Yeah yeah

1530
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:24,127
Very inaccurate

1531
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:24,895
And

1532
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,711
Coded complaints

1533
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:31,551
It's about their they don't like your speech they're going to arrest you kinds of things

1534
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:35,647
Make it clear that your problem isn't with the abl It's a larger

1535
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:38,975
Thing that you're focusing on because you've made a boogeyman

1536
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:39,743
And out of

1537
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:43,583
So far we've been listening to too old assholes complain racist

1538
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,655
I mean it's between continues to be that

1539
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,703
But this is this next clip is

1540
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,239
Where things

1541
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,775
Go off into

1542
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,055
A very crazy

1543
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:54,847
Directions

1544
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:57,151
And it mostly has to do with

1545
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:03,551
Yeah I mean you're right it is a war and end in order to understand that you have to take it back to

1546
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,599
The end of the second World War

1547
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,159
Germany is a conquered country

1548
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:14,047
We have complete United States has complete control over whatever goes on there

1549
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:19,423
And the first plan is basically the morgenthau plan they're going to starve the Germans to death

1550
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:26,335
Is that point the the the adults in the room realize what we need Germany against

1551
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,871
The Communist okay

1552
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,175
So they introduced the Marshall Plan

1553
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:32,223
And this is the beginning of

1554
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:33,759
Social engineering

1555
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:39,135
Or this is Warfare this is psychological warfare we call it social engineering

1556
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:43,231
We are going to take complete control over the flow of information in Germany

1557
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:49,887
This means that any book any newspaper any play any TV show any movie

1558
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,423
He has to get a license

1559
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:55,775
It gets a license from a man by the name of David Marta Kylie V

1560
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,847
Who was a Jewish psychiatrist from New York City

1561
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:04,479
He hands out the licenses and therefore they determine the flow of information

1562
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:06,783
At the same time this is happening

1563
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,575
Germany is now flooded

1564
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,111
With pornography

1565
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:15,487
Flooded with material as soon as the valence reform took place as soon as I got the currency reform

1566
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:22,143
The pornography claims in tons would come in from Austria and the place is flooded with pornography

1567
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:27,007
I might have just been a natural thing after Hitler

1568
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:30,079
You're never going to win against pornography

1569
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,871
You're just never going to win

1570
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,455
Kind of don't really know what he's talking

1571
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,991
Think about but I suspected what

1572
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:40,063
Like the basis of this I think he's referring to the practice

1573
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,343
During war

1574
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:44,671
Other people are engaged in of dropping pornographic materials in

1575
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,207
An attempt to demoralize the end

1576
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,023
I think that's what he's talking about the only thing that makes

1577
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:55,679
The Axis powers dropped nudie pics conveying the message that f****** was way cooler than fighting against the Axis powers

1578
01:08:55,935 --> 01:09:00,031
U.s. tried to pretend that they didn't also engage in these sorts of psychological tactic

1579
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:00,799
Text but they almost

1580
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:04,383
I think largely with my e Michael Jones

1581
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:06,943
Complaining about here with the deer license

1582
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:07,711
Sentence for

1583
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:10,271
Stuff going around I think he's talking about D Natsu

1584
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:12,575
Application

1585
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,367
Propaganda about Jews

1586
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,647
Introducing pornography and

1587
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,671
The world as an attack on

1588
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,439
Some type of church

1589
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:21,791
Because that is a position that he had stopped with

1590
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:25,119
The problem happened around the end of WWII and then finished

1591
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,143
Because Germany

1592
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,679
Urban League

1593
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:32,543
The theory that Jews are behind the propagation of pornography is super popular among

1594
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,847
Close to Neo-Nazi areas of online

1595
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:35,615
Right wing

1596
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:38,175
They believe the pornography itself is a Jewish

1597
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:40,735
Conspiracy meant to made white matter make white men lesson

1598
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,503
Interested in

1599
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:44,063
Basically is a long game towards white genocide

1600
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:47,391
3 strangely commonly held belief in those corners

1601
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,695
Is the internet but basically it's just repackaged Nazi

1602
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,767
Hitler believed the Jews responsible for prostate

1603
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:57,631
The tution which is preventing Aryan race sorry perverting the Aryan race

1604
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,399
And spreading

1605
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,215
You talked about it a little bit in mine,

1606
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:06,335
World Devastation which this depravity brings with it are sufficient

1607
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,103
Destroy people

1608
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,127
Slowly but surely

1609
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:14,015
The Judy ization of our spiritual life and monetization of our meeting and Paul sooner or later be fouls are

1610
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:14,783
Tired

1611
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,343
So I mean it's all just

1612
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,135
Country package

1613
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:25,791
Fine

1614
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:28,863
So in the seventies e Michael Jones was in Germany

1615
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:32,191
Teaching Ono and he has some ideas about

1616
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,007
The evils of sex

1617
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:35,775
To liberate

1618
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:38,335
I'm guessing he got kicked out because of his quote

1619
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:40,895
Super views on pro-life yeah

1620
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,711
And over this. Of time you have a battle

1621
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:46,015
For the mind of the German people

1622
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,807
Being seduced

1623
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,599
Bisexual liberation

1624
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:52,927
It gets more and more intense over this. Of time

1625
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:56,255
Until you reach the 70s when it states the movie

1626
01:10:56,511 --> 01:11:02,399
This is when I was in Germany I was a perfect I was a teacher at a give nauseam in Germany and the girls

1627
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:08,799
They're coming into class here are holding the magazine called Bravo which is for

1628
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,615
There's an advice column

1629
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:16,991
Buy the man a man by the name of doctor Somer whose real name is Martin Weinstein

1630
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:19,295
And he's teaching the girls how to masturbate

1631
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,319
I don't really

1632
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:22,111
Scared to hunt down the Steve magazine

1633
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:24,927
From the 70s in Germany the Joneses talking about here

1634
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:25,695
I don't really trust

1635
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:30,559
The only only kept that clip into illustrate how compatible

1636
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:32,095
Alex Annie Michaels world

1637
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:35,935
I would spend a lot of time yelling about how Jocelyn Elders was trying to

1638
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,471
Teach kids how to masturbate with

1639
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,007
Depart of the globalist plot

1640
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:43,871
And here you have a guy who Alex's refusing to realizes a gigantic anti-semite talkin about

1641
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,431
I call him this teaching German uceta masturbated

1642
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:51,295
The corrupting I want specifically pointing out as a Jewish surname

1643
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,367
Michael Jones is a funhouse mirror of Alex Jones

1644
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,647
Except none of this is fun

1645
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,183
So

1646
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,231
At this point Alex invites

1647
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,279
Michael Jones back on the show

1648
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,559
And

1649
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:09,215
And I'll have you back again soon because you're right on.

1650
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:11,263
Or liberals like joke about this

1651
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:14,847
We're not scared of women and we're not scared of sex

1652
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:19,967
The point is this is a real psychological warfare plant George Orwell wrote about it 1984

1653
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:23,295
Because he saw the plan as a top propagandist in

1654
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:24,575
OSS

1655
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:27,647
And an MI6 and then I was later Declassified

1656
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:28,671
Declassified

1657
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,743
Breakdown Society

1658
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,279
In the family

1659
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,839
And that's what he wrote about a 1984 so

1660
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:37,887
It's early sexualisation

1661
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:41,983
And all this is about people not developing the higher centers of their brain

1662
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,031
Been having dreams it's about

1663
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:47,615
Destroying them while they're young destroying their innocence

1664
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,919
So I don't have time to flower to fully develop

1665
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:52,223
That's why they're now targeting in the US

1666
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:55,039
We're going to teach your children to masturbate

1667
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:58,367
Nh5 sexualisation of children pedophilia

1668
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:01,951
And you're not going to stop at so it's again a psychological warfare plan

1669
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,975
Developed

1670
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:07,327
Alex Trails off weirdly there at the end

1671
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,607
Developed

1672
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,911
Why didn't you say you develop the plan

1673
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:17,823
Is it possible that he knows who e Michael Jones thinks develop the plan he doesn't want to get into an argument about globalist versus Jew

1674
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:20,383
Because I think that's a possibility it's definitely there

1675
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,687
Don't think about 1984

1676
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:23,711
First of all

1677
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,991
It's not real it's a book

1678
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:25,759
Don't

1679
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,039
Inasmuch as it could be

1680
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:27,807
He said that it's

1681
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,599
Ballistic Orwell himself

1682
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,647
Explain that the book is based on his imagination

1683
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:34,463
Cannabis stalling like government based in totalitarianism

1684
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,023
Speaking place in a western country instead of Russia

1685
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:39,071
It wasn't that He Came Upon a secret

1686
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,631
Globalist plan and he decided to get the warning out

1687
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,911
To the masses through the book

1688
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,703
I know that Alex likes to play that

1689
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:45,983
Make references to

1690
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,519
The fact that Orwell died just a

1691
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,799
The book was released

1692
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:51,103
But that's because you've been dying from tuberculosis

1693
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:51,871
For years that that

1694
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,151
Subculture

1695
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,175
TV wasn't

1696
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,735
Oh you'll be over it sure

1697
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,759
You'll just be over it soon

1698
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,807
1947 Orville road

1699
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:03,135
Piece called why I write which describes some of his formative experiences

1700
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,415
Dabbling in writing

1701
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,951
Stent in the Indian Imperial

1702
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:07,231
Becoming impoverish

1703
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,279
And coming to a greater understanding

1704
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,303
King of the working classes

1705
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,863
Use understand decided on a lot of issues

1706
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,655
At least until 1930s

1707
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:15,935
Quote

1708
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:21,567
The Spanish war and other events in 19 3637 turn the scale and thereafter I knew where I stood

1709
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,871
Every line of serious work that I have written to

1710
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:28,479
Since 1936 has been written directly or indirectly against totalitarianism

1711
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:30,271
And for Democratic socialism

1712
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,295
As I understand it

1713
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:34,367
It seems to be nonsense in a. Like around 2

1714
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,903
I think that one can avoid writing

1715
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:36,927
Search subject

1716
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:43,327
Alex believe George Orwell was reviewing some secret plan of the globalist because because

1717
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:47,167
The text of 1984 the dystopian imagining of a totalitarian

1718
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:47,935
In Britain

1719
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:50,751
It is Imagine government is very similar to the

1720
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:51,775
The paranoid ravings

1721
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:53,567
Alex's intellectual predecessor

1722
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:59,711
The anti-communist Cold War weirdos like anybody in the John Birch Society or W Cleon skousen

1723
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:02,015
Alex is unable to engage with a 1980

1724
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:03,039
Before because he thinks

1725
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,063
It's real

1726
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,903
He's unable to detach it from the anti-communist propaganda that he was raised

1727
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:13,279
So to him it reads like just another book from the John Birch Society talking about what the globalist have

1728
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,327
Also

1729
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:17,887
As I recall pornography didn't play that big of a rolling

1730
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,423
In 84 and the proles were

1731
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,471
We're totally allowed to have it and f*** all they wanted

1732
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,007
Only control stuff was just

1733
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:23,775
For the party

1734
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:29,407
Yeah I was going to say like I'm trying to go through all the possible dystopic

1735
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:35,807
I'm like Huxley they were they were all about sex but then you have like the

1736
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:36,831
Liver and it's like

1737
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:40,415
You're not allowed to have sex and all that stuff is rigidly controlled

1738
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,951
You're going to get a dystopia

1739
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:45,023
It doesn't matter what flavor f****** you're dealing with

1740
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:48,351
Apron you or when the state has

1741
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,119
Control over

1742
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,655
That we wind up getting f***** over

1743
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,703
Then yeah.

1744
01:15:53,983 --> 01:16:00,127
Yeah it's not like owed its moral to have pornography or not have pornography

1745
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,407
State to control

1746
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,199
The larger point

1747
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:05,247
To about what Alex was saying there

1748
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:08,063
They're better take your right on about this civilization

1749
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,111
Is

1750
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,647
Betty Michael Jones

1751
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:12,927
A hundred percent

1752
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:13,695
I believes it's the

1753
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:14,975
Doing that

1754
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:19,839
That are responsible for the sexualization of culture in order to corrupt the minds of

1755
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:20,863
Everyone

1756
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:23,935
So when Alex says you're right on about this

1757
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:27,007
He's tacitly or not even test

1758
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,799
He's explicitly supporting

1759
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,079
Something that

1760
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,639
Be maybe shouldn't

1761
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:38,015
I find it incredibly difficult to imagine that

1762
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:38,783
He just doesn't

1763
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,063
This is to

1764
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,111
Ridiculous I mean it's it's

1765
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,463
It's either him signaling hey

1766
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:49,535
This was always compatible

1767
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,559
From the very beginning

1768
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,839
Or him signal

1769
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,631
I don't care anymore

1770
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:56,703
And so I am willing to go as far as not

1771
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:00,031
Yeah it's hard to say if it's

1772
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:03,103
If it's any of these guys it doesn't matter how hard

1773
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:04,895
Core they are I am willing to

1774
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,663
To Chase

1775
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:06,943
Survival over

1776
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:07,711
Anything else

1777
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,503
And it's going to wind up killing

1778
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,319
I don't know

1779
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,343
Make predictions

1780
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,951
Alex asks Michael Jones with the end

1781
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,279
Oh yeah

1782
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,839
Probably similar but different answers

1783
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:29,727
And it'll take anything over to understand it

1784
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:31,263
How do we counter

1785
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:37,663
What does pedophile called is doing because the ATL is also come out and said drag queen story time is a month if you don't

1786
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:41,247
Big fat men dressed like clowns have accessed your children unannounced

1787
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:43,295
Bags under the eyes crow's feet

1788
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,087
The cut off by the brake there

1789
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:46,111
Unfinished thought

1790
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:48,415
But you also see this tendency that he has any

1791
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:50,207
Keeps trying to bring back

1792
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:52,511
The is drag queen Story Time narrative

1793
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,047
Cuz I think it feels safe

1794
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:57,631
I think that he recognizes on some level that like

1795
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,935
I need this ball to be in my court

1796
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,215
And if I don't

1797
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:01,983
Somehow

1798
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,031
Control where this is going and could get out of

1799
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:04,799
I am really quickly

1800
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,591
You and I can both it

1801
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:09,151
Twistedly agree pedophilia is bad

1802
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:11,967
To explicitly talk

1803
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:13,247
About pedophilia

1804
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:17,855
But if you start going on today to Howell homosexual Czar destroying everybody

1805
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:18,879
I'm not there yet

1806
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:21,695
At Banner if you go on to say how the Jews are controlling everything

1807
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:25,279
I'm not allowed to do that will get there very quick no matter what topic

1808
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,815
You talk about this guy

1809
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,351
Unless

1810
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:33,727
Yeah I'm waiting for him to just answer everything with yeah you know all Jews are pedophiles and you like talking

1811
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,495
Great

1812
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,799
So in this next clip is its

1813
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,079
The closest that

1814
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,615
Really fine

1815
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,663
Of Michael

1816
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,735
Episode of proving that pornography

1817
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,503
She is a weapon

1818
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,063
Is a lot there's a lot of fun are

1819
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:48,831
If you talk

1820
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:50,879
What's at the bottom of the

1821
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:53,183
That whole where is all this going

1822
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,975
Dr. Jones

1823
01:18:56,767 --> 01:19:02,911
Yeah you're right it's a weapon pornography is a weapon and this became clear when the Israelis invaded remodel

1824
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,703
2002

1825
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:06,239
They coming to town

1826
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:10,591
Are they take over the TV stations and they start broadcasting pornography

1827
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:13,663
Don't wait a minute I thought pornography was freedom

1828
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:18,783
I thought it meant Freedom so does this mean the Israelis want to bring freedom to the Palestinians

1829
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:21,087
No this proves that it's a weapon

1830
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:21,855
Okay

1831
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:28,255
Is subjugation people is supposed to keep rail them and supposed to be range them and it's also supposed to be

1832
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:32,863
Block any type of rational response to what's going on

1833
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:33,887
A couple things

1834
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:35,423
Things here first it's amazing

1835
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,471
Me how Alex is just letting you Michael Jones

1836
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:43,359
Just keep on barreling through with every single example he says about anything negative surrounding all of issues they're discussing

1837
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,639
Coming back to the Jews

1838
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:47,967
Every example of individuals he's brought up our arduous

1839
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:54,111
And now the proof he's giving of the claim that pornography is a weapon is Israel airing foreign when they took over Ramallah

1840
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,647
Alex legitimately

1841
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:57,695
Has to be the most oblivious person in the world

1842
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,487
Or else he knows he's talked to a jacket

1843
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,511
Anti-semite

1844
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:04,607
Yeah it's really pouring broadcast

1845
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,631
Sing 2002

1846
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,167
I'm obviously opposed

1847
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:10,239
But I think my reasoning is a little different from John

1848
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,799
Are the relevant reasons the broadcasting

1849
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:15,360
Born is bad but p*** itself is not

1850
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:16,896
1

1851
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:23,296
Israeli specifically did this because it was offensive to the residence of the Westbank I believe that motivation is important

1852
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,064
Factor in this equation

1853
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:24,832
Here's what I mean

1854
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:27,392
I don't think pornography is intrinsically bad

1855
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:32,000
But I do think it would be an immoral act to hijack Jim Baker's compounds cable network

1856
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:33,024
And Airport ography

1857
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,560
Before all the Sunnyside residue

1858
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:39,680
One part of it is because you have a reasonable cultural assumption that what you're doing with

1859
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,448
Appreciate

1860
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:44,032
But the other part is that it's never appropriate

1861
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,568
Force pornography on somebody

1862
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,384
What does break the pornography itself bad it make

1863
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:51,200
Hijacking stations that would otherwise be

1864
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:53,248
Be playing familysafe programming

1865
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,528
The airport ography Raw

1866
01:20:55,296 --> 01:21:01,440
I'm not an expert on this matter and tarred to trace down concrete facts on the subject so I'm going to leave some of the questions here alone

1867
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:03,232
About that specific yeah

1868
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:05,792
Mostly because they're not really relevant to the matter at hand

1869
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,328
This incident is now

1870
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:11,424
Not proof that pornography is a weapon it's proof that could be used in ways that are meant to

1871
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,448
To cause discomfort in

1872
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,216
Disturbance

1873
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:14,752
This is not the same thing

1874
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:15,776
For instance

1875
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:19,360
Heavy metal music has been used as a tool of torture I was about to just

1876
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:23,968
Bring that up that does not make heavy metal music torture intrinsically

1877
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,760
The way that it's being used

1878
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:30,112
That is the problem and I don't believe that this guy isn't smart enough to understand

1879
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:31,904
Did willfully obtuse

1880
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:33,440
That's all

1881
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,720
Yeah

1882
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,256
This is wild

1883
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,024
Right

1884
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,328
I just

1885
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,888
Because it's so

1886
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,168
Insane

1887
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,752
It's so unhinged and and disconnected from

1888
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,032
Any and all reality

1889
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:50,592
Like when you're this singularly focused on

1890
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,896
All Jews are evil

1891
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,688
Then you bye-bye

1892
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,224
Very nature just

1893
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,504
Exist in your own world

1894
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,528
You exist

1895
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,088
Completely separate from the rest of humanity

1896
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:02,880
888

1897
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:03,904
8 Ball

1898
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,696
It's a bunker

1899
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,464
Pretty bad

1900
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,768
It's told you

1901
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:10,304
I don't want to do this

1902
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,328
I hate him

1903
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,120
I really don't like him

1904
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:16,448
So they talk some more about this for no issue

1905
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:17,728
Why not

1906
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,520
And

1907
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:20,544
Michael Johnston

1908
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,592
It's talking about no nut November

1909
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:23,872
Of course he does

1910
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:24,896
Webcourses

1911
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:27,712
Of course

1912
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:29,504
Because because

1913
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,528
So he's

1914
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,600
Framing this as a boycott of pornography

1915
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,880
Amman

1916
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:39,488
He says that people got mad about that boycott there's an article in Rolling Stone

1917
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,768
Solo Double J

1918
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:43,840
Pornography ruined excited to work against it

1919
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,680
Ruin sexuality ruins the real thing

1920
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,216
Absolutely

1921
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:52,032
Absolutely so they said what we're going to take back

1922
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:55,872
We're going to take back our own minds we're going to take back our own bodies

1923
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:59,968
Going to take control of Our Lives rational Morrow Control of Our Lives

1924
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:02,016
Bendy organizes boycott

1925
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,296
Well guess what

1926
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,600
The pornographers are upset

1927
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:12,000
The people who instituted this regime or upset and there was an actually an article in rolling

1928
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:12,768
Stone

1929
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:17,376
In which the author says that these people

1930
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,912
Are anti-semites

1931
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:23,776
If you don't masturbate if you boycott pornography you're an anti-semite

1932
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,568
I didn't make this up

1933
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:28,640
Okay

1934
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:30,432
So what you're saying here

1935
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:32,224
In general is

1936
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:36,832
Oregon Ducks losing control of the narrative

1937
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:42,464
What are the most powerful subjugating narratives of our time was pornography

1938
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:47,584
It made an entire generation docile to the commands of their rulers

1939
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:53,984
And now people are waking up to understand that sexual Liberation is a form of control and they don't like

1940
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:58,848
End up breaking up their own change and escaping from the jail

1941
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:01,152
That's the culture has created for them

1942
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:08,576
It's beautiful because people realize that they're getting outside together getting away from their phones and they're realizing all of this

1943
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,624
It's meant to give you fake

1944
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,952
Satisfactions you don't go out informal relationships

1945
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,512
A real relationship

1946
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:21,120
Just imagine Alex f****** gardening

1947
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:27,520
Wow so that article in Rolling Stone is not about calling anyone who decides to not for taking foreign or specifically.

1948
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,800
Does no nut November

1949
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,640
Anti-semite make it up

1950
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:36,224
That is exactly the sort of straw man version of the story

1951
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,808
Spectre raging anti-semite who believe the pornography the secret dude

1952
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,624
That's the strawman they would create out of the story.

1953
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,648
To attack

1954
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:47,488
To be clear the article literally says quote of course it goes without saying

1955
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:53,120
But not everyone who participates in no nut November or no fap is a white supremacist or religious Fundamentalist

1956
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:55,424
Thanks man

1957
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,240
This article is basically about how there's a weird overlap

1958
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:00,800
Between imports not masturbating and right-wing groups

1959
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:01,568
Princeton

1960
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:03,872
The proud boys make you not masturbate if you want to join

1961
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,456
Most of the article is about a meme that have been going around

1962
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:10,784
It's sort of dances around whether or not there's a bigger meaning to them

1963
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:13,344
And honestly the article itself seems undecided

1964
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,112
On the issues

1965
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,136
I don't really feel like it

1966
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:17,440
But have any concrete conclusions about it

1967
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:19,744
The article doesn't say the people do today

1968
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:20,768
Port Aransas

1969
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:26,144
So it doesn't accurately point out that people like David Duke believe the pornography is a secret Jewish

1970
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:26,912
Attack plot

1971
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:29,728
And talks about how there's some people in the morning

1972
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:33,056
The street who received a no nut November related harassed

1973
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:34,080
That was also.

1974
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,104
Deeply anti-Semitic

1975
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:37,152
It doesn't mean that they

1976
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,944
Hi riddy

1977
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,968
The beach

1978
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:41,760
Mission

1979
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:43,808
Is rooted

1980
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:45,344
There's an overlap

1981
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:48,928
The content of this article are not things that Jones wants

1982
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:50,976
Particularly to be looked at realistic

1983
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:57,120
You prefer that the uninitiated not know that he does think that the Jews created pornography as a weapon

1984
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:58,912
Because that makes them look like what he is

1985
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,472
Instead of dealing with the article as it exists

1986
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,752
He creates a fake version

1987
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:03,520
Discuss

1988
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:06,080
They said if you don't want to look at p*** you're anti-Semitic

1989
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:10,432
And just like that he refuses the rightful accusations of his own 87

1990
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,968
And Dodgers the question

1991
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:12,992
And brought up by the article

1992
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,808
It's literally the exact strategy you see Alex

1993
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:16,576
Employee constant

1994
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:18,112
When news breaks

1995
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:18,880
10-20-30

1996
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:21,184
That one of the Boston bombers was a fan of his sight

1997
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,464
Instead of seeing that

1998
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,000
Question what that means

1999
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:27,072
He pretends the people are saying that he inspired the bombing

2000
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,096
Thereby creating

2001
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:28,864
Thank you strong

2002
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,656
They said I called the bombing

2003
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:33,472
It's so much easier to defend yourself against then

2004
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:37,568
It seems weird that this guy was obsessed with the protocols of Zion was really into your show

2005
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:38,336
What does that mean

2006
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,896
It's important to understand this text

2007
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:41,664
But it's also

2008
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,688
Important to under

2009
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,992
Understand the fundamental reason it's employee

2010
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,784
Whenever there are straw man

2011
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:48,320
Wherever you find him

2012
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,856
There's also something underneath

2013
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:52,928
The people don't want to talk about and Dan will be there

2014
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:57,280
No other man over his head and tossing it to side

2015
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:59,584
I will not suck you you Michael Jones

2016
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:05,472
Also when you Michael Jones says it pornography quote made a Generation Doll sold to the command of the rulers

2017
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:08,288
It should be pointed out that he literally means the Jew

2018
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,104
He's been very explicit about this in the past saying quote

2019
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:16,992
If you turn away from the Catholic Church you will end up a slave a slave to the Jews either through their pornography or their usury

2020
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,528
Alex is just

2021
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,552
Agreeing with an

2022
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:22,624
Licit anti-semite who is Tony

2023
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,928
Just enough to not sound off any alarm Bells

2024
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:25,952
But he still being

2025
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:26,976
Very over

2026
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,280
Hopefully for a second Alex dozen

2027
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:32,096
This is exactly what it is

2028
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,120
And

2029
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:34,656
Next clip

2030
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:36,704
I think we passed

2031
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,496
The line of any

2032
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,264
Real

2033
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,800
Acceptable

2034
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:44,384
In this next I feel like plausible deniability

2035
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,152
Could be

2036
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,200
Dubiously maintain

2037
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:54,112
I don't see a little biased

2038
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:57,440
But I think here we really cross the Rubicon

2039
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:03,584
Hitler Hitler wanted sexual Liberation in a use pouring stuff as well and

2040
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:08,960
Relationships why is that why the fascist while one is well

2041
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:16,128
One of the one of the books did Hitler Burns where the books of Magnus hirschfeld

2042
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:22,784
Mom is here spelled was the head of it was a Jew who is the head of the institute for sexual distance

2043
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:26,880
I wonder why

2044
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:29,440
Type of abuse

2045
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:35,840
Germany a conquered country after WWII suddenly these people are

2046
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:42,240
Or let loose people like Mom this year's felt or let loose and suddenly the people are resentful they don't want the corruption

2047
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:47,104
And they turned to somebody like Hitler because he said he would straighten them out

2048
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:51,456
This this this could have happened to could have been shot earlier

2049
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,736
Holyshit

2050
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:56,320
If you listen to that clip you have two men contradicting each other

2051
01:28:57,088 --> 01:29:01,440
Alex is saying that Hitler wanted sexual Liberation because he's operating from a place

2052
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:05,536
He's supposed to be attacking sexual Liberation as a means of bringing social degeneracy

2053
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:07,840
But also still thinks Hitler is bad

2054
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:10,144
Yellow Hitler must have been for sexual liberation

2055
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:10,912
Which is 100

2056
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:11,936
Is that not true

2057
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:12,960
Conversely

2058
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:15,776
I'm not convinced e Michael Jones thinks Hitler was bad

2059
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:17,056
I'm pretty sure he

2060
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:17,824
Does not

2061
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,896
If Alex thinks that the lebensborn program

2062
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:23,456
Did the Nazis Institute account sexual liberation

2063
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:25,504
That says something about him

2064
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:28,320
Encourage out-of-wedlock births

2065
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:34,720
It was specifically about creating more racially pure children

2066
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:35,744
It wasn't like

2067
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,584
Sexual Liberation you should be free to control your own body it was more like

2068
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,888
Sexual Liberation you should be making more white

2069
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,424
So that's not quite

2070
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,192
The same thing

2071
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:47,264
The things you generally might associate with the types of sexual liberation

2072
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:51,104
And Alex is talking about where things were brutally repressed by Hitler's government

2073
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:54,944
Tens of thousands of gay men and lesbians were imprisoned many of them sent

2074
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:55,968
The camp something

2075
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,248
Subjective experimentation

2076
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,272
Change your sexuality

2077
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:04,928
The Nazis shutdown Club Band gay Publications and overall had an attitude that the Jews were to blame for these cultural perversion

2078
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,720
Like gay people existing

2079
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:09,536
And as we all know they were on the right side of his

2080
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:11,584
History there which is why America

2081
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,120
Kept up the practice until

2082
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,144
I don't know

2083
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:20,288
Conversely prior to Hitler's rise to power the Weimar Republic had a very sexually liberated Refuge

2084
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:26,432
There's a budding sexual reform movement where access to birth control and recognition of different sexualities

2085
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:27,712
Gender identities

2086
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:28,480
We're taking over

2087
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:34,112
Even passed a law in 1927 that made it so doctors and have to treat sex workers who came in with venereal disease

2088
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:35,392
Without judgment

2089
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,416
And then temperature

2090
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:38,720
The actual issue of Health as opposed to the fake one

2091
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,256
Which is marginalize insects were

2092
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,792
Naturally they were all murdered

2093
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:45,888
A large part of the scene in Berlin was thanks for the work of Magnus hirschfeld

2094
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,192
The very person eat Michael Jones Justin

2095
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:50,240
Listen to the language

2096
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,008
Is it that dude is you

2097
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,336
Is Magnus hirschfeld didn't exist Hitler

2098
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:55,360
The creation

2099
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:57,664
It's meant to say that this guy is actually

2100
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,944
Magnus hirschfeld

2101
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,480
Justify Hitler's

2102
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:02,272
So so well

2103
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,296
That if he wasn't

2104
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:06,880
You'd expect Hitler to come up with it a fake version of him just adjust

2105
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:09,440
Defy his actions including Holocaust

2106
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:12,768
In case you forgot okay now I remember that one

2107
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:14,048
You know I've read

2108
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:18,144
So many books on WWII I often forget the Holocaust part in whether or not

2109
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:18,912
I was going to rap

2110
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:21,216
Magnus hirschfeld was a pioneering research

2111
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:25,056
Researcher it's the recognition of gay bisexual and trans men and women

2112
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:27,872
Topics that were not being well handled that point is

2113
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:33,504
He was putting that work exploring the idea that sexualities exist within a wide range of intermediary

2114
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:37,088
Really hard to stress how far ahead of his time he was

2115
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:39,392
There's a lot of work being done regarding the

2116
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,416
Acceptance of people who

2117
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:45,536
Just outside Bridget views of identity or sexuality or gender to the point where they were movie

2118
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,560
It's about gay character

2119
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:47,328
Being played in

2120
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:49,120
At that time there weren't

2121
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:50,912
Yeah yeah

2122
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:54,752
Months after Hitler became Bryce Chancellor he ordered hirschfelden

2123
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:57,312
Berated and the library was burned in a Publix

2124
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:59,616
Swiftly

2125
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:02,944
And Hitler use sexual degeneracy like what hirschfeld was doing

2126
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:03,712
Asthma attack

2127
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:04,736
The Jews

2128
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:06,272
Not to put too fine a point on

2129
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:08,064
But it's very similar to the function

2130
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:08,832
Genevieve Michael Jones

2131
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:14,720
He says cool people these people like Magnus hirschfeld are let loose

2132
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:16,000
Suddenly the people resent

2133
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:16,768
They don't want the

2134
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:18,048
The corruption of their morals

2135
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,096
What John says that

2136
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:20,864
That's the same

2137
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,912
Bigger plan behind the scene

2138
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:24,192
The hirschfeld was just

2139
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:24,960
Carrying out

2140
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:28,288
Hearts not here that is it basically saying that the

2141
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,568
The Jews were corrupting German

2142
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:31,616
Society through promoting sexual deviant

2143
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:33,152
Exactly what Hitler said

2144
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:33,920
Right

2145
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:34,944
Not overlap there

2146
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,016
Yeah people weren't resentful of the sexual liberation

2147
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:42,368
Until the until it was used as a scapegoat for the country's other problem

2148
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:49,024
Like what John saying that there was a backlash against someone like hirschfeld that you're trying to say that was the people's will

2149
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:51,840
And Hitler was just curious about the people's will

2150
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:53,120
Is very troubling

2151
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,680
That's that's

2152
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,240
It's one of those things where

2153
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:02,080
I I it almost like this b******* almost convinces

2154
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:03,616
Is me towards the incremental

2155
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:04,640
Argument

2156
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:08,224
Because anytime you see people ahead of

2157
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:09,248
History

2158
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,784
You see them get

2159
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,808
F****** murder

2160
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:13,088
Almost

2161
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,136
Well hertzfeldt you know

2162
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:16,928
2

2163
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,208
He went he was out of the country

2164
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:22,304
Regardless of whether

2165
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,584
Yeah it's it's just like

2166
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:25,888
These these f****** lunatics

2167
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:26,912
Cannot hang

2168
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:29,984
Cannot hang with there with a

2169
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:31,520
Complete

2170
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:33,568
Control over other

2171
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:35,104
It's real

2172
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:37,408
Antecedent

2173
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:39,456
I can't even handle

2174
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,248
This is f***** up

2175
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:43,040
The end of that last clip

2176
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:44,576
If you said this could have been taken

2177
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:45,856
In care of much sooner

2178
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:48,928
That alone is a really f***** up idea

2179
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,488
He goes on to talk a little bit more about that

2180
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,304
Next clip and this is the point where if I were Alex

2181
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,096
Outside be behaving

2182
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:57,120
And so many

2183
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:58,656
Right right

2184
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:01,472
This is the point where it's like

2185
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:03,008
Talking to him in the first place

2186
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:06,080
No not at all but if I were

2187
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,104
Somehow

2188
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,640
Accidentally in the situation

2189
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:15,040
And I've been obliviously Mister Magoo in my way through conversation up to this point

2190
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:16,320
Naturally

2191
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,600
Vice versa

2192
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:18,624
Come

2193
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:21,952
This is the point where I would be like get the f*** off my

2194
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,000
That this is a point where I just

2195
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:26,304
I can't believe

2196
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,072
I fell for it

2197
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:31,680
This this this could have happened to could have been stopped earlier

2198
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:35,264
The uncle of Pope Benedict the great-uncle of Pope Benedict

2199
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:40,128
Wrote a book called a what

2200
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,152
And he said

2201
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:47,552
If the church doesn't step in and defend the People by enforcing the laws that protect tomorrow

2202
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:53,952
Order of people going to look for a leader but guess what the German word for leader is

2203
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:55,232
It's truer

2204
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:56,256
And they found it

2205
01:34:56,512 --> 01:35:01,632
They found their leader this is the type of reaction we want to prevent here in America

2206
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:05,472
And the way we prevent this is why open dialogue

2207
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:08,288
And able to wear were able to to

2208
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:11,616
Criticize the people who have subjected is

2209
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:14,688
To this reign of pornographic Terror

2210
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,016
Doctor Johns

2211
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:23,136
It's going to get worse with the left and their final hunger across-the-board

2212
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:24,160
Is children

2213
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:26,208
I don't give a f*** about Jones

2214
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:29,792
Is bulshit op-ed from Pope Benedict's uncle or whatever the f*** he's talking about

2215
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:33,888
I don't give a s*** because this argument boils down to something along the lines of

2216
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:37,216
Gay people walking around in public so what do you expect to happen of course it

2217
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:44,128
It's going to happen that's why you got to let the church come in and force you out of the public for your own good every time you guys try

2218
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:48,224
Ryan beat yourselves we murder you why are you trying to be yourself

2219
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:48,992
Right

2220
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:55,392
When you Michael Jones says that a Hitler come to power is the sort of result he wants to avoid in America that is still a threat

2221
01:35:55,904 --> 01:36:02,048
He's not making it clear on the show but when he talks about the quote people who have subjected us to this rain of pornographic Terror

2222
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:04,096
He's talking about the Jews

2223
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:10,752
So I guess what he saying is that he doesn't want another Holocaust but it will happen if what he's proposing doesn't happen

2224
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,800
Which raises the question

2225
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:14,080
What does he want to happen

2226
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:17,408
Well if I understand so far his

2227
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:22,016
General Vibe demeanor and actual meaning of his words

2228
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:23,808
I would say his basic

2229
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:27,648
In order to stop another Hitler for rice

2230
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:30,464
We're going to need another Hitler

2231
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,536
Maybe maybe not

2232
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:37,888
I'm not drivable answer to the question of what he wants to happen but Clues

2233
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:41,728
Maybe a decent clue comes from that speech he gave in 2017 even V bear

2234
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:42,496
I thought was a fence

2235
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,032
Quote

2236
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:47,872
The Revolutionary Jews are enemy because he has rejected logos

2237
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:51,968
That means that Jews to the extent that they accept honor and Revere logos

2238
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:52,992
Are not our enemies

2239
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:57,088
They are Jews who accept logos fully by sincerely accepting baptism

2240
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,392
And there were Jews who accepted and some lesser

2241
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:01,440
Capacity by there. Cilty to the truth

2242
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:08,096
That statement seems to indicate that all Jews convert to Christianity specifically the extreme is Catholicism the Joneses

2243
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:12,448
Except the Christians are right and stay in a docile state

2244
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,216
Symptoms of

2245
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:13,984
Be cool

2246
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:19,360
It seems like it would be Jones version of what needs to happen in order to avoid another Hitler situation

2247
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:20,128
Which is

2248
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:21,408
So f***** up

2249
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:24,736
Alex just going along with a guy who has more or less saying that

2250
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:26,784
Jews all need to convert or some

2251
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:27,552
Submit

2252
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:30,112
What happens if they don't converters

2253
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:32,672
Well I mean

2254
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:34,720
I think we know the answer

2255
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:41,376
Well we certainly do from his comments about to like synagogue to the Tree of Life synagogue shooting

2256
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:43,168
You guys you didn't

2257
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:44,448
Converter submit

2258
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,216
So

2259
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:50,592
Just unacceptable on every level and I've listen to Infowars everyday for the past

2260
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:51,360
3 years of my

2261
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:54,176
I can't even put into words how disappointing

2262
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:58,784
It is to hear this guy saying things that essentially boiled down to Hitler did what he had to

2263
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:05,184
To do and Alex's responses is the pushback or in the interview it's to escalate things to be in about how they want your key

2264
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:07,744
In the world Alex is pushing

2265
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,536
The global student want to want your kids

2266
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:10,560
But Jones

2267
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:11,584
You Michael Jones

2268
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:12,864
Wasn't talking about

2269
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:13,632
The globalist

2270
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,680
He's talking about the Jews

2271
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:19,008
It's kind of easy to see how it would make that mistake though

2272
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,312
When your whole worldview is based on

2273
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:22,336
Homedics

2274
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,104
It's hard knock

2275
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:25,152
Accidentally agree with it get along with an ant

2276
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:25,920
Anti-semite

2277
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:33,088
Honestly Alex pivoting to talking about them wanting your kids and then going off into a little bit of a rant about to drag queens

2278
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,392
Feels more like Panic on his part then

2279
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,160
Anything else

2280
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:37,696
It's almost like muscle memory

2281
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:39,744
He has nowhere to go with this conversation

2282
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:40,512
This dude is

2283
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:41,536
Pretty much

2284
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:44,352
Applauding Hitler yep

2285
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:45,632
It is too much of a coward

2286
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:47,168
To ask this guy

2287
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:49,728
You believe the juice of humanity

2288
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,288
Cetus Retreats into something he knows to go

2289
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:54,592
Like lying about drag queen story

2290
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:56,896
About history

2291
01:38:58,944 --> 01:38:59,968
II

2292
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:00,736
You find it

2293
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,880
No this the doubt

2294
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:08,416
It has been removed

2295
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:10,208
And when you have

2296
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:11,232
That like

2297
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,000
Moment

2298
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:13,024
Particularly

2299
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:13,792
When

2300
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,560
You have

2301
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:15,840
This guy

2302
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:20,960
That there was this sexual Liberation that the Jews Like Magnus hirschfeld

2303
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:22,240
We're responsible for her

2304
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:24,800
Carrying out they were let loose in Germany

2305
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:26,848
What are you going to do

2306
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:29,152
Hitler's going to come along and take care of business

2307
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:30,688
Do you have someone

2308
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:31,456
Saying things like

2309
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:34,272
After all the other stuff you said on the show

2310
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:37,600
Yep you have no excuse not know that

2311
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,392
The person you're talking to

2312
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,416
And would like

2313
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,184
How

2314
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:44,256
This you know your response

2315
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:47,072
And the only reason

2316
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:49,632
You fail in carrying out those responsibilities

2317
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,936
The pushback or end the conversation

2318
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:53,728
Is B used for

2319
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,008
And

2320
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:57,312
II

2321
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:59,616
My feeling on it is Alex retreating back to

2322
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:00,640
The drag queen story time

2323
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:02,176
I'm stuff is kind of a like

2324
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:02,944
I don't know what to

2325
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,504
But it would be delusional

2326
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:09,344
To think that his discomfort is in somewhere like I want to end this interview

2327
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,368
Because it goes on to

2328
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:15,232
Five more minutes

2329
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:19,072
Dr. Michael Jones culturewars.com

2330
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:26,240
Very interesting only five more minutes with him about the election about Trump where he sees all this going on invite him back up interview

2331
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:34,176
Upcoming book as well

2332
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:36,736
Please remember without you were being shut down

2333
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:40,320
Alex better be real careful with which books of Joneses

2334
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,344
The plugs on the air

2335
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:46,208
You can plug something with an innocuous title or you might accidentally plug is most recent book

2336
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:48,256
The Jewish revolutionary spirit

2337
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:54,656
I was about to make a joke that it his most recent book would be too obviously anti-jewish and then you'd

2338
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:58,240
So cool I've seen some comparisons

2339
01:40:58,496 --> 01:40:59,008
Do

2340
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,080
Unfavorable review comparing it to the protocol

2341
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:03,872
Houses as addiction

2342
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,152
No idea

2343
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:09,248
Or you might accidentally plug shylock's using Rams

2344
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:11,808
Are you might accidentally plugs the Jews and moral soup

2345
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:12,576
Diversion

2346
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:15,904
What I'm saying is this guy's bibliography is a Minefield if you're trying to

2347
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:17,696
I carry the illusion

2348
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:18,976
But he doesn't believe

2349
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:20,000
Exactly what he believed

2350
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:23,840
So this is weird Alex Goes To Break

2351
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:24,864
And he comes back

2352
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:25,888
Enemies

2353
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,192
I don't know what he's

2354
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:35,360
The globalist great error with the believe that has a collapsed Humanity

2355
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:41,760
Battery is coming down fast but we're miles above them

2356
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:48,160
You're listening Alex Jones Show

2357
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,440
That's

2358
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:50,208
Really weird

2359
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:55,328
Are we rebranding this is a show that's about the journey to hell

2360
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,656
I didn't know that was what we were doing I did not know that

2361
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:00,192
Female actually

2362
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:02,240
What part of retroactively makes

2363
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:06,592
Brookside stimme if he's just embracing the we're on the journey to hell

2364
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:09,152
Or did he just quickly it maybe he

2365
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:12,736
It was that on the very beginning of the shelters that the first time you heard that

2366
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:13,760
What do you mean

2367
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:17,600
That that little we're way above them on the journey to hell part that's

2368
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:18,880
Did you ask

2369
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:20,160
I mean have you heard that

2370
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:23,744
Not not not the same way I have heard him

2371
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,096
Like rif over the helter-skelter music about how like we're coming down

2372
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:29,888
Right we're miles above you

2373
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:33,472
To imply that when we land were on top of the globe

2374
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:39,616
Yeah I bet they never heard it articulated as we're on a journey to hell maybe he just baby

2375
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:40,384
He just was like

2376
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,664
Oh I got it now

2377
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:42,432
I got it

2378
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:44,992
I'm just going where we're all doing

2379
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:51,392
My own personal Journey there quick positive

2380
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:53,440
F****** Maria I think

2381
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:54,976
He knows he's on his way to hell

2382
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:56,512
So in the next

2383
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:58,304
Click we see them come back and

2384
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,072
And talk

2385
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:00,096
And

2386
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:04,192
I think that this is a good illustration that Alex is still trying to

2387
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:05,472
Pretend that

2388
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:07,264
They're talkin about this

2389
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:10,336
Is not Invincible they're carrying out

2390
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:13,408
Experience their satanic compulsions

2391
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:15,968
That into a political plan

2392
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:19,808
But as you said all they ever do is summon their own destruction

2393
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:22,624
Though that's some instruction

2394
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,672
Run lyrics civilization as well

2395
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:28,000
So I can see what you're saying at the wrath of God

2396
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:31,840
A giant thunderheads rolling in a typhoon towards the shore

2397
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:35,168
Isn't long I from colliding into civilization

2398
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:40,800
Alex is really keeping up this facade that he thinks e Michael Jones isn't talking about the Jews

2399
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:45,152
I was just pretending the Jones said that the left summons its own destruction

2400
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:47,456
Unless he said that off are in the commercial break

2401
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:49,504
That's not something he said about the left

2402
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:53,600
What he did say is that the sexual Liberation in Weimar Germany summoned Hitler

2403
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:54,368
Which was

2404
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:55,392
The Jews fault

2405
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:56,928
Promoting sexual liberation

2406
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,464
This is absolutely not

2407
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:01,536
Is the second instance of Alex taken

2408
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:03,328
Decided repackaging it

2409
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:04,352
Infowars

2410
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:05,888
Sort of language

2411
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:09,984
When the shock troops are the gays that is a homosexual as they put out on the street

2412
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:12,544
Alex turning that into its the pedo Lobby

2413
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:16,896
Benny's does this here with the you know the Jews Simon their own destruct

2414
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:18,944
Turn in the form of Hitler because of their sexual

2415
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:21,248
Deviancy or whatever and Alex Ortega

2416
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,016
The left

2417
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:23,296
Samantha rone

2418
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:24,832
Weird

2419
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:26,368
He does a drone

2420
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:27,392
Does this a lot

2421
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:28,672
You Michael

2422
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:29,952
That thing

2423
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:30,976
Summoner

2424
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:31,744
Struction

2425
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:34,816
He blamed the Jews for the Holocaust and the pogrom

2426
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:36,096
Before I would assume that

2427
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:39,936
He is a talks about this a lot particularly after Jewish people are targeted for

2428
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:40,704
Protects

2429
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:44,544
I mentioned on our last episode that after the Tree of Life synagogue shooting he said quote

2430
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,592
You have undermined the moral order

2431
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:47,872
And now don't be surprised

2432
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:49,664
Did people start acting out their aggression

2433
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,432
Towards you

2434
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:54,784
Which I guess is kind of his answer to what happens if people don't

2435
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:55,808
Submit orca

2436
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:56,576
Convert

2437
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:59,648
You're the long history of blaming the Jews for things that people do to them

2438
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:01,952
Any justifies it by saying that

2439
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:05,280
Anderson Just converted to Christianity and accept this old logos idea

2440
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,816
Go to saved everything

2441
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,352
This is

2442
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:09,632
This is I think

2443
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:12,704
Cuz we've talked about the him

2444
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:13,984
On the day of the

2445
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:15,520
Is a dirty a******

2446
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:16,288
Maurice

2447
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:18,848
Fat like

2448
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,384
There is an ark

2449
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,664
For him to

2450
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:22,688
To take

2451
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:23,968
Back away

2452
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:24,736
From

2453
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:25,504
We're here

2454
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:27,808
And I don't think

2455
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:29,600
Is a

2456
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:30,624
I'd like

2457
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:32,672
Even if he tries

2458
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:33,440
This

2459
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:36,256
F****** episode should be a stone around his neck

2460
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:38,304
He has no Arc

2461
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:40,864
This is this is an anchor

2462
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:42,400
Yes is done

2463
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:43,168
Yeah

2464
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:44,192
End

2465
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:49,312
Anytime if he tries to pay that back towards anything that's even remotely

2466
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,080
Positive

2467
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:51,360
I don't give a fuk

2468
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,384
And he has every reason

2469
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:56,224
To know like

2470
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:57,504
Just be very public

2471
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:59,552
Betty Michael Jones

2472
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,832
Yeah

2473
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:05,184
But even beyond that Alex has every reason to know about him

2474
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:06,208
Because

2475
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:07,488
Alex

2476
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:09,536
Used to employ Owen Benjamin

2477
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:13,120
He got into these e Michael Jones ideas

2478
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:15,168
And went down this road

2479
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:16,960
Alex knows because he

2480
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:18,752
Doesn't have an employee

2481
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:19,520
Used to

2482
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:24,128
And they've had a public Feud about the the idea that Alex

2483
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:24,896
Doesn't

2484
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:26,688
Get into the Jewish stuff

2485
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:31,296
So Alex is every reason to understand that this man who he's now talkin

2486
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:34,368
Is an inspirational figure for a lost

2487
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:35,648
Quote unquote friend of his

2488
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:36,928
He has

2489
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:38,720
Really no excuse

2490
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,048
And I'm finishing up this interview I couldn't

2491
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:43,328
Help would be struck by a few

2492
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:44,864
Is it pretty much done

2493
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:51,008
First thing I'm stuck with this very clearly Michael Jones was throughout this interview what he

2494
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:58,432
A lot of it was just not specific enough to fly under the radar but he was pretty over particularly when he started ranting about how Hitler

2495
01:46:58,688 --> 01:46:59,968
Who was the leader of Germany needed

2496
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,504
People

2497
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:04,064
From reverting the country

2498
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:09,952
It'll be very difficult to hear and say the things that he said and not ask a clarifying

2499
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:13,024
You're almost have to make yourself not do it

2500
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,048
Because you already know the

2501
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,584
And you'd rather keep that

2502
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,352
From the audience

2503
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:17,632
The 2nd

2504
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:20,448
Something I'm struck by is how Alex seems to be going out of his way to

2505
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:22,240
Package of things Jones's saying

2506
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:23,520
And put it into the language of

2507
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:24,288
Infowars

2508
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:29,920
Jones has consistently talking about the Jews and how they're up to no good but Alex pretend that's not what he say

2509
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,200
John says

2510
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:31,968
Perversion

2511
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:36,320
Jews engaged in a prewar Germany some of their destruction and as we said Alex Jose

2512
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:38,624
Like you said the left always someone's its own

2513
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,392
Destruction

2514
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:41,440
I was really wrestling with these thoughts

2515
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:44,000
And to get a better handle on things I wanted to see what

2516
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:44,768
Some of the internet

2517
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:45,536
Response to this in

2518
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:46,304
Interview was

2519
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:49,120
And communities that maybe don't believe the same things that I do

2520
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,704
I came across a site called Occidental dissent

2521
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,472
Which had some

2522
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:54,752
Some comments about the inner

2523
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,056
I don't have much interest in Reading much

2524
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:57,824
Beside itself

2525
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,360
What's the recommended blog links

2526
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:02,432
Conclude David Dukes website stormfront.org in Venice

2527
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:05,504
So I kind of gives you an idea what the editorial line was

2528
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,576
The author of this piece says quote

2529
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:10,368
I'm watching this and E Michael Jones

2530
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,904
Is dropping tons of red pills

2531
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:14,464
Alex Jones is sugar coating and delivering

2532
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,232
Come to his audience

2533
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:16,000
It's hilarious

2534
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,072
That's exactly how I

2535
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:24,192
Bad guy at least somebody's got some pretty good analysis what's going on

2536
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:25,728
That's exactly how I would just

2537
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:29,056
Any ability for me to convince myself that it's

2538
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:30,848
Not in some way intentionally

2539
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:31,872
Was quickly leaving my

2540
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:32,640
My body

2541
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:35,200
I have a habit of generally blaming so much of Alex

2542
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:37,760
His behavior on him being dumb and not having anything but

2543
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:39,552
What toxic information streams are

2544
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:40,832
Curates headlines from

2545
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:43,648
I don't think I can accept that as an explanation for what I've seen

2546
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:46,976
Prior to the booking Alex or anyone at Infowars

2547
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:50,816
At every opportunity to know exactly who Michael E Michael Jones was

2548
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:53,632
And during the show there tons of red alert sirens

2549
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:54,656
It should have been going off

2550
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:56,192
But none of it face Alex

2551
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:57,728
He is charmed

2552
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:00,288
And I'm just so disappointed

2553
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:01,568
I cannot wait for him to go

2554
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:02,592
Get sued into Oblivion

2555
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:06,176
For the majority of the time that we've been doing this podcast

2556
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:08,480
Because it took a little while to figure out the lay of the land

2557
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:13,344
Another firm position that when you get past the bulshit headlines Alex found on drugs or Fortune

2558
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:17,184
When you push aside the science fiction books that are movies that Alex

2559
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:17,952
Surreal

2560
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:19,232
The Bedrock of in Fort Worth

2561
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:20,512
Not that it's historical and

2562
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:21,280
December 10th

2563
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:24,096
Repurposed in the end in renaming the villains

2564
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:24,864
The globalist

2565
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,656
While retaining a lot of the major theme

2566
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:30,240
We talked a lot about this with a heavy over life

2567
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:31,776
But the protocols and how Alex

2568
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:32,544
Albertsons

2569
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:33,312
Conceptions

2570
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:36,384
Mirror the histories of the blood libel and well poison

2571
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:37,152
Narratives

2572
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:40,736
I've long believed that one of the more dangerous aspect of Alex's

2573
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:42,784
And the world deepest emanates

2574
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,064
Is it a paris's audien

2575
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,088
Games for hardcore thing

2576
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:50,464
Because Alex has built a worldview that Sophie matically reliant on historical antisemitism

2577
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,000
But he's insistent that

2578
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:53,024
Not

2579
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:56,864
He allows his audience to internalized these themes without realizing where they come

2580
01:49:57,888 --> 01:49:59,424
When he does so they're likely to

2581
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:02,240
The same things being echoed in the rhetoric of people like Michael

2582
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:04,288
Who unlike Alex does

2583
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:05,568
Not tonight but he thinks

2584
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:06,592
Images of the problem

2585
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,408
And there are far greater risk of being hooked by

2586
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:14,784
Oh man I was a huge fan of Alex for the longest time but

2587
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:18,624
Then I saw he's I saw couple videos and I realize he's not

2588
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:19,648
It's something

2589
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:20,928
Globalist man

2590
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,744
The globalist the globalist are what they are

2591
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:27,328
The Jews who are doing it the Jews are behind the globalist

2592
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,608
The Jews are the globalist

2593
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,144
To the globalist

2594
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:30,912
To us

2595
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:35,008
Or you'll hear Alex have an interview with e Michael Jones where they agree

2596
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:36,032
Pretty much across

2597
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:37,824
The board maybe you'll start looking at

2598
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:40,896
Some more of Jonesy Michael Jones's content you'll start

2599
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:42,688
MC like oh my God this guy believes

2600
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:43,712
Behind every

2601
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:44,736
Maybe look at

2602
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:45,760
It's a message boards

2603
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:46,528
Comments

2604
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:47,296
Two people

2605
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:48,576
Saying that

2606
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:51,136
Is just too afraid to say this and you like

2607
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:53,440
What he did at this guy who believe the Jews are

2608
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:54,208
Everything

2609
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:55,232
Agreed

2610
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:56,768
Everything Alex

2611
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:57,536
Who's really

2612
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:58,560
Will do

2613
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:00,352
Is something

2614
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:01,120
That

2615
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,656
Because

2616
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:03,424
Because

2617
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,192
The world

2618
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:05,472
Are so identical

2619
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:07,776
You have greater responsibility

2620
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:08,544
Protect your audio

2621
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:10,336
From people like this

2622
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:12,128
You have like

2623
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:18,528
I mean instead of actively courting his audience while funneling yours to him

2624
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:20,576
Because Alex is never going to come out ahead in that

2625
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:24,672
Alex isn't going to sway you Michael Jones's audience over to Infowars

2626
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:28,768
No I don't go back from anti-Semitism to just regular global

2627
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:33,632
The only way you do that is if you become more like e Michael Jones

2628
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:37,216
The radicalization pipeline in the states does not

2629
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:38,240
Slow the other Direct

2630
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:40,032
The only possibility

2631
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:41,312
Is introducing

2632
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:42,336
Normalizing

2633
01:51:42,592 --> 01:51:43,360
Mainstreaming

2634
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:44,384
His

2635
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,408
Ideas

2636
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:46,944
To your audience

2637
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:50,016
Local colloquialism s*** flows Downstream.

2638
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:50,784
Sure

2639
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:53,344
I know the other the other piece about it is

2640
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,112
If it's really dead

2641
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:55,136
Disappointing is

2642
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:56,416
Like

2643
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:57,440
You can just see

2644
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:59,232
Very

2645
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:00,512
Clearly how

2646
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:01,280
The

2647
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:04,864
The delusion of

2648
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:05,632
Alex's

2649
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:08,192
Sort of ideas that he

2650
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:10,240
Is worldview isn't based on 87th

2651
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:11,264
Collapse

2652
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,032
Yeah

2653
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:13,568
It's now it's explicit

2654
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:15,360
Well I mean

2655
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:18,432
I still think Alex will I have the same rebuttal

2656
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,480
You can even fall back

2657
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:21,504
Behind the same defense

2658
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,272
Spite

2659
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:24,064
I just

2660
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:27,136
I I think booking you Michael Jones

2661
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:29,184
Is an editorial decision

2662
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:32,512
And I think that's

2663
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:34,816
Enough to signal that it's

2664
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:35,584
Explicit

2665
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:39,424
I think booking e Michael Jones and then agreeing with him all the time while

2666
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:40,448
The same time trying to

2667
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:42,240
To cover for him is the most

2668
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:44,800
Yeah so I'm out

2669
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:48,128
Yeah I'm out on his I'm out on any kind of cover now

2670
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:49,408
Isis

2671
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:50,432
Explicitly

2672
01:52:50,944 --> 01:52:51,456
Fight

2673
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:52,480
Nationalist

2674
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:54,016
Anti-semite

2675
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:55,040
Monster

2676
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:56,576
Data to Alex Jones

2677
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:00,160
Time up until now I don't think

2678
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:02,720
He's used his platform in as

2679
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:03,744
Explicitly

2680
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,536
Dangerous way

2681
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:06,816
Because like

2682
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,632
Critique would be while you're David Duke

2683
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:11,680
And I understand that and he looked

2684
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:13,216
Real bad when he had a 4-2

2685
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:14,496
But

2686
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:17,312
The intent behind it was very different

2687
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:20,128
The at least the pretense of we're going to

2688
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:21,408
Talk about our disagreement

2689
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:25,760
Yeah I'm going to point out that he shouldn't blame black people in the Jews

2690
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:26,528
For all of this

2691
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:30,112
That is a completely structurally different thing

2692
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:31,648
Been having this guy on

2693
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:32,928
And covering

2694
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:35,488
To just shoot. Water

2695
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,536
Making his

2696
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:38,560
Believe

2697
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:39,584
More closed

2698
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:40,352
To yours

2699
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:42,144
If he says

2700
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,960
Something that is a hot word that you don't want

2701
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:45,984
You would rather he said

2702
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:46,752
Globalist

2703
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:48,032
Switch it's a pedophile

2704
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:49,568
Do something like that

2705
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:51,360
Added into one of your other Neri

2706
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:52,896
Don't allow him to be

2707
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:54,944
Explicitly anti-semitic beak

2708
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,224
Because you know that's what he is

2709
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:57,504
Is it you know that's what you

2710
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:00,832
I mean

2711
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:04,416
I can't even begin to assume what the motivation

2712
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:06,208
But at this point

2713
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:08,000
The list of possibilities

2714
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:09,536
Are very bad

2715
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:13,376
So here's how Alex ends the

2716
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:14,656
I hate the Jews

2717
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:21,056
That was a very informative interview Paul Joseph Watson is coming up recommend morose

2718
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:24,640
You like us to have on it showtimes infowars.com

2719
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:27,200
That's not good this was not an informative interview

2720
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:27,968
Wow

2721
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:32,576
I don't know is grbl still available for an interview

2722
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:33,856
So

2723
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:35,136
They come to the end of this

2724
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:36,416
And like I said

2725
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:39,232
I didn't want to do this episode I hate that this is the direction

2726
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:40,768
Things have gone

2727
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:43,072
Although I will say that I was not

2728
01:54:43,328 --> 01:54:45,888
Unprepared for this to be the case

2729
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,168
Still

2730
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,216
I know that it's become that meme

2731
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:50,496
Hate to see ya

2732
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:51,264
I do hate to

2733
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:52,288
I really

2734
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:54,592
I guess I just

2735
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:55,360
Haven't

2736
01:54:56,128 --> 01:55:00,224
I had every bit of Hope burnt out of me by cynicism but I was really hoping

2737
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:01,504
That with the Drudge

2738
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:05,856
Turn an Alex's turn away from Trump I was thinking

2739
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:07,392
Maybe

2740
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:08,672
Maybe he'll just

2741
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:12,256
Pointed back a little bit away from from this

2742
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:14,048
Andy

2743
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:15,072
A Linden

2744
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:16,352
He leaned it

2745
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:19,936
Like I think we always kind of had in the back of her head that was

2746
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:26,336
Probably most likely outcome could be a blip like it could just be a single

2747
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:28,896
But maybe they won't be this is an anchor

2748
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:31,712
Well yeah I agree with you and

2749
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:32,736
Unless he

2750
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:33,504
Apologize

2751
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:36,576
Then this

2752
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:41,696
I would allow that made a public apology I would say

2753
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:42,464
Alright

2754
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,256
I'll go ahead and

2755
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:49,632
I have to be a pretty in-depth Bubba

2756
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:51,424
F******

2757
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:52,960
It would have to be

2758
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:55,264
Book I would need a f***

2759
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:58,592
Creative non-fiction book about his apology out

2760
01:55:58,848 --> 01:56:04,736
You would have to be between the world in me that's what we're talkin about

2761
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:11,136
I don't know it could be a blip in the radar whatever like

2762
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:14,720
Inviting him back maybe that next interview will never happen

2763
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:15,744
And baby

2764
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:20,608
This isn't necessarily indicative of a trend down this road but

2765
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:23,424
Considered with the larger picture of

2766
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,216
A lot of the people he's been having on

2767
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:26,752
You get the sense

2768
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:34,176
I I think he knows it I think he knows that he's on a journey to hell and he's trying to take the rest of his with

2769
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:38,272
That is your theory

2770
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:39,552
Anyway I will be back

2771
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:41,088
But until then we have

2772
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:44,416
Andrea

2773
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:48,000
We do have Twitter at that knowledge underscore fight when I go to bed

2774
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:48,768
Jordan was on

2775
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:52,096
Where on Facebook you can download the show on iTunes or other

2776
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:53,120
Podcast app

2777
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:56,192
Believer

2778
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:58,496
Deal

2779
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:00,288
Until then

2780
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:01,312
I'm busy at Clark

2781
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:02,336
I am the juiciest

2782
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:05,152
