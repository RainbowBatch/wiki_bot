48
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,624
Which is right

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,768
Alex

50
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,072
Interview by saying

51
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240
Well Mike dollars to come down here and tell

52
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,544
Billions of dollars of free press

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,616
You understand

54
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,480
You are straight-up on are saying to this guy's face

55
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:37,344
I explore a little bit I use you as a prop

56
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,744
Do you understand how Imo

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,840
Vulcans of late capitalism myself need to be taken down

58
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,632
Because I

59
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:57,824
Do you understand about whether or not you ever see your kid again

60
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
I don't give a s*** that you're homeless made

61
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,664
So much free

62
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
I'm a sociopath

63
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,488
So we're not going to cover that cover anything else

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,559
Visa Vie Mike Rotondo unless there's

65
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,095
Major break in the story

66
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,679
Rainbows

67
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,983
That's a character

68
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:30,335
Dude the other thing I want to say is that

69
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,127
People's responses

70
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,687
My immediate reaction

71
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
Whenever someone

72
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,527
Criticism

73
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
Like I said

74
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,599
They just reflect upon things

75
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
People say

76
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,647
And I process

77
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,255
There is a fair criticism

78
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,559
Episode

79
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
Clear enough

80
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
About

81
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191
The difference

82
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,751
Pieces of the story that we were talking

83
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
Think about

84
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:04,383
We kind of were coming from a perspective of we believe that Mike is on the spec

85
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,663
Right

86
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,247
Mentally ill

87
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:15,647
Not simultaneous unrelated

88
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,487
Clear in our language

89
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,071
Like they were connected and I apologize for that

90
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,887
Perception I don't think that's fair

91
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,751
Probably the best reason that you can take it that we don't mean that is

92
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,055
We didn't consider it in the Moana

93
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
Because it's so obvious

94
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,639
Distance to things are unrelated

95
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44,063
The previous 700 episodes or however many weeks done should give you some sense of where we're at

96
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:51,487
Like the most Progressive most equal rights

97
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,815
You still got exclude somebody and it turns out

98
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
Asperger's people got a gun.

99
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,871
Because I've been reflecting on this a little bit

100
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,663
I don't believe either of those two things

101
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,735
Been having a great week

102
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:21,951
I've been walking I've been getting up in the morning and taking walks there's a short super nice

103
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,791
Taking these walk

104
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,095
Taking a walk

105
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:32,191
Thirty in the morning

106
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
Early Morning Rain

107
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
Wrong

108
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,775
Early morning walk

109
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,079
Having a great time with

110
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,615
Mistreat my business

111
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,711
What do I see out of the side of my eye I see a moped with a sidecar

112
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,271
How does that not set your day off in the right direction

113
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
Is awesome

114
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,135
A moped with a sidecar

115
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
5 blocks

116
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,207
Alright miracles do happen

117
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,535
I heard a squirrel hit the ground from a tree

118
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
Terrifying

119
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Was like

120
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,143
Sit drop

121
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:13,919
Embarrassed

122
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,711
And then you see and there's one guy in the eye

123
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,015
You and you and me die with a secret

124
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,623
You and me to Watkins out cutter yesterday

125
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,999
There's some reflection involved

126
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,375
Sorry we weren't more precise in our language

127
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,911
Better

128
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,471
Sorry

129
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,519
Sometimes you just don't realize that there are people listen

130
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
It's kind of like

131
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,783
It's shocking that anybody listen to me

132
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,599
Appreciate

133
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:01,791
The transition I was waiting for

134
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,327
I'm a policy wonk

135
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,631
Thank you very much

136
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679

Highlander

138
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,311
Look the first name that came to mind

139
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
Not the one that I want to say

140
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,247
27

141
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,063

Princess

143
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:34,815

144
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,311

So I guess you know what's crazy about that.

151
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,615
Progressively darker

152
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:24,735

Real hard

154
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,071

155
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,655
Does not mention Maui hate such icons

156
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,239

None dare call it conspiracy if we have 250 owners

161
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,695
I'm having a great time

162
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255

25 pages about the first 10 pages right

164
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,935
How long is this

165
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,359
It's like

166
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:28,479
I've ridden so much and it started with a really clinical town where I'm at

167
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,391

168
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:41,791
Graduated to do in Las Vegas somebody actually meant

169

When I asked

179
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,319

180
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343

Paydirt

192
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:14,975

00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,823
Is the building

200
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Towards

201
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,919
Whether or not Alex has any awareness of

202
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,783

211
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143

212
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,215

Speak with a gentleman

222

231
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,831

He doesn't matter

236
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
But

237
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,087
Big news

238
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,623

What do the books

247
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663

The woman

256
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
Fighter who

257
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,535
I've literally just read an article about it

258
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,863
Is article about the implication

259
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
Pro wrestling

260
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:46,591
Pro wrestling

261
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
These workers is

262
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:56,063
Unbelievable

263
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,135
And then they die

264
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:04,767
Two years later because of the high amount they make

265
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
4

266
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,607
The work that they do not considering that like

267
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,887
The training is work

268
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
Right

269
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,215
WWE

270
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,263
Travel is

271
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,823
You have to

272
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,919
You have to have somebody who trains with Sprite

273
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:26,015
Like you have to you're running a small business need a body man

274
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,319
Bentley

275
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,903

276
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
Employees

277
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,535
We all got a national Union

278
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
Tea Party

279
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
Gear

280
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
We will

281
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,103
The effects of that

282
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
Might be real

283
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,527
Flashlight we're down here in Austin Texas and

284
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,655
Revolutionary development

285
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,703
RadioShack

286
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,983
And more

287
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:32,063
Revolutionary changes are afoot at Infowars Alex Jones LLC

288
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,599
Right around the time

289
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
Giant

290
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,695
Cash influx

291
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,743
In two organizations like

292
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,023
Organization

293
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
Like

294
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,583
Sean Hannity

295
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,631
Yeah it's curious

296
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,167
Allergist in timing

297
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
We just had a

298
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
Huge

299
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:55,359
And there's something's going to happen in the next couple weeks or whatever.

300
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,199
Negotiate my contract Obama

301
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:04,831
About this episode about how he's going to hire more people and but how we're going to push through

302
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,415
And expand even though the economy is getting worse

303
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
Pretty amazing

304
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,743
To me some sort of

305
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,791
Now will you match that with the fact that

306
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
He's been saying that a money bomb is

307
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607
Coming up

308
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,375
To get a sense

309
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,679
A couple times throughout history

310
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
Convenient

311
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,799
Weird point in 2015 it happened

312
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,103
Couple months before he joined

313
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,711
Maybe a couple weeks after 10

314
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
Anderson

315
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:37,343
Who is what he was talking about the headwaters in Minnesota

316
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,135
License to sell gold bullion

317
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
Byford

318
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,951
Midas resources

319
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,047
A couple weeks later Alex Jones does a money bomb

320
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,071
Right now

321
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,351
2009

322
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,423
Pimpin the money Bob right around the beginning of the

323
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,495
It's very interesting these timing

324
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,543
The timing Things Are

325
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,359
Super Bazaar

326
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:05,759
Free car washes

327
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:11,647
Bookkeeping can't make a

328
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
Are Cason Court office

329
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,511
But I think as time goes on it's

330
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,815
These date

331
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,607
The circumstantial case is going

332
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
To be damned

333
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,727
It already is it

334
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,031
When we started this podcast ahead

335
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,247
But I used to have a pet

336
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,039
Pretty clear that he's full of s***

337
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,831
Yep pretty clear that

338
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
Sold out

339
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,135
4 years

340
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,487
Eddie Bravo

341
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,351
Sweet

342
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,399
This guy used to be present

343
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
Guy get a peanut song

344
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,431
Read about impropriety and perhaps

345
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
People with

346
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:11,551
View it as a way for him to be corrupt

347
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:15,647
The office of the presidency must be above the appearance

348
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,184
Even the appearance

349
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,304
Of corruption Dan alone actually being f***

350
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
Whatever

351
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,008
Most corrupt

352
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,824
Seat belts

353
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,384
To believe

354
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
The Jimmy Carter

355
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,944
Reasonable ass cat

356
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
But

357
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
Bisquick

358
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,864

00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,448
As well

360
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,520
Believe it

At this point in time isn't he in another country building homes for people

362
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,880

Is a guy from weed

364
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,768
Which is an organization that we're going to have to talk about a lot

365
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,304
Future

366
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,608

Learning books at a Costco

379

Clearly a 9-11 truther right there

383
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,224
Light to someone who wants

Yeah sure I'm even to do with it

386
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:00,000
It's not me but I think it'd be nice if they wanted their victims

387
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,864
One of the only thing about that

388
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:10,496
Given what this all the ship that went down during Jimmy Carter's presidency

389
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,848
I could totally see him being a little bit on the side of like

390
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,920
We had another bush in there so who knows

391
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,712
He might've done it

392
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
Personally

393
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,088
Anything

394
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:29,440

397
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,920

00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944

399
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,528

How dare you have you ever read the autobiography of a yogi

418
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:40,096
Those dudes

419
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,680

Charismatic spiritual leader

423
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:57,248

424
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,600

427
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,512
Scott

428
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,400
The camera in like a

429
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,472
Youth speaks in a lilting voice using neuro-linguistic

430
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,008
Programming safe little trick

431
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,312
Tell you about like your

00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,384
Your path lies and your soul and stuff like that

433
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,200
She's been around forever used to watch videos of her back when I was

434
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
F****** stupid

435
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,760
Smoke weed all the time

436
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
Credibly gorgeous

437
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,720
Now

438
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,256
Here's why I say f***

439
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,072
I know already

440
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,352
The dispatch

441
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,680
It's just going to be another one in the long line of these buckets

442
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,472
Cereal knock-off podcast

443
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,520
Did end up covering a topic

444
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,544
Interesting

445
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,616
And then I don't know

446
00:26:55,872 --> 00:27:02,016
Look at that was that one about Sarah Franklin that cult leader guy

447
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,368
Maybe

448
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,792
F****** crazy dude

449
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:19,168
And then in the last episode you like you know what they might have felt like they belong

450
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,472
Maybe there's Heaven's Gate and all of us

451
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
Aldi's

452
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:44,512
Maybe she's just like an MSR ASMR

453
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,240
No it's out there's a crew called

454
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,288
He watched some of her videos

455
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
Thursday

456
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,080
They're absolutely

457
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,480
I get the impulse

458
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,760
To make those episode

459
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,296
Like those shows like that

460
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
Oh

461
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,136
Maybe

462
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,144
Where can I buy like 20 episodes

463
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,752
And we're going to do roughly all the episodes up until the point where climate change

464
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,544
Destroyed

465
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,824
And then we'll be like

466
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,408
But you know what Alex Jones did make a lot of info Warriors very happy

467
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432
He made

468
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,712
Computer security

469
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:39,296
Fear

470
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:45,440
It's just like horror movies

471
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,720
How dare you

472
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,256
Are you

473
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,048
Do a podcast where you invest

474
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,120
Navigate some subject in the entire thing is about how like

475
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:58,240
Here's the evidence that they're f****** with people just like double back to be like

476
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,544
Nothing

477
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,872
Oh I hate it

478
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,896
I will to listen to

479
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
By the score

480
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:12,064
But just because I

481
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,744
Great write-up at the end of that podcast

482
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,656
So

483
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,728
I'll expect a call for

484
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:34,336
Citizen watch

485
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,128
Disturbance

486
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,224
But he wants to talk to Alex

487
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,248
About

488
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,272
About his free speech

489
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,088

Bead store

494
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
Kobe gives his right

495
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,304
To travel with all the lights

496
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,352
Every time

497
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,888

00:29:59,424 --> 00:29:59,936
Idiot

The right

501
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
Stud through the courts

502
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,288
And what beasts

503
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,568

505
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
They have

506
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,152
Deborah

507
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
Neighborhood

508
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,200
Together

509
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,992
A route that is

510
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,784
Individual

511
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,576
File a waiver of

512
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
Tort

513
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,368
The judge

514
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,416
Adult judges

515
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,208
File against them

516
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,000
And they will back on

517
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:37,312
Because communities

518
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,504
The Super Bowl

519
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:53,952
First we need to file a waiver of tort which

520
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,768
If enough judges get it

521
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,608
Misters benches ideas

522
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,680
Idea is that if enough

523
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,728
Judges get these they're going to be like

524
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:14,432
Everyone knows

525
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:18,784
A waiver of tort whenever my neighbor is not allowed to

526
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
Travel without a license

527
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,856

00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,072
For Alex

530
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,376
These waivers

531
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,680
BBQs anymore

532
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,104
I do not want to talk.

533
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,712
We are just

534
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,320
Text the song

535
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
They're trying to pick me up

536
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,904
Break up

537
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,976

Or getting the doctor

548
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,320
Imitation of what I'm saying

I have a billboard

555
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,080
There's clearly not a real billboard

556
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,640
61p

557
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,712
It's 865

To this billboard

565
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,704
Billboard

566
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:19,616

That is one

576
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,600
One-fifth of a football field

577
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,512
Get a holding penalty

578
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,816

The size of the Billboards

582
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,800
In terms of free speech

583
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,824

584
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
Don't

585
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,408
No empathy situation

586
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,736
I get it

587
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:29,760
I get it

588
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:35,904
The reason is because of

589
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,696
Like neighborhood association

590
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,560
Agreements with you

591
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:47,168
Because like is your pudding if you're living in a place where you

592
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,216
Can put up a billboard

593
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,752
Conceivably the

594
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
People will

595
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:56,128
Also we're in a residential neighborhood on their houses

596
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,408
You're not going to get

597
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,456
How many new people seeing that billboard

598
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,480
Seems like it would be

599
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,040
Super effective

600
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,112

You are going to get out

605
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,816
Now your evening sunlight

606
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,352
It's going to be blocked by a giant

607
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,656
One that says

608
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,984

609
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,776

Aspiring

Agitating and trying to start a riot Courthouse where a Muslim was on trial

We got arrested for that weirdo in the 1700

It look if there is mandatory minimum sentences

774
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,911
Feel like there should be mandatory life

775
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,471

00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,087

00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,055
The other dealer headline that I was attracted

783
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,663
Trailer brakes

784
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,687
Whatever

785
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:13,087
If... All right.

786
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:19,487
That's gold right there that's the most clickbait

787
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,583
This is by a guy named

788
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,119
Wooldridge

789
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:35,103
You draw stages throughout the body

790
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,735
In the last 48 hours

791
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,527
Pic, DeRozan

792
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,295
Media jobs

793
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,063
Displacement

794
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,367
By the show star Roseanne Barr

795
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,695
Comparison of Valerie Jarrett a Muslim

796
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:56,095
Who's singing Obama to a character

797
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,119
Put the Hussain in there

798
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,167
And doesn't even say former president because

799
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:04,287
Former Barack Obama

800
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,871
Then starts another

801
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:12,223
Which as you know equipped biggest oxymoron on this planet

802
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,247
Muslim

803
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,527
Prove themselves

804
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:20,927
Who's to be the most racist religious economic political organization

805
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,743
Former President George W bush to a monkey with a

806
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:30,655
Another word of racism from the CNN and like-minded media Outlet yeah

807
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,679
On Facebook

808
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,727
Black women

809
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:38,847
You can read it

810
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,895
I ready

811
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:47,039
Quartz as like you know but I'm still up still got on the page

812
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,367
It's a black women

813
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
Ite

814
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:55,999
Because of the color of their white skin

815
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,791
Is white a color

816
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,583
If the apps

817
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,959
I always got that confused

818
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,751
The combination of all colors black

819
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,055
Is the absence of color

820
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:15,711
It seems like it should be but it's not looking alright alright

821
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:20,063
Black rappers use the n-word in their songs with such vulgarities

822
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,391
They hate themselves

823
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,671
Just trust themselves

824
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,231
And totally negate themselves as human beings

825
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,303
Never a word from the mainstream media

826
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,863
!

827
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:39,263
You only get one! Uses it as a writer

828
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,567
You don't support Miss Black America

829
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,847
System itself

830
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,199
True for Black Entertainment Television their Futures only black actor

831
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,503
!

832
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:55,903
If you don't support the United Negro College Fund which supports

833
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,375
With blacks only never a word from the races

834
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,935
Remedia!

835
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:14,079
You would be racist if you don't support the TV sitcom

836
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:19,711
Which produces and features only black

837
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:24,831
If America the mainstream media

838
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:31,231
Free with all white national basketball league for television

839
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:31,999
Hawaii colleges

840
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:38,399
Malaysian America and those

841
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,191
Editorial note

842
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:43,007
That was cold the past

843
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,639
Almost

844
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,919
Look if you had a

845
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:57,599
70 years

846
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:05,279
And you wouldn't allow black layers to do it and you had an all-black leaks

847
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:08,095
Boat it was the black lady that was racist

848
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,935
Old Satchel Paige

849
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,215
He was just a

850
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:13,983
Racist

851
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,711
Hey bro

852
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:29,087
What are you doing what is this article really

853
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,927
Salerno's on this is the end of this

854
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,463
Is Brett

855
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,583
Look at the racism of Muslims in America

856
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,351
Alright

857
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,911
It's horrible dirty barbaric and growing

858
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,191
Weezy Muslims pushing

859
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:48,031
A Sharia law which presents the most racist organization in the world

860
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:53,151
Muslim Conquest in America charges to a fraction of our current problem

861
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:56,991
Mainstream media

862
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:57,759
In the end

863
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:04,415
Races don't naturally get along with one another

864
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,559
Traffic

865
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,143
Men

866
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:18,495
America should be one for whites and African people black

867
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,031
That is

868
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,311
No that's not even

869
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:27,711
All right races don't naturally get along with one another

870
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,503
Who prefer to be among their own

871
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,831
On a personal level all I can do is

872
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:37,183
Respect all Races colors and ethnic groups

873
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:43,583
Every person to make down the road of life

874
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,351
Alright

875
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,143
Frosty

876
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,167
UNLV

877
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,727
So that's crazy and very racist

878
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,775
That's the publication

879
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,823
News with you

880
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:00,479
I got you all right I was just reading from that blog

881
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,015
Great

882
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,551
Is there publisher that

883
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:06,367
Seriously calls into question like what else

884
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,927
What else are they called

885
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,743
How do I

886
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,279
White America for whites black

887
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:17,119
Africa

888
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,959
Oh yeah

889
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,263
My biggest issue with him

890
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:26,079
As a representative of the white race apparel

891
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:30,431
Figure out what the f****** oxymoron

892
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,223
Figure out what irony is

893
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,783
Other figure out your f****** talking about

894
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,551
Cuz you're goddamn

895
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,855
Embedded satire

896
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,183
That's true

897
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,231
It's so poor

898
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,071
Call Michelle

899
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,119
Episode

900
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,215
Answer question

901
00:51:54,751 --> 00:52:00,895
The first two questions are unimportant

902
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,063
Has to do it

903
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,879
The people who are responsible for what we're in

904
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,487
When considering the history of bolshevism and cotton

905
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,023
The Communist Manifesto

906
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,327
When considering the protocols of

907
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,375
Elders of Zion

908
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,911
Considering her

909
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:26,239
Harold rosenthal's interview and many other

910
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,055
What do you think for life

911
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,847
Zionism in the world

912
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:32,383
And the New World Order is

913
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:36,479
Do you think Zionism is a genuine racing

914
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:43,903
And really that's about all I have

915
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,183
So you girls want

916
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:46,719
The question

917
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,743
The first to question

918
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,095
Stumbles around a little bit

919
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,119
Third question

920
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:53,887
Here's an

921
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,063
The white supremacist

922
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,111
Orland

923
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:18,719
Japan

924
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,047
And

925
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:22,815
Animal

926
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:31,775
It's a harbor

927
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,871
Type system

928
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,159
Who is this

929
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:50,207
Jordan

930
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,511
Straight up Alex Jones

931
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:53,791
Call Israel

932
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,839
System of apartheid system

933
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,167
Yeah cuz that's what it is

934
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:00,959
Weird

935
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,543
And they just

936
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:10,943
Liberally murdered

937
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,759
Israel

938
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:18,623
I don't know man it's I mean we've already encountered this

939
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,647
In terms of

940
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,671
15 something

941
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,951
The different about him in the past

942
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:26,047
It's good to like I just remind

943
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,655
I've come to a point where I believe earlier the episode I told you that

944
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,215
Questions

945
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,007
Letter answer

946
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,031
Yeah

947
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,311
And

948
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,079
The wannabe

949
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:41,151
At least more like a lot of

950
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,223
Pointing directly

951
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,503
Me to Bugs Bunny's rap

952
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,111
And one of them

953
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:54,207
Is here in this eclipse today

954
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:57,535
I would say in 2009 has been a really shock

955
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,303
Surprising

956
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,327
Blue

957
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,167
About

958
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,727
Pretty sizable like

959
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,495
Look here

960
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,263
Look here

961
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:10,335
Local currencies

962
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:19,295
The market is a separation of powers

963
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,599
Within the entire monetary

964
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,183
Are the symbols of credit

965
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,231
That's really dumb

966
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:28,511
Wow

967
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,791
That's like

968
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,583
I understand

969
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,351
Thought comes

970
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:37,471
Was only one currency in the world

971
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:43,103
Control control all stereo

972
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,431
Smaller level it's like if is one currency in our country

973
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,735
Controls

974
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,503
Country

975
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:53,343
Exactly you have that sort of mentality

976
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:54,623
But

977
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,927
Boy we done this experiment

978
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,207
Like we have

979
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:02,047
No

980
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:02,815
Simple about it

981
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:06,399
I don't I don't remember exactly how he felt about it

982
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,263
He had competing

983
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:25,087
The thing is like it in the early 1900s

984
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,623
We had

985
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,439
And late 1800s

986
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,463
We had States

987
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:32,767
It just had their own currency

988
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,375
What put out their own currency

989
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,447
Tons and tons

990
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,519
I want you run into that with is

991
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,543
Interstate

992
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,335
Acceptance of other currencies

993
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:50,175
They work in Missouri

994
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:54,015
Sometimes

995
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,295
Disney

996
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:58,111
Competing with Six Flags

997
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:02,463
Disney bucks competing with dollars

998
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,279
Because Disney books

999
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,583
And dollars both work in Disney

1000
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:10,399
Buck's don't work outside

1001
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,679
Unless

1002
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:13,215
We allow for the

1003
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:19,615
Free and Fair competition between current and the only way for all of that to really

1004
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,663
Ever been in any meaningful way

1005
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:26,527
First of all you need coordination between all of these people who put out these various currency

1006
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:30,367
I made all need to be tied to a commodity or something

1007
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,135
Call Tanner

1008
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:37,535
We're basically pretty much could be silver or copper or whatever

1009
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:40,863
Roman coins from Egypt

1010
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,143
Beast coins

1011
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:46,751
How much is 1

1012
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,031
75 South

1013
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,055
7

1014
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,127
Nationalized

1015
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,175
I've been doing

1016
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,199
8 ton

1017
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,479
Research

1018
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:58,783
Conspiracy

1019
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:01,599
Beginning of the Federal Reserve

1020
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,647
A lot of it has to do about

1021
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,791
Hundreds of pages of

1022
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,583
Congressional Record from 19

1023
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,911
Like I've been

1024
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,447
The figure out exactly like

1025
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:20,287
What's going on what are they lying about where are the specific lies

1026
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:23,103
Come on the show

1027
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:27,455
We need State currency

1028
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,223
Like

1029
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,015
Dislike

1030
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:31,807
You didn't

1031
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:38,975
You don't know why we have a federal response understand why we have a national currency

1032
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,511
You understand why

1033
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,559
The gold standard was abandoned to begin with

1034
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,583
Like

1035
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,143
Because all that stuff created so many problems

1036
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,423
And those problem

1037
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:52,543
One of those outside of

1038
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,567
Like legitimately

1039
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,359
Right side of the Great Depression

1040
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,151
We have not had instance

1041
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:59,711
Of a severe back run

1042
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,247
Spence

1043
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:06,111
Write the Federal Reserve was founded

1044
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,647
The stimulus package was

1045
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:13,535
Federal Reserve came about in like what 1914

1046
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,815
And then

1047
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,607
2008

1048
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,655
The Great Depression

1049
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,263
There were three instances of

1050
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
Collapse

1051
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,567
Close to

1052
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,335
Collapse

1053
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,359
Since then

1054
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:30,943
Look before that in the 15 years prior to

1055
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:35,551
For the 25 years or so prior to the foundation of the Federal Reserve

1056
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,087
53 Giant

1057
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,647
Like it happened all the time back then

1058
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,951
This this whole ship

1059
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,719
Is nonsense

1060
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,743
And the fact that Alex

1061
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,023
That means like

1062
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:48,095
I don't think you've thought about this Alex

1063
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,631
I think what you want

1064
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,399
Is the Sun

1065
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,959
That's the thing about

1066
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:54,239
Conservatives

1067
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:57,823
Want

1068
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,639
A real they don't want a solution

1069
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:03,967
They want the problem to be what they thinking

1070
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:09,087
They wanted micro problem just like when he was like

1071
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:13,183
When the government doesn't have as much money it's just like when the family dozen

1072
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,207
You have much as much

1073
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,023
Right

1074
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,815
Nearby okay

1075
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,655
Why you think that makes sense

1076
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,215
That makes sense practically

1077
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,007
Practice

1078
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:30,335
That's a f****** dumbass idea that you can pause

1079
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,663
I just don't want

1080
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,455
They just don't want to accept

1081
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:37,759
That there are evidence-based solution

1082
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,551
Handle

1083
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,855
It needs to be an ideological

1084
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:42,623
EBay salute

1085
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:47,999
Whatever you are advocating has been done before

1086
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:52,863
I didn't work sorry dude

1087
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:02,079
Never work

1088
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:06,431
Because of the

1089
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:14,111
I'm so happy

1090
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,391
I wasn't alive

1091
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,671
When the consequences

1092
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,439
Where around

1093
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:19,999
Brave the real

1094
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:23,327
Leave a bunch of liars

1095
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,375
Wework

1096
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,655
Together back in the seven

1097
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,983
Later

1098
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:35,103
I don't want you to take that I just I was just speaking

1099
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:35,871
Glibly

1100
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,919
When I said that

1101
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,199
Really all you want

1102
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,991
We watch local currency

1103
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,271
Local

1104
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:44,575
Stuff like that

1105
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,599
Hi

1106
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,183
He doesn't he's not

1107
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,487
Because he wants

1108
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,047
A unified whole with

1109
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,071
Sweden currency

1110
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,863
Because he wants those

1111
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,143
Be separate from each

1112
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,167
He wants

1113
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:01,215
Secession he doesn't want the United

1114
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:06,847
It's all happening

1115
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:10,175
I should be clear this is beginning of February 3rd

1116
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:15,039
Children

1117
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:21,439
Pirates

1118
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:29,119
Official title

1119
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,063
These revolutionaries

1120
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,903
Actually you're a counter cleaner Revolution

1121
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,535
Jokes

1122
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,471
Cool boy

1123
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:10,847
Shades of present-day Alex in terms of going out to break with a murder threat

1124
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:13,407
But he doesn't do an act

1125
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:19,807
Is Prison Planet.

1126
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,367
TV membership Ray documentaries

1127
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,415
He didn't even put out the Obama Deception

1128
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,999
So like

1129
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:30,559
Probably years away from him having

1130
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,375
You not

1131
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:37,471
The thing that does make me

1132
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,007
Is

1133
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:41,567
In a like

1134
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,871
With the quote from the Declaration

1135
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,687
Something that I am

1136
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,991
Kind of interested in right now is

1137
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,015
What happened

1138
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:51,807
Trump is

1139
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:55,135
It was like what happens after we prove that he cheated

1140
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,415
Right

1141
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:03,071
All of his things should be invalidated

1142
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,887
Isn't that the only thing that makes sense

1143
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,423
Is if he is impeached

1144
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,703
Rid of

1145
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:11,263
Also we should be able to kill him for treason right

1146
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,543
Yeah I think so

1147
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:15,359
We don't we don't have access

1148
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,895
Information

1149
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:23,295
If that is the case then that is the prescribed punishment

1150
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,599
So-so

1151
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:31,999
Why

1152
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,303
Zoso

1153
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,583
Shouldn't

1154
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:39,423
F****** everything

1155
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,191
Be president

1156
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,639
You're wrong like Gorsuch

1157
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,663
Should be gone

1158
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,783
There's no way to do that

1159
01:04:55,039 --> 01:05:01,183
Right there's no way to really do it Beyond going to have like a revolution

1160
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:03,743
Pooping like that on everything

1161
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:10,911
What happened

1162
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:13,471
We are the cops right now

1163
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,495
Because all those question

1164
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:18,847
Continuity-of-government

1165
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,663
No one knew what was going to happen

1166
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:25,503
If the president died

1167
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:30,367
At that stage where there is no plan for the continuity of government

1168
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:35,999
If we find nefarious heydrich

1169
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:42,911
Like trying to continue being a country after we find out that

1170
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,703
Our country was stolen

1171
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:47,263
You'll end up with

1172
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,287
Is

1173
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,847
I've no idea.

1174
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:54,687
I was going to try to say something but I have no idea

1175
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:59,551
Like my suspicion is everybody's going to try and

1176
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,319
Tend

1177
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,087
That it's like

1178
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,111
Know this

1179
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,135
This is normal

1180
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,671
Like we just we just

1181
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:11,583
We just impeach Mike Pence as president

1182
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,351
Pencil Park

1183
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,631
Him being lame.

1184
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,567
Decisions I can make

1185
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:25,919
I don't know. I don't know

1186
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:28,479
I don't know how to drive

1187
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,527
I feel like it

1188
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,367
It's it's so irresponsible for us to assume that we've no

1189
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:40,767
The capital T truth about stuff you can see how everyone

1190
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:46,143
What is behaving like runaway artists

1191
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:48,447
Curry facts

1192
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:50,495
Trump's lawyers

1193
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,775
Don't

1194
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,799
Testify

1195
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:53,823
Because

1196
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,871
You're going to commit perjury

1197
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:01,759
Fight

1198
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:02,783
It's not good

1199
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:06,367
It's not good is my favorite

1200
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:10,975
Is my favorite legal b******* right now I love it

1201
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:14,047
It's absolutely not true

1202
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,655
That's not corrupt

1203
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:22,495
Who cares we got too much to get through shut this line

1204
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,775
Alright

1205
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,055
Because that's

1206
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,847
I just want to bring back in

1207
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:27,615
The sharp Focus

1208
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,199
We got overthrow the government

1209
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:32,991
Because they're coming after us

1210
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,015
They're going to kill you

1211
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:37,599
We have to overthrow the government

1212
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,719
Makes it

1213
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,743
Not that impressive

1214
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:51,423
You said something later that brings it into a little bit

1215
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,703
More Focus

1216
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:58,079
Okay we'll talk about it when we get there but for now I found another

1217
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:58,847
It's different but

1218
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,407
2009

1219
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,431
That is his

1220
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,967
Support

1221
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,735
Support

1222
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,503
I'm certain organs

1223
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:21,887
Control

1224
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,423
Supposedly

1225
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:30,335
Alex hate to be NRA now doesn't like the NRA and 289

1226
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:34,687
He's fans of Larry Pratt group gun owners for America

1227
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:39,551
And I can't remember the exact name of the group there's a group called like Jews for the preservation

1228
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:41,343
Kindergartener Shelf

1229
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:44,415
Find recovering on like

1230
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:46,463
The next episode

1231
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,743
It's in February

1232
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:50,047
He has the guy from that on and that guy

1233
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:52,863
He is aggressive

1234
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:54,911
Becca's notes

1235
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,191
Yeah

1236
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,983
And he is he is rude

1237
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:05,919
Total crude on on one level because

1238
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,479
I think this is actually one of the

1239
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:11,039
One of the differences between present-day and pass

1240
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,087
Could be

1241
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:17,695
I would be willing to be like all right I got you Alex you're not

1242
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,487
That big of a hypocrite for this

1243
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:25,119
Because I don't think 2009 the NRA with as crazy as it is

1244
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:27,423
They still were a bunch of s***

1245
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,191
And Alex's

1246
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:28,959
Wrong

1247
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:32,031
To say they want to help take away

1248
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,079
They weren't like the

1249
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,103
Ted Nugent

1250
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,639
Oliver North

1251
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,807
That wing of

1252
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,343
Of crazy gun show

1253
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:47,135
It wasn't

1254
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:47,903
It wasn't like

1255
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,439
People probably want

1256
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:57,887
Without giving up his principal be against the back then

1257
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,167
And before them now

1258
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:01,983
I kind of could I could accept

1259
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,519
But it also track

1260
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,311
With all the different changes

1261
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:09,663
Write like all the other stuff that we have up on the board

1262
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,431
What are the

1263
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,455
The policies

1264
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:13,247
But the Koch brothers are probably ask

1265
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,271
Switch

1266
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:18,367
He was to take their money they support the NRA

1267
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,159
This Alex Jones

1268
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:23,999
Has a paranoia towards almost

1269
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:32,191
But if the organization has a blanket paranoia right now

1270
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,543
It's almost it's almost

1271
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:44,223
Anything that has his power as these organization

1272
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,551
Like kind of

1273
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:49,087
Is it concept any group

1274
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:52,159
They could possibly switch

1275
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,207
Towards Liberty

1276
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:56,511
Or whatever

1277
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:01,119
It also includes him

1278
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:07,519
More than an hour of television

1279
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:20,319
Prisonplanet.com

1280
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,343
So

1281
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,999
Imagine

1282
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:36,959
Running around

1283
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:42,591
Once your house is your property

1284
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:17,407
So the only reason I kept

1285
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,943
I think it's demonstrating

1286
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,223
Like

1287
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,247
Really

1288
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,527
Really nice

1289
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,063
Recent version of

1290
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:26,879
Because he's

1291
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:27,647
Getting it

1292
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:28,671
Getting this stuff

1293
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,695
Really scary

1294
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:32,767
And then he's like are we going to go ape in the infowar

1295
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,815
Which is kind of a buried plug

1296
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,607
For himself

1297
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:43,007
Visit the infowar I run the infowar are you going to support that spiritual plug

1298
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:45,055
What's going on there

1299
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:47,103
The mode

1300
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:52,223
So I think that it's really interesting

1301
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,759
You see like this is the colonel

1302
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:55,807
This is the Steve that will germinate

1303
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:56,831
Can grow into that

1304
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:02,463
It is now been proven super

1305
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,767
Like if we just point it out

1306
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:08,095
Like now that's that's true.

1307
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:11,679
Betsy DeVos we just pointed out that she stopped

1308
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:16,031
Thinking about diversity

1309
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:17,567
Yeah I like science

1310
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,591
She just stopped

1311
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:24,991
All of the things that protect

1312
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,551
Here's a joke

1313
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:29,343
You point out with the globalist

1314
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:35,743
To do a call-out in point out what races

1315
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,303
David amor

1316
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:44,191
God

1317
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:47,519
Don't we have enough on Scott Pruitt

1318
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:51,359
The very least for the rest of his life

1319
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,383
Agree

1320
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:58,783
We can't do the show if your schedule is like this

1321
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:02,111
This is the last time that we have Jordan has a showroom

1322
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,647
Derby record

1323
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,671
Agree agree

1324
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:07,487
The issue is also that none of that stuff

1325
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:08,767
What to talk about

1326
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,095
Tommy Brigade now he's always been

1327
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:20,031
Award

1328
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:26,431
This point out from his buddy Mike Rivero call is guy who has that show

1329
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,455
Really happened

1330
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,479
Also on the Genesis

1331
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,759
Communications now

1332
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:31,295
He's also the guy

1333
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,087
Reminder who has

1334
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:37,183
Heated Alex Jones

1335
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,207
2010

1336
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:42,303
After the two of them had a bit of a fight about whether or not Alex was

1337
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,095
Israel

1338
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,631
Mike Rivero

1339
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:48,191
Israel

1340
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:49,727
And now works for the

1341
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:54,847
Man I just wish you were still around to tell us what really happened

1342
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,639
Nada

1343
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,919
It's still around

1344
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:04,575
Rivera shows up again a week and a half into Obama's

1345
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:10,463
I'm already calling into token president not because of his skin color but

1346
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:21,471
He was going to cut defense spending it was a token amount

1347
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:24,543
Prisoners are still other places

1348
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:28,127
How many breakups a complaint

1349
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:32,223
Different words

1350
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:38,111
Anyway at this point

1351
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:40,159
Two of them are having conversation

1352
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,951
Guess what comes back up

1353
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,279
Knuckle gate 2009

1354
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:51,679
Congressional

Congressional leadership

1356
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:14,719
I said I'll do whatever I want and then you'll notice that the story has evolved a little bit

1357
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,767
Quotations

1358
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:17,791
Anyway

1359
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,071
Before

1360
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:21,887
Continue to do it

1361
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:22,655

1367
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,583
Quoted as cracking is not

1368
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,375
I don't know man

1369
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,143

Yeah that was very defiant if I had been Barack Obama in that situation Ron would have been fired

1380
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,679
Right there on the spot

1381
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,983
Barack Obama does not move

1382
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,263
To establish

1383
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:33,823
Or assert his control over the White House

1384
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,103
Process

1385
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:39,199

1386
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:45,599
Freddy business owner Magic

1387

1395
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:24,767

1396
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,399

Israeli

1402
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:45,503
It's kind of weird that American citizen volunteer for a foreign government

1403
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:52,159
Service

1404
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:57,023
Benjamin Emanuel

1405
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:03,423

Honor of his brother

01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:17,759
I can't reveal what his original is burnt

1411
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,551

01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:27,231
Israel Israel

1414
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,255
Kind of guy

1415
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:31,327
I filled the idea that wrong would go over there

1416
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,119
Like that make

1417
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:35,935
Weird at all

1418
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:38,239
To say that he's an IDF Soldier is

1419
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,543
Stretch

1420
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:41,311
And then

1421
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,591
He's not American

1422
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,127
Born

1423
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,199
Mom

1424
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:51,295
And they say Obama was born in Hawaii

1425
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:57,951
Jewish crazy

1426
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,399
Like that kind

1427
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,727
He's willing to say that

1428
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:14,592
In 2009 but it's just

1429
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,384
Further proof

1430
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:18,688
You did

1431
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:19,712
State

1432
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:21,760
Play Kenny willekes

1434
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,320
Like scoring potshot

1435
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:27,392
The only reason you would

1436
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,416
Critique

1437
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:32,512
Throw out his dad created Mossad

1438
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:34,048
And he's not an American

1439
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,584
He's an idea Soldier

1440
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,352
Like

1441
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,120
I hate

1442
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,400
The state of Israel

1443
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,680
Like that is just

1444
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:42,752
Is a proxy for Israel in terms of

1445
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:43,776
Someone to punch

1446
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:45,568
If not

1447
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,104
The entirety of Israel

1448
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:47,872
He is

1449
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,664
Using Israel as the

1450
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,480
To discredit this guy

1451
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:56,576
Knowing full well that a lot of info Warriors

1452
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,112
It's very hard to say

1453
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:58,880
Chicken and egg

1454
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:04,512
Who do you hate more the chicken or the egg

1455
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:08,352
It's not quite the same as the way we understand

1456
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:13,472
Did the caller say he doesn't believe they're Obama can prove

1457
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,288
Sounds right the reason is because

1458
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,056
This neck

1459
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,592
The caller

1460
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,360
Is

1461
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,408
F****** amazing

1462
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:26,016
Okay

1463
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:27,040
Never heard about before

1464
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:27,808
Endive

1465
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:37,024
Now besides that I have a very important question

1466
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:40,352
Years ago in 2004

1467
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:42,400
Gastonia show

1468
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:43,936

01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:46,752
Retired Colonel dondi Grand Prix

1470
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:52,128
And I listen to that interview and I was highly impressed I even

1471
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,920
That you have the transcript

1472
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:55,200
I want to see a real quick

1473
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:58,272
Episode

1474
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:00,320
The ground

01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:11,328
Trinidad out and he said

1476
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,632
Wouldn't he

1477
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:16,704
Member of The Joint Chiefs of Staff

1478
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,472
But one time

1479
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:21,312
Okay no

1480
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:22,592
He said that

1481
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,128
70%

1482
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,664
He was

1483
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,736
In communication on a weekly basis

1484
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,528
With friends of his

1485
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,832
Work in the Pentagon

1486
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,136
And he said that 70

1487
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:38,208
I believe it was 70% of the highest

1488
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:41,024
Is 17 military time

1489
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,560

Better by blackbear

1492
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:01,248
Wondering what happened to that and another thing is

1493
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:05,088
It just blows my mind that there is no

1494
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,880
The change to me like

1495
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,672

01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,664
Stop Non-Stop

1541
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,480
Hangout

1542
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:42,016
3 days

1543
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,296
No sleeping

1544
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:45,344
Just a bunch of Pilots

1545
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:47,392
Screaming at each other

1546
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:49,184
I bet unanimously

1547
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:53,280
9/11 were not controlled by human Pilots

1548
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,560
Had to have been remote

1549
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:58,400
A 24-page report

1550
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:07,360
The Grand Prix

1551
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:09,664
Load up a 24-page report

1552
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:11,200
I need send it to the government

1553
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,368
It may not

1554
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:26,816
Who was General Shelton at the time but

1555
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,864
You can't come up with the name at all

1556
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:29,888
Pretty funny

1557
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:33,472
Cuz none of these assholes

1558
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:41,664
All these weird mysterious deep military resources you have don't know who's in

1559
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,432
Charge of s***

1560
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,224
Just seems to be a problem

1561
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:44,992
Do you know why

1562
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,272
Cuz they're not really

1563
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:49,344
They know the names of the people who are

1564
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:53,952
So.

1565
01:26:56,512 --> 01:27:02,400
The government

1566
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,680
Had to have been aware of

1567
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:06,240
Alex

1568
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:08,288
These copies got out in the original

1569
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,312
2004

1570
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,080
Quote

1571
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,872
I got a telephone call and I

1572
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:12,896
It was the fifth

1573
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:13,664
March

1574
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,712
2002 State at the time

1575
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:18,016
You said no,

1576
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:22,880
Use the Marine Corps lingo Semper Fi Semper Fidelis

1577
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:23,648
Always

1578
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,696
And so that

1579
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:26,464
To him

1580
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:32,864
2dr Grand Prix held was an indication that like food I know that I got your message

1581
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:36,960
Well that's because his name was Steve the Indy 500

1582
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:38,240
Gray

1583
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:44,640
General Shelton

1584
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:48,480
I don't know this individual Shelton tells Popular Mechanics

1585
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:53,088
Quote the name doesn't ring a bell and I certainly never saw a report you rendered alleging there was

1586
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:54,368
Some type of conspiracy

1587
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:57,696
Or that the National Guard pilot shot down flight 93

1588
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:06,144
They're part of the North

1589
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,704
Airborne

1590
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:13,056
Letting you do

1591
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:14,080

In that 2004 interview

1606
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,040
If you can get shaved

1607
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:00,672
Savannah Grand Prix

1608
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:01,696
He says

1609
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:04,000
You see as I outlined in book 1

1610
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:06,304
He wrote a three-part book which will get you in a second

1611
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:14,240
As outlined in book 12 as well

1612
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,264
Frozen book 3

1613
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:19,872
On the verge of a military coup d'etat

1614
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:21,152
And this was long

1615
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:24,992
78 days of bombing

1616
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:32,416
Pilots who worked with that possibility

1617
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:36,000
I was told on the morning of September 11th

1618
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:40,352
Only it was an administrative or we call it cold today

1619
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,912
The story of which was

1620
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:45,728
Call the silmarillion

1621
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:47,520
Over reversed

Alex

1625
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:53,408
Counter-revolutionary Hunter

1626
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:54,944
Counter counter-revolution

1627
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:59,296
You're getting picking up AAA

1628
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,088
How to recoup

1629
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,112
It's been a piece of

1630
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:04,416
Like his world

1631
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:06,464
414

1632
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,744
2004

1633
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,792
Where he's pitching that narrative

1634
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,816
As being like

1635
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:11,840
Oh

1636
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:13,120
There there

1637
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:15,680
People in the military who are fighting against

1638
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:21,312
The coup that was launched on the morning of September 11th by Rumsfeld wolfowitz

1639
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:23,104
Right near Albany

1640
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,152
People fighting

1641
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:26,688
You been doing this over

1642
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:29,248
Over and over again

1643
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,784
I don't think anyone realized

1644
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:33,344
I don't see this ever talked about like

1645
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:35,904
Alex Jones reportaj

1646
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:40,512
Being like Oh yeah this feeling to make that argument

1647
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,816
Lowlife

1648
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,376
Like a junior in high school

1649
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,704
Fire time

1650
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:52,032
Gundam Wing and was like

1651
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:58,432
Oso reality right there

1652
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:02,528
The fun part about this interview Grand Prix solution

1653
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,088
He's a goddamn military insurrection

1654
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:06,880
Is Alex

1655
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:08,928
I mean it's

1656
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,208
They're federalizing everything

1657
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:11,488
Militarizing everything

1658
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:14,304
The classic takeover are they not

1659
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,608
Yes they are

1660
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:17,888
Alex

1661
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:24,032
Am I bringing clearly at book 3 the only way we can stop it is with a classic counter coup d'etat

1662
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:26,080
For the military stuff

1663
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,360
Last

1664
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:31,200
The classic included

1665
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,992
Or bring the military in

1666
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:37,344
And under the Aegis of the disemboweling the civilian

1667
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,696
Hierarchy Federal

1668
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:44,512
I'd like that he can use the word

1669
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:45,280
You just correct

1670
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,304
That's nice

1671
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:48,096
Ulta

1672
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:52,192
Classic counter-coup

1673
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:57,312
I think it probably only I don't want I don't want the new Coke

1674
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,640
That's some b******* right there

1675
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:01,664
Bring me back to

01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,200
Classic Coca-Cola

1677
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:05,504
I think it only exists in propaganda because

1678
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,784
Is always a narrative

1679
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:07,552
Used to just

1680
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:09,088
Stuff I sucked up ax

1681
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:15,744

1694
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:54,912
Time frame

1695
01:32:55,168 --> 01:33:00,288
Also he gives out his phone number

1696
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:05,920
It's another phone number on the air

They are National Guards have pointed out that ghiberti is a lieutenant colonel not a major

01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:42,176
Flight 93

1726
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:44,224
Dismiss that because we're turning Colonel Gibney

1727
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,504
Was with me at the time

1728
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:47,040
It disgusts me to see this

1729
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:48,576
Because the public is being misled

1730
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,856
More than anything else

1731
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:51,136
Disgust me because it brings up

1732
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:51,904
Spheres

1733
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,928
It brings up hope

1734
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:54,464
It brings up all sorts of feelings

1735
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,232
Not only

1736
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:58,048
To the victim's family but to all the individuals throughout the country

1737
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,584
And the world for that matter

1738
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,376
I get angry at the misinformation

1739
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,448
So it seems like you would probably lying about that

1740
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,984
Because

1741
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:10,592
There's also electronic records of where these plans were or gibboney

1742
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:15,712
Open system problems when you look into Colonel John de Grand Prix

1743
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:20,064
The first of them is it he's always references a turtle but there's no consensus

1744
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,368
To be a colonel of

1745
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,952
The Bayou that Alex reads on his show says that he's a retired army colonel

1746
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:29,024
The Grand Prix refers to himself as both an Air Force

1747
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,328
Turtle and various blurpee post about himself

1748
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:33,888
Online

1749
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:40,800
The Marines in the Air Force

1750
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:47,200
Also refer to him as a car on the cover

1751
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:49,248
Bio on Amazon

1752
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:52,832
Probably because

1753
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:53,856
Did put that in

1754
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:03,072
Is the barbarians

1755
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:04,096
Inside the gates

1756
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:05,632
He asserts that the Holocaust

1757
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:07,680
Android

1758
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:08,448
Teen harder to create

1759
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,216
The state of Israel

1760
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:13,824
Pretty much all his arguments writings of History go back to an argument

1761
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:19,200
Basically

1762
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,320
The Grand Prix

1763
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:26,368
Too good it's real fun

1764
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:29,696
Liar in a lot of a lot of information

1765
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:32,000
Some of it

1766
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,024
Definitely

1767
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:33,792
Comes from hemp

1768
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:40,448
Alex gets back just a second

1769
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:46,080
There is real discussion out there about secession we have an independent in Hawaii

1770
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:52,480
We just found it on the fact that Hawaii is not legal and so I would think that as we

1771
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:53,760
Song with the fall of Rome

1772
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:58,368
As the central government bankrupt itself the outlying provinces

1773
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:00,672
Start to break away and assert their independence

1774
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:05,792
And I think ultimately that's what we're going to see happen again

1775
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:11,680
Hartford

1776
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:16,288
Got to go away to come back baby

1777
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:25,504
That's History

1778
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:31,136
They weren't quite a work

1779
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:53,664
Is what Alex's

1780
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,944
Real

1781
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:58,528
Makeup

1782
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:00,832
Good riddance also fake

1783
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:01,600
Break up

1784
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:02,368
The United

1785
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:04,416
Yeah is what you really want

1786
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:09,536
Do you like well maybe we'll come back together any non globalist government

1787
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,072
But that's

1788
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,096
Foolish

1789
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:15,936
Well that was actually kind of thing that I was talking to you about

1790
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:17,472
A while back

1791
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:18,496
I like

1792
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:21,312
Every 10 years we should have a re-up

1793
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:24,896
It's like every state is like do you want to stay in the United States or no

1794
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:26,176
At the difference

1795
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:29,248
Yeah it's different but it's theirs

1796
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:33,088
The reason that

1797
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:36,160
He thinks we're going to come back together is because

1798
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:36,928
He doesn't

1799
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:37,952
No

1800
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:38,720
He doesn't

1801
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:41,792
But what is telling you on is the idea that

1802
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:42,560
We will

1803
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,840
Out of choice

1804
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:49,984
Hanging together is almost like tradition

1805
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,520
Is that if we break up

1806
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:55,872
Everybody good

1807
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:58,176
You understand

1808
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:59,968
Union breaks

1809
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,040
He knows that it

1810
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:04,320
The union breaks

1811
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,928
Is never going to join another Union

1812
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:11,488
Gay right

1813
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:15,072
Texas is never going to join another Union vet

1814
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,632
Allows women access to abortion

1815
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,680
Texas is never going to join

1816
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:20,704
Someplace that

1817
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,472
It's not

1818
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:23,264
Basically a Christian

1819
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,288
Reconstruction

1820
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,056
Government

1821
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:28,128
Theocracy

1822
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,152
I'm not

1823
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:33,248
Let's let him go

1824
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:35,296
You're not looking at this

1825
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:36,064
Bright

1826
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:41,696
Mexico Tire like

1827
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:42,720
All the states

1828
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:44,000
Become

1829
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:46,560
Dissolved in terms of the federal government

1830
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:48,352
Every state for themselves

1831
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:51,168
What if you were trying to reconcile

1832
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:51,936
Attitude of Doberman

1833
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:54,240
Most of that middle

1834
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:57,312
It doesn't vote with Progressive

1835
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:58,336
Value

1836
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,360
Rextac

1837
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:01,408
Yes dude end up with a

1838
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,176
Giant

1839
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:03,712
Chunk in the middle

1840
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:05,248
That becomes a white

1841
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:06,272
Christian ethnos

1842
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:10,880
The Pacific coast

1843
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:12,160
Richard be there

1844
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:14,208
Wrightwood Avenue Inc

1845
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,000
And that's about it

1846
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:19,840
That's not good

1847
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:23,936
It's not good

1848
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:27,008
Toyota

1849
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:29,568
Well you know he doesn't

1850
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:35,968
He does understand that absolutely.

1851
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:36,736
Does not

1852
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:38,272
Have the capability

1853
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,832
To extrapolate consequence

1854
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:41,600
This to his balls

1855
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:45,696
I think I think on Sunday best

1856
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:48,768
You at best you're right when he knows the text

1857
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:49,536
This won't come back

1858
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,864
That knows a lot of the Country Walk

1859
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,680
Comeback ideas

1860
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:59,008
Swath of the country

1861
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:03,104
Which it would be even weirder because Chicago would be

1862
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,128
With the code

1863
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:06,176
And that'll be garbage everywhere else

1864
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:07,456
I think he knows that

1865
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,224
Texas

1866
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:08,992
In particular

1867
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,272
A lot of other states

1868
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:13,088
Could create a Confederacy

1869
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,136
Oklahoma

1870
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,416
Isaac

1871
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:19,232
He knows that those places would have the votes

1872
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,256
Needed

1873
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,816
Create

1874
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:26,912
Where are we

1875
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:27,680
Talking tough time

1876
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:28,704
Bright

1877
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,752
Here's the situation

1878
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,920
Did he understand the endgame but he's advocating for

1879
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:39,200
You disagree

1880
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:43,040
We can agree to disagree on that

1881
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:44,576
In the near future

1882
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:45,344
About that

1883
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:48,672
I sent from my position

1884
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:51,744
Understand

1885
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:53,536
Some of these states

1886
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:54,816
App Store

1887
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:57,120
He lives in would be able to create

1888
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:58,656
Kinder version of the

1889
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:03,776
Never possibly exist as long as people are involved

1890
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:07,104
Opera

1891
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:15,808
So

1892
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:17,600
You got your recording

1893
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:19,904
Sunday this is your last night

1894
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:20,672
Adulation

1895
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:33,472
Cut

1896
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:40,128
Where Alex Jones breaks down music video by 3 Doors Down

1897
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:46,784
I thought you were out at the first hour in my punishment is I don't get the

1898
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:47,808
Hear the

1899
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:48,576
Construction

1900
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:51,136
3 Doors Down videos

1901
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:54,720
This is the worst thing that I've ever done

1902
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:57,280
Citizen Soldier

1903
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:05,728
3 Doors Down

1904
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:08,032
It does it's a song about how people are stupid

1905
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,312
Soldiers

1906
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:10,080
Alex

1907
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:18,528
We came out 2007

1908
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,064
Originally

1909
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:26,464
Height of 3 Doors Down

1910
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:32,864
3 Doors Down in 2008 the end of 2008

1911
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:35,168
February 2009

1912
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:38,752

No

1924
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:14,080

01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:17,408
There were aliens they're sucking out your brain because you're watching

1926
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:18,176
Too much Hulu

1927
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:18,944
But it was

1928
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:21,504
It was based on the idea that

1929
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:25,088
Alec Baldwin has a nefarious voice and then also

1930
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:28,416
Correctly the aliens were the aliens
