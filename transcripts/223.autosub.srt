1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:16,896
Where to celebrate Halloween

3
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:23,296
I know so little about all the way up

4
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:27,392
I know nothing about Halloween on a G lyrics

5
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,696
And they wouldn't allow me to celebrate

6
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:33,280
Partner is

7
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,072
She's dressing up for Halloween

8
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,864
She's going to school dressed up and

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,144
She's got a Halloween party

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,912
Going to do the whole thing

11
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,544
She is a teacher

12
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:50,432
Meijer

13
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,016
Thankfully that was one that they gave him there

14
00:00:55,296 --> 00:01:01,440
Yeah me and my brother dressing up in like sort of evil issuer like

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,792
So that was nice

16
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
Simple

17
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:13,216
Live like the satanic panic

18
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,496
Ciara just never ends

19
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:21,152
Just like we're still uncle

20
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,200
Who is a psychologist

21
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:29,600
Who wrote a couple books about multiple personality disorder

22
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,672
And the only cure

23
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,720
Negative

24
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,656
Wild stuff

25
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,056
Traditional attitudes

26
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,080
Number one

27
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:56,224
A number two

28
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,040
Absolutely

29
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,904
Going over this house like we need something fun

30
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,696
Fun because it is

31
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,768
Is Ben straw

32
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:13,888
Whether it's been in the present-day or even in the past like

33
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
We're still hitting on even when we're back in

34
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,216
In 2000

35
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,240
Very relevant

36
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,264
Things about it

37
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,872
Different

38
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,920
So we can all just move on

39
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,688
It's still very

40
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
Rottweiler with in the

41
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,552
The conversation

42
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,328
I'm so where we let have to do

43
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,864
Whenever we get into those mode

44
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
Is we have to

45
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
Take a step back

46
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
A visit

47
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,960
Kerry Cassidy

48
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,240
And the world of project

49
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
Camelot Hellyeah

50
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:00,224
Get that together with them

51
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:06,624
Say it. They tell her stories about space

52
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,304
There's also a lot of weird stuff

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
We just don't cover about like a

54
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,376
Like she just did a reason

55
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,680
Two-part video series about

56
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:26,080
Christine Baisley Ford and

57
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,896
Being mind-controlled

58
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
I give a pass

59
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,368
This episode probably took more work than most Alex Jones up

60
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,952
Alright those episodes involve

61
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
Research

62
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
Involve a lot of

63
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
My time

64
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,048
This episode took me

65
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
Listening

66
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
Project Camelot being like

67
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
No

68
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,472
Is not the right one okay

69
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,032
This was this was a browsing in the cereal aisle

70
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,920
Email recently from a listener wanted us to go over

71
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,944
Super soldier

72
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,784
Episode

73
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,344
Kurt Russell

74
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,416
The episode the super soldier

75
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,184
That you had on

76
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
La

77
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
Pretty wild

78
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
Steph

79
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
Some nonsense

80
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,191
And I started looking into Miss Shepherd

81
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
It's all true

82
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,007
No it made me really sad

83
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,567
The picture started to come together of a woman

84
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,103
Whose family put her in a home

85
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,919
Oh no

86
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,943
Like our policy

87
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,967
Basically

88
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,783
Project good and well

89
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
Until we're making

90
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,855
King fun of somebody who seems like they're actually

91
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,415
Struggling

92
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,207
I know it's a good couple hours of

93
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,975
Live my life

94
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
Now it is like

95
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
We can't go over

96
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
B2 hours of us

97
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
King Von

98
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Someone who's my

99
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:58,495
And that's not that's not what we're here to do

100
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:04,895
Make your own show about us vets

101
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:16,159
Us what we do to Alex

102
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,719
You accurately research

103
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
Source everything

104
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,023
Stop

105
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,583
Number of other episodes

106
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
We need to

107
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
The good

108
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
And so finally

109
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,471
I'm scrolling through

110
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,263
Episode

111
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
About a guy

112
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
Captain Jay's

113
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,687
I like a cat

114
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,831
Absolutely

115
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
Yes you're going

116
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,439
Information about Mars

117
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:55,071
And I'm like well we got to know about

118
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,631
AAA similar in size to Earth

119
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:02,495
That's all you need to know right now is that this episode came out

120
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,567
It was just after she started interview and Marc rich

121
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,615
She's in a little bit of a

122
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:13,247
I will say that these are the sort of people that she was willing to interview back pain

123
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:18,879
So she's left stridently confident in that everything she knows from

124
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
Is this correct

125
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,951
And is more in a very

126
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,511
Stage

127
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,327
Left full of herself

128
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,631
Alright she has Alexa video

129
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,447
Mark Richards

130
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
Is blustery

131
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,543
Sociopath Behavior

132
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,335
Maybe a little bit

133
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
When she gets in the room with like

134
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
And Eddie page

135
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
The telescope

136
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,735
She's able to meet

137
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,647
What is always important to remember that one of our episodes

138
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,487
Bus station I will never remember his name

139
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
What's important

140
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,655
Which one of these guys

141
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,959
She'll be able to mold their narrative

142
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,031
To help State hers more PL

143
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,127
Captain Jay's

144
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,455
I think that she has more of a like all right I'll let this guy

145
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
Whatever

146
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,039
Like we can get out of this

147
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
Evan

148
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,623
It leads to stuff like this out of

149
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
Contacts dropped

150
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
Come to the house yet

151
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951

Appreciate from Mike

154
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
To say that

155
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,359
This was going to harken back to an earlier time

156
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:48,479
When I believe Carrie to be the most credulous woman on the planet

157
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,807
I get what you're saying

158
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:58,207
You know how this is bulshit it sounds like b******* to I'm suggesting back then she had more

159
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,559
More of an operation going where it's like

160
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
Nah

161
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:11,263
Pictures of every one of our as episodes we just and would like

162
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,823
Yeah I'm going to pass on this one it is just

163
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,407
Isaac modern-day Carrie would have taken Captain J when he came in

164
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
I hear things

165
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
What you saying

166
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,479
Outlandish

167
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,783
Yeah well from the information

168
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:28,671
I've got maybe it's possible

169
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,463
And try and get him to be like

170
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,559
You do now that you mentioned it yet that's like that

171
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:40,447
You know this is pretty absurd right have you considered yourself because

172
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
What

173
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
What's

00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,799

00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:53,759
Outlandish

177
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,063
I teased on the last episode

178
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
So we got a song to play

179
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
Yes

180
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,719
And I don't know you have been bothering me with how excited you are about this song

181
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:07,071
For 4 days now

182
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
That leaves my instincts

183
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
To say that we should

184
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,471
Should wait I'm not that cruel so I will go ahead and play it

185
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
Guys

186
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,335
In doing some research and fiddling around looking

187
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,871
Project Camelot world

188
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
I found

189
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
The back in 2014

190
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
Kerry Cassidy made an album

191
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:32,415
What's show Siri Cassidy made an album called

192
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:37,279
I believe I don't know if I'm up Spotify

193
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,583
But

194
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:46,239

Raiding party are abducted permanently office

200
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,935
I need to pause for a second

201
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:20,287
A second just to say that the song is called space

202
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,871
Command the album Rebel 3

203
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:30,271
If you were watching 4th Matrix movie Underground

204
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:38,207
We have many uses to visiting races

205
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,607
Duvall as a food source and maybe others

206
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:51,007
Allies plays for building

207
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:57,407
Serving various races

208
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:03,807
As in scientific study versus the desirable vacation

209
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:11,487
Precious stone outside use the granite

210
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,887
Other systems.

213
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:42,719
Multiverse humans on the level with other ET Races they don't appreciate

00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
Futaba

215
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
Okay

216
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,631
We have of

217
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,679
Space command

218
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:56,799
Could be an early really early Thievery Corporation track like that really doesn't sound that tariff

219
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:03,455
Really I'm not saying this is there later or they're even later

220
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,527
I went

221
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Just turn this into a music

222
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
Target

223
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,143
But

224
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
You know

225
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,239
Be replaced

226
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:31,615
Gold standard

227
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,175
It really does make me happy in a lot of ways

228
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:40,063
I told you earlier I was coming

229
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
Still satisfies

230
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,975
So good

231
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,303
As we opened every episode with project

232
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
It says her name

233
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,375
But things go slightly different

234
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
Immediately reduction

235
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:05,407
And we have

236
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,807
Here with us today and this is the very impromptu

237
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
Set up

238
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
Captain

239
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,631
No actually

240
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,031
Clear-cut

241
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,967
To Mars and part of the Mars program

242
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,551
The understand that from the disagree

243
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:51,743
There's a billion different ways

244
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:01,727
If there was any astronomical astronomical movement around the time when he says he was

245
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,751
Supposed to have leftovers

246
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:08,895
For specific

247
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,271
Play more at the beginning

248
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,087
The show cuz she doesn't know what the f*** is coming

249
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,415
We're going to be crazy

250
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,695
It says he's like

251
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:26,303
Or doing his interview I have no idea

252
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,119
We can't prove this is your Dosha

253
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:36,287
We can't even prove this guy how long has she been doing the show is this

254
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,847
Houston's like probably three years ago I mean

255
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,479
The beginning date of her show on YouTube

256
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
Investigation

257
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,039
Things and stuff like that

258
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,063
Kind of nebulous

259
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
Sushi

260
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
She's been on

261
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
For like 6

262
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,743
7 years okay

263
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
3 years ago

264
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
Like 20-30

265
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
Alright

266
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,911
Search for 2014 2015 right next

267
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,519
Probably just recorded that

268
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
You need to know

269
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
Is this

270
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
View is happy

271
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
Very soon after

272
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,807
Interview with space

273
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,831
Super soldier

274
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
Randy Cramer

275
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,671
The guy who we did our first episode of

276
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:31,071
The guy who woke up in his bed that 80 and then playing for the game whatever

277
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,655
Space-time and it's

278
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,471
Various Alien Children on Mars

279
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:43,871
Ashley Stoller a protection unit or whatever Kramer Who come out and done his

280
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,967
Interview on Project Camelot

281
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
Which is relevant

282
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,295
Because he goes by the name

283
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
Captain k

284
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:59,231
This guy heinze Manchester

285
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,279
Men In Black J & K

286
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,327
Literally wrote that.

287
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,119
I've literally wrote that down

288
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
I don't think that their nest

289
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,679
He's necessarily trying

290
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
Make that connection

291
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Is he

292
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
Okay then second

293
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,247
And I came before Randy Cramer in

294
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,319
He's going to say that

295
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,855
So many times

296
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,439
He's so petty about how do you say

297
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,791
Okay

298
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,863
Means that you specifically however chose your name

299
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,447
In order to make it look like you were before this

300
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
Because he was

301
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,775
He's older and Eve

302
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,311
I'd like I was around

303
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,359
20 years before he was up there in

304
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:53,759
Lovin You could have called yourself well

305
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,575
His name is very anyway

306
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,391
Nation that I don't appreciate

307
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:05,023
SuperShuttle do you got plenty coming up

308
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
Him trying to talk

309
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,119
About space weirdness

310
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,167
And then Randy Cramer came along

311
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,703
He's like

312
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,287
So I welcome and introduce yourself

313
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,871
I'm using a named Captain J because

314
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,431
It is my first initial and also

315
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,479
It's the letter before

316
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:31,135
I'm online

317
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,535
Online it

318
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
I realize that

319
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,015
No one was listening to me before Randy driver showed up

320
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,087
Cuz I got to strike while the Iron's hot

321
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
Can get in

322
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,647
As we guy who came before him

323
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,183
Even though I'm

324
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,255
Quite literally by any and all definition

325
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
The guy who

326
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
A week

327
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
Opportunism

328
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
Personify

329
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,103
I'm going to get in while the group

330
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,663
Super soldier drugs make you sound like Anna

331
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:34,879
Side effects to get rid of

332
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
I'm not

333
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,511
Listen I'm against the military industrial complex

334
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
Super soldier

335
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,887
I want maybe an imposing voice maybe the very least with you know I'm a very

336
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:50,239
Nasal Tanner I would prefer a thick based

337
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,335
You need to pump

338
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
Super soldier with that

339
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:01,503
Because you're assuming first about this guy's a super soldier

340
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,879
You're Assuming he's a super soldier

341
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,927
You're assuming that the government deep something

342
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
To him

343
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,767
Oldies maybe maybe erroneous

344
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:19,167
Do I know that you're making those exceptional because he's comparing himself to Randy

345
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,311
Turns out he's not a super soldier at all

346
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,335
And his story

347
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,127
Is convoluted as f***

348
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,663
I will do my best

349
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,479
To pull the strings in order to unlock

350
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:38,623
Untangle this thing but I have not gordian Dan I say to you now

351
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,159
No confidence in my abilities

352
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,463
I will do my best

353
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
Look at you and everybody

354
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,559
Absolutely

355
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,095
In the next clip

356
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,655
Captain J goes on

357
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,423
Explain

358
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
Some of the

359
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,239
The organization

360
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,263
He was involved

361
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
I think Carrie asked

362
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,823
Very basic question

363
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,615
And it almost ruined the entire it

364
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,991
Starting at the trial

365
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,999
Songs Navy and Marines at sign

366
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,631
That matter

367
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:28,287
All the way through that

368
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,711
Rover myself

369
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:55,935
How do you go from one organization to another

370
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,543
Well

371
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,615
Fake programming

372
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,479
Not answer

373
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:14,623
Give me a year

374
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,816
1963 when the first Mars probe went up which is actually a small man

375
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,424
Stuff that has been

376
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,776
AOL

377
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:38,176
I will accept that if we're going to go any further

378
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,712
Give any specific

379
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,136
Flying around

380
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:52,768
Not an answer as to why you were in multiple arms of the service

381
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,840
Mid 5363

382
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,400
I guess so

383
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
Disguise

384
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
Alright

385
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,824
You've got loving a man who's

386
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,896
Invalidated

387
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:15,296
I have a lot of trouble with this sort of a Project Camelot episode

388
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,856
Years is tough

389
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,624
Because

390
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,184
You should be able to

391
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
I do not know

392
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,536
You thought about it though probably

393
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,816
To put together like

394
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,120
Secret space program

395
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:36,800
If you were

396
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,592
Acuity about when things happen

397
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:42,176
If you were going to go do an interview specifically about those things

398
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:47,808
You'd be able to sit down ahead of time be like well that happened right around the same time as X Y or Z

399
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,856
Before this event in my life

400
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,648
Before Zach

401
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,440
Rhetoric

402
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,720
What specific information

403
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,256
You did that question come up

404
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,048
He hasn't been

405
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
This guy might be

406
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,376
Might be making a lot of s*** out

407
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
I just love

408
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,704
The confidence of a guy who'd

409
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,984
Just has no idea what

410
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
We talkin about huh

411
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,056
Confident I am literally

412
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,128
If I just say things stridently

413
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:12,896
Powerful

414
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Yeah yeah yeah

415
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,784
And this is one of the like like

416
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,880
This type of Project Camelot

417
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
It's destroying the world

418
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,256
This this this type of Project Camelot episode

419
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,280
Kind of a challenge

420
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,352
Because we have a guy using an alias

421
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
MJ

422
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:37,984
Am I supposed to find out anything about who this working person actually is

423
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,288
Also

424
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,080
I believe his name is just

425
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,896
It probably why probably

426
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,200
Simpsons

427
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:51,296
Mark Richards I can look into that

428
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,600
Pass

429
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,880
Please find more information

430
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,928
Volume to flesh out the picture

431
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,232
With Captain J I got none

432
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,536
I just have his word to go on

433
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,632
Eevee research path to go down

434
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:09,728
No just find anyone who has been in both the Marines

435
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,496
And the Navy

436
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,224
No

437
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,992
Probably

438
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,528
Butler

439
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,112
The Navy submarine

440
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
He's in the CIA

441
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:33,024
The mid-fifties to 1960

442
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,584
C3 he's involved in something or other

443
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,632
Specific

444
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
Dora

445
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Jets

446
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,752
Now is he not even know when Rockets were invented

447
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,824
Unimportant

448
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,384
Deep sea October Sky

449
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,176
Okay

450
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
Jake Gyllenhaal

451
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,248
In this next

452
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,648
None of those things

453
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,464
We've already talked about bear any relevance

454
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
To this Mexico

455
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,792
Because he's going to jump forward to the 7

456
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
Talk about something else

457
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,376
Good that I believe

458
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,936
But there's more like

459
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,264
Carrie's not great at like nailing him down on

460
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,568
The story he's going

461
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,872
To tell for the rest of this has to do with stuff in

462
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,456
So all that stuff about him being in the Navy and the Marines

463
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,992
CIA MKUltra

464
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,296
I don't think

465
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,064
I don't think

466
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,624
Just to demonstrate

467
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
How

468
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,928
Blurry

469
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,208
His backstory

470
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,488
Run away we go to the

471
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,608
Part of a small group

472
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
Honda Pilot

473
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
Text message

474
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,376
1960 Prius

475
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,656
Wichita

476
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,704
Orbitz

477
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,432
And the same pilot

478
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,424
Look at

479
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,752
Defying all laws of physics

480
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,800
The technology we have available to us

481
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,104
1063 Tamar's

482
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,128
Documented

483
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,200
Being a teeming civilization

484
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:03,552
Let's find out more let's go home

485
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,904
How much

486
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,744
1963a life support

487
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,376
I don't care about that he's a child at the time

488
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:23,776
At the time yet

489
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:34,016
That is a problem we've always had lights

490
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:38,112
Speed travel technology

491
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:44,768
Towards the most important

492
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
How did all of these ridiculous

493
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,704
Don't know how far planets are exactly

494
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,752
Bitdownloader

495
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,032
It's a joke.

496
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,568
Mars is a jaunt

497
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:03,456
Jupiter is a bit of a long walk sure and then Pluto

498
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,112
One of the things that I find most

499
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,136
Sing about the center

500
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,952
In 13 Reasons Why

501
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,232
Is

502
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,024
It introduces us

503
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,424
To so many new alien races

504
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:30,848
Pizza spider leadership

505
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,384
Two brothers the man

506
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,480
Grazed the grades are always there

507
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,272
This gentleman Captain J has a

508
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,576
Very different take on the grill

509
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:44,928
Probably why Carrie says that this is ludicrous.

510
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
We have the

511
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,720
Polly ATM

512
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
We have

513
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,280
I already said rafters

514
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,304
We have

515
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:55,680
Did we have in Vietnam

516
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,960
Yeah there's a lot of

517
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,752
Bunch of new

518
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,520
Draco

519
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
Break up

520
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,128
Wrapped up with reptilian

521
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
So

522
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
We get it we get

523
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
And

524
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,064
It starts to be introduced

525
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,232
Like

526
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,792
Between say 6370

527
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,888
Well that's when everything happens

528
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,168
I think

529
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,752
Talk about

530
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,288
As opposed to

531
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,552
Considerate

532
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
Local

533
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
However

534
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,184
Show me the flying saucer

535
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,000
Just never went away

536
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:52,768
Okay

537
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,816
So now if you're going exactly

538
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,120
What is just

539
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,424
Is that if you go to Mars

540
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,448
You will find

541
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,544
They're not really aliens

542
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:09,152
Cuz they're our neighbors there yet

543
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,200
There are silver flying crafts

544
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,992
Legend

545
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,576
Always been around never really went away or not

546
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,184
So this is this is

547
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,744
The world that we are now interjecting ourselves in

548
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,304
This is the basic setup

549
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,840
You know what I do like

550
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
About this

551
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,168
Is that this guy is

552
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,192
Drinking locally

553
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:38,592
You know everybody else has been talking about Interstellar long time including

554
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,808
You really break the very least

555
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:54,208
This guy Progressive illegal immigrants are our neighbors

556
00:30:54,464 --> 00:31:00,608
That is that that makes me feel very uncomfortable

557
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,936
Right right

558
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,728
Hey there for Mars

559
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:10,336
Mars is just a skip away

560
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:13,920
Okay

561
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:17,248
That's what he's at he's like somebody who's like listen

562
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,296
Indiana still part of them

563
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,112
Let's not pretend that we need to close out

564
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,392
Sojourn

565
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
I told you

566
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
It would be wrong

567
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
To assume

568
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,512
The Captain Jay's

569
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,536
Is a space Soldier

570
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,376
You need

571
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,400
No is

572
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,192
Diplo

573
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,520
That doesn't make sense

574
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,480
Honorary title

575
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:54,880
Jerry does literally have to do one of the later Clips what are you you are the pilot

576
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,952
But

577
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,976
You the hero

578
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,512
Okay

579
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,608
Introduction

580
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,144
So you don't want to come out

581
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
And be like I am the most

582
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,704
Important person

583
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,728
In all of space

584
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,776
Unless you're parked right

585
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,360
Captain Jay's

586
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,640
Little more modest

587
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,712
A little more humble but now we get to high

588
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:23,552
Liberated bar

589
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,624
Key to everything

590
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,720
We finally managed to identify

591
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,328
He liberated the

592
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,400
Evil ones of Legend

593
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,192
He freed them freed Mars

594
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,496
Who was piloting

595
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,056
Where they are going

596
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,848
And what a word

597
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,584
Finally

598
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,592
All the species on Mars and the two

599
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,416
So we really

600
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,440
Had this meeting

601
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
Shut up

602
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,792
By virtue of a secondary Enright

603
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,400
This isn't right you Kathy

604
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,704
Powerful alien

605
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:59,040
Because these people down here on Earth

606
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,600
And so they were able to

607
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
Stop

608
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,416
Large degree

609
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,976
She do the activities

610
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,328
And in order to

611
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
And meeting with

612
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,264
Multi-million races

613
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,176
Pretty much

614
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:35,392
Liberation day

615
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:39,232
You're funny pretty funny ad

616
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,256
Powerball

617
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,560
Powerful

618
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,632
Trisexual

619
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:51,264
The beginning of our

620
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:58,688
That was a lot of talking

621
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,760
There are more than two gender

622
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,088
It means there's three

623
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:12,512
Things to come he does not explain that in the time being

624
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,072
What we learned

625
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
Where is that

626
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
Grave

627
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,192
In facilitated meeting of the minds

628
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,240
Of all of these races

629
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,776
Including our route

630
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:30,432
Like the pleiadian aliens

631
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,856
Ender's Game come out

632
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,648
I must Express

633
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,464
Zach's Opposite Worlds you the carry-in

634
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,048
The greys are evil

635
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:52,448
Reptilian aliens that come around and kidnap people

636
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,080
Which are starting to get a sense of why this guy is only been on once

637
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:01,152
Following my previous argument that if Mark Richards

638
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:07,040
Evil meaning

639
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,856
Good

640
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,416
People and he's calling the people he called evil good

641
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,720
Support

642
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,424
Three or four days

643
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,728
Track

644
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,056
Real

645
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,592
Light on the beat

646
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:35,968
Store to get out or anything like that

647
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:40,064
We figured out what everybody wanted we all got what we want

648
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,672
When he finally does give a little more detail about it

649
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:48,000
Even more hilariously absurd

650
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,048
You know we have our take on this

651
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,584
Mars

652
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,376
Here's what Carrie

653
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,288
And asked you about

654
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,848
Because it's

655
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,640
WinCo

656
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,200
It's not clear

657
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,760
It is a little convoluted

658
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
Yeah

659
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,832
So she wants him to get back

660
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,600
Debased

661
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,904
She wants to talk about

662
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,928
Like where

663
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,952
Did this

664
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:22,816
Where did your awareness come from

665
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
Because I think

666
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,216
She realizes is going to be an uphill battle

667
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:32,032
Let's get a little more report to me about the

668
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,104
Beginning let's start let's start how did the center

669
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,664
Evolve on Mars

670
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,736
Notoriously inhospitable place

671
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:47,392
That's good response

672
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:50,976
More of the backstory

673
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,000
And she asked about that

674
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,096
Route

675
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,008
Without verbalizing it

676
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,848
It's a prank being played on people that carries

677
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,152
Because a few years later we living in the present

678
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,760
Carrie is a steady pace

679
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,088
So here is a little anecdote

680
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,880
From

681
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,160
For Captain J

682
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,184
And this ends

683
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,720
I blurt

684
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,144
Hi

685
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:39,360
Anything pulled in

686
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,648
Ameren

687
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,120
But innocent

688
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:03,936
During that time

689
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,848
When I was a child

690
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:14,176
Why don't want to talk about it

691
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,704
Cuz you guys broke child labor

692
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,728
Illegal

693
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:41,312
Virchow's work this hard

694
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,432
I love the idea.

695
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,992
Every child labor laws

696
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,016
Weirdo

697
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:55,648
The Olsen Twins then you could get away with that s*** if you got twins

698
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,208
Makes your butt

699
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:01,792
It almost died out but it almost makes me believe

700
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:05,120
Kind of a weird line

701
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,680
Obviously child labor laws aren't

702
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:11,008
Play you're making all this up

703
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:15,872
I don't talk about that cuz I was a child illegal to make me work

704
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,432
This guy is coming from a bad play

705
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:24,064
But I like where his ideals are going so far

706
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,648
He say he's fighting in space battle

707
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:33,536
You just started s*** Outsource are these people alien

708
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:37,376
Are solar system

709
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,448
Children have to work

710
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,728
No nope

711
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:46,592
It is interesting you might be

712
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:52,224
The craziest but most reasonable person

713
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,904
Metaphorically stand behind buddy what he is representing obviously

714
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,536
Sorted it out is like no we don't need laser gun

715
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:09,120
I believe we need to do any Recon we just needed

716
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,424
To find out that they were there we went around once

717
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,752
Emma

718
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,056
Sorted out

719
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
Whatever that means

720
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,128
So

721
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,152
Seems to like

722
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
I mean

723
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,712
This guy's already said

724
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:26,016
He was Navy and the Marines mcia

725
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:31,648
Answer carry once made it all the way through the mk-ultra Baptist Church

726
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,976
Cloud from

727
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,000
MK Ultra

728
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
Haven't talked

729
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,840
Kramer knows that Randy

730
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,864
Kramer has an imagine

731
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,912
Legendary military liaison

732
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:46,240
A sponsor who is there telling him this is okay for you

733
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,264
All that stuff

734
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,800
So she wants to know

735
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:49,824
If Captain

736
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,616
Has a similar situation

737
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,687
Pre discussion

738
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,503
For example

739
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,511
He has a person behind the scenes

740
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,327
Who's backing him who is a military officer

741
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,751
Lorne Michaels

742
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:28,223
What's the people from the 50s or early 60s

743
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:31,295
Real quick. Is a reasonable thing to say at the end of his

744
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,575
A butt

745
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,855
I want to just say that like

746
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,623
What you just waiting

747
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,695
Whenever someone asks you a direct question

748
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,719
Your answer is

749
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:43,327
Usually means you're just making sure

750
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,079
So the only no I don't have a personal sponsor I was just

751
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,711
Have record

752
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:04,319
Abuse activities

753
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,391
Those records

754
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,671
Will be there

755
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,095
Oh yeah that sounds like

756
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:23,519
Really believe in good things real glass-half-full kind of

757
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:27,871
Information

758
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:36,575
Transparency is their business right if anybody comes in like a was camp

759
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:47,839
Flores

760
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:54,239
So you should know.

761
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,519
Is not playing

762
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,055
Where is proof

763
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,847
He did all this stuff

764
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:07,807
This like this clip makes me laugh so hard because he explains the proof

765
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,599
And where you can find

766
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,415
Any of the stuff that I say about Mars

767
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,719
I'll be very careful only to

768
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,535
Important information that I know

769
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:21,375
There are records of apparel Mart and other places

770
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,167
Can be verified

771
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:32,639
There's proof of it which is on Boston

772
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,407
Their record

773
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:36,735
You only have to go to Mars to get them

774
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:41,087
Love that totally awesome

775
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,135
Conspiracy theorist use about like the idea of

776
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,439
Everything that I'm saying

777
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:49,279
In a bunker deep under the Vatican

778
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,327
Give me the secrets of maybe

779
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:57,727
Existing the Vatican bunker underground people don't worry about

780
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,799
Do you want to prove

781
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,335
It's the same thing with the Akash

782
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,127
People talk about

783
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,407
These records

784
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:10,271
Is all of humanity that only exist in the astral realm you can access and Subway

785
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,367
Itsfunneh

786
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,415
It's fun to think about

787
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,487
Not fun to rely like base your life on

788
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,791
Edward

789
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,095
That's where it gets murdered

790
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,887
That's how you can kind of generally talwin

791
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,471
Just go to Mars

792
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:41,247
Break the ground please buy my shirt

793
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,015
Or whatever

794
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,599
Did you hear the Trump just issued an executive order

795
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,367
Leasing all of

796
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,135
Demars.

797
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:54,559
Working on it

798
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,607
Temp today

799
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,799
Is a day to remember

800
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,591
Both the good and the bad

801
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,127
The good

802
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,687
Is the correct lease test out this prop

803
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,223
The bad is

804
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:18,367
They immediately reported with no research whatsoever that Trump was going to issue an executive order

805
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:23,231
Right right

806
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,559
Trump says he'll sign executive order Banning Birthright citizenship

807
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:29,887
Trump signs executive order saying he can fly

808
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,959
You're not making any sense

809
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:44,479
Seems like a modern

810
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,759
Simultaneously

811
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:52,159
And that's where this is no place for reality

812
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:56,511
The Forbidden we're learning about space

813
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,047
We do not need to bring

814
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,703
We've got a lot of s*** that needs sorting out here

815
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,727
That conversation

816
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,007
For Friday today

817
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
Where in space

818
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,079
So in this next clip captain

819
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,359
Very clearly

820
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:12,895
He does not

821
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,479
Which is already

822
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:19,295
But it gets much more in-depth

823
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,831
I was sleeping one night

824
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,135
Woke up

825
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:27,231
I walked out into a field

826
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,071
Or maybe 150

827
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:34,399
What's up

828
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,983
Humanoid

829
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,223
Near future

830
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,527
Harmony

831
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,135
Sort out

832
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:09,983
Play Far Away

833
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,799
Shut up

834
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,551
ABC

835
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:27,135
You know intelligence agency

836
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:35,327
Yeah

837
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:38,655
This interaction with the gray

838
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:42,751
I don't understand anybody

839
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,335
20 minutes

840
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:54,783
Few days later released later and now they're along with

841
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,439
Keep it simple

842
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,999
Australian severe

843
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,583
Series of events went down

844
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,775
Bi-Mart

845
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:18,847
Meeting with the local

846
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,127
Matt

847
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:24,479
I guess you would say to me

848
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:30,623
Temperature of Mars

849
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,119
Supported by them

850
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,543
I see alright

851
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,847
Lucas Grave Art

852
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,127
Good

853
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:58,783
They've come down and check for whatever reason

854
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:05,951
Be there while we sort things out with these silver saucer aliens

855
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:10,047
Subscribe

856
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,607
Not an abduction experience as being like

857
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:19,775
Took us up they were like you folks are going to help us out later so check that out

858
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:23,615
I don't know what the 20 minutes part is that makes it so funny

859
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:29,503
Took 20 minutes either too little or too long

860
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:30,783
Dismissive detail

861
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,879
The same time it's kind of like

862
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,415
No big deal 20 minutes

863
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:42,815
It's like you're talking about a work meeting that like kind of a nuisance playlist

864
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:49,215
Disrupted my story later we saw sure why I needed to wake up for that quote

865
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:53,567
During the day but no 20 minutes no big deal with the bad everything is

866
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:57,407
Very weird

867
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,943
It's great

868
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:02,015
Scraped she wants to know

869
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:02,783
Carrie wants to know

870
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
Captain Jay's

871
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:10,719
The question is Randy Cramer

872
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:17,631
Not personally but I remember him or I remember the whole project

873
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,039
I don't think

874
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:43,999
Find your somebody breaking the ice maybe I

875
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:46,559
Sean what happened before that

876
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,143
Things from Randy Cramer

877
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:55,519
Interview I remember I remember I remember

878
00:51:55,775 --> 00:52:00,383
Because I listen to interview

879
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:04,735
Later in the interview you'll go on to talk about how like

880
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:05,759
Randy Cramer was

881
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:08,063
Was existing in this world that was like

882
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:12,927
I stimulated fighting thing that was going on that wasn't even real

883
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,719
Or something like that

884
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,511
But also it doesn't make sense

885
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,559
It still has something

886
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:20,607
To do with the silvercraft B

887
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,679
Yeah but simulated fight Zone still has something to do with

888
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,727
Nefarious silver

889
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,799
But according to history they had already

890
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:31,615
Sorted it out by then

891
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,247
Is because they ran all these complex

892
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,015
Combat

893
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,575
Situations are they realize that this was going to go well

894
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,623
So why even bother fighting

895
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:51,839
You just sort it out anyways so you might as well just giving you the because Randy Cramer

896
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,607
Situation would have

897
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,655
Ten Years After

898
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,935
Randy Cramer

899
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:58,239
Went back in time

900
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,775
That was after him

901
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,823
And especially according to Captain

902
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,175
He makes it so clear over and over I came before

903
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:09,247
So is he sorted it out with his being

904
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:11,039
Then why is there this

905
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,831
For the stimulated fight Zone

906
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,647
It makes no sense I will tell you that

907
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,231
Further makes no sense

908
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:25,375
The idea that they had worked it out and banished silvercraft beings from the universe that were meddling

909
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,423
With the Earth and Mars

910
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,983
All this really negative stuff

911
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,543
They sorted that out in the seventies

912
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,591
And there's been no substantive difference

913
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,359
In the world

914
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:37,151
From the 70s

915
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,175
In terms of like

916
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:38,943
Some

917
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,711
Mastiff

918
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,759
Everything is better now

919
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,319
You know everything

920
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:55,839
No matter where we can never figure out where to land on the

921
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,911
Good evil alignment of these aliens

922
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,191
I mean 88

923
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:03,519
With the way he's dealing with time though like I could have been the mid-50

924
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,543
She's going to be in the midst

925
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,335
You could be wrong

926
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:15,551
On their way out they killed all the reformers on it

927
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:19,135
Maybe maybe those silvercraft beings

928
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,671
Protecting Martin Luther King

929
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,207
Rsk

930
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:26,303
They were treated silver beans

931
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:31,167
Because now we got that dead Martin Luther King jr.

932
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,959
You never know

933
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,239
F***** up I got to say

934
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:37,055
You never know

935
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:42,687
Anyway, Terry wants to know if Captain Jay's

936
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,223
And his answer

937
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,575
What

938
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,159
I really do

939
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,887
832

940
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,775
Any one of them

941
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:15,967
You saw the moon landing for the first time

942
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:21,855
That's of course you do. Proof of aliens

943
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,903
You're on the phone look at that

944
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,999
Do you know what happened

945
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:34,399
The Moon tonight they look at that I know you probably you probably pass out

946
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:38,751
Overtaken with wonderment like it would be so crazy

947
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:43,103
Ability ideas like oh my God look at that that is not proof of alien

948
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,919
Group of exactly what you're saying

949
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:54,879
It's a boon to listen to

950
00:55:55,135 --> 00:56:01,023
First person to stand on the Earth

951
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,375
That's what you have to say you're not like

952
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,727
All the goddamn movie I think it's 11

953
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:16,383
I think it was for like zero gravity type stuff sometimes physical training and that I'm sure

954
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,407
Days of it were like

955
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,431
Kool-Aid

956
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:24,831
If you breathe super heavy you're probably going to die

957
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:28,927
I also we don't want that on your text

958
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,951
To chapter 4

959
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,767
The title

960
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,119
Cuz it will play better later

961
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,167
I disagree

962
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,959
The reason so many people

963
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:42,495
Stages because

964
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,055
Just acted like you were big zimin like

965
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:50,943
Water park world of food are you shiting me

966
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:51,711
You got all soaked

967
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,479
Considerate

968
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,783
Standards of

969
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:55,551
Decorum

970
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:58,623
Didn't allow that kind of

971
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,927
Even graduated the MKUltra

972
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,327
Uno's

973
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,143
So in this neck

974
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,727
Georgia

975
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,847
I think you might be innocent

976
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,895
Jordan

977
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,455
Are you

978
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,503
I'm trying really hard and

979
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,319
Don't talk over there

980
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:34,463
Journey

981
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:38,815
I have

982
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,607
Such a fundamental problem with

983
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:41,887
The very idea

984
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:46,751
Of what he's expressing

985
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,383
The population up there

986
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,967
It has to happen

987
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:02,367
Credible

988
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:06,207
Artifact

989
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,327
Real quick I just need to make clear because

990
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,423
He didn't know if he'd ever stepped foot on the Moon

991
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,447
We're back to Mars

992
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:17,983
Typically about being on

993
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,759
Across the other side of the crater

994
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,367
Where

995
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,671
Human

996
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,047
Humanoid

997
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,495
Never seen anything like it

998
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,799
Couple people

999
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,063
Indescribable

1000
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:15,071
It would be too much

1001
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:21,471
And we ran into an Easter Island humanoid

1002
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,519
Maybe 10 or 11 ft tall

1003
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,991
Easter on guy with the hat

1004
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,295
Just like them starlings at Target

1005
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:40,159
So now we have a new alien race to consider Easter Island people

1006
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,999
The critic

1007
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,279
How they're worth

1008
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:51,679
Coronavirus

1009
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:59,103
Yes of course I remember that I will never forget that those are real people

1010
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,663
Absolutely

1011
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:07,039
Is there supposed to be like that I'd like the Easter Island carvings are actually Giant

1012
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:10,367
Lego deep underground

1013
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:15,999
I guess so yes

1014
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,535
I mean this is a fun way to

1015
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,839
Incorporate that

1016
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,399
I don't know what you call it

1017
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:29,055
Weirdo World Easter Island

1018
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,663
It is it is a piece of that

1019
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,735
To see him be the one who brings that in

1020
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:40,319
Easter Island head aliens

1021
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,855
Here's my here's my question

1022
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,927
Why is it that step

1023
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,951
3

1024
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,975
Easter Island

1025
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:50,559
I'm not sure that even wanted staff

1026
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,583
Wrote down the steps

1027
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,191
On the other side of the crater

1028
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,215
There were

1029
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,263
Right

1030
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,063
Can you solder

1031
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:19,743
What is the next step is the next Beavis centipedes

1032
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:25,375
Easter Island people

1033
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,471
Show me for a loop

1034
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,007
To see the Easter Island

1035
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,591
Further

1036
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:37,663
Weather

1037
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:40,991
When I heard that clip

1038
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,271
Be wrong

1039
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,295
Thought that like

1040
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,879
Meeting the Easter Island guy wasn't the step

1041
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,159
It was incidental

1042
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,695
I thought it was

1043
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:56,095
I thought it was something that like we did these first two steps and then we wander through the tunnel of you found any Island Man

1044
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:01,471
That's coming through the tunnel and that I like I felt something Bubba

1045
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:04,799
I told her I was like hey sorry and then it turned out to be a 20 ft tall Easter Island

1046
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:11,199
I thought that might be what he was saying I'm not entirely sure problem with the whole thing

1047
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:13,503
So when you go to Mars

1048
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:18,111
Be slowly acclimated to alien existence or else you're going to freak out

1049
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:26,047
Flying around

1050
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:28,863
Three-sided only 20 minutes

1051
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:36,287
Flying something

1052
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:42,687
Strongly disagree from the literally no reason for them to play this game of like

1053
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,991
Oh dip your toe in the water is fine

1054
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:48,575
Timetable for the Seahawks

1055
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:51,647
It kind of sounds like this whole thing is taking a couple hours

1056
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:02,655
Somewhere between

1057
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,983
Liberated

1058
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:11,359
Captain Jay's sorted out

1059
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:12,895
Because

1060
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,663
They were being

1061
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:17,759
I guess terrorized by the silver saucer

1062
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,319
That sounds good

1063
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:29,791
You can't see through the glass we see through a glass Darkly

1064
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,327
Only the Lord

1065
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,935
However you want

1066
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,007
Is the work of the Lord

1067
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:42,847
Because it helps us see about both liberation

1068
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,127
And who is he

1069
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:45,663
Silvercraft

1070
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:49,759
Liberation day

1071
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:51,039
What do you mean

1072
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:56,159
Silver saucers leaving our system

1073
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,119
Lumineux whitening for

1074
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:11,519
Tomorrow

1075
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:15,615
Talk about that later

1076
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:18,687
Mars

1077
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:29,439
Problem

1078
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:32,511
Our planet

1079
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,839
Calling them silver saucer

1080
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,655
The beans

1081
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,935
Driving those

1082
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,751
You said we're aunt

1083
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:56,319
Gravity

1084
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:05,279
What would be the mail

1085
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:11,423
Highly telepathic

1086
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:30,111
Fly with their mind

1087
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:33,183
Set the trisexual group of warm-blooded

1088
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,207
Make

1089
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,487
Wawa

1090
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:37,279
And water bears

1091
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:38,815
So

1092
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,095
Does he

1093
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,375
Is is

1094
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,911
Warm blooded

1095
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,703
Water bears are like those might

1096
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:47,775
Microscopic

1097
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,335
Yeah

1098
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:53,151
I love the idea of

1099
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,431
Actual

1100
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,111
Anytime you hear somebody with that thick Southern

1101
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,415
You're never not going to like

1102
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:08,255
Lower their estimation of

1103
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,023
Be there

1104
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:09,791
Intelligence

1105
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:16,191
But at the same time if you heard

1106
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,727
Einstein just being like

1107
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,311
There's a s*** ton of Relativity going on there

1108
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:28,735
Matter is basically energy

1109
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:29,759
Okay

1110
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,367
What you got or not

1111
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:41,279
So you're getting from this

1112
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,815
You better believe there is

1113
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:57,151
Stop listing whatever you say something stupid like there's a hole

1114
01:06:57,407 --> 01:07:00,223
Galactic

1115
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:06,623
But that's probably true like okay

1116
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,391
It is

1117
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:11,231
Listen

1118
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:14,815
There is a whole hell of a lot of radiation

1119
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:17,119
Wherever that may be

1120
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,143
Weather

1121
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:23,263
A lesbian like HomeBase

1122
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:25,567
Almost

1123
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:29,919
I thought you meant the center of the Galaxy

1124
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,735
I don't know

1125
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:37,855
I don't know that to be the case I'm just going on context clues I think he's talking about it as home base

1126
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,631
Sure

1127
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:53,471
In different parts of the Galaxy there are varying rates

1128
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,007
Radiation

1129
01:07:55,519 --> 01:08:01,663
So wherever he's talking about is the place they come from there's a lot more of it then

1130
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,199
Normal

1131
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,735
And they are a trisexual

1132
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,527
Again

1133
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,807
Really not what he's trying to say

1134
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,623
No also

1135
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,231
I want to just try and explain what

1136
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:16,255
He's talking about

1137
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,023
So

1138
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,303
He defined

1139
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,327
Gmail

1140
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,351
As the wasp

1141
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,679
Okay the males as the water bear

1142
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:27,263
And then the third gender what she doesn't really

1143
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,287
Explain order

1144
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,055
Detail at all

1145
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:37,503
I don't understand what you have trouble with you

1146
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:38,527
I don't

1147
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,087
Right right

1148
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:47,999
Sherman and the third gender is this

1149
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:54,143
United Way

1150
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:59,263
Certainly not

1151
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:01,823
Right if you want

1152
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:08,479
I don't understand the role of the snake I don't understand

1153
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:11,039
I don't know

1154
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:13,087
Based on our conception

1155
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,111
Genders

1156
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:14,879
I guess

1157
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:17,951
If you're living in a nonbinary gender

1158
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:22,303
And what you need to be living units is a trisexual gender world

1159
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,095
Where there are water bears

1160
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:26,911
I'm cool

1161
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,191
Bet

1162
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:30,495
You know I am cool

1163
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:32,031
I am

1164
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,567
I am above

1165
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,591
The

1166
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:36,639
The dichotomy of gender

1167
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:39,455
But I understand I'm very open-minded

1168
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,223
You are so

1169
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,271
Very open-minded

1170
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:50,719
Is so

1171
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,535
Not where I'm coming from

1172
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:57,631
Coming from a place of bees are analog

1173
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,679
Of different species

1174
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,447
He's on Earth

1175
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:02,751
I don't get how a

1176
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:03,519
Wasp

1177
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:06,591
Mates with a water bear what is their offspring is it

1178
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:09,407
Either a wasp or a waterbed

1179
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:15,807
How is that possible if a wasp and a water bear mate and ask

1180
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,879
Let me ask you a question

1181
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,671
Here's what

1182
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,951
Not this is

1183
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,487
The problem with this whole

1184
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,279
Carrie doesn't know enough

1185
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:31,423
Why are you thinking and assuming that they make when they're in there fully adult

1186
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,215
That's a great question

1187
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:40,383
Look younger larval stage maybe they made they cross-pollinate and then they

1188
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:41,407
Grove

1189
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:45,759
A water snake

1190
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:52,927
Those three things could come from the same

1191
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,767
Right draw the face

1192
01:10:57,023 --> 01:11:00,351
I do know that yes yeah I do

1193
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,631
Lego

1194
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,935
Everybody starts out like in Skyrim on this

1195
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:10,591
Okay for this alien

1196
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:11,871
Video

1197
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:12,895
Okay

1198
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:18,271
Reasonable to land.

1199
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,063
Complete

1200
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,343
Bizarre nonsense

1201
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:23,391
The reason why I

1202
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,183
The reason why just sticks in my

1203
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:25,951
Micro

1204
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:27,231
That like

1205
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:27,999
These are

1206
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:30,047
Gender expression

1207
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:32,863
You know in the same way as like

1208
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,399
Do you know

1209
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,167
Crossville

1210
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
The Spectre

1211
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,727
Gender expression

1212
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:39,263
Identity

1213
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,055
Experience

1214
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,079
We're also human

1215
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,615
With this

1216
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,407
Water bears

1217
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:49,759
Are all worms an insect

1218
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:54,111
One of them is a microorganism right and the other is a reptile

1219
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:57,183
Very different species

1220
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:00,767
Here's the actual you understand why it's not

1221
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:01,791
It's very

1222
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,399
That actually makes

1223
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,167
Way Morrison

1224
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,447
Please walk me through

1225
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,263
The reason

1226
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,031
Is that

1227
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,311
When we

1228
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,335
Disgust

1229
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,871
Every bias

1230
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:18,175
As we have towards alien well

1231
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,711
If we ever get in contact

1232
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:22,015
They're going to be essentially us

1233
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:26,879
We can't genuinely care about something that he's at

1234
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,695
Because it's so far outside of our experience

1235
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:34,047
Right makes more sense for them to Waterbury

1236
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:36,351
And steaks out in the middle of f******

1237
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,375
Space bulshit

1238
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,167
Then it does for them to just be like

1239
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:43,519
Two dudes who look like us but they're a little bit wacky which is what Carrie like

1240
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:49,919
Genelec humanoid beings

1241
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:52,991
Imagination on so many of the comment

1242
01:12:57,343 --> 01:13:01,183
Superintelligence face paintings flew B-52 bombers

1243
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:07,583
You don't like this guy

1244
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:10,911
A a is capable of reaching that they're not

1245
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:18,335
It is absolutely ludicrous and I hate it but come on man this is good stuff

1246
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,663
We talked about

1247
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,199
The nature of liberation

1248
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,479
Then I was like

1249
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,015
Mars by Kona

1250
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,647
Most of the time whenever we have these

1251
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,927
Come on

1252
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:36,767
Space Valor

1253
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,375
And what's super interesting about

1254
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,911
Captain Jay's

1255
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:45,983
Is as we've already sort of talked

1256
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,775
About there's no fighting fall

1257
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:53,919
There's not even there's not even really an exertion

1258
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,199
There's no

1259
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,223
Threats or anything

1260
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:56,991
Sing like that

1261
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:57,759
Alyssa

1262
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:01,087
The language

1263
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,647
Before we go any further

1264
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,927
Let me give you this

1265
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,207
All right here we go

1266
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,767
The water bear

1267
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:09,791
Wasp

1268
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,583
Snake triumvirate

1269
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:13,631
Trisexual

1270
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:17,727
The evolved separately on a planet where there were millions of death

1271
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:21,567
When on Olive

1272
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,335
Macy's began

1273
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:25,151
AAA going through this

1274
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,455
And only these three

1275
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,479
Is recognized

1276
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:33,343
They needed to survive in because of the way that they were reproducing didn't make any

1277
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:35,647
They decided to come together they created

1278
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:37,951
Combinator and then

1279
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:44,351
Every time they want to reproduce what they all do is put a little bit of their own DNA into the genetic recombination

1280
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:46,143
Bellator

1281
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,679
Problem solved

1282
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:49,471
Spine done

1283
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:51,519
Staryu

1284
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,311
You hit my Syfy nerd boner

1285
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,335
MX Player

1286
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,895
We find out about what happened

1287
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,199
Deliberation

1288
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:03,039
Can you tell me

1289
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:15,839
Persuaded

1290
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:28,383
Something you can destroy

1291
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:33,247
They are too powerful

1292
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:38,367
Are you intelligent

1293
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:48,095
Anything else

1294
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,375
Absolutely

1295
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:54,239
Funny written on Mars

1296
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:59,103
The brave

1297
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:02,175
Whatever

1298
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:04,223
Humanoid

1299
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,743
Talking Tom

1300
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:20,863
They are

1301
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,143
AR

1302
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,751
Oriole

1303
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:34,943
Dominion

1304
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:37,759
So

1305
01:16:55,935 --> 01:17:01,311
Because

1306
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:03,103
You don't have a planet

1307
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:11,039
All to themselves

1308
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:13,087
Admission regarding God

1309
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:18,975
Yeah yeah there's a real fundamental issue here with like they are overpowered

1310
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:25,375
To excessive degree they can control psionically all of these other aliens

1311
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:29,215
Only race in our solar system with weaponized

1312
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:29,983
Ships

1313
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:36,383
Yeah but you just go up there and have a little chat and you spoiled their fun you can't

1314
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,687
Grab them but you can spoil their fun

1315
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,711
You keep saying

1316
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:42,271
Spoil their fun

1317
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,039
I'm like I don't

1318
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:47,903
You scold them and they leave

1319
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,583
What

1320
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:57,887
Silvercrest

1321
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:02,239
What's what is an estimated IQ of

1322
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:05,567
I don't think I mean

1323
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,687
That's a failure

1324
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,647
IQ test

1325
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,927
I have a implicit culture

1326
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,719
Surabaya

1327
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:24,255
500 IQ.

1328
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,815
They're the whitest

1329
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,351
Whatever exists

1330
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,375
The maximum IQ

1331
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:31,935
Who gives a s***

1332
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:36,543
The point of imagination artificial standard of

1333
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,311
Intelligence

1334
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,335
First of all

1335
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,615
I meant technical interim

1336
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,663
Triple scale

1337
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:42,943
Doesn't go above like

1338
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:43,967
200 right

1339
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:48,831
Don't people just talk about like the greatest Geniuses being like 17

1340
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:51,391
There is

1341
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,231
Miss actually

1342
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:02,655
Tested

1343
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:12,383
Actually actually that was what's going on

1344
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:17,247
Could be

1345
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,783
Read

1346
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:22,111
Gladiator

1347
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,439
Group going to another job

1348
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:26,719
The Galaxy

1349
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:29,791
It also makes them seem like they just like

1350
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:34,143
Pranks it doesn't seem like when you're using the language of like

1351
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,167
There's

1352
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:37,727
Funwa spoiled really doesn't make

1353
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:38,751
Seem like you're eating

1354
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,799
Right

1355
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:48,223
Putting banana peels around

1356
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,527
That you would get bored to the point where you're just like

1357
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:55,391
Like what other explanation is there for

1358
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,159
The s*** that

1359
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:57,439
People ascribe to God

1360
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:59,743
Ladies an overpowered

1361
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:03,583
Bored bored

1362
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,399
God prank

1363
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:09,471
Ghost

1364
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,263
Goes through

1365
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,031
The Aquaman

1366
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,311
Process

1367
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,848
Easter Island

1368
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,384
That's part of it

1369
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,408
And then he goes

1370
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,432
Deep underground

1371
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:19,968
Will you find some

1372
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:25,088
Communicating

1373
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,648
Right

1374
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:28,928
And is

1375
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:29,952
Variable

1376
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:35,584
When did Ender's Game come out

1377
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,424
I'm sure

1378
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,192
Said

1379
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:41,216
The way he

1380
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,776
So bizarre

1381
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,848
I love on one level but also think

1382
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,672
He's going to give you the history of Mars

1383
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,008
The first

1384
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:18,336
Serious Silent Communication and I had

1385
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:19,616
Why

1386
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:23,712
Getting in

1387
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:32,160
Presents

1388
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,768
I don't know you

1389
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,048
Into

1390
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,936
Attaches to their stored

1391
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:46,240
Memories

1392
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:48,032
I have records going back

1393
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:53,920
Beginning and that's why I'm not afraid to come out with any of this information is all because

1394
01:21:56,224 --> 01:22:00,832
Put the f****** hospital for yourself

1395
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:04,416
You're going back

1396
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:12,352
That was the name

1397
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:16,448
Immediately after the great cataclysm was almost

1398
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:19,520
This'll take

1399
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:29,504
Significant events and then head to years in another year

1400
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,648
Melding together of 15 years

1401
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,184
A good man's life

1402
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,720
On that

1403
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:41,792
Give me

1404
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:42,560
Telepathic

1405
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,840
Psionic memories

1406
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,144
You are the character

1407
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,424
It's so good

1408
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:51,008
You are actually looking out for the character

1409
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,056
This to me seems like

1410
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,080
Something like a

1411
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,616
Melding of

1412
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:57,664
Albert Brooks movies

1413
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,688
Defending Your Life

1414
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:03,296
Oh yeah that's a HP Lovecraft story Shadow out of

1415
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:10,720
Don't forget the matrix's little like throw throw

1416
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,000
2 seconds

1417
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:19,168
Really throwing me off

1418
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:22,496
It really bumming me out

1419
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:25,312
You've turned on it

1420
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,152
Okay so

1421
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:32,480
This technology where you put the helmet on

1422
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:34,016
And then you get to see everything

1423
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,040
They want to tell you

1424
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:41,440
The helmet specifically designed for a human head despite the fact that until now

1425
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:43,744
I've never needed a

1426
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,280
Humanoid heads are probably pretty

1427
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,632
Similar to Cranium

1428
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:52,448
Baseball cap that can like

1429
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:54,752
Expander

1430
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:57,568
Deflect

1431
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:58,336
Fiber

1432
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:02,176
Okay that works at that party

1433
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:04,480
Clothes on that one

1434
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:10,880
Lee is at 1

1435
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:15,232
Flexi helmet history

1436
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,000
Show you

1437
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,816
Not a problem that I have is

1438
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:20,352
The only saw 50

1439
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:23,168
Years of one person's memories

1440
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:28,800
And not all of them just major that blur together

1441
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,080
Maybe a little baby

1442
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,128
Idea that it was

1443
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:32,896
After the

1444
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:36,224
Cataclysm on Earth never specified with that

1445
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,248
Which one

1446
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,272
Through punch

1447
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,624
Pleasant

1448
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,416
The only thing that I would guess

1449
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:46,720
Because he never spells

1450
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:48,000
Is it

1451
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:52,352
Anti silver saucer alien prop

1452
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,120
Buganda

1453
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,912
Like

1454
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:55,936
It's

1455
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,472
Is it like

1456
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:02,848
Like Noah's flood or whatever was caused by the

1457
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,664
Like he gets to put this helmet on and then

1458
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:06,688
Experiences

1459
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,968
The life of someone who died in

1460
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:10,528
That's like the alien

1461
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:11,808
Who called

1462
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:16,928
No I'm stretching real hard so I'm really not following him at all

1463
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:21,024
But this one

1464
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:26,912
I'm going to save it doesn't make any sense Dan also I want more than 15 years is

1465
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:28,448
I want more than one

1466
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:29,728
Perspective

1467
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:32,288
If we romantic definitely don't want

1468
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:36,384
One person's perspective over 15 years but actually it's like

1469
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,456
Few moments melded together

1470
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:42,016
Spitballing

1471
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,552
Technology

1472
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,576
Have the Matrix

1473
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:45,856
Respect

1474
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,648
Why not

1475
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,720
Just like why does it have to take an hour for you to get

1476
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:51,744
15 years

1477
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:59,168
What is this

1478
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:00,704
This is so yummy

1479
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:04,288
It should be as fast as the brain function

1480
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,312
U.s. Bank

1481
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,336
Oh man

1482
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,640
This is like

1483
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:11,712
Has a governor

1484
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:17,088
I'm going full speed but he's he's running

1485
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:18,368
But he just can't run fast

1486
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,184
Inspection is you

1487
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,976
You can't break your own rules

1488
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,256
Do you know what I mean

1489
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,304
Like when you're writing a science fiction

1490
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,608
Sure you got faster-than-light travel or whatever

1491
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:33,472
But that has to be like a brick veneer f****** around

1492
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:36,288
You know whatever rules you establish in your fake

1493
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:37,568
Science fiction

1494
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:40,896
Are fine as long as you adhere to those

1495
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:42,176
The same way that

1496
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:42,944
We're supposed

1497
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,480
Yeah

1498
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:48,064
Thumbs down

1499
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,600
Comes down to this guy Dan

1500
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,440
You going to roller coaster with Captain

1501
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,072
Carrie is on board

1502
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,096
Dislike

1503
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,120
Part of it is

1504
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:01,888
Because

1505
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:02,656
He is Porter

1506
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:05,984
Silver saucer evil aliens

1507
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:06,752
As

1508
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:07,520
These supposed

1509
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:08,288
Radian

1510
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,568
And next

1511
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:18,016
Anthony other creatures

1512
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:21,600
Communicate with you with you

1513
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:28,256
City challenge long involved

1514
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:32,352
However

1515
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,680
So-called play in races

1516
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:43,360
Lottery

1517
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:45,152
Just be standing there going

1518
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:54,112
Sub-Zero

1519
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:54,880
Supposed

1520
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,440
Pleiadians he's silver saucer aliens

1521
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:59,744
Much more powerful psionic

1522
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,512
Cabela's

1523
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:02,304
Without

1524
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,096
Deflect fiber helmet

1525
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,656
Now have a trademark

1526
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:16,640
Compact email.

1527
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:18,944
So yeah the end that he scoffs

1528
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:21,504
That is amazing

1529
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:22,528
Like

1530
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:25,088
You got a magic carriers Stewart

1531
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,416
You your ass

1532
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,184
Cancel

1533
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,304
Marquez

1534
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,840
Most of the lake

1535
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:36,864
Queens most of the

1536
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,144
Space Visa

1537
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:38,912
Oviraptor

1538
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:44,800
All of the channel the material

1539
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:47,104
That you get from all these weirdos

1540
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,128
They've been going on for

1541
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:48,896
Years and years

1542
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,968
A lot of them

1543
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:53,248
Lightbringer

1544
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:54,016
Do you like

1545
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:55,552
There is this mythology

1546
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,112
Time to give us

1547
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:00,160
Bredemann

1548
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:04,512
Identify the sentence the order of species but why

1549
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,816
Is that just from the the Greek

1550
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,352
What you mean

1551
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:14,752
Is there some sort of connection there white

1552
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:17,824
PPL Center on that one is being there Bringers of light

1553
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:19,360
I think

1554
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,384
Because

1555
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:22,176
Nordic

1556
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:22,944
Alien

1557
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:29,600
If I had to guess just cutting through the b******* is a version of manifest

1558
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:30,880
Or space race

1559
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:35,744
Is a version of it they are the most similar to white people

1560
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,536
And therefore

1561
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:38,816
Cast in the role of

1562
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:44,192
I need that that's racist already took over space before we even got there

1563
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:47,776
So

1564
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:49,312
Unsurprising

1565
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:51,872
Yurt

1566
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:52,896
Races races

1567
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:55,456
Britta mean all of these people like

1568
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:56,992
If we if we cut

1569
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:59,040
Talking about like

1570
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:00,576
The science fiction writing

1571
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:04,416
And we actually just deal with it as adults

1572
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,024
These people are just telling stories

1573
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:10,304
With

1574
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:11,840
The characters

1575
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:13,888
That are extravagant

1576
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:14,912
Some ways

1577
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:18,496
And all not all

1578
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:19,776
Because Captain Jay's

1579
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:20,800
Is kind of an anomaly

1580
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:22,592
1 reasons why this

1581
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:27,200
95%

1582
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:28,480
Alien

1583
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:29,760
Stuff that you end

1584
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,064
Cast Pleiadians

1585
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,160
Scotch and they are always

1586
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:37,440
Describe

1587
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,208
Nordic

1588
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,256
Taller than us

1589
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,304
Angelic White

1590
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:46,912
Because all of the p

1591
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,192
Actuated

1592
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,472
Stories

1593
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:52,288
Boring

1594
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:56,896
Ono lightly

1595
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:57,920
Creative but not

1596
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:58,688
Creative enough

1597
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:04,064
Write something good

1598
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:05,344
Who's okay

1599
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:09,184
Racist

1600
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:13,536
You don't care

1601
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:15,072
Inhibition

1602
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:16,608
On your creativity

1603
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:17,888
Just like these people

1604
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:18,656
Generally

1605
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,776
Not good

1606
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:28,384
Yeah you were talking about earlier the idea of like this is where you live

1607
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,176
Your creativity

1608
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:31,200
They get to a point

1609
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,224
Can't go further

1610
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:34,016
Next up is a convention

1611
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:35,552
Lutheran witch

1612
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:39,392
And they allowed their personal biases

1613
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,160
2

1614
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:41,952
You're in ways that they

1615
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:42,976
Otherwise couldn't

1616
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:44,000
Express them public

1617
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:44,768
Probably

1618
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:46,304
So in this next

1619
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,888
Yes Cassidy

1620
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:50,656
What about her

1621
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:51,936
Whataburger

1622
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:53,472
Is about the military

1623
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,008
She always

1624
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:58,336
The idea that people are in

1625
01:31:58,592 --> 01:31:59,104
Military

1626
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,384
Because

1627
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:02,944
The military

1628
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:06,784
Services secrets

1629
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:10,624
And what more

1630
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,208
What do you think

1631
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:16,768
Every single person that

1632
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:18,048
But she has who are like

1633
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:19,840
Underworld

1634
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:21,632
Military

1635
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:23,936
Randy Cramer

1636
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:24,960
Keystone middle

1637
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:27,008
Sponsor

1638
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,032
In the military

1639
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:30,592
Captain Mark Richards

1640
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:31,360
Military

1641
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:32,384
Video

1642
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:34,688
Doing this 30-year bed to life

1643
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:35,712
Prison

1644
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:38,784
Because he's still part of it and yeah

1645
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:39,808
All of the

1646
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:41,088
Everything has to

1647
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:42,368
Considered

1648
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,648
Within

1649
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:44,672
The

1650
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,440
The world

1651
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:46,208
Review of

1652
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,792
That's a really good point

1653
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:57,984
8-bit like begs the question

1654
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:07,712
Kind of

1655
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:09,760
Hardcore

1656
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:13,088
Militaristic it's interesting I don't know enough

1657
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:14,880
About her family of origin

1658
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:17,696
My actual like

1659
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:19,744
Deep research time on more productive

1660
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,280
I don't know

1661
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,816
I don't want to do more for.

1662
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:24,352
I would save it

1663
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:26,656
She probably has

1664
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:27,936
A very

1665
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:28,960
Strong app

1666
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:32,288
Wow also being

1667
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:38,688
Part is the like I believe

1668
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:40,992
Space aliens

1669
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,808
Imaginary

1670
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:44,576
Authority

1671
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:45,856
And then

1672
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:48,928
It all lives within the world of

1673
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,768
I only really believe people who pretend to be part of the military

1674
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:55,072
Yeah so I don't I don't know if

1675
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:56,608
It's tough to say where it comes from

1676
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:00,448
I do want to break the Goldwater rule by psychoanalyzing

1677
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:01,728
But

1678
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:04,032
He wants she wants a fascist

1679
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:07,872
Dominator she just doesn't want the

1680
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:09,152
Perhaps

1681
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:11,456
Truliant of all the

1682
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,736
These whistleblowers that

1683
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:13,504
Richie have

1684
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:17,088
They all pretend that they were deeply involved

1685
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:19,648
XYZ organization

1686
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:25,280
Whatever records that organization

1687
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:29,376
Deep deep Secret

1688
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:30,656
Records that you're never going

1689
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:39,104
I probably am the most important person to write me and my dad to Dutchman we even though I was over at all

1690
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,128
Stanford over again

1691
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:43,200
Yeah

1692
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:45,248
Like Hiram

1693
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:47,040
No like the highest

1694
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:53,440
Like I said she's never had that she's always had somebody who's like that no one who's been looking to order

1695
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:57,536
Of course you don't you don't you don't f*** around with noncommissioned officers

1696
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:01,888
That just makes perfect sense that goes all the way back to her West Point

1697
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:03,680
All of this

1698
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:04,704
Is just a service

1699
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,472
Reduction

1700
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:07,264
To this next

1701
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:08,800
Where it really is

1702
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:10,592
Seems like Captain

1703
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,432
Like

1704
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:16,480
He's not even expressing bit like this

1705
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:17,504
Trip to Mars

1706
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:19,040
Quotes sordid

1707
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,088
Nothing

1708
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:22,112
The

1709
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,416
That was just a graze coming and picking

1710
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:26,720
You are the person

1711
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:27,744
Took about 20 minutes

1712
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:28,768
Did you

1713
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:30,048
Commanding officer

1714
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,352
Absolutely not

1715
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:36,704
We had no radio contact with anyone other than our Pilots

1716
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:46,432
Round document

1717
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,992
No we were just to come back and debrief

1718
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:59,232
Diplomat associated with the greys have chosen

1719
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:03,328
He doesn't know when he's answering

1720
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:05,632
Who are the other people on this f****** s***

1721
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:07,424
It makes absolutely no sense

1722
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,704
Four carries worldview

1723
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:09,472
Because it's

1724
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:10,240
Space Program

1725
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:13,568
Analyzing its government doing all the

1726
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:14,336
These black

1727
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:17,408
Operations right

1728
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:20,224
Liberate Mars

1729
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:20,992
And I did it

1730
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:22,272
Basically solo

1731
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:27,648
Like we didn't have any military training now I am bored with his grace

1732
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:33,536
Because they realize that if you wanted to go with somebody who is the political machine

1733
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:38,144
You're going to wind up having to go through all this red tape and you're going to get a lot of people

1734
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,960
Do you grab this guy who you know has a

1735
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:41,728
Good

1736
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:42,752
F****** hard

1737
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,032
Which is all you need

1738
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,944
I don't I like

1739
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:54,016
What I like about this is that you have some

1740
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:55,552
Who is so different

1741
01:36:56,064 --> 01:37:00,416
And all of her other guy

1742
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:01,184
And she hate

1743
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:05,792
Ludacris already visible

1744
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:06,560
This is

1745
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:07,584
Convoluted

1746
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:10,400
She is not having a good time with

1747
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:12,704
Because he's presenting like this

1748
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:13,728
Experience which is just

1749
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:15,776
Motherfuking right

1750
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,848
And I will tell you the grades are pretty

1751
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:19,872
They came

1752
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:22,432
Mars

1753
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:24,224
Military

1754
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:32,928
Easter Island

1755
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:37,792
They're great pretty cool. Like a civilian-led governor

1756
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:40,352
No she doesn't feel like it's not like

1757
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:41,120
She doesn't

1758
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:42,144
Like someone

1759
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:47,008
Doesn't have a clear up

1760
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:47,776
Chosen

1761
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:48,800
By the

1762
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:50,080
Call Nick boscia

1763
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:52,640
Dude

1764
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:53,408
But

1765
01:37:53,920 --> 01:38:00,064
Not all of her other guests have only fomented more pain and Terror

1766
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:02,624
Is the first guidance

1767
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,976
I forgot, Rogue

1768
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:11,328
Adult around the universe

1769
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,608
Sorting shootout

1770
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:14,656
Yes

1771
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:16,704
Carrie is

1772
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:17,984
Enjoying this

1773
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:20,544
Clearly seen

1774
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,592
And so towards

1775
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:23,360
This point

1776
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,384
She's

1777
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:27,712
And she's like

1778
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:33,344
She doesn't in an hour in this whole interviews only

1779
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:36,416
Which is short for summer

1780
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:39,744
Do I have other things

1781
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:42,304
And she keeps interrupting

1782
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:44,864
He I will say is one of the

1783
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:45,632
The people who

1784
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:46,912
Is the most

1785
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:49,216
Loquacious

1786
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,288
Like he just will do

1787
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:54,080
10 minute long

1788
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:59,712
Song

1789
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:05,088
It was amazing

1790
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,112
Went over and

1791
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:11,744
Because they don't construct things

1792
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,816
Talk about spirits

1793
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,656
Security has to keep interrupting

1794
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:19,680
When she wants to end

1795
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:23,776
The show

1796
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:25,568
But

1797
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,336
She does end

1798
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,616
Couple questions

1799
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:30,944
The audience

1800
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:33,248
I'm sorry to interrupt you here

1801
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:41,440
I do have a very small

1802
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,976
Questions in the chat

1803
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,792
One person wants to know

1804
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:47,328
Percent

1805
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,168
Okay cool

1806
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:54,496
Check that one off

1807
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:58,336
Boring question

1808
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:04,224
Another person

1809
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:09,856
No reason I just think it looks more like

1810
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:26,496
Malibu

1811
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:40,064
I won't argue based on movies and like

1812
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:45,696
Too far away from the camera

1813
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:48,512
He has like a webcam setup that is a

1814
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:49,280
Good like

1815
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:55,680
Feet away from

1816
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:57,472
But it's not a good I can't

1817
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:03,872
Man look like a pirate

1818
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:12,832
Dollar Tree

1819
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,000
So those are the questions

1820
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:20,768
And then

1821
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,048
Rienzi energy

1822
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:23,840
Soft

1823
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:27,680
Thank you very much

1824
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:32,288
Sharing your testimony with us today

1825
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:38,176
This is as I say very impromptu and

1826
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:40,224
Information

1827
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:40,992
Time

1828
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:44,320
Perhaps there will be in the future

1829
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:47,648
And we'll just kind of

1830
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:50,976
That is exactly what you said to begin

1831
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,048
Which is there is no way to prove any of it but

1832
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:55,328
You can sort it sound like

1833
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:59,168
If they're gone better she wouldn't have ended it with I'd like to remind you

1834
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:02,240
He's talking about

1835
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,288
Yeah it's fun

1836
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,568
Maybe this is

1837
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,848
Maybe this is a

1838
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:08,640
Halloween episode

1839
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:11,200
Because Carrie is dressed up as someone

1840
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:12,992
Who actually is questioning

1841
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:14,272
Want some

1842
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:16,832
Maybe maybe it is

1843
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,368
Analog

1844
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:24,768
I just don't know how

1845
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:27,328
On the one hand

1846
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:30,144
He's so far been my favorite

1847
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:31,168
Project

1848
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:33,216
Well I mean the running isn't

1849
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:35,008
Like it's not a deep crew

1850
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:37,312
Like who do you have to pull for

1851
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:43,712
Well what's the racist murderer the guy who was

1852
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:46,272
P.m. in Britain

1853
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:50,112
Was he Diamond Parks was he on the show or was he just meant

1854
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:53,184
Well he's up

1855
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:54,720
I like him

1856
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:57,536
I don't know

1857
01:42:57,792 --> 01:43:00,608
It seems like his policy positions were great he's not

1858
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:05,216
Alien once every four months

1859
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:07,008
He's not as bigoted

1860
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:07,776
As some of

1861
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,056
The other folks

1862
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:12,640
This guy doesn't

1863
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,432
I don't know

1864
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:16,736
Is bigoted but I don't know where to

1865
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:18,272
Who and why

1866
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:22,368
Do you know what I'm saying when you get done

1867
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:23,392
Beginning of the show

1868
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:25,440
Expressing

1869
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,208
At least

1870
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:28,768
Metaphorically be more Progressive

1871
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:31,840
So many of these other guests

1872
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:33,120
And Carrie hates

1873
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:36,704
Seems to say something

1874
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:37,728
Seems like it

1875
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:39,264
I don't know because we can

1876
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:41,056
The world of metaphor

1877
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:43,360
I don't know what conclusion you can draw

1878
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:47,200
What is endlessly fascinating

1879
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:48,224
Whenever we goes

1880
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:48,992
Through all of

1881
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:51,040
These guys and how they feel about

1882
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:51,808
Races

1883
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:53,088
Like they all

1884
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:54,112
All of them

1885
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:58,464
When an alien race is involved they all have hard-and-fast position

1886
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:06,144
The races are good and entire races are bad

1887
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,704
Uniform

1888
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,472
Tickets given to

1889
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,640
You might think similarly

1890
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:18,688
Theater

1891
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:19,968
Sure

1892
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:25,856
But this guy is he even his racist things like the all the pleadings you think you're playing

1893
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:29,696
And they're bad but even then they're like

1894
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:31,232
They're like a badass

1895
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:34,560
Like his is description of all of this s*** is

1896
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:38,144
Is very non-committal towards an actual race of beings

1897
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,936
Being good or bad

1898
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:42,496
Or even like even his

1899
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:43,264
His worst

1900
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,544
Characterization

1901
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,312
Was

1902
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:53,760
You know like the infinitely powerful and have no problem

1903
01:44:56,064 --> 01:45:00,928
We talked to them and I couldn't have their phone

1904
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:01,952
I don't I

1905
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:04,000
If there are space

1906
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,304
Politics

1907
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,328
That's better version

1908
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:10,912
I appreciate it

1909
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:14,240

1945
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:34,016
I don't think our voices

1947
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:38,624

They are the octopus ride for on your room nro

1952

Dia ansar we can't legally listen to this without hookah so

1953
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:24,704
They are the octopus

1954
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:31,104
Are any world yours secret space all worlds

1955
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:36,736
Are yours except for Europa

1956
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:42,112
That's a big reveal the big reveal

1957
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:47,744
Going to go to Europa the only world I want is Europa

1958
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,072
Never come up on the show before

1959

01:48:58,496 --> 01:49:03,872
She burned that material on this album

1962
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:06,176
All worlds are yours

1963
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:07,456
Except Europa

1964
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:12,320
Like what world is Europa

1965
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:15,648

1966
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:19,744
Nail gun to the Head

1967
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,792
That's a harsh title

1968
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:25,632
What's going on

1969
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:36,640
Do all prospective whistleblowers get out while you still can

1970
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:43,040
Ensure

1971
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:49,440
The banker hits are being done by the bad guys to keep the men from stinging after they slipped

1972
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:55,840
During prosecution investigations

1973
01:49:56,096 --> 01:50:02,240
Cstl fed guy discovered

1974
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:08,640
Afforded

1975
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:15,040
Before he sang again

1976
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:21,440
Didn't know what I'm made of

1977
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:22,720
Vatican connection

1978
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:29,120
On massive Forex fraud that unclear which is bigger

1979
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:35,520
Vatican linked to Narco money or links for axial broadsoft out

1980
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:40,384
Protocol

1981
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,344
Instrumental

1982
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:51,136
Serviceable

1983
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:57,536
Eerily eerily similar to The xx album I'm new here

1984
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:01,120
Gil Scott-Heron spoken word

1985
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:02,912
And then just put beads underneath

1986
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:04,192
Eerily similar to the

1987
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:05,728
Slightly different

1988
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:09,824
Contact whoever says that a rat done bit

1989
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,872
Better sister.

1990
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:16,992
Iraq

1991
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:19,552
The government Etc

1992
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,344
This is

1993
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,112
So while

1994
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:23,904
I'm just

1995
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:24,672
Almost

1996
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:26,464
It's not worse

1997
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,024
I think it's terrible

1998
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:32,096
But only because

1999
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:33,376
The combination of all of it

2000
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:34,144
Parts

2001
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,168
Like I think

2002
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:35,936
I could

2003
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:37,472
Loki

2004
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:39,264
Mellow vibe

2005
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:40,288
Some of the

2006
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:41,056
Imitation

2007
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:43,104
And also if it wasn't

2008
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:45,408
Kerry Cassidy

2009
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:51,296
I think I could put up with

2010
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:58,464
Full disclosure like those kind of like

2011
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:04,096
Ambience

2012
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:06,144
Makes

2013
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:09,216
It makes sense I don't think this is terrible I really don't

2014
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:11,008
I will see if you enjoy this

2015
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:14,848
The next track is actually space Clinic nail gun to the Head

2016
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:16,896
Milk

2017
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:19,968
Play the next song

2018
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:23,552
This is AI battle

2019
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:24,576
Okay

2020
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:32,256
That is real Titanic into the Vatican play Hamid

2021
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:17,056
List of all George Bush Senior or modular

2022
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:23,456
Market-based in Tanzania

2023
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:29,856
Return to Earth

2024
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:36,000
Dark nobility are anything's

2025
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:40,608
If it was kardinal offishall I'm going to be pissed off

2026
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:47,008
Someone on the track and it doesn't say who is God

2027
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:48,288
Also know that he will do

2028
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:50,080
Anythink still show up anyway

2029
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:55,200
Isn't that song with Colby odonis

2030
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:56,480
Oh yeah

2031
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:03,392
Carrie

2032
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:08,768
Shari

2033
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:13,120
So this last track hear the album

2034
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:13,888
Closer

2035
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,936
Call Humanity get off your knees

2036
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:26,176
Understanding What You're Made Of is key to understanding what are true potential is

2037
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:32,064
Once you realize this and child is father to the man

2038
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:38,464
If you're not feel everybody

2039
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:41,280
From the early 2000s

2040
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:47,936
The father of man is also an album by the by Blood Sweat and Tears

2041
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:52,544
Seems like opium in Goleta

2042
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:55,616
Like this seems to me like you got to be like

2043
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:57,408
Real on

2044
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,480
Debilitating absolutely

2045
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:07,136
Becomes much more real but that is we may end up being

2046
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:13,536
Their teachers rather than the other way around humanity is engine

2047
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:19,936
Experiment Library

2048
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:26,336
Damn right

2049
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:32,736
You believe it is likely even greater than the sum of a part

2050
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:39,136
Our potential is unlimited as a result

2051
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:45,536
Recognize who you are and begin to push the envelope above your potentiality

2052
01:55:58,592 --> 01:55:59,616
Hayward

2053
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:03,456
I think that's a great Bass

2054
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:06,272
Pictures of Proclaim it

2055
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:10,880
Only listen to this sample

2056
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:14,720
I guarantee if you had to sit around Elizabeth for half an hour you probably

2057
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:18,560
Lessa half hour

2058
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:19,328
That's too long

2059
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:21,632
Each of those tracks we only heard about 1

2060
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:24,448
Too long

2061
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:25,984
The 36-minute album

2062
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:26,752
6 track

2063
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:32,640
No I can see her

2064
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:35,712
Putting out an already to Blue Note album

2065
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:38,016
It's interesting that you did that in 2014

2066
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:39,808
And is not

2067
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:40,832
Ventured back

2068
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:42,368
The Waters of muse

2069
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:45,440
Nor is he mentioned it on the show

2070
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:50,816
Fraser

2071
01:56:51,584 --> 01:56:52,096
Call God

2072
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:54,144
If I were her

2073
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:57,216
That would be the thing I would be most crap.

2074
01:56:57,728 --> 01:57:01,824
I think that I've heard a lot of like a albums by people who have no business make

2075
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:03,104
Music

2076
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:04,128
Like you're like a

2077
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:04,896
Joe Pesci

2078
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:07,456
Call Nathan music

2079
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:13,344
Actors who has made music

2080
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:14,112
And like

2081
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:15,392
You listen to that you like

2082
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:18,208
What are you doing

2083
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:18,976
What are you doing

2084
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:24,608
I will I will come with you as far as I'm going to accept

2085
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:29,216
You should come with us and leave your world behind

2086
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,032
Music

2087
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:34,848
Good good on her apron

2088
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:36,640
It's not bad then we will

2089
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:41,248
This will be our eternal struggle was producing that album

2090
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,552
Knew exactly what

2091
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:50,976
She was working with exactly what they were working

2092
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:55,328
Stupid you are willing to Elementary

2093
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:56,864
Let's make sure that this

2094
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:57,888
F******

2095
01:57:58,144 --> 01:57:59,168
Vibes

2096
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:03,264
And let's not worry about anything beyond that

2097
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:07,104
Who's going to live or die by her

2098
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:08,896
So what happened

2099
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:09,664
Non-essential

2100
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:11,200
I'm just

2101
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:14,784
As mellow and just whatever is possible

2102
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:16,832
I meant to throw her weirdness on it

2103
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:21,696
Let's not on me I was just on their website I still don't remember what that guy's name is

2104
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:28,096
Who did all the music

2105
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:34,496
Let me tell you something I look it up it's on

2106
01:58:34,752 --> 01:58:37,056
Multi-instrumentalist

2107
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:41,664

Nice break for

2115
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:08,032
From reality a little bit but

2116
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:10,080
With our next episode

2117
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:13,152
Whatever it is

2118
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:15,968
Materiality

2119
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:16,992
Maybe

2120
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:18,272
Covid-19

2121
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:24,672
I couldn't even sell myself on that anyway Weaver website.com

2122
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:31,072
I'm not on that one

2123
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:33,632
About Facebook

2124
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:36,704
Tell your mother you're brilliant

2125
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:37,728
Backgrounds free

2126
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:38,496

2127
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:41,312
I do Avail myself of

2128
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:44,640
You can leave a review

2129
01:59:44,896 --> 01:59:45,408
Describe

2130
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:48,480
Appreciate it thank you all

2131
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:49,760
For supporting the show

2132
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:53,856
Absolutely

2133
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:57,184
The only thing that I can say for certain

2134
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:58,208
Shut it down

2135
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:01,536
I do want to hear what you were going to say but I have a better

2136
02:00:03,328 --> 02:00:07,680
Okay alright

2137
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:09,728
Alright you're alright

2138
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:13,568
The only thing I can say for certain is that for the first time

2139
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:15,616
On a project Camelot maybe not the first time

2140
02:00:15,872 --> 02:00:16,384
But

2141
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:20,736
For the first time in a Project Camelot episode where a guy calls himself a captain

2142
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:23,296
He has explicitly

2143
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:24,832
Never killed a guy

2144
02:00:26,368 --> 02:00:27,392
But I know somebody who

2145
02:00:29,184 --> 02:00:29,696
So here's mine

2146
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:34,304
It's pretty close

2147
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:40,704
Bank

2148
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:43,264
That when these

2149
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:44,288
Silver

2150
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:45,312
I have to be in

2151
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:47,616
Problems in the universe

2152
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:50,432
Was

2153
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:51,200
Some

2154
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:54,272
Going into space going to Mars

2155
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:55,296
Getting acclimated

2156
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:57,088
To Easter Highland being

2157
02:00:58,880 --> 02:00:59,392

2158
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:00,416
Todai

2159
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:01,696
Figuring out the

2160
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:02,464
The problem

2161
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,280
But one guy had to

2162
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:06,304
Theoretically

2163
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:07,072
Lee die

2164
02:01:07,584 --> 02:01:08,096
No reason

2165
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:17,312
Mine was a little bit more

2166
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:19,360
It was the way I would just remind

2167
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:27,552
Let us know which one you enjoyed better we'll see you next time you're on the podcast
