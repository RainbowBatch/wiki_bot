17
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424

00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,104
Curious flavors as we talked about in the last episode

22
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,384
Dream

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,944

00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,728
Butter fruit flavors

31
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:24,128
Only thing I know about Fanta is be commercial from the early.

32
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:28,992
Advanta

33
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
It's fruit

34
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,576

35
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
Expecting fruit

That big of a heel turn

39
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,840
My friend that was not a fruit

40
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,144
I can tell you that for sure

41
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,472
Yeah I think it's cotton candy I'm putting this on the record

42
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
Candy grapes

43
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,056
They taste like cotton candy and their grapes

44
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,360
That the fruit that would be an interesting Tech

45
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,944
Alright that I'll put that down

46
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
Just because that help

47
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,784
Okay that makes my guess a little bit more

48
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,648
Well done

49
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,928
Also it's not good

50
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,000
No relief done job

51
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792
Get your s*** together

52
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:19,168
You know what I didn't even wanted necessarily tell you but it begins with a t and ends with an a

53
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,216
Serena

54
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,008
Well I mean that

55
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,776
Was

56
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:30,176
A beautiful boat because

57
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:36,576
Mentally emotionally affected Williams to retire

58
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,624
Not one of the greats

59
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648
The Great

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
I think

61
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,256
I think that a good on iPad don't know enough about tennis to say

62
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
Fully willing to

63
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,608
I agree with you I just think it's

64
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,912
And someone who knows nothing about this portal

65
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,752
Definitely top players of all time

66
00:03:55,008 --> 00:04:01,152
You are an expert so I'll take your word on it

67
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:06,528

From my youth

70
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,136
Feelings

71
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:14,208
Memory memory actually

72
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:19,071
As a man with a substantial arm hair I imagine that you do have a lot to go on

73
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:24,191
Rob Robin Williams on the great tennis player

77
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343

Little yellow bumps

79
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:48,255

Accu Brite Spot

92
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,911
I really think this is one of the best ones I've seen in a long long time like

93
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959

I already saw that coming from a mile away or if it's San Francisco

99
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,071
1400 miles away

100
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,887
Where are they at

101
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,167
In terms of the egg

102
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:05,055
No I mean like in terms of the final semi-finals where we at

103
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,847
The final how many rabbit

104
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,687
Before the fourth round is the quarterfinals in the semi-finals

105
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:16,319
So so the fourth round is the round of 16 okay the round right before the

106
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,671
16 tonight is probably we're going to be the best

107
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
Match of the entire tournament

108
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,255
Kyrgios vs. Medvedev

109
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,047
Kyrgios

110
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,119
Crushing it was the first time in his life in the Russia

111
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
Different carriers

112
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,727
Different Medvedev

113
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
But

114
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,311

00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127

Still at like

118
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
3 in the

119
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,295
Same time as the French

120
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,087
Ulta

121
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
To set up 8

122
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:56,255
Exactly the same number of memories of you being like I'm going to be up

123
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,791
Fall Nikes

124
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,607
I woke up at 3 a.m. so I can

125
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,935
I'll be up until 4 a.m. tomorrow night

126
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,751
Sit at a bar have to go to the airport

127
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
That's true

128
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,383
I just assumed that's what it's like to be satisfied that you're always watching

129
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,455
The 2 a.m. illegal streams help

130
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
I could I do that

131
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,855
I feel like a number of wrestling fans have the same sort of thing with I

132
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
Japanese

133
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
Promotion

134
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:29,023
Pay-per-views and stuff to love something I guess guess yeah

135
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,559
Today

136
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,095
What are we talkin about appraisal

137
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,887
Episode

138
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,447
Because bats

139
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:40,031
Signal weather

140
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
What speed

141
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,639
I heard people talking about a speech

142
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,175
I can't tell if you're joking

143
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,783
No I mean I know about the speech but it's like I just don't understand why people

144
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,623
Yeah okay yes okay

145
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Okay

146
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,415
Nevermind

147
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
That was it

148
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,791
I really thought that if there was some stuff but it's just it's a look

149
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:08,447
It looks familiar I actually I mean we can get into a little bit now and will come to more episode and such but

150
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,471
I think this is

151
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,543
Speech is either going to be historically and

152
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,847
Incredibly relevant and guy or

153
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
Not

154
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
But in a temp

155
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,479
To be very historically relevant

156
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,087
Yeah I'm not sure exactly how the ball is going to break at this point

157
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
He gave us

158
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,927
Speech that was essentially like Hey look

159
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
Here's the situation

160
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Trump

161
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,815
And the people who were following him these Maga folks

162
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
Are a mess

163
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,167
They don't care about democracy

164
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,471
And they are very serious threat to democracy

165
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
Proceed as we

166
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,567
Are experiencing it now and

167
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
Disability of the country

168
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,663
Normal Folk

169
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
Democrat

170
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
Independence

171
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,039
Publicans who aren't into that nonsense right

172
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,111
We have a responsibility to do what we can't

173
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,647
To protect democracy Now

174
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
The

175
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,743
Future Generations will look back

176
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,279
Psoriasis being in the

177
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,351
Fight if we do our job they will look at the

178
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
This point

179
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,471
As an inflection point in history

180
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,263
There were a number of things that are

181
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,567
I would say a little bit overdue in terms of

182
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
Recognition of Hey look

183
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,919
This s*** is nonsense

184
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
Right

185
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
Well and

186
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:29,599
You do previously had called hook 70 fashion

187
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,439
So you there isn't there is like a little bit of a finally

188
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
Some of this is

189
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:39,327
These words are being uttered

190
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
There is an aspect of life

191
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,983
Love you too little too late that is definitely present

192
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
Doesn't even really mean

193
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
Girl like

194
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
Is it going to

195
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,431
Push any needles

196
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
Directions

197
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,551
Or is this going to be something that has just a severe backlash

198
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,087
Who knows

199
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:07,231
In my in my humble opinion the only reason that a president should give a speech is as

200
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
Cover

201
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
4

202
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,423
Somebody to arrest like a thousand people at the same time right

203
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:20,031
And then all of a sudden in the middle of this meet you start cutting two people being arrested

204
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
Do a blocks

205
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,591
Like all the bankers are going

206
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:28,991
Like the whole thing that's do that's because I pathetic

207
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:35,391
Oh absolutely man that's the he's giving his speech to say that these people

208
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,927
Are coming for democracy

209
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
Surprise

210
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
They're all in jail right now

211
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:44,351
How about that well as we are at the speech as we are a few days after this

212
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:51,519
Unfortunately your your movie fantasy the shot happen

213
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,127
But yeah I'm really there's part of me that is quite

214
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
Conflicted about like

215
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
How

216
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,991
Exciting to think

217
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
The

218
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
Like

219
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
You know given voice

220
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
Do a lot of this stuff

221
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,135
Like or how meaningful it is

222
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,719
I would like to believe that like a

223
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
Indicative of

224
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
You know something

225
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
The broader

226
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,863
Honestly

227
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,399
There's a there's a

228
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,959
Another part of me that is a geyser

229
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
It's probably empathy

230
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
Dent in its direction

231
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,823
Directionless

232
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,383
Even well I mean you have to ask yourself

233
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,711
And I think that no I think the entire country is asking

234
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,247
Can you tell right now

235
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,319
Does anybody even listen to the president anymore

236
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,879
More like all of real talk

237
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
Does anybody

238
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
Care what he says

239
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,511
They might be one of the largest effects of trump

240
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:50,911
I know it's like someone who f****** cares with the president has to say years we had

241
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,103
Twitter

242
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,175
Even before Trump you had president to it have

243
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
Detox

244
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,759
No promises that I capture

245
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:10,623
The Syria Redline Seattle used to a bit of that

246
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
Just talk

247
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
Just all the time

248
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
It seems tough to like comeback for

249
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
From bad to good

250
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:20,607
I will take all this very seriously gravitas of the office

251
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,911
Get me and say that I should give a s*** about what the

252
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
What it says

253
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,727
I can if I so choose

254
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,263
But how dare you say I should

255
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,567
Yeah it's a tough

256
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
It's a tough

257
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,615
Walk from the past

258
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:35,455
Stuff like my fellow Americans I come to you today to like

259
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
Trump being like

260
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,247
They say I have a

261
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:41,855
The small dick imagine imagine FDR's Fireside

262
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:48,255
Speeches if it was just like oh you only thing we have to fear is how tiny Hitler's balls are you my right

263
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,815
Everybody

264
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,119
Gorgeous

265
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
The notion of

266
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,679
Thinking about

267
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
President

268
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,495
In history

269
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,031
Caring about

270
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Memes

271
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359

273
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,967

274
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,551
Holy if there was a if there was a nasty little

275
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,391
Comic is stripping a paper he went ape shitt maybe that's why I looks like them

276
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159

The speech happened

305
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,007
And

306
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
Because of that

307
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,823
Alex decided like I'm not going to wait

308
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
Intro to play

309
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,919
I'm just getting them there I'm diving

310
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,735
The show start

311
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,551
Sink my teeth into this speech he is

312
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
Like just

313
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
In it okay

314
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:29,279
Now see America is going under total New World Order martial law

315
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,519
Tomorrow's news today

316
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
Timex

317
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
Nailed it

318
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
Yeah that's not bad

319
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,687
Professional

320
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,247
Larian set

321
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,551
Really seems to be

322
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,367
What are the primary things that Alex's folks

323
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
Kristen

324
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
The optic

325
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
Pics of it

326
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,463
The red light

327
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,023
Behind him. He gave a speech at

328
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,607
Knight Caesar

329
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
Preoccupied by

330
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,959
I mean I assume that the

331
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,007
Content of the speech is not really something

332
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
He's very

333
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,615
A little bit here in there

334
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,175
Some of that stuff that really works well for him

335
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,455
Yeah but

336
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,271
The Optics are the reasons

337
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
That

338
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,623
This is really sticking in his craw is it worth

339
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,415
We heard for

340
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
Years

341
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,743
During Trump's time Alex being like

342
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
You have

343
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,535
The bully pulpit

344
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,095
Do an evening speech

345
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,631
Get out there in a dress

346
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,447
The population in Primetime and get your

347
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
Your message

348
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,287
Do that right or you didn't

349
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,615
Do the thing that I Alex wants and now here you have

350
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,407
Doing exactly what Alex

351
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,479
I was wishing Trump would do

352
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,783
But giving a speech so you know the thing that there

353
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,087
Famously Furious that he

354
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,111
He cannot do

355
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
You know we can't speak

356
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,439
Clearly for a second

357
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
Do

358
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,535
Note that Alex doesn't

359
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Play like

360
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
The full speech

361
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,679
Replace some B will get that here in a second but like

362
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:18,079
Because there is a key he makes gas all the time cuz no plan exhaust

363
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
And so

364
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
Yeah it's

365
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,759
I think it's sour grapes

366
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,807
Someone for Alex

367
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
The Trump would have done something

368
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,415
Something like this you wishes the Trump would have

369
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:37,279
Declared war on the globalist

370
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
He's in a situation

371
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:41,375
Kitchenware like Biden's doing the thing I wanted Trump to do

372
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,655
I'm not saying

373
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:48,287
That I have any kinship with Alex over this but I do believe that his idea of what

374
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
Speeches

375
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,079
Would happen

376
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,871
Is very similar to mine

377
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,663
You know that that

378
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,943
You know this speech happens

379
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
While your arrest

380
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,503
Sting everybody that you need

381
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Arrested

382
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:02,879
Yeah I think he and I are very similarly alive and that means a wave it

383
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,671
Speeches should go well

384
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,975
There's a slight difference

385
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,535
Well you guys are both like experience

386
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,447
I'm wishing reality was a movie

387
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,751
Alex's portraying

388
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,031
Giving the speech

389
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:24,383
Cover for bags

390
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,687
Locking up of all of their political enemies

391
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:30,015
Yes I guess there's a similarity

392
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,039
To somebody about that

393
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,575
Like an expert

394
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,367
What's nothing

395
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,951
Supposed to say to that expert

396
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,535
I don't know there's like 700 episodes

397
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,007
Maybe they'll give you a honorary degree

398
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,567
Otso Alex

399
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,383
Does start the show by playing some of B

400
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,687
And I noticed that there were some

401
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
Some Cuts

402
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,063
Not a republican Embraces our extreme ideology

403
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,183
Cuz I've been able to work at these mainstream Republican

404
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
And here

405
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,767
In my view is what

406
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
True

407
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
Subway

408
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,839
So there's pretty obvious cut

409
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:20,191
There is very important to point out is that

410
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,495
Biting does go out of his way

411
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,799
Be very specific about like

412
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,823
Like what he's talkin

413
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,615
He's talking about folks

414
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,991
Do not understand the transfer of power

415
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,807
The folks who don't have any interest

416
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,831
The turtle

417
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
Governing

418
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,647
Rules and norms

419
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,207
Not just Republicans

420
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,999
This is not just a very partisan

421
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:49,887
Types p.m. he broke down at one point and just started screaming

422
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,519
In a fashion

423
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,871
Rita's bring it up.

424
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:03,455
Intrigued me that there was this these days

425
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,759
Because he has all the time

426
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:09,343
In the world on his show you can play whatever you want

427
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
Do you know

428
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
What he wants

429
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
Right

430
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,719
But here's what was said

431
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
Between

432
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,767
At the clips that was cut out

433
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
Quote

434
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:24,191
But there's no question that the Republican party today is dominated driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the magaru

435
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,239
Publicans and that this is a threat

436
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,007
To this country

437
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
These are hard things

438
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,335
But I'm an American

439
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:34,431
Not the president of America or blue America but of all America

440
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,503
And I believe it is my duty my duty to level with

441
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,831
To tell you the truth no matter how difficult no matter how pain

442
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:45,695
It may be coincidence that this was cut out but it also seems like a point Alex wouldn't

443
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,231
Be super comfortable with

444
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,511
Particularly the part about

445
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,071
The Gob being intimidated by Trump

446
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
And his followers

447
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:59,007
The Impressions about Trump and the Maga folks is supposed to be that they're winning the Battle of ideas and that they're just smarter

448
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,799
More patriotic than the rest of us

449
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,359
Which is why they've taken over the GOP

450
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,175
It's not a great idea to plant seeds in the audience

451
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:12,063
Does Mida maybe they're part of something hostile that is gaining power not by being ideologically better

452
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,855
But by being more willing to threaten

453
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,879
An employee file

454
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,976
Alex also cuts out the part at the beginning or Biden says quote

455
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,256
We must never forget

456
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,584
We the people are the true Heirs of the American Experience

457
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,632
But the began more than two centuries ago

458
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:31,520
We the people burning inside each of us the flame of Liberty that was lit hear it Independence

459
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
Too tall

460
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:38,176
A flame that lit our way through abolition the Civil War suffrage the Great Depression world war Civil Rights

461
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:44,832
That sacred flame still Burns now in our time as we build an America that is more prosperous free and just

462
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,392
That is the work of my presidency admission

463
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,184
I believe in with my whole soul

464
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,768
That's just good business on Alex's bar cutting that out

465
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,584
He has a vested interest in pretending that his political enemies

466
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,888
I hate the country and what it stands for

467
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,936
So it's best not to allow someone like buying

468
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,472
Speak like this on Infowars

469
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,032
Is someone who has a passionate

470
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,824
I love

471
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,616
For the country or two.

472
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,896
Robidoux confused

473
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,224
Really terrifying if he quoted Thomas

474
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,504
Batman

475
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,088
That would be accurately

476
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,160
Inaccurately quoted Thomas Jefferson

477
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
They would go

478
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,744
Absolutely a****** at all

479
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,792
Day all day would

480
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,584
Would be a Non-Stop barrage

481
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,704
What we all know.

482
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,984
To be the truth

483
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,568
Of their ability to remember or even

484
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,128
Fantasize

485
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,408
Thomas Jefferson quote

486
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,992
Speechwriter

487
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:51,392
Slipping something about Deez Nuts or something of that quote Thomas Jefferson

488
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,184
PJ all

489
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,512
That be wonderful at the way you got to go

490
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
So I mean he plays

491
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,560
Enough

492
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
Of the speech

493
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,632
Just play

494
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,424
The full path

495
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,800
If you wanted to put there is just this is Frankenstein together everywhere

496
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,384
They promote authoritarian leaders and they fan the flames

497
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,408
Political violence

498
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,456
Threat

499
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,992
For personal rights

500
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,040
So the pursuit of just

501
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
The rule of law

502
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,392
The very soul of this

503
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,488
We hear you heard it

504
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,304
More and more talk about violence

505
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,608
She could hear that caught there again

506
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,192
Instead in the middle of that right after where it cut

507
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,800
The mob that stormed the United States Capitol on January 6th

508
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,896
Brutally attacking law enforcement not as Insurrection is to place a dagger to

509
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,176
The throat of our democracy

510
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712
But they look at them as Patron

511
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,856
And they see their Maga failure to stop a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election

512
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,880
Has preparation

513
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,904
And for the 2020

514
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,184
2 + 2024

515
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,768
I think Alex knows well enough that most of his audience

516
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,792
Stussy January

517
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,328
Six Riders is Patriots

518
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,120
Which is uncomfortable

519
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
Yeah

520
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,936
It's hard for the

521
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,240
It's hard to rationalize

522
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,264
If you really have

523
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
Confronted on

524
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,408
Yeah yeah this is holding up a mirror to his audiences beliefs in a way they could be threatened

525
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,432
Where is Auto Parts

526
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,736
To the speech that are left in they really are

527
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,552
Brixton tea leaves in Biden saying

528
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
They promote authoritarian leaders

529
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,368
Because the audience

530
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,904
Doesn't think they do that

531
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,232
Trump DeSantis bolsonaro in orbit

532
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,048
Furthest Thing from authoritarian in the audience's eyes

533
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,120
So hearing Biden say that is just absurd.

534
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,144
That's not the

535
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,168
It's not something's like

536
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,704
I'm taking it back by then

537
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
Yeah

538
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,264
Another part that Alex leaves in

539
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,032
It's quote

540
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,848
Maga forces are determined to take this country back work

541
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:51,200
2 in America where there is no right to choose no right to privacy

542
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,016
No right to contraception no right to marry who you love

543
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,552
All that stuff

544
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
Stuff that is audience

545
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:01,184
Believes it is totally fine with I was going to say that's like

546
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,584
Yeah man that's what we are doing

547
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:11,424
In favor of banning contraception they want to get rid of marriage equality

548
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,960
The idea of right

549
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,008
The Privacy is vague enough that they can just

550
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,288
Slept that in Alyssa

551
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:20,384
Day I don't know what that mean we want the right to privacy but we also want to break into your home if you

552
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Things to do with

553
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,224
Social media I don't care whatever

554
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,016
This is not threatening

555
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,320
For Alex to show the audience because

556
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,112
Is the audience the feeling divided

557
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,648
Is declaring war on them

558
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,184
For their political beliefs

559
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,744
The I identify with the people

560
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,280
The Biden is describing as a threat

561
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,072
Democracy which is what Alex wants

562
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
To feel

563
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,912
The case of the January 6th thing that's a little bit

564
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,032
That's a case where the audience will see their feelings mirrored by what Biden to saying but

565
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,824
It's not about political positions make

566
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,104
Can justify his rash

567
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,432
Opposition to abortion or believing that marriage is just

568
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:58,272
Between a man and a woman are things that are common in Many religious communities

569
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,320
Give you pause to look at

570
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,856
Put yourself in that mirror

571
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,160
The rights of January 6th action

572
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,976
And those actions are way harder for people who want

573
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,000
See themselves as

574
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:08,768
Respectable

575
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
To justify

576
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:13,632
That's a mirror is best not to look into partially because

577
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,680
Except

578
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,704
The group that

579
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,824
Tried to overrun the capital in order to stop a life electric being certified poses a threat to our Democratic process

580
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,408
You don't want let me want that mirror

581
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,712
Alex has also cut this part out

582
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,272
But while the threat to American Tobacco

583
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,832
Chrissy is real I want to say as clearly as we can

584
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,624
We are not powerless in the face

585
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
These threats

586
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,720
We are not bystanders and its ongoing attack on democracy

587
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,024
There are far more Americans

588
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,304
Barber American

589
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,584
From every

590
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,632
From every background at believe who reject

591
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,424
The extreme Agha ideology

592
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
Send those who accept

593
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
After that line

594
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
There was a big

595
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,336
This could be useful to instill fear in the audience but that's

596
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:57,664
Play as well with the Infowars version of Biden

597
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,944
And these ideas

598
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,480
A huge part of the election

599
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:04,832
Conspiracies that vine was so unpopular and then no one would come to his rally so

600
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:09,952
You don't really want these large Applause brain and the getting Applause

601
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:14,048
For the idea that there are more people who are sick of this

602
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,864
Stuff then Alex's

603
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
Gubiotti of that good

604
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
That's not good

605
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:25,312
There's a bunch more that's cut out and a lot of it is Biden saying things about uniting around defending our political process

606
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,336
Cement getting Applause

607
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,640
No need for stuff like that

608
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,664
Because it's bad

609
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,224
You don't want it I mean yeah

610
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,992
Also

611
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
For him it

612
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:38,112
Yeah you know it's not even a thing it's just like oh yeah we're not you we don't

613
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,392
We can't use that

614
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,720
So why leave it in you know and nobody's going to question us for

615
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:48,608
For cutting it it's obvious by audiences going to watch the whole speech

616
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,472
They're going to accept whatever interpretation I give and that's going to be real

617
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,032
You know I was I was wondering

618
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
You know part of why I think the

619
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,616
It's calling the January

620
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,896
Six people Patriots

621
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,920
It is weird to me it's

622
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
Because

623
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,480
It was such a huge fuk up

624
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:10,112
You know like they really we all saw that it was just a bunch of f****** assholes

625
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,672
Just really being pieces of s***

626
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,464
You know

627
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,488
You can't

628
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
Mythologize that the same way

629
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,560
You can the boss

630
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
Boston Tea Party

631
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:24,192
Do you know like that was just a bunch of assholes going on a boat and like

632
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,240
F****** s*** up you know Counterpoint

633
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
What

634
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
William Travis

635
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,104
Fair enough

636
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,344
Drunk assholes f****** murdering people at their house who was only there because he was running away from rats

637
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,136
His ex-wife

638
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,696
Nevermind nevermind

639
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,720
I should have looked at

640
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
Mormonism

641
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,936
We're too close to it now yeah that's all remember some of the details as opposed to that

642
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,472
Selling of the myth

643
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,776
I think you're right

644
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:05,664
For now but give it a little time

645
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:10,784
One more bit that was I noticed a

646
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,808
Just a massive

647
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
You've got here

648
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,368
Republic

649
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
Predicting

650
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,608
This is inflammatory

651
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,144
Is dangerous

652
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,448
It's against the rule of law

653
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,520
And we the people must say

654
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056
This is not

655
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,592
Who We Are

656
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,736
America must be cut

657
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,504
Jarring

658
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,808
So here's was missing there

659
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
Quick look

660
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:48,416
I know politics can be fierce and mean and nasty in America

661
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
I get it

662
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,488
I believe in the give-and-take apology

663
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,280
Disagreement did debate and

664
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:58,656
We're a big complicated country but democracy and doors only if we the people

665
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,704
Respect the guardrails of the Republic

666
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,544
Only if we the people accept the results of free and fair election

667
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,592
Only if we the people

668
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,920
Politics not as Total War but mediation of our

669
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:15,552
Democracy cannot survive when one side believes there are only two outcomes to an Alexa

670
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,856
Either they win or they were cheated

671
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,416
That's where Maga Republicans are today

672
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,208
FairPoint

673
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,488
Can't argue with that

674
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,816
Every single

675
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,352
F****** election

676
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,144
It it's getting

677
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,680
To the point where

678
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,216
You know obviously that's

679
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,240
To give some of

680
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,264
The folks

681
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,288
Pause

682
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,568
On the

683
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,640
Maybe some of the more aware self aware

684
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,176
Listeners Alex's

685
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,712
Church be like all right

686
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,272
Sarah Palin lost

687
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Those cheating

688
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,856
Laura Loomer lost

689
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:54,208
Cheating man who has the time

690
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,512
To cheap that many election

691
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,560
When the globalists are stretched

692
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,888
Binman they don't have time for Alaskan election

693
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:07,008
Sarah Palin can lose on her own baby and with the case of Laura Loomer it's got a

694
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,288
You got to look at this house

695
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,568
Glass is half-full

696
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,944
Absolutely

697
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,736
Dab

698
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:20,832
You lost

699
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:26,208
Aw away from getting a double you know what I'm saying like that was a very short

700
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:26,976
Short walk

701
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,816
I also in this portion by Melissa phone number visit

702
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,584
Accomplishment

703
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
Helped

704
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:37,728
Make possible in the past two years all of which are things that Alex is pretending aren't real

705
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,776
So it's best not to confuse the audience

706
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,872
This also

707
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,176
I also cut out the part where there's a protest

708
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,200
Yelling stuff

709
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,504
To disrupt the speech and

710
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,576
Notwithstanding those folks you here on the other side there

711
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,368
They're entitled to be outrageous

712
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,904
This is a democracy

713
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,696
But history and Common Sense

714
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,000
Good manners is nothing they've suffered from

715
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,328
Pretty Far Cry from all those times Trump

716
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:07,936
Interrupted his own speeches to demand protesters be kicked out or times he responded with

717
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,216
Libra tattoos

718
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
Bobbing

719
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,544
Assaulted at his rallies that 11

720
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
It's kind of hard

721
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,896
The patients that Biden is exhibiting

722
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,456
Intolerance of somebody who disagrees

723
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,736
Tyrannic

724
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,296
Right especially juxtaposed with

725
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:26,624
I'm out really have to

726
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
To cut out a lot

727
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,464
Hayden speech in order to make him look like

728
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,488
Like a tyrant

729
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,768
I mean but

730
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,560
There's red lights and he's doing this at night

731
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,352
So that's pretty good I mean

732
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,912
He is part about it is like

733
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:39,936
You know

734
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:44,800
I suppose you could go with the bailout in like the ACA 2

735
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,848
Portray Obama is a

736
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,896
The Tyrant you know at least there's that

737
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:52,480
But was biting it really does feel like he's half acid

738
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,504
You know like

739
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:58,368
Is he a tyrant if he's willing to be like a 10K in student loans

740
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
Forgiveness

741
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:04,000
I'm not going to go after these hard right people and say we got to get 20

742
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:11,680
Is negotiation all right you're literally

743
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,704
Your own power

744
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,544
Sure

745
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,312
I think it's 12

746
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:21,664
But it's a challenge that I open up to the plate

747
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:26,528
Another thing that's weird here is that the part where this

748
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
Picks up

749
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,064
After the

750
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,136
We're Biden says quote and now America must choose

751
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,440
That's actually from earlier in the speech

752
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:37,536
This is edited out of order to create the impression that Alex is wanting

753
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,864
Convey right I promise I can make Alex's show looks

754
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,704
So much worse if I just gave up on the idea of a linear time

755
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,264
That's not fair because this is

756
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,800
Definition of Taken

757
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,824
Things out of

758
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,360
Out of context in

759
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,896
Temporal space

760
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,688
Yeah I know if you take it out of one

761
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,736
Time and then put it into a different time

762
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:03,136
And make it appear that thoughts are flowing into each other that aren't you might as well edit in each individual word to make

763
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,928
IMO Tyrunt

764
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:08,768
Yeah might as well be a magazine cutout of a letter

765
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:13,376
I understand that maybe four-time reasons Alex would want to play the whole speech

766
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:17,472
But the wave is being presented is irresponsible and it's

767
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,008
Intentionally deceptive

768
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,056
100

769
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,384
So a clip comes to an end

770
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,408
Are the part of

771
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,176
Give the speech

772
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,456
An Alex

773
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,480
I have some more

774
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
Abyss

775
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,272
Is it

776
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,576
Like this is the entire show

777
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,880
We can choose a better path

778
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Forward to the

779
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
The future

780
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,256
Future of possibility if

781
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,280
Pictures of build

782
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,640
This country

783
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,664
He is on the

784
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,808
But they're planning to Stage violence

785
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:18,400
Move on us

786
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,680
Godwin

787
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,752
Only miss was the porches

788
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,056
Torches

789
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,360
Isn't that traditionally pitchforks and torches

790
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,384
She's coming from the other

791
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,408
Directions

792
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,944
Yeah and I think

793
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,736
The torch is certainly in

794
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,272
Present parlance

795
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:38,624
Evokes ideas of the United right rally

796
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:43,232
Which would be the buddies that he's around yeah

797
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,048
I don't know I don't understand exactly

798
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,352
I'm sure there's some images trying

799
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,888
It's not that but

800
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,496
I strongly suspect that Alex has the time that he has there because

801
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,544
Cuz he knows that his followers are prime

802
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,616
To hear something like this as the go-ahead to start shooting

803
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,152
Preparing out violence against

804
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:01,920
The government

805
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:06,016
He desperately needs to create a pre-emptive narrative that anything that may happen

806
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,832
Is not real and will be a false flag

807
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:14,976
Incidentally what Biden said the public Figures were calling for violence and we were talking about that talking about Alex

808
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:21,888
This was almost certainly in response to Senator Lindsey Graham going on Fox News and saying that if Trump was charged for having all that class

809
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,448
Syj tomorrow logout then there would be riots in the

810
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:28,800
Nothing is not always about out

811
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,336
Everything is always

812
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,432
You could argue that most things are not

813
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,248
Typically

814
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,040
That's a dead giveaway that they're probably

815
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
I do appreciate

816
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,136
The discourse in America you know like

817
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,928
You think back to those

818
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:47,744
Those conservative commentators like William F Buckley

819
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
Play Junior

820
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,328
And you think about him now saying you know

821
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,168
What amounts to I'm Rubber and you're glue neener neener

822
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:58,240
Give me sticks to you

823
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,032
I mean I think a win

824
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,080
I didn't get evolution chart

825
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:08,480
You know ask not what the government could do for you and what you could do for the government

826
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,856
Because the government

827
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:20,256
Can do everything but not for you for you that you must do nothing

828
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,888
So yeah I think that

829
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,656
That

830
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,960
Obviously he knows that they're about to go to break

831
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:32,288
And so you have a limited amount of time but the Heat

832
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:37,920
The reverse of everything

833
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,688
A little bit late

834
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,064
I'm telling you the entire show is just

835
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,344
False flags are coming

836
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,368
This is

837
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:49,184
Cuz that's the only thing that's important

838
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,464
Alex knows

839
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,232
Well enough

840
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,792
He's plugged into Noah keys

841
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,352
Friends with all kinds of keeper types

842
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,656
Begging to

843
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,448
Fight a f****** War forever

844
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,496
Like he knows enough

845
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,520
To see the Opera

846
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,592
This to see the way people are talking about it

847
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,616
I know

848
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,640
Someone

849
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,176
Probably

850
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,456
Making a bomb as we

851
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,224
Yeah

852
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,016
So

853
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,552
When that happened

854
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,088
If that happened

855
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,112
I don't want to be playing

856
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:18,880
Time for it

857
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,648
And I don't want this

858
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,952
To be set back to my business

859
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,744
Into my ideology

860
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,304
It has to be fake in advance

861
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,632
And when he was talking about false Flags coming

862
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,680
Before this speech

863
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,752
I mean it's the same thing

864
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,520
It's just

865
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,800
Much more

866
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,568
Important

867
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,128
When there was

868
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,432
Then I went to text on this before but like

869
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,456
The clipse on

870
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:49,856
Social media going around him saying off also I can come before the midterms Jeff that's just his normal every

871
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,624
3 days

872
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
Type

873
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,720
This is far more pic

874
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,048
Didn't know that the reason is because

875
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,584
He knows there's a heightened

876
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,144
Jantz Fridays friends are going to do some

877
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,192
Real f*****-up stuff

878
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:08,032
That's true I I don't know I think I would take that back

879
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,312
I think I would take the bet

880
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,336
Because the bed is

881
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,920
If you rest Trump and you do the the law thing

882
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,688
Incorrectly

883
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,016
There's there's they they attack

884
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,296
Or

885
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
Nothing happen

886
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,344
Said we

887
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,904
I think I'd take the bet

888
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,976
I think if we get Trump and they don't attack

889
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,512
The wind drops

890
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,536
Out of their sails

891
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,304
Completely

892
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,584
Like if they

893
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,424
Actually healthy to look at it this way

894
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
Because

895
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,472
Anything

896
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,240
That

897
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,800
The legal system or whatever

898
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,592
Should play out how it plays out

899
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,896
And if there is

900
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,176
Cause and it's

901
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,992
Appropriate to arrest them

902
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,528
Talkin arrest him

903
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,136
There should not be a consideration of what the backlash will be because that

904
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,928
I understand that

905
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,208
I understand that

906
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:01,792
But you understand that is the consideration that be is being taken place

907
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,840
I understand

908
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,376
Certainly that's a big part of

909
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:08,960
The conversation hopefully not within law enforcement

910
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:13,312
Why didn't why do you think Billy didn't charge him in the first place it

911
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,080
The doj

912
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:18,944
Maybe it's not appropriate to a sitting president be charged I don't know look

913
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:23,552
Fair enough so maybe other considerations

914
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,160
Yeah I get I get where you're coming from

915
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,696
But also I think that's a naive

916
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,232
Because I think the

917
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:35,840
To Sumit immediate backlash is the backlash

918
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,608
Might be

919
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,888
Might be short-sighted

920
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,912
So like if

921
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,192
You know Tumblr arrest

922
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,984
Nothing happens it doesn't mean like

923
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,752
6 months

924
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:48,128
I love planning later something wouldn't happen jailbreak

925
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,408
Right but I mean

926
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:55,808
If you do understand we're dealing drugs out of his Resort prison escape

927
00:40:56,064 --> 00:41:01,696
Planned planned by the dumbest people on the f****** planet you know like I'm not afraid of their plans

928
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,488
I'm afraid of a flash mob

929
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,512
Do you know what I mean

930
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,816
Yeah I feel like their plans would be spoiled

931
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,840
Very very easy

932
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,120
Right yeah

933
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,912
Right

934
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,680
It's it's

935
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,960
Stop

936
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,728
Sing to

937
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,496
Think about

938
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,032
But I hope that the

939
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,080
Decision-making isn't being Guided by

940
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,872
The potential for

941
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,408
People to

942
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,176
Cause

943
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,200
Rampant

944
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,224
And random

945
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,760
Political damage

946
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,552
Because I did again

947
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,160
Not a great way to guide decision

948
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,488
Right right right

949
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,536
There you go

950
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:41,376
Cancerous

951
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,984
So this got me really excited but don't worry it's a

952
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,752
Deflation

953
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,312
This is an emergency broadcast

954
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,872
Ladies and gentlemen and I'll be up here tomorrow

955
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,687
Taping another emergency 3-hour broadcast

956
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,967
Special guest

957
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,807
Storms across the country

958
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
What

959
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,975
Big guests as well as

960
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,303
Psychological warfare

961
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,887
Expert

962
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:20,543
Now you can't tell me that it's going to be a deflation

963
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:26,943
I wanted you to see how I felt I thought it was going to be pechanec

964
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,503
He was going to be making his return

965
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:34,879
Now's the Time yeah so somebody's playing was not able to get

966
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,647
Texas

967
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,671
4

968
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,743
Whatever I'll just leave it at that

969
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:40,767
Alex didn't

970
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,047
Record

971
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,911
Or at least it's not up on Van. Video or

972
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,703
Any anywhere I can find a v

973
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,727
What normal place

974
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,007
Things are posted

975
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,799
So I don't think it's happened but

976
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,567
Thinking about it like

977
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,591
It's probably just Rodger

978
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,383
Righttime dealers in Florida

979
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,151
Yeah that would be

980
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,271
Said if it is Rodger then of course you'd have to save some

981
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,039
Something Hollywood

982
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,343
I'll just leave it at that

983
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,135
Oh I mean there was a weather of

984
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:10,719
Yeah I know I do. I didn't check the weather report

985
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:15,071
Ecstasy where there were

986
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,887
Who could

987
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,911
Possibly even

988
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,935
Be a Metrology

989
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:24,543
Joel skousen is not coming in no shape with you at fast

990
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,567
Oh man

991
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,359
Barnes

992
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,383
Just a hickey

993
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,175
What if he got Bannon

994
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,711
What if he got the band

995
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,503
Promote

996
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,087
Maybe he's got a

997
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:37,855
Family

998
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:42,207
Is it a bunker the War Room bunker

999
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:46,303
Not mad about now

1000
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:48,863
I don't know

1001
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,631
Trump

1002
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,471
He's got to get out of the state

1003
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:57,311
Yeah extradition from Texas is tougher than you might think

1004
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,687
Alex's ass of analysis and its really superficial

1005
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,783
This is like if you go to the zoo

1006
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:11,135
You know that's an elephant hunt

1007
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:11,903
Chair

1008
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,743
Are you sure

1009
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,423
The leader of the country gets up

1010
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,983
And declares half the nation terrorist

1011
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,799
Says they're about to engage in terrorism

1012
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:32,639
And they do it with troops behind them with a red background

1013
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:38,271
There's a dark cross in every Hollywood movie

1014
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:41,599
Every dystopian system they show that exactly

1015
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,367
Iconography

1016
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,903
All the scripted

1017
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,231
Vendetta

1018
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,351
Also incidentally

1019
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:59,775
Filming at 3 hour special so honey I can't take you to the store

1020
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,799
Pazuzu

1021
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:05,919
Listen we were going to go fishing but that fell through so we're like let's go to the zoo and now

1022
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,455
That's why I don't mind

1023
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,479
Sorry

1024
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:14,879
Playing got delayed everything is movies have everything is based on the surface level at appear in

1025
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,671
Isn't it kind of troubling

1026
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:23,327
It's really doesn't mean much more than him saying that the he looked at the speech and it reminded him of movies

1027
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,863
Yeah

1028
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
Didn't say that s***

1029
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,447
Just a mischaracterization of his

1030
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,007
It would be interesting if he threw that one out there though

1031
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,287
Hey listen

1032
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,823
Listen assholes

1033
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,127
50% of this country is coming to kill you

1034
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,175
If the president said that

1035
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,479
That would be a statement of War

1036
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,391
Straight Talk Express coming at chess

1037
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:50,975
50% of America's Got a Gun and it's coming for you

1038
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:57,119
50% of America are bad boys bad boys

1039
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,423
Alright okay

1040
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,447
Dear

1041
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,495
It's it would have been I think

1042
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,031
I think our conversation about

1043
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:08,895
Probably be different if that was what he said.

1044
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,919
That's it

1045
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,199
Undiplomatic

1046
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:15,807
Unproductive way to The Last Jedi background

1047
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:21,695
Looking at look at it Raves right now those people yeah I get it I get it that would be evil

1048
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:28,095
I honestly would even have a pretty different take on it if it was what you fantasize about

1049
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,911
Whatever different they got it if they pulled that one off

1050
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,727
So Alex's

1051
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,007
Talking about this

1052
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:35,775
Sony's like

1053
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,055
And this seems like

1054
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,871
I can work with this guy

1055
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,407
I'm going to I'm going to create

1056
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,175
Some Brandy

1057
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:46,527
Blood red light

1058
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:56,255
We're coming for you and what it is

1059
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,327
Operational name

1060
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,375
Oh God have a name

1061
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,447
What is called operation

1062
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,471
Matador

1063
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,519
I bet

1064
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
Bullfight

1065
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,527
Long

1066
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,599
Skinny razor sharp sword

1067
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:26,719
When the bull lunges forward

1068
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,767
Into the Heart

1069
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,815
And step aside with Escape

1070
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,095
As The Bull

1071
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,887
Razer self into the Dust

1072
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,447
This is operator

1073
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:37,983
Matador

1074
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,127
Operation matador

1075
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:50,783
T-shirts coming soon okay no no no no no no

1076
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:57,183
Names of Ben documents in the past you've been like we got operation lockstep and that's not real either

1077
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,207
Thing though

1078
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:01,023
At least there was a wordlock step that could

1079
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:05,119
Another document

1080
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:11,519
Pitch your old name

1081
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,823
Everyone I bet it's called admin

1082
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:19,967
And then just give it a name but he getting they call it the name they came pretty as option which is bullfighting

1083
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:26,111
And the camera I got matador's batter

1084
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,135
Call Jack

1085
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,695
Evan and then he has his own

1086
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:34,303
F****** analogy in order to explain the name that he pets

1087
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,095
They made up for it

1088
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:42,751
They have the metaphorical will wherewithal to make that up there it's a pain.

1089
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:50,687
Valic likes with those he's going to keep going there

1090
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,711
He's just sitting there like

1091
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,527
And for this and I'm going to

1092
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,623
Spit ball of the name of myself

1093
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,903
Yeah

1094
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,207
So we goes along with this bull analogy

1095
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,559
Why you get a bull

1096
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,655
Big giant razor-sharp

1097
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,679
Orange

1098
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
I think Sharp

1099
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,663
The pissy moth

1100
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,135
Power supplies

1101
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:34,719
Remote control

1102
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,815
Running down our families and

1103
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:41,375
NFL

1104
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,399
I'm sorry what

1105
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,983
Throwing a little Spears

1106
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,823
Now the red cakes

1107
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,895
67 days out from the midterm

1108
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,199
I know they're set to lose

1109
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,039
Open

1110
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,415
Behind it

1111
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:08,255
Is the FBI

1112
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,327
We're Not Gonna

1113
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,351
Jump on the sword

1114
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,423
Populous Christian conservative

1115
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,959
Operation matador

1116
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,007
What is happening

1117
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:25,407
An understanding for language that you know that most of the stuff Alex talk about is b*******

1118
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,479
Spears being poked

1119
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:32,575
Just buzzwords he throws around to prompt an emotional reaction

1120
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,599
From the audience

1121
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,159
This list is an airing of grievances

1122
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:39,743
And the complaint is basically that Alex doesn't like technological advance

1123
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,071
Whores a society that Embraces immigrants

1124
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,375
And lgbtq Community folks

1125
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:51,775
He yells about Free Speech all day but wants to live in a country where athletes aren't allowed to take a knee during the national anthem

1126
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,079
Women protest of racial discrimination in policing

1127
00:50:55,103 --> 00:51:01,247
These are things that Alex conceptualizes as the spears being used to poke the metaphorical Bull and it really just sound

1128
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,527
Sounds to me like Alex's

1129
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,343
Expressing a profoundly white identity view of the country

1130
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:08,415
He doesn't believe that people who are not straight white

1131
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:11,743
Christians are entitled to rights or power in this country

1132
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:15,583
I don't sublevel anytime he hears a conversation by people who fit this description

1133
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,119
Acting in a way that he doesn't like

1134
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:21,727
His reaction is basically like you should be glad us white folks even let you be here

1135
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,775
Yeah I mean

1136
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,311
It does seem like

1137
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,335
The more

1138
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:32,735
Apps metaphorical stand-in for Alex in this scenario is in fact

1139
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,015
Back to the bullet self

1140
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,319
Constantly being in Rage

1141
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,367
Did you buy any number of different things

1142
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,391
Alex's

1143
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,415
Yeah

1144
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,695
He's angry

1145
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,767
Annoy time he sees these things

1146
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,047
These things

1147
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:46,815
Like

1148
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,095
People living

1149
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,887
Experience is that at

1150
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:52,447
Spear being poked into his white Christian tolerance

1151
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:56,543
Colin Kaepernick taking a knee instead of just accepting police violence that the

1152
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,407
Reading at a library instead of being shamed into never living in public

1153
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,175
That's the spirit

1154
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:08,063
Immigrants being allowed into the country instead of having a hardened militarized border they're killed for cross

1155
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:08,831
Sing status

1156
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,623
Here's the thing

1157
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,695
What a bull charges after being poked by a bunch of beers

1158
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,975
It's a natural reaction

1159
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,815
The Matador waving that flag is something of a bull can't really be fault

1160
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,583
Supercharging

1161
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,631
It's the expected result of all the poker

1162
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:28,031
If we understand Alex's metaphor his padria buddies are the bull and there they would be well within their rights

1163
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,567
To charge the Matador

1164
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,591
In this

1165
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,615
Case bomb thing

1166
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,407
Because they went poop so much

1167
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:38,015
Write the only problem is that the matador's cape has the FBI behind it

1168
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:43,391
That doesn't really make sense because in the metaphorical Matador situation did this whole thing

1169
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,695
Really no way to make it a false flag

1170
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:48,255
You would need like a fake ball or some s***

1171
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,791
How this works

1172
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,327
Hibiscus

1173
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,655
Yeah this isn't Alex warning about a false flag this

1174
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:57,471
Zim warning his buddies about following their

1175
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,775
He's trying to tell the bull not to

1176
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:00,799
To charge because it's

1177
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:04,383
The Trap because I was understands that his buddies want

1178
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,431
The charge that Matador really badly

1179
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:12,063
They want to bomb s*** and Alex is smart enough to recognize that the way the people are talking about Biden

1180
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,623
Speech is exactly the kind of thing that will lead

1181
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:19,231
Lob as much of a stimulus for that as a matador waves

1182
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,279
This isn't a false flag

1183
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,815
Situation he's talking about

1184
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,351
More of a Honeypot

1185
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,887
Kind of idea

1186
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,167
Yeah I was I was

1187
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:29,471
Comparing them to the bulletin board in the Sun

1188
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:32,031
It's that they lose at the end

1189
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,591
Is the bulldozer

1190
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,871
When

1191
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,407
True

1192
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,687
The bull can't like

1193
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:41,759
Overcome the whole thing and be like I

1194
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,527
Listen

1195
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,063
I've chosen the way of peace

1196
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:50,719
Like the bull is going to do the thing because they have no ability to stop them

1197
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,559
I think a better way to make as metaphor work

1198
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,327
I guess

1199
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
Is

1200
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,143
The bowl is the audience

1201
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,935
Alex is the Spears

1202
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:00,703
Poking them

1203
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,239
Yeah a man

1204
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,519
Getting arrested

1205
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,799
Is the Matador

1206
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,079
That work

1207
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:12,991
That's something that he was ever a spear or anyting

1208
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:17,087
Things to do with this incitement that is being done by Alex

1209
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,111
Yeah

1210
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,183
No Volkswagen

1211
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:25,023
Trickery really even then Alex could be the Matador trying to

1212
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,583
Navigate the bull but really

1213
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,911
Not having any control over where the bull goes

1214
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:37,567
And so the bull constantly comes at him and then you know runs forward in his there's all kinds of

1215
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,359
Collateral damage

1216
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,663
I think the point though is that has metaphors in

1217
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,967
Some good know that is the point

1218
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:44,735
Alex

1219
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,527
Talking about this being like

1220
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,087
Steve Volkswagen Terror attacks that they're going

1221
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,623
The globalist are going to do and s***

1222
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,927
Work within this

1223
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,207
Like the framework

1224
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:58,303
Talking about the only way for the bull metaphor to work

1225
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,071
Is

1226
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,375
Alex understanding

1227
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,399
That is audience

1228
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,447
He's going to carry out bombing

1229
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:08,031
Right it's just that they're being provoked into doing it right

1230
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,823
Because they think that it's the right thing

1231
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,591
To do

1232
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:15,455
I would also accept that it might work if adding actual bullfight

1233
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:17,759
When the Matador pull the

1234
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,527
Dacapo side

1235
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,551
FBI what

1236
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,623
It's still on.

1237
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,159
Nobody would Wake Forest

1238
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:27,231
But I think that maybe Alex and thinking of the cape

1239
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:28,255
Is a flag

1240
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:34,655
I don't know.

1241
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,191
I don't have

1242
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,983
Of that many clips

1243
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:41,311
From this whole episode of the reasons is because it's in

1244
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,591
Volkswagen

1245
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,871
That's really

1246
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,687
80% of content okay

1247
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,247
Why you make an announcement this folding crazy

1248
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,111
Because they're going to pull stuff so damn horrible

1249
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,999
Assassinate

1250
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:00,767
Trump

1251
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,119
They'll come kill me

1252
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,399
Sure

1253
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,519
Making their move

1254
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,151
I will be dead by the midterm

1255
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,943
I mean but but what are you

1256
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,223
Are you talking about then

1257
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:23,039
You're just didn't say you call for violence

1258
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:29,695
You're saying he's saying that they're coming they're literally coming to kill you and there's no stopping it because

1259
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,719
Just announced

1260
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:32,767
He is an ounce

1261
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,815
That the war has started

1262
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,375
The war has started haha

1263
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,655
But the war is a trick

1264
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,471
What

1265
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:45,311
You can't stage false Flags if the war has already started

1266
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,335
Do you understand

1267
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,383
There's no reason to have faults

1268
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,919
Flags

1269
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:53,759
Cuz you want to look like you're only

1270
00:56:54,015 --> 00:57:00,159
Fighting defensively it's the same thing that you can just do the thing and

1271
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,695
Then you have people lie for you

1272
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,231
True

1273
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,511
I mean

1274
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,047
That's an option

1275
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,119
Kohl's

1276
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:17,823
Part of the fun banter here is

1277
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:24,223
Missing your ideas adopting Alex's ability

1278
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
To patch over thing

1279
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:29,343
Yeah there's too many holes here for me even to really do work on this too high

1280
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,367
Butts

1281
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,159
Alex's tummy hurts

1282
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,719
Told you last month

1283
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:38,303
My gut-level also intellectual analysis is

1284
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,351
10 times worse than it's ever been

1285
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,703
More concerned

1286
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,543
Aaron

1287
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:57,759
Unless we see massive just Department whistleblowers now unless we see people even in corporate media that know their Mercenaries

1288
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,807
Know what they're doing wrong a lot of them

1289
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,647
Unless we just see everybody start coming out and saying I'm not with this it's over

1290
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:13,119
We don't want to have a war with these

1291
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,447
What are the process

1292
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,727
Pyrrhic victory

1293
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,775
No you lose

1294
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:24,127
That's why you don't you don't want

1295
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,431
Yeah nobody's actually going to

1296
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,711
Fight a civil war

1297
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,527
It would be absurd

1298
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,575
I mean frankly just be expense

1299
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:35,391
Heather will be here

1300
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:39,743
More and greater right-wing terrorism

1301
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:43,839
Dunno what happened really because

1302
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,863
As much as

1303
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,703
Some of that is galvanizing for his community

1304
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,727
No denying

1305
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,263
Oklahoma City bombing

1306
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,799
Certainly something there

1307
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:54,335
They've made a lot of mileage on

1308
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,871
It's also a lot of work

1309
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:56,895
It's a hassle

1310
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,431
And you rather not do that

1311
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,199
Weather

1312
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,735
Play in this this space

1313
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,319
This Schrodinger's bombing

1314
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:07,647
Space that Alex is in now is much easier to

1315
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,415
To live in

1316
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,695
Well and I mean not

1317
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,463
Just that bud

1318
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:13,279
If you're going to have a civil war you then you have to have a

1319
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,559
The concept of your endgame

1320
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,095
And

1321
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,655
If you're the terrorist side then

1322
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,191
Ostensibly your endgame is

1323
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,215
Defensive

1324
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,775
Maintaining your territory

1325
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,567
What is your territory

1326
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,103
Occupied Texas

1327
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:32,991
I mean that's what I'm saying so if you win the civil war do you get all of America or do you get

1328
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,271
A certain subset

1329
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:37,855
Open of America and you don't want a subsection of America

1330
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,903
Right everybody who's

1331
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,695
How would you get all

1332
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:45,535
They can't there's no infrastructure that they can handle

1333
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,839
There's no way to get water

1334
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:52,703
Win win the civil war they're like ours all the Wild West

1335
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,727
They can't govern

1336
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:54,751
True

1337
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,799
You know how like

1338
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:00,383
Alex believes the Trump is the rightful president of the u.s.

1339
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:06,783
I'm sure he thinks the Confederacy is the rightful government of the US

1340
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:10,623
Mid-South didn't just not lose the Civil War they wanted all the way right

1341
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,927
To get back to that

1342
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:15,231
Byron Scott

1343
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,255
Inconceivable

1344
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,791
That's fair it's on me

1345
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,583
So

1346
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,375
Workday

1347
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:23,935
Baguette

1348
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,471
Trucks

1349
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,751
Fuel oil bomb

1350
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,663
But if we put enough

1351
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,431
Cheat on them

1352
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,807
Learn about this

1353
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:42,111
Neutralize

1354
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,671
So we are bombs and trucks

1355
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,207
Ready to go

1356
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,231
Right today

1357
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:48,255
This is Extreme

1358
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,279
Yeah

1359
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,583
If I believe any of this I'd be pretty scared

1360
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,423
Real struggle to get her

1361
01:00:55,935 --> 01:01:00,287
Sure and I mean if you believe all this like OKC was a false flag

1362
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,591
Fuel bomb truck

1363
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,615
Ready to go

1364
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,663
You kind of have to

1365
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,431
To think that

1366
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,735
The target would be a civilian Target

1367
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,503
Yeah

1368
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,039
If you're somebody you just

1369
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:14,879
Lives and bike listen to Alex

1370
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:19,999
I don't know how you could not think like well maybe the building that I work in

1371
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,303
Could be a Target or Thursday

1372
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:25,119
Got2b cripplingly scary

1373
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:25,887
Weather is

1374
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:28,703
The conscious fear or not like he's got to be

1375
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,727
Something that

1376
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:34,591
Doleful benefits of volcano Casey it's not like

1377
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:37,663
It's not like all this only happens in the major cities

1378
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,943
It's like that is

1379
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:42,015
I mean it's not not a hurry but it is like

1380
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:46,111
That is more of the well it could happen in my supper

1381
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:48,415
Mid-range

1382
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,439
Insidious

1383
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,487
Nah. Not a metropolis right

1384
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,303
Yeah

1385
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,095
And I pick up the feeling that he wants.

1386
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,655
So Alex is Alexa

1387
01:01:59,167 --> 01:01:59,935
But he's talked

1388
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,239
Did they say who

1389
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:04,543
I can agree with him

1390
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,919
High-level current CIA

1391
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:10,687
High level

1392
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:11,711
Army

1393
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,735
Special operation

1394
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:15,295
And I concur with my analysis

1395
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,087
104

1396
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,183
But I'ma see those people

1397
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,743
Obviously

1398
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:24,767
People that have

1399
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:28,607
Agreed

1400
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:36,031
Martial law that's f****** Steve

1401
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,871
A bestiary is 100% of Stevie way2go

1402
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,639
Oh yeah

1403
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,943
Guys who have run regime-change

1404
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:47,807
Beazer epithets that Alex uses to describe Steve pieczenik

1405
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,599
And he's

1406
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:51,135
Not saying the word

1407
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,183
He's backsliding into this

1408
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:54,975
Abusive relation

1409
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:58,303
I have a matter of time

1410
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:03,423
It is God and get it back already

1411
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,191
Now

1412
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,751
I do think

1413
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,031
That it would make

1414
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,335
Sense that these high-level people

1415
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,103
Agree with Alex

1416
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,127
Because we heard

1417
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,687
Not too long ago that the f****** leader

1418
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,783
Yeah but he doesn't even remember that

1419
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,343
He does not remember that he is not

1420
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,951
Calling people right you are until I brought it up you forgot I completely forgot

1421
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,231
Is the day today

1422
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:33,631
It's a day-to-day you're not at all of the Patriots in the

1423
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,727
They look to him as leader of course they're not

1424
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,031
Geico intersect

1425
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:42,847
What are they doing with analysis shouldn't they know s***

1426
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,639
Deborah

1427
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,967
It's there

1428
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:54,367
The things they know from The Things They Know shouldn't be calling them to confirm his analysis and not have them

1429
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,927
Be like we were thinking the same thing bro

1430
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:59,999
We don't have any explanation or why

1431
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:03,583
He's just talking s*** with people

1432
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,631
You don't actually have any

1433
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,399
Brother's Day

1434
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,935
They're not like high-level

1435
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,727
Talkingshit with

1436
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:12,543
Basically

1437
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,591
I'm not fun

1438
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,127
This clip

1439
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:18,175
I was really where I am

1440
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:19,199
If I were

1441
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,271
Involved in towel throwing

1442
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:25,599
This is maybe where I would throw the towel on this

1443
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,999
So they are getting ready to

1444
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,815
Bye

1445
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,863
Attacker whatever

1446
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,447
Poisoning

1447
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:43,775
There's a plethora

1448
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,823
Things they can do within the

1449
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,359
Call flag

1450
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,407
Realm

1451
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:55,039
Because

1452
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,599
I want a few weeks to maximizer

1453
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,671
RhymeZone

1454
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:02,975
Tober first

1455
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:08,863
Going to start stuff up

1456
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:14,239
Is that all part of operation matador

1457
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:16,031
The truck bombs are loaded

1458
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:19,615
You better believe the mentally ill schizophrenic Mass shooters

1459
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,175
Drugged up

1460
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:25,247
Government cecia New World Order

1461
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,807
Programming centers for operation

1462
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:28,575
Right now

1463
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,903
They are rolling out

1464
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:34,207
Guaranteed you can bet your bottom dollar

1465
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:40,863
Zoning out a little bit because it's just repetitive yelling nonsense about false

1466
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,447
Flags that I kind of got brought back down to the ground by this clip

1467
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:45,983
Like what

1468
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,775
What are we doing

1469
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:52,383
What Alex is conspiracy in this Grand false-flag that's coming and Biden

1470
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,175
Speech is a Harbinger for it

1471
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,711
It all centers around the

1472
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,247
F****** midterm I mean

1473
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,271
The plot for the

1474
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:01,855
Volkswagen by creating the public perception that it makes

1475
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,671
Sentence for Democrats to win midterm elections

1476
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,463
What is going on

1477
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:10,559
And it's not just that but

1478
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:11,327
Please listing

1479
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,375
Everything is a sign

1480
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:18,751
Like every you know it's not just false Flags where it's like oh there's an explosion or something

1481
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,775
No it's like

1482
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:22,847
Hey the power went out for 8 hours

1483
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:26,431
For you anything

Could be explained as the jump off

1485
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:32,063
Yeah he's lifting random ass s***

1486
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:35,903
You know anybody

Is everything any of anyone's on Rises and the rooster is silent

1488
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,119
Looks Shifty at you in the grocery store that

1489
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:52,543
You know like there's no Escape if you see a rainbow in the colors are inverted weight

1490
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:59,711
Back they've been beaten back we have neutralized

1491
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,015
Powerball

1492
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,343
It's insane abs

1493
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,927
The notion that it's about the midterms is just pathetic

1494
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,463
I can't

1495
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,791
There was

1496
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:17,119
Lisa self seriousness that Alex had

1497
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,167
In earlier times in his career

1498
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:21,727
Where that would this would look embarrassed

1499
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:22,751
For him

1500
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,775
To be like going

1501
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,311
So far out of his way to

1502
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,591
To create these elaborate

1503
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,871
Conspiracy theories

1504
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,895
About

1505
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,431
Something like a mid

1506
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,711
Midterm election

1507
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,479
Yeah

1508
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,247
It's

1509
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,271
It's

1510
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,807
Howell Howell

1511
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,855
Best is he with like

1512
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:39,391
Breeding

1513
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,671
Like politics

1514
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,695
Like sports

1515
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:44,511
Yeah, like a pop-culture kind of thing

1516
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:45,791
He's doing

1517
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,327
This about a midterm

1518
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,863
So sad

1519
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,423
Yeah man supposed to be about

1520
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,959
2911

1521
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,751
Now you're at the mid

1522
01:07:55,007 --> 01:08:01,151
911 is coming in order for Democrats to win

1523
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,687
Sad

1524
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:03,967
It's

1525
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,735
Hey

1526
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,759
It's the most important election

1527
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:11,903
I mean I think that a lot of people very rightly critique that kind of rhetoric all over

1528
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:14,207
The place that night I think that's fine

1529
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:16,767
I just I think that Alex is doing a

1530
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:20,863
Substantially worse version of it more extreme version

1531
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,911
What a bummer yeah

1532
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,447
Calls

1533
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,263
To talk to people who are like

1534
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,567
You know in the military

1535
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:30,591
Are you going to bomb something

1536
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:33,407
Because it should be a false flag

1537
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:39,807
Negril at people about that

1538
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:42,879
Okay I'm taking calls my first question to everyone

1539
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:45,439
Have you or are you about to build a bomb

1540
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,463
I think

1541
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,559
In the past I have heard people say like how it's going to talk to you all fair

1542
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:55,935
Maybe not on the radio

1543
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:59,007
He says he wants to take calls from military Folk

1544
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,287
Uno thing

1545
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,847
I would suggest

1546
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,127
It is a bad

1547
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:07,967
Strategy because they didn't send devices people to lie about being in the military

1548
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:11,039
I'm only taking calls from military people that go

1549
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:13,087
Hey guess what now I'm military

1550
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:13,855
Yeah

1551
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:20,511
I don't know if you recall that story of The Bundys and all those dudes sitting around

1552
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:26,911
I'm talking about their f****** military experience doubt all their wartime s*** none of them had ever been in the Army at all

1553
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,191
Yeah

1554
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:31,775
They brought that up on here for

1555
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:38,175
Alex takes a call from somebody who is allegedly movie National Security or made

1556
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:42,015
Maybe ice could be anybody resumes dubious

1557
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:44,319
And I have some news about a bomb

1558
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:47,135
Tony is a 15-year Homeland Security

1559
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,415
And he wants

1560
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:50,719
Washington d.c.

1561
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,487
Johnny

1562
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,047
Hey how you doing a mistake God bless you

1563
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,375
15 former federal employee

1564
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,167
Protection work for ice

1565
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,703
Regard

1566
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,471
To the

1567
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:03,775
Everything is coming about

1568
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,127
They wanted us to

1569
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,151
Do the vaccine man

1570
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,735
Gmail

1571
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:16,575
There will be there will be

1572
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,159
I still work there

1573
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,719
It's going to be a nuclear bomb

1574
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,255
Plutonium or uranium

1575
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,535
-

1576
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,303
Anymore

1577
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:31,935
Set a lock down so not a nuclear bomb

1578
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,983
Power outage but without the

1579
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:42,175
-2 radiation

1580
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,199
14 / 8

1581
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,111
Beer people some people can be also

1582
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:54,463
Clear plastic explosive

1583
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,999
It's going to be a neutron bomb

1584
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:57,791
We got

1585
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:58,559
Supplies

1586
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,631
I figured we got

1587
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:02,911
As you know about the body bags

1588
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:03,935
Myself my

1589
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,495
Bodybag Culver

1590
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:11,871
Tire spot

1591
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,151
Which is Kissinger

1592
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:16,479
A skier obsessed with Neutron bombs and populate America

1593
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,783
This guy sounds a little speedy

1594
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,319
I mean

1595
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:25,183
He's more chatty than any CBP officer I've ever anymore

1596
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:28,767
Because he left over vaccine mandate

1597
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,791
6 months ago

1598
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,583
Sure vaccine mandates

1599
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:37,983
Neutron bomb is not just a nuke minus the radiation there's still tons of radiation but the

1600
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,031
Concept is to minimize the long

1601
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:45,151
Longevity that the radiation is the affected areas

1602
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:47,199
Inhabited more quick

1603
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,503
Get people back in

1604
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,039
But I guess

1605
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:54,879
We should be on the lookout for nuclear bombs that have no radiation involved cuz this

1606
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:58,463
High-level ice Insider has warned of a tan Alex

1607
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,511
Disagree this is a serious concerns

1608
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,303
We should probably be really worried about

1609
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,071
This is busy

1610
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,607
Is definitely worth your mind

1611
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:11,263
Yeah yeah yeah guy dubiously associated with federal government programs

1612
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:15,359
Ostensibly. On speed right now telling me that

1613
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:19,199
Nuclear bombs without plutonium are going to hit people

1614
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:26,367
I'm going to go with a pass on this one you passed I passed cuz Alex said I agree

1615
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:32,767
The difference with this business

1616
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,815
The difference between you and Alex

1617
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:37,119
I'll drink another color he's got an idea

1618
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:38,911
Talk to you

1619
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,471
My personal opinion is that

1620
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,287
Maurice White

1621
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,103
And if you notice there's a lot of

1622
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:47,871
Ukrainian

1623
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:50,431
I'm through there I haven't noticed

1624
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,455
Are you going to use these

1625
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,223
Ukrainian

1626
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,247
His body has

1627
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,343
Mesa Falls

1628
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:03,743
And they're going to dress him up and Trump

1629
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:04,767
Trump gear

1630
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:05,791
And have them do so

1631
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:06,559
Some stuff

1632
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:07,327
And

1633
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:08,863
Martial law

1634
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:14,239
So look out for ukrainians dress up as Trump supporters carry a neutron bomb

1635
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,287
Martial law also trucks

1636
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:18,335
Swiss fuel bombs already

1637
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:20,127
Gassed up and ready to go

1638
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:24,479
A boy we got a lot of things to worry about this is a concern.

1639
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:26,527
A buckshot of

1640
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:28,575
Concern if the

1641
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:31,391
Did he say that he's seen

1642
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:36,511
He hasn't seen ukrainians coming through the Border

1643
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,791
Soma care

1644
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,815
Mexico

1645
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:45,215
What does the zoo ukrainians are going through Mexico they fly into El Salvador

1646
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:48,543
If you created the coming through the portal

1647
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:51,615
Well there's a tunnel from Ukraine to Brazil

1648
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:52,383
And then

1649
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:55,199
North Korea

1650
01:13:56,735 --> 01:14:00,831
From North Korea you know the channel connect France and the UK

1651
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:07,487
Okay you know I have that but Ukraine in Brazil

1652
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:11,071
And they're like listen we could go to the United States

1653
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:15,423
But those m************ UK my way

1654
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,727
We're going to take the land

1655
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:23,103
Route through Arizona or whatever you might be thinking about this wrong

1656
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,407
Did you know there's an Odessa in Texas

1657
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:32,063
Did not know that is there a teleportation device

1658
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:38,463
Okay Dallas support portal territory

1659
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,231
So

1660
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:43,327
Lot easier to get a suitcase nuke through I would think so

1661
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:45,887
Anyway and has connections with

1662
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:46,911
Quote those

1663
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:49,215
The whole country or country

1664
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:51,775
So we'll see who disagrees

1665
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:57,151
This is a good example of pointless to disagree without

1666
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:57,919
Michelle

1667
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:01,247
Kohl's right now let's go to

1668
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:03,807
John in Vegas

1669
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,111
Yeah I'm looking at

1670
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,391
At the Biden transcript

1671
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,671
Right now and

1672
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:14,559
Little thing that you're talking about in this I tell you what

1673
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,583
What you're doing

1674
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,863
Edging your audience

1675
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,911
Is embarrassing

1676
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:22,495
A shame your seminar caller

1677
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,031
You said you were calling on up

1678
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,311
Air Force

1679
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:29,151
The club right now while you're gaslighting

1680
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,991
Even the Washington Post said it was basically a declaration of war

1681
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:36,319
Everywhere

1682
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:46,303
Unprecedented

1683
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:50,143
Denying that

1684
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:54,751
Two-player games

1685
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:58,079
Controlling your thermostat

1686
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,015
Everybody Talks

1687
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,551
Flashlight

1688
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:14,207
Food color is a good example of why you can't really inject disagreement on Alex's own show Even if you have a valid point like how

1689
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,999
None of the things I like to say about Biden

1690
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,023
Streator Acura

1691
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:22,655
So it's good is hang up on you talk over you call you with seminar collar and create fake reasons

1692
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,679
Not engaged anymore

1693
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:24,447
Your points

1694
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:27,007
He can list off weird unrelated talking points

1695
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,543
Distracted listener

1696
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,591
I was like what exactly does your Therma

1697
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,383
Girls that have to do with whether or not

1698
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,919
Play Alex's discussing

1699
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,199
Speeches accurate

1700
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,735
I believe

1701
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,271
I believe he was actually speaking

1702
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,551
Literally nuts Apex

1703
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,319
If you if you

1704
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,343
Scan the sentence

1705
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:43,647
Since then he's actually the stacks of Articles them

1706
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:44,415
Selves

1707
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,951
That are controlling our

1708
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:46,719
Thermostat

1709
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:49,791
So that was just letting everybody know that the stacks of Arden

1710
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,839
Cuz it's taking over

1711
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,631
The amount of printing

1712
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:56,959
And wasting of paper and non recycling that Alex does

1713
01:16:57,215 --> 01:17:03,359
Does taking a shower with state governments have had to control your thermostat

1714
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:09,759
Thermostats because we can't stop printing second-story will reflect

1715
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:14,623
That's that is a theory

1716
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:18,207
Soundscan also dislike move the goalposts and pretend

1717
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:23,583
Only you've been honest about why you called in he would have engaged with your points total

1718
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:28,447
He cannot play any of the clips and present his unwillingness to present his own evidence

1719
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:31,775
As an unwillingness to engage with your games that you're playing

1720
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:38,687
Pulling into screams Alex is pointless and even though the prime directive of our show you know to not interfere with info

1721
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,223
Kind of destroyed

1722
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:43,295
Because of our presence at the trial and might work with the plaintiff

1723
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:46,623
I still think that it's important to point out that this just is

1724
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:49,695
Something it's going to go anywhere. I would not incentivize

1725
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,743
That behavior

1726
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:58,143
Although I do kind of wrestle this cuz I think that person probably is a listener varsho cuz he's the edging Chrome

1727
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,679
I'm not saying that

1728
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,447
Weave

1729
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:06,847
Popularized edging but I didn't realize I don't think I've heard anywhere else

1730
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,015
Specifically ours yeah

1731
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:16,831
Or at least they give the

1732
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,111
Suspicion

1733
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,135
Strongly

1734
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,927
And I kind of considered not

1735
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:27,327
Playing even because I might be some of the f****** with Alex about

1736
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,607
Creating like

1737
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:33,215
Trying to mess with him it was just giving a disagreement about

1738
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:38,079
The point that he was making using the edging doesn't necessarily mean he listen

1739
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:44,479
Could be it could be one of those words that just starts to get popularized through the

1740
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:48,063
He's not even bring it up

1741
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:50,623
Is

1742
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,927
Played in the past times or like that's

1743
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:54,975
Somebody wasn't

1744
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:57,023
Incentivize that right I don't want

1745
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,047
People to think like

1746
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:04,447
If they listen get on our show through if I don't want anyone to think of that is like

1747
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,727
Something that

1748
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:07,519
What is or or is it will

1749
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:08,543
Like

1750
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:10,335
Behave good job

1751
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:12,639
Soccer with Alex

1752
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:19,039
Or a thing that they compete with that people compete with each other on it like oh if it's funny enough it'll get on the show

1753
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,319
That's not going to happen

1754
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:25,695
This is just a good teachable moment where this person had a point

1755
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,231
That's a Alex

1756
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,767
Could not respond to

1757
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:33,887
Can you see the all of the methods and he deploys immediately in order to get out of this

1758
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:34,655
Just call

1759
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:37,727
Delegitimize the person as a seminar caller

1760
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,519
Accuse them of gaslighting

1761
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,567
Say I would play the clip

1762
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:46,175
But you don't deserve it because you lied I wouldn't gave with your points but you lied

1763
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:52,575
Yell over them before they better go you disagree with

1764
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:54,111
I disagree with the way your

1765
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:56,415
Exactly just cut it off.

1766
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,439
It's not

1767
01:19:57,695 --> 01:20:00,767
There's no win

1768
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,351
0 Oz is the psych Warfare

1769
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,375
Gaston

1770
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,399
I will.

1771
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,679
No I'm bored

1772
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:11,007
We're not going to listen to much of it

1773
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,799
I found it to be a little bit

1774
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:13,567
Like

1775
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,848
I don't know boring

1776
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:18,944
But we have one clip you and I don't think that this is exactly

1777
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,248
The beginning that Alex wanted

1778
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,784
I to this interview

1779
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:29,184
Studio weather for the next hour plus he is recognized

1780
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:35,584
Formation psychology

1781
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,888
Psychology department of psychology

1782
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,936
Educational Sciences

1783
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:42,752
They said University Belgium

1784
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:51,200
Joe Rogan

1785
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,992
A show as well

1786
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:55,808
You want to get right into Biden speech professor

1787
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,344
And just how

1788
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:01,440
Nighttime with troops behind him with red lights

1789
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:04,000
It's right out of

1790
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,280
Germany's right out of

1791
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:07,584
Stalin's Russia North Korea

1792
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:11,168
Our enemies are going to be

1793
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:13,984
We've got to have a war with him what did you make of that

1794
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:24,224
Vices

1795
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,296
People who are

1796
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:32,160
Represent by Nas

1797
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:33,440
The mega extremists

1798
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:35,488
These people

1799
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,048
And that's why

1800
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:39,072
What should be avoided

1801
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,888
It will be

1802
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,240
The people act

1803
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,800
Because the system

1804
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:50,848
Control aggression

1805
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,920
Crucial importance

1806
01:21:57,504 --> 01:22:00,576
Resistance and realized

1807
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:03,136
Foremost

1808
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,416
You have to watch

1809
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:09,024
I would sell its name to this aggression

1810
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:14,400
This is not really what Alex wanted

1811
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:20,800
The professor isn't describing a false flag he's saying that Biden speech with possibly a bad idea because it'll be you

1812
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:25,408
Used as justification for people who want to do violent things when they do violent things

1813
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:28,992
This isn't good with that Alex's concept

1814
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:32,576
Because it basically is admitting it out of community real largely incline

1815
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,600
Towards violence

1816
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:39,744
They don't have a good handle on that internal enemy that is aggression and are begging for someone to give them a reason to act on

1817
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:43,072
Understood appropriately this episode as base

1818
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:45,120
Sleeping I was tripping over himself

1819
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:45,888
The frame Biden

1820
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:46,912
Speech in a way that in

1821
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,704
Inflames that aggression is Audia

1822
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:53,568
Basil lip-service to not wanting any violence so we can evade any accusations

1823
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,336
Goody's causes

1824
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:56,384
Calling for terrorist

1825
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:59,456
Put simply I don't respect anybody who except

1826
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:03,552
What's a booking on Infowars but this guy is coming out to the conversation to Biden speech

1827
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,344
Completely different perspective

1828
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,112
But Alex

1829
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:08,416
And I think that their views are actually at all.

1830
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:09,440
Each other

1831
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:13,280
I disagree with the professors Point mostly because if taken to its logical

1832
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,584
Two conclusion you end up in a place where criticizing

1833
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,656
Any potentially violent segment of the population is bad

1834
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:20,960
Because it will trigger their aggression

1835
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:22,496
But I do accept

1836
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:23,776
Pointers at least

1837
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:26,336
Connected to reality and it's something that can be debated

1838
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:29,408
Position is more less just rooted in his feeling

1839
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,944
Wings and it's not something you can

1840
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:31,968
Deborah few

1841
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,272
At all it would be pointless to argue with

1842
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:36,064
I'm about a conversation

1843
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:36,832
Is

1844
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:38,112
Alex saying

1845
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:38,880
When

1846
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:41,440
The people that I've riled up to

1847
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,720
Violence

1848
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,512
April

1849
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:47,072
And his conversation is

1850
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:48,096
Actually

1851
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,376
They shouldn't

1852
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,144
Do violet

1853
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,192
Because that is

1854
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,728
Is the the thing

1855
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:55,008
But if Alex

1856
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:57,056
But if you say that to Alex's listeners

1857
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:58,848
Then they won't do violin

1858
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:03,200
And then there will be a false flag because they won't actually be an actual attack

1859
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:04,480
So those

1860
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:06,528
To those two conversation

1861
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,600
Are in direct opposition in terms of gold

1862
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:11,136
Call Alex kind of wing

1863
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:13,952
Viva like violence

1864
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:16,768
This is an attempt to

1865
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:19,328
Do you know what this metaphor with the Matador

1866
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,864
Like it is

1867
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:21,888
If you

1868
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:27,264
Metaphor it is what this doctor this

1869
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:31,104
This is an attempt to lure you into doing

1870
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:31,872
Something

1871
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:34,176
I'm as opposed to it being fake

1872
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:40,064
That's not a larger possibility

1873
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,856
Is false flag

1874
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:43,648
The term

1875
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:44,416
Includes

1876
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:51,072
People doing things they shouldn't do because Biden made them angry

1877
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:52,352
Flag loses any meaning

1878
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,632
As a term

1879
01:24:54,400 --> 01:25:00,544
So if Alex is describing that as something to qualify for the phone then I would say we have

1880
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,848
Past the point where anything

1881
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,128
Has any

1882
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:08,736
Definition yeah yeah cuz the idea false flag

1883
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:12,064
It has to include I planned this

1884
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:14,880
To achieve the opposite of what

1885
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:20,768
Theoretically I want something on somebody else

1886
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:22,560
To frame a person

1887
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:24,608
Which implies

1888
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,376
Intent

1889
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:27,936
Whereas this is if you include

1890
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:28,960
They

1891
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:30,240
Photo quotes

1892
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:32,544
Nothing

1893
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,104
Then I wanted to do already right

1894
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:37,152
That's just responsibility

1895
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:43,552
Just called responsible for your action trapperman because I didn't like Biden speech

1896
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:45,088
I don't know really like

1897
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:47,904
I mean it is a little bit like every like okay hey

1898
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,440
Here's a good speech

1899
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:52,256
People shouldn't steal from

1900
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:54,304
The grocery store cuz the people need food

1901
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:59,424
I know like that makes me want to steal from grocery stores

1902
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:00,704
But when I did

1903
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,032
It was cuz he tricked me

1904
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:05,568
That makes sense

1905
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:06,848
I like it

1906
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:08,384
Yeah

1907
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,432
One of the things you should take away from this

1908
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,200
Is that

1909
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:13,248
Regardless of whether

1910
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,296
Alex

1911
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,576
Is talking

1912
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:18,880
Incoherently with this metaphor in stuff

1913
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:19,648
Or

1914
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:23,488
If you really does believe that if you bomb something

1915
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,512
Because you're mad if I did

1916
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:27,584
Speech that's a false flag whatever the case

1917
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,632
The term false flag is meaningless to him

1918
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:31,936
What is a signifier of something

1919
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,472
That is just like

1920
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:34,496
Don't take

1921
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,776
Take this seriously

1922
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:36,544
Where is audio

1923
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,568
Stu like not

1924
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:39,104
Accept any kind of like

1925
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,920
Idea that

1926
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:43,200
The information space

1927
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:45,760
But they live in and the stuff that Alex is emanate

1928
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:47,808
Is part of the viola

1929
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:52,672
What's right is part of inflaming that aggression right that that's what false flag

1930
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:54,208
It means don't

1931
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:55,232
Include this

1932
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,256
In your balance

1933
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:57,280
Of

1934
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:59,584
Consequences of this world

1935
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:04,192
Ironically to return to an earlier metaphor than Alex himself made

1936
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,216
If you are taking

1937
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:07,520
Taking your three-year-old daughter to the zoo

1938
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:09,056
And you're looking an elephant

1939
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:09,824
And you go

1940
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,872
That's not f****** elephant

1941
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:12,896
Fake elephants

1942
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,944
Then that's more like what Alex

1943
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:16,480
Again the trip at the zoo has

1944
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:21,088
Cancel cuz Alex needs to report this 3-hour video that he ended up not recorded

1945
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:23,136
Maybe next time little lucy

1946
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:27,744
Yeah this interview this guy found very boring

1947
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:33,632
I mean he's talking about this idea of like a mass formation

1948
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:36,448
Chess video the idea that

1949
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:40,800
Part of the population has been tricked into thinking covid is

1950
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:44,128
Real and it because of

1951
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,152
What is fate

1952
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:50,016
We need to do all this stuff in order to battle covid invariant

1953
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:51,552
Hypnotic state moreless

1954
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,880
If you listen to it if you want to

1955
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:57,184
Go ahead but if you do

1956
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,208
You'll notice that

1957
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,232
A lot of

1958
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,792
Maybe all love

1959
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,376
The things that he is describing as being indicative of this

1960
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:08,192
They sort of hypnotic right that people are in

1961
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:09,216
Kind of

1962
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:09,984
Describe

1963
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:10,752
People who

1964
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,032
Support Trump

1965
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:13,824
And I just

1966
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,640
I found it to be an uncompelling interview and

1967
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,432
This

1968
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:20,224
Phoenix get his verbal patterns

1969
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:21,248
Prairie

1970
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,272
Boring

1971
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,296
I hate it

1972
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:26,368
I really don't like that guy's using terms that I think Alex

1973
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:29,440
Kind of not understanding and dancing around yeah

1974
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,208
It's just

1975
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,232
Ida Ida

1976
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:36,096
This is very little to do with what I think is important which is Alex's response

1977
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:37,120
To Biden speech

1978
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,400
Rite Aid so

1979
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:40,192
We will leave it off there

1980
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:46,592
But yeah so be worried about ukrainians dressed as Trump supporters who have forgotten that already

1981
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:48,384
Suitcase nukes

1982
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,920
Anytime

1983
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:50,944
Portals

1984
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:55,040
Keep an eye out about

1985
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:57,856
Possibility of fuel

1986
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:03,744
And also the midterms coming up

1987
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:08,096
Also you noticed Alex is like doing other stuff but he's not saying go vote

1988
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:17,824
Talking about the

1989
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:18,848
Get out and vote

1990
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:21,152
There's no real like a there's a

1991
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:23,456

1992
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:27,040
Who's going to sponsor registration Drive

1993
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:28,832

Donate turkey exactly
