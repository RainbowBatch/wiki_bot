1
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for its knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

2
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
MoneyGram

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,832
Facebook.com

4
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:07,328
Saline from afar and talk a little bit about

5
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,352
Alex Jones

6
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,632
Zen hotel room

7
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,680
When did we are Dan Jordan

8
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:15,008
What's up

9
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,544
Vibrate Spotify

10
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,176
Is to fold the first is that we are heading back to Chicago

11
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,856
Without without giving too much away in terms of dachshund our location

12
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,208
Do not tell all that much the

13
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,000
Service not good

14
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,304
Is a lot of noise from

15
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,352
The building next to us

16
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:46,752
I've been multiple false alarm fire alarm

17
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:52,128
Yeah I miss my cat and I want to go home I want to see how my potato plants are coming along

18
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,528
Half the plugs in my room when I got there and I bet $5,000 they're going to try and

19
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,928
Charge me for it yeah so we've been here and we've experienced a lot of the trial and we've seen

20
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,720
Things being in the room

21
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
And what have you

22
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,048
And we figured that

23
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,608
Tomorrow being a travel day

24
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,216
Would be the most economical thing for us to do in terms of being able to

25
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,800
I'll be back and respond to some of the results of the trial

26
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,104
Supposed to staying like

27
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Another

28
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,640
Week

29
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:29,504
Yeah I was out of control

30
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,904
Yeah God knows if we start thinking hey we're going to be just stick it out the trial of infowar

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,304
Like

32
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,072
Maybe

33
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:49,472
The NFL just deliberate 45 minutes and then we'll be fine

34
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,776
You don't really know and so I am

35
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,824
Excited to go home be able to sleep

36
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
Vodka.

37
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,736
But just with a cat on me and that'll be great

38
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:05,344
But it's been nice and I appreciate the

39
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
The kindness of

40
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
Evokes

41
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:13,792
You're outside of the hotel on this bright spot is

42
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,584
DJ Marky

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,144
I was working on a Cantina Theme remix

44
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:24,800
And I'm like and where it's going man that whenever two theme remix of her theme song

45
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
I need it now dad

46
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:31,200
I'm going to lose my mind

47
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
I'm here let alone

48
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648
Going forward

49
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,440
That's true if you like it

50
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:46,048
Much like the Caravan of the project had a theme of its theme song but it's like

51
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:52,448
Vibe of its own this trip has really been Cantina thieves

52
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,008
Is it is the medically appropriate

53
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,032
The house serious

54
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,312
Alex is taking the

55
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,896
Through every talk about that a little bit today but

56
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,224
My bright spot is today

57
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,528
My bright spot was

58
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,880
Also the dark spot and just maybe the most powerful

59
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,672
Miss Lewis

60
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,256
Looked Alex in the f****** I and Alex

61
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
Blanched

62
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
You know

63
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,351
True

64
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,935
Yeah I wish I could use better words but really

65
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
Really

66
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
That was that was powerful

67
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:31,103
Recording this on Tuesday and today was

68
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,175
I think fair to described as the

69
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,015
Jonathan Moore a heavy day of

70
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,551
Testimony that we heard

71
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,135
You had Neil Hansel and and Scarlett Lewis take

72
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
The stand

73
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:48,767
And Alex was not there during meals testimony

74
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,071
And I think that that was

75
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
I mean first of all just

76
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
The passive active disrespect

77
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
Maybe someone

78
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,799
But he did show up

79
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,103
For the middle

80
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,639
Of scarlet

81
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,687
Testimony

82
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,735
Thank ya yeah and

83
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,271
Her poise

84
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,575
In being able to

85
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
Say things like

86
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,159
Sort of blood Lee and correctly

87
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
Text was

88
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,839
I don't know I don't know I don't know how you do that

89
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,143
I really don't I really don't

90
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:30,751
I really really really really really really don't and I

91
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,311
Could not admire her more enough

92
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:39,967
Well I think that I mean I've looked at Alex in the face before

93
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:45,087
I think that you see the eyes of a of a fish when you look at him

94
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
Like I don't think that like

95
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:54,559
I feel like if you're expecting to have some sort of an emotional impact when you're saying emotionally impactful words yeah

96
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
It's

97
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
Kind of a

98
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,471
If it's a chore that will not be completed

99
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
At some

100
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
Points in time

101
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,663
The way he looks out and his eyes kind of going opposite directions I halfway think his tongue is going to

102
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
Shootout in like get a bug off of one of them

103
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,063
And then and then you're like I caught that

104
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,367
Your lizard

105
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,439
Swear

106
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,743
But yeah I am so just be able to like

107
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,535
Power through that

108
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
Is

109
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
Admirable

110
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:35,263
It's all talk a little bit about that and then be going over Alex's show from today as well

111
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
August 2nd

112
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:43,199
2022 he was doing while the trial was

113
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
Testify

114
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,783
I feel like

115
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,831
There's not a whole lot more

116
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
To say then

117
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,903
The two of them

118
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
Gave

119
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,791
Quite powerful testimony moving

120
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,863
There was some tears in the courtroom and what have you

121
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,167
Are you did

122
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:08,031
I tried not to look at you

123
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,871
You were fine but gavi

124
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,199
I don't I don't have a whole lot to analyze

125
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,247
Of that other than to say was

126
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
Quite a thing to behold

127
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,831
The mood in the courtroom was quite

128
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,879
Serious true

129
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:27,487
And then Alex showed up and things are a little bit less serious

130
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,023
It is kind of crazy

131
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,351
To let me know and I told you if you know when we were walking

132
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
To the court I was like

133
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,447
Today is going to be the weirdest juxtaposition that may Everett

134
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Yeah

135
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,775
And God damn it if it didn't live up to

136
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:44,127
Yeah yeah just emotionally difficult and

137
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,967
Sort of optimistic even within the darkness

138
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,783
Kind of conversation about

139
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,343
But people who've gone through hell and

140
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
Then

141
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,927
You know we're coming back from lunch

142
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
Standing outside

143
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,535
The the courthouse

144
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,351
7 maybe now reporters

145
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,631
Larry 7

146
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:12,031
Do lakeover Infowars fans except for Rob dues mom I think

147
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:18,431
It might have been his mom's old lady who said that she was filming for Rob to and then you told her not to use

148
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,479
Is the iPhone cuz it has too many chemtrails

149
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:28,415
Which is a mistake you should have said 5G

150
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:34,815
Like all I've got is Chemtrails that was my only polci that's has you marked you as a prankster and she did not take your warning screen

151
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,863
No I know but yeah it's

152
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:43,263
It was it was bizarre cuz you know Alex shows up and he's like the Democrats are jamming me up

153
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
It was the

154
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
Great

155
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,663
Alex got2b stand

156
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
Did a little bit of

157
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
Direct

158
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:58,367
Questioning who you love so much

159
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,695
And I don't know I think

160
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,767
By the end of the day

161
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,095
The judge was saying that Alex had lied under oath twice

162
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:14,495
Right numbers low for I think you missed a few things

163
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,311
Some things you could be understood to have me

164
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:23,455
Better like to pick up on this like Alex saying that he left

165
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:29,855
Rockwall because there's just too much prime

166
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:39,327
Yeah or the cops were going to kill him because he uncovered a drug ring that's within the police department

167
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
Euro boy

168
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,543
So they do their stuff like that but it was just kind of like

169
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,359
Directed story about why you're so great

170
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,943
And your your various accomplishments in the field of

171
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,783
Roguish journalism

172
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,855
It was it was as if like

173
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,695
Imagine you had never learned

174
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,511
And in fact never learned language at all

175
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,815
You were born in a cave

176
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,351
You lived in a cave

177
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,679
You are 45 years old when you walked into this trial

178
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:21,055
The moment you saw Alex start talking you would immediately understand the definition of the word bloviate

179
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,895
And it would just pop into your head and that would be the only word you can speak

180
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,175
You be like

181
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,199
Baby

182
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
That's what it is that's what it was

183
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,295
Yeah it was covid-19

184
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
Is the epitome

185
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,671
By the end of the day the day

186
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
With

187
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
The judge

188
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,791
Dismissing the jury

189
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:46,911
Ban Mark raising some important questions about things that Alex had said

190
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
Alex

191
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,983
Said that you was bankrupt

192
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:56,127
On the sand can't do that which is directly against the orders of the judge

193
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,199
Concerns was that his lawyer led him to that

194
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:06,367
That that statement more or less he did one hundred percent absolutely on purpose

195
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
Exactly also

196
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,463
And then also Alex brought up

197
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,279
Lawyer had brought up in in

198
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,327
In terms of the line of questioning

199
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,655
The notion that he is not

200
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:23,007
Guilty of the things that you

201
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
How many times

202
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
I am going to observe

203
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,639
In a trial about damages

204
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
And attempt to prove

205
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
Wild it is wild

206
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:36,831
So we ended on a bit I mean do you know if this were a

207
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,391
The TV show there's a bit of a cliffhanger

208
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:43,743
Aspect to it that is like serious problems are brought up with how things are going

209
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:49,375
Direct examination isn't done so that'll still pick up tomorrow or a sauce

210
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,679
And so

211
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:56,543
I think I speak for you as well and that like

212
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,591
There was an exhausting

213
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
Today I think

214
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,967
Obviously for other people more than us

215
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,039
But it would be very difficult to be in that room

216
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
Experience

217
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
All that happened to not just be like

218
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
I mean

219
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,439
I don't even know if I can

220
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:19,327
Can do it again like straight-up like when he when he said the reason that he left Rockwell was because

221
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,863
There was too much crime

222
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:27,775
Like I mean I got to work I got to work again from the from the bailiff for making too many faces or whatever it is

223
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:33,151
You warned me to I know cuz you I think it I think Alex said

224
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:38,015
No I didn't wear you I said this is the first time you're going to have to try not to laugh you said you have to leave

225
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:44,159
Oh no that was what you will because Alex said that the goal of talk show host

226
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,999
Is to make the most right prediction the moment he said

227
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,559
He was trying to here's what he described

228
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,863
He described it as talk show host

229
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
You become

230
00:12:54,143 --> 00:13:00,287
More popular it becomes a game between all of the pop talk show host like a power rankings

231
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Skip the most

232
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
Predictions right

233
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,663
Everyday that is measured and then

234
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:12,063
You're like in the lead or not Nielsen ratings

235
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:19,231
I almost lost my s*** laughing 100

236
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:25,631
Want to do the news much anymore I do more of a philosophy show I'll God more of a self-help.

237
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:32,031
I almost wanted to yell reset War

238
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:37,663
It's just we can't be in there

239
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,967
From being in a position where like

240
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,295
All right this very serious Alex's understand

241
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,599
I respect the process

242
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,671
I respect what's going on I respect plaintiff soon

243
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
You know to

244
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,047
Not be able to laugh at him is very hard

245
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,631
And I'm not immune to that

246
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
Much as people think

247
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:05,311
I have ice water in my veins in human icewater boys I apparently crypto

248
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:11,711
Holding in ice water in your veins can't not laugh at Alex talking about the prediction hierarchy

249
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
Irene

250
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
Listen

251
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
It took

252
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
A lot

253
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,879
It took a lot then it took a shity hotel

254
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,671
It took a week

255
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,231
Being in a terrible state

256
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,535
It took us going to a courtroom

257
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,559
4 hours

258
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
It took us

259
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,887
Experiencing some of the most devastating

260
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,983
Personal stories let alone like testimony in a court but just

261
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
If somebody was

262
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
Telling me the story

263
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:41,151
It would be devastating for you to eventually come all the way over to my side and say I

264
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:47,807
Have to laugh I survived myself

265
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,599
Nation that I think a lot of people would have reached

266
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:55,231
Much sooner that is like I just want to be around this guy in the same room as him

267
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:59,327
Easier to discuss this with a slight amount of distance

268
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,143
And I'm going to reclaim my space

269
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,495
My proximity to a very beloved one eyed cat

270
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Yes

271
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,359
Indeed did on a bit of a sour note

272
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,223
You can see the video on the Law & crime

273
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,015
Website of us

274
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:24,415
Leaving the courtroom three seconds of the video that everyone is sharing shows you and I walk

275
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:30,815
Walking out of the courtroom pretty like meaningfully 15 seconds before it happened and we were like

276
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,631
Like we're out of I was I was on a like

277
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,983
I want to pass out I want to take a nap totally killing me

278
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:44,127
Also Justina can't Vape in the courtroom right and we

279
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,271
Mingle let's say

280
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,807
And to think

281
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,367
Thank lucky stars

282
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,671
Because there's a little bit of another fight

283
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
Oh my God

284
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
You just

285
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,791
Yeah you know in your heart of hearts

286
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
It's going to happen

287
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,143
You know it's going to happen

288
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,447
We've studied this man for how long

289
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:15,359
What world would we believe that this wouldn't happen right it's some kind of b*******

290
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:19,455
Same time I was sitting in there today going like

291
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,247
Well you know

292
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,527
We're in a quart

293
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:27,391
I don't know why I think there's a did I don't know why I would think that Alex

294
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
What's the difference

295
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
Between

296
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,231
Sitting on a

297
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,023
Witness stand and

298
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
Sitting behind

299
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:39,423
Yeah not be a difference which is scary

300
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:45,311
It's happening was the judge that left the room and

301
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:50,687
Miss Lewis Scarlet had handed Alex a water

302
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,599
I'm not sure exactly what predicated that he'd been coughing the entire testimony

303
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,135
Quite aggressively

304
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:05,535
Complaining about having a torn larynx that sometimes flares up and that he will be

305
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,607
Better in a moment.

306
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,167
Definitely did not come off.

307
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,727
No it was important

308
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,543
For him to listen and not talk

309
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:23,711
Throat was so find it made a remarkable job before he went outside

310
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:29,087
Nightingale did people's cameras listen

311
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:32,927
Let me give you his bottle of water I you need

312
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,999
Yeah it go well Alex

313
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,791
Started saying

314
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,351
They have been manipulated and chilling

315
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,167
Fake videos and edited videos and

316
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,775
Bunny went for a handshake with her and then Mister hats

317
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:51,871
And that was when the lawyers are like we're not doing this

318
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
And

319
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:58,015
Alex started to get mad about edited videos

320
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,087
Again and it was

321
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
Disgraceful

322
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,391
Yep and shity

323
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,695
So that was kind of weird things left off

324
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,975
Tell Alex

325
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,767
Went outside the courtroom

326
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
And there were some cameras

327
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
And here I'm going

328
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,167
To play a bit of video

329
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,727
You came from video

330
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
Alex's comments

331
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,567
About what happened

332
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
At the end of the day

333
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,247
Outside the courtroom pologize is he admits that he was wrong he says that he shouldn't have said about

334
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
The Fitbit right

335
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,039
Just off

336
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,087
Politely all closed

337
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
That have been caught

338
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
Claiming

339
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,999
Did I attack Scarlett Lewis

340
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,559
Today on here when I did not I said I think he's

341
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
A good person

342
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
The real person

343
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
Nope

344
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,823
Depart off where I

345
00:18:59,455 --> 00:18:59,967
I said I believe

346
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,271
Real

347
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
I believe

348
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,375
Charlotte Lewis

349
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,447
He's a little bit

350
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
Flow

351
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,263
I said they're giving on Edith

352
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,055
What

353
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
Why are you guys

354
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
What is it

355
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,911
Why are you talkin to me during trial

356
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,959
I can't talk to you

357
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,663
I know but the point is is that

358
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,967
It doesn't matter of the judges

359
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
We're going to talk about it

360
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
From the court of appeal

361
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
This

362
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
Being developed

363
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
I know you won't cover

364
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,167
And his ex-wife

365
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
Wonderful lady

366
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
Weider book all of it

367
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,543
Don't

368
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:40,831
And that's why people

369
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
Corporate media

370
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
You will be

371
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
Ipledge

372
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
You only spent we're doing

373
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,887
Episode

374
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,655
Is

375
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,983
It's an interesting question cuz that's not

376
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,031
True at all not even a little bit

377
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,871
Interesting to wonder if that is legitimately how Alex

378
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,151
Experience The Exchange

379
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
Or if it's

380
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
It's just

381
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,807
Like if it like is a delusion or is it malice

382
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,623
And why I watch the video cord

383
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:18,208
Because I had that very same question of like

384
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
There's no way

385
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,000
You know

386
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,024
And what are you

387
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
What I think

388
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,608
And and you know I mean

389
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,472
Obviously we're we're speculating so I would not be called as an expert in

390
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:35,616
But it's so

391
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,200
Watching it I truly believe that Alex

392
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,504
When he went up to the

393
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
At first

394
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
To apologize

395
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,832
Believe

396
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,880
That what he was going to do

397
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
Was it

398
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,208
Expressed genuine remorse to them

399
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,512
And then

400
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,072
Because

401
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,864
He couldn't do it the way

402
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
He wanted

403
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,704
Wrightwood that included the also I'm right

404
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,984
Exactly

405
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,800
When Mark and and Company

406
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
Got in the way

407
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,896
He did what he did he did what he does

408
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,200
You know and then it becomes

409
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:16,576
They were trying to hug me or love me they're my fans now

410
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,648
Thanks but the lawyers won't let him say it

411
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,488
Manipulated like you wow

412
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
So

413
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,328
This brings us to our central question

414
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,632
And to do with

415
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
If the tape

416
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,680
But Alex is referring

417
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
Yes

418
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:36,800
During Mr hasland testimony

419
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,592
Alex was on air

420
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,872
Can you say it too

421
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,152
Batshit

422
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:47,040
Everything but also master has one in particular

423
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
Yes and

424
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,112
So during the break

425
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,440
The clip of this was

426
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,744
Cured by the plaintiffs team

427
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
And

428
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,304
It was played

429
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,328
In court

430
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,888
Oh yeah and Alex then

431
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,192
Use that is kind of a hint

432
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,056
For him to make a they're playing edited videos because it doesn't show the part Ray

433
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,336
Said I'm sorry

434
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,104
Elvis

435
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,944
Doing what we do as a show

436
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
I thought

437
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,528
Let's look at the totality of this

438
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,088
There's no reason to

439
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,416
Alex didn't say anything in his testimony today that is worth

440
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:30,048
Discussing really doesn't have time to listen to the full video but do you know who does

441
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,608
Court of public opinion

442
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,192
So where is start here where Alex starts on the 2nd

443
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,984
Boy he's whiny

444
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,384
On this line Tuesday worldwide transmission I have a torn Larry I have a

445
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,504
Washington Post headlines

446
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,368
Where they say

447
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,464
Of the four

448
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,304
Sandy Hook trials they have lined up there now started

449
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,608
To shut us down

450
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,680
MSNBC

451
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,312
The goal is to set this pattern with Alex Jones

452
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,872
And then go after every

453
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:16,896
Body

454
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,992
Play Fox News

455
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:26,368
Will get Fox News

456
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,208
They're going to come for everybody

457
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:36,608
I'm sure that Alex doesn't have tons of articles that say this antiques

458
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:40,448
Pads and not some revelation of a grand conspiracy to shut up the media

459
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,848
Also is anyone at Fox rcnn or those you did what Alex did I think they should be punished just the same

460
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:52,992
It's so weird that Alex has so many strong feelings about this but he doesn't seem to remember that like

461
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:57,600
Seth Rich's parents sued Fox News and settled for an undisclosed amount

462
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:01,184
Warehouse CNN settles lawsuit with Nick Sandman the

463
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,000
Covington Catholic kid back in 2020

464
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,304
He doesn't bring up any of this stuff because

465
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,144
He doesn't give a s*** about the actual principal of people suing media entities

466
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
And how that happens

467
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:15,264
From time to time but it doesn't lead to a complete end of the first amendment AT&T ready

468
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,056
And the devil walking Among Us

469
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:22,176
Snow it leads to CNN's lawyers talking to other lawyers and being like listen we know we f***** up here

470
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:28,064
Let's figure out a reasonable amount of money we're we're fine and you guys are taking care of we all get to go home

471
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,464
Call Alex cares about is comically exaggerating his own persecution because that intern inflates his

472
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,488
Sense of heroism

473
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,144
Everyone so against him and he's up against such great odds and yet he fights on and it's just a breathtaking active him a

474
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,680
Imaginary bravery

475
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,448
You know that's

476
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,216
That's all gay

477
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,752
Imaginary is the

478
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
The perfect word

479
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
Yep

480
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:52,640
It doesn't get more cowardly than literally everything he's done today

481
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:56,224
No doubt No Doubt

482
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:00,064
Maybe rightfully they give Don Quixote a tough time

483
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,368
For the windmills

484
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,440
Fighting all those windmill nights

485
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,464
Sure

486
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,256
Alex does a similar thing

487
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,536
But with strawberries

488
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:13,888
Right that's how you protect his own cowardice and makes it seem like heroism

489
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,680
And here's a here's a big one

490
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,640
Probably sit there and show

491
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
The jury's there

492
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,712
How guilty I am

493
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,248
Not if I'm guilty or innocent

494
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,368
Juries all these emails and all these videos

495
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,976
While the judge tells him everyday twice a day

496
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,768
Remember this man's guilty

497
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,144
Riverside how guilty he is

498
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:54,080
Third-world dictatorship

499
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,128
This person is guilty

500
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,664
I think they do

501
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,944
You're also the judge

502
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,296
Instruct the jury not to bother with the question of Alex's guilt or innocence because there's a damaged

503
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,064
Just trial

504
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,904
Get every right to participate the initial trial where he could have mounted

505
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,488
The defense of the judge absolutely could not have said that kind of thing

506
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,536
But he chose not to participate

507
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,560
He did he would

508
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,584
Just lose faster

509
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,656
No one's claiming that Alex didn't turn over any

510
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:25,568
Turn over a bunch of stuff like a hundred plus page professional background check on Lenny Posner that no-one it in

511
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,848
Infowars can explain

512
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,408
Where did this come from no one knows

513
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:35,808
Alex is creating the strawman but he's being accused of not turning over anything because it's super easy to defeat

514
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:41,952
All you have to do is show that he turned over something and just like that Alex has proven that the cord is lying about him

515
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:47,072
He needs the audience to accept his drama and framing devices of the situation because

516
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:52,704
If his audience sought out any other source of information is entire argument about what's happened with looked

517
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,728
Aesthetically silly

518
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:59,872
The last thing he wants is for them to understand how much of an active participant he's been in getting himself defaulted

519
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:04,224
Because it raises so many questions about why would you do that

520
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:08,320
And the only real conclusion is because you're guilty as s*** right

521
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:15,232
For someone who talks so much s*** about the Amendments that he doesn't

522
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,024
Understand and cannot read

523
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,608
You know that I was thinking about that idea of like

524
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:24,192
You should have the right to face your accuser

525
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,472
You know

526
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
You should

527
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:31,360
Sure and sometimes and maybe only maybe this is the only time it's ever happened

528
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,944
But the accuser should have the right to face the Accuser

529
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,480
Do you know what I'm saying

530
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,784
Especially when they're already f*****

531
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:47,488
So he should have been in there whenever nail is there nail should have been able to look him in the eye and tell him the truth

532
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,024
The same way that

533
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,352
It's active

534
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,144
Claim your space

535
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:58,240
And be there and run your mouth and say about the b*******

536
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,824
While meals got to listen to you and I'm not pay the same courtesy

537
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,944
Stand respectfully if not

538
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,784
Actual but implied violation of the Bill of Rights

539
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,600
Look I'm no scholar

540
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:17,952
Mediator I do think another thing

541
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:24,352
You do want to do I mean I think you should be there to pay respect or at least give the appearance of respect for that

542
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,168
I think you shouldn't do is Maybe

543
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,216
Talk rampant s*** about the judge

544
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:35,616
Junior case

545
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,640
Tell the jury

546
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,688
This person is guilty

547
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,784
But she says up there

548
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,744
Universal

549
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
Demonic

550
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,472
Monica Lee possessed

551
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,240
The judge

552
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,520
Lawyers

553
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,080
It's surreal to be around

554
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:14,528
And it makes you feel sorry for them because these people are committed to a cult ideology of the new

555
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
Never going to stop

556
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,976
They're getting rid of all the

557
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,024
Freedom border

558
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,072
Everywhere

559
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,888
They're just annihilate the social contract

560
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:34,240
They are destroying our country by Design they have been turned

561
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,080
Day I mean

562
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,640
The general crazed Mob of the left

563
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,200
I thought you were talking about the

564
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:48,320
Judge he specifically was talking about the judge so now it's the Mob of the left

565
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:54,976
Okay alright alright correctly what we're trying to say is that

566
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
Bet if I said

567
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:02,144
Dan you're a giant piece of s*** that I hope gets light lit on fire and the damn that I'm talking about

568
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,776
Is everybody and you wouldn't at all think that perhaps I was talking about you

569
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,104
You would know that I was talking about everybody

570
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,640
Also

571
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,968
I have not checked up with my man gygax

572
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:20,832
Is a dork Goblin

573
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,672
Vet in the Monster Magnet I don't believe so

574
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,208
I do not wish it

575
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,768
Believe you can be

576
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,864
I don't even know if you can be a mixed-race torklaw but I think there's two or

577
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
Orcs

578
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:40,544
Interesting interesting evolutionary thing like if you're too far away on the genetic change you can

579
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:46,176
If that's the case then I would say that Alex needs to get right with this and start calling people like

580
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,736
Does George's up there like a beholder

581
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,344
There's charges like a half elf dwarf meaning

582
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,696
Monster the plaintiff attorney is a gelatinous cube

583
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:04,096
What's the what's the name of the ones that are devils in the monster manual guide

584
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,984
So Alex has decided he's going to do the first hour

585
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,104
Event he's heading to court baby smart

586
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:21,760
Are the judges

587
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,040
Achoo

588
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,368
Testified today in the show trial

589
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,208
What the judge again this morning said cuz I've got the

590
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,256
Twitter alerts

591
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:38,912
To the jury it's a decided issue he is guilty remember that

592
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,704
He's guilty

593
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,288
You just decide when you give him 150 million

594
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,848
Because he questioned the shooting or 59

595
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,296
A b a damages

596
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,320
Hearing

597
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:01,952
I still do not understand what you are trying to explain to me Dan I've been in court

598
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,744
7 days

599
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,304
Or at least I haven't been in court but I've watched

600
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,352
Trial for 7 full days

601
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,888
A damages trial

602
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,168
And I have not

603
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:11,936
Scene

604
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,704
1

605
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
Full

606
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:19,616
Acknowledgements from tomorrow since I have lost the trial already

607
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,248
I mean it's a it's a it's an active mass gaslighting of his body

608
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,808
There is just an attempt

609
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,600
To pretend you don't understand

610
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,648
The situation because

611
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,952
If the audience did understand the situation

612
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,000
Better say it raises questions

613
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:39,840
And they are questions that Alex can only answer by

614
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,888
Well I'm stupid

615
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:46,752
Or I torpedoed my own ability to defend myself knowing

616
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:47,776
That I would be in

617
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:52,128
Incompetent and unable to defend myself right given the opportunity and that would be

618
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:57,248
More humiliating than situation we're in now where I can just gas like the s*** out of you all

619
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,784
Ariel still give me money

620
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,320
So I think that

621
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,392
I understand why you taking this approach

622
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,416
Basically Aldi

623
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,184
Please God

624
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
I mean

625
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,256
What's so ironic about it

626
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,840
Is that essentially what he's done is he's hired a

627
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,888
I mean in his

628
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
World

629
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,216
A high-power

630
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,288
Democrat lawyer appointed by Eric Holder

631
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,312
2

632
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,128
Stonewall a trial and a

633
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:28,480
I guess foursome mistrial in order to delay even longer

634
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,760
So we can just keep up

635
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:37,440
Well it's fun that you know you have a

636
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,464
Setting Court

637
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,864
You have a high-powered Democratic lawyer who was hired by Eric Holder who we should also say is a man of

638
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,424
Trees of the highest order exactly.

639
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,752
And being involved with Obama and all this stuff that probably

640
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:57,152
Alex should examine that also you got this high-powered Democratic lawyer hired by Eric Holder who's fight

641
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:01,760
Leaving the globalist for Alex what what's going on here can you imagine if Mark

642
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:07,648
Tomorrow just looks at him and he's like okay you say it's the Democratic party to set out to get you

643
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,232
You know your lawyer was appointed by Eric Holder right

644
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:17,632
I would ease into that just make you think about Eric Holder

645
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,168
Blindsided

646
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:19,936
That would be amazing

647
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,960
So Alex

648
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,264
Sees himself in a particular way

649
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
In this trial

650
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,104
In the circumstances that he find some

651
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
Themself in

652
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,640
And

653
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,944
Naturally there

654
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,712
From a movie

655
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,784
This is beyond the movie Gladiator where they tie up

656
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,624
Gladiator in Elkhart

657
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,952
Coliseum Florida

658
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,768
Good explanation of that movie

659
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,984
Where is Debbie

660
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
15 *

661
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,336
Lion on top your head biting you

662
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,616
And then they come out

663
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:09,600
Find HBO camera with their Almighty

664
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,416
Sandy Hook

665
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:18,816
This man made hundreds of millions of this man tortured

666
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,584
10 years

667
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,960
And then finally

668
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
They testify

669
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,848
And their psychologist testified

670
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,176
Add

671
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,040
Has one and his ex-wife

672
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:45,952
Bill and Scarlett didn't need to be aware of Alex himself to experience the effects

673
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
His actions

674
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:52,864
Even if Alex were portraying the situation honestly what he saying doesn't in any way invalidate their position

675
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:57,472
This is another strong man because Alex can't really address the case on its merits

676
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:04,128
If he did he would have to reveal that he isn't the gladiator who was stabbed to soften them up for the big Showdown

677
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,432
But he would win easily otherwise

678
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,064
It's more similar to a gladiator who is politely asked to show up for their their Showdown for

679
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,832
Years

680
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:17,184
Decided to not show up to

681
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,536
H & H ranting publicly about how he was going to win

682
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
Not fight

683
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,144
He never shows up for the fight but he's legally obligated to be in it so

684
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,520
He's made to appear in front of a tribunal little decide what he's going to be fined for not doing this fight

685
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:36,384
And the whole time he's just whining about how he was never given a fair shot it is Big Show dad to begin with

686
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,968
It's a prosthetic kind of gladiator that I don't think would make a good movie

687
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
I mean

688
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,272
2828

689
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,296
Argument directly

690
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,576
Which is absurd

691
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,624
Is essentially like okay

692
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,000
Say I'm the strongest man in the world and I can throw a javelin from Texas to Connecticut

693
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,536
If I hit somebody

694
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,560
In the leg

695
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,096
And they don't know it's me

696
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,400
How is it my fault

697
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:05,312
There's a million ways you could formulate a rebuttal to that stupid logic that he's using

698
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,080
The javelin

699
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,128
I mean it's it's evocative

700
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,784
Is an image of ABC

701
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:20,672
So here we go Alex getting getting shity

702
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:23,488
The media Brockton the clip of Owen

703
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
Talking about

704
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,816
Has one on

705
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,632
Megyn Kelly

706
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,960
To make him mad and assuming

707
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,240
Bouncing on quartz

708
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:41,408
It's all these lawyers all these Democrats always offered as going out to the families

709
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,344
Another name for that

710
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,624
Investigated right now

711
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
But

712
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,488
It's just insane

713
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:58,816
Yes

714
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,912
Alex is attempting to deprive mr. heslin of having any agents

715
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,680
See here

716
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:10,080
The goal is to make sure the audience accepts the idea that the lawsuit isn't something that's inorganic decision has Lynnwood

717
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,408
I eat

718
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,688
It's something that was pink

719
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:17,248
He's being put up to buy the media these lawyers

720
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,904
Alex is doing this in order to appear like less of a monster because it's easy to play like you're the good guy Wendy

721
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,536
You yell at a nefarious lawyer plot than it is when you take a guy whose son was murdered and you already lied about him a bun

722
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,072
You may notice

723
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,376
That Alex is going a little bit harder towards

724
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:39,776
Discrediting needle and there's a reason for that Alex knows that is far as the

725
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,800
Ariel he's produced

726
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,616
He's not said Scarlett's name on air

727
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,408
His other legal complaints are diff

728
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:51,040
Do you have a defamation case from Neil but and intentional infliction of emotional distress case

729
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,064
From Scarlet

730
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,856
Alex knows

731
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:58,208
That the one where you said the guys name is more of a clear-cut case where

732
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:58,976
F***** up

733
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:04,352
So being able to assassinate this character and insist that he wouldn't even sued if it wasn't under the sway of some

734
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,912
Globalist lawyer conspiracy against Alex

735
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,192
Is him a tempting

736
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,496
To cover up the more serious of his f******

737
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,032
While giving lip service

738
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,824
Do the other one that he feels as less

739
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,896
And that he's not saying Scarlett's name

740
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,688
And is saying meals

741
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,016
Or at least is attacking Neil and not Scarlett

742
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,040
Kind of Morris

743
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,088
Suggest that this is a man who knows that

744
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:31,744
I've already defame this m*********** haha it's probably a good idea to leave it at intentional damage

745
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,536
Judges on the other person

746
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,840
So I don't add defamation to her name

747
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:40,704
Maybe it may be that this is the easiest

748
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,032
What's this person I can punch them

749
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:48,128
Activating him more now I will say that the strategy

750
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,920
A bad strategy

751
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:53,248
At least Alex doesn't continue to call the judge of God

752
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,296
Judge Goblin here in Austin

753
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:59,392
Wow I would have really not.

754
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,488
Ashley finally got to see a real goblin

755
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,024
Oh my God

756
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,328
I have some fun

757
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,168
Goblin

758
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:16,288
Wow that's why I'm so sweet on her but the point is

759
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,592
Last Friday

760
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,480
Go forward

761
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,784
Went back on Monday morning

762
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,112
No matter what you doing

763
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,488
Because this is all

764
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,512
A giant

765
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,048
Exercise

766
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,120
Our freedom

767
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:46,496
Go after conservatives and populist and Patriots and the judge said

768
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:50,336
I also is bankruptcy has no bearing on this case

769
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:54,175
So you know I've been trying to Aunt my brazenness up about his

770
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,735
Hi as I can possibly put it

771
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,503
Yeah

772
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,295
I got nothing on that

773
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:04,415
It's hard but you got nothing on that I just don't I mean that's that's

774
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:07,231
What is that you also don't have people enabling you

775
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:12,351
You have people like me who are like 8 maybe should come down with this ship and I'm grateful for that

776
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:18,751
Because I'm not calling the judge of goblet right now years of people just not telling you to shut up I'm a zombie

777
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,287
Like that

778
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
Crazy

779
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:25,663
So yeah it's all just about getting these conservative the Nationalist

780
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:30,015
Alex's whole thing is just part of a larger pattern

781
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,063
And somebody who's in that pattern

782
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,855
Is Alex's new friend

783
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,391
Former mortal enemy

784
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:41,023
Steve Bannon

785
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,191
How tall are you

786
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,751
And now they're coming with fully weaponize courts

787
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,567
Amanda DC criminal trial

788
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:04,063
Smart

789
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,207
Dog crazy they're going for breakfast

790
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,743
Yeah those Bandits choice

791
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,279
Yeah I think I mean

792
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,815
After watching

793
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,631
Defenses lawyer today

794
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,399
Question

795
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,935
I mean

796
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:20,959
Again

797
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,287
Brazenness on a scale that I can't comprehend

798
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,103
Choose not to defend himself

799
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,383
Or do any of that

800
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,151
Rodger

801
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,431
Pictures of Mount no defense

802
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
Ensign his case

803
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:31,967
Sprite

804
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:36,063
They're not being deprived of their right they're choosing to wave it

805
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,903
So they can pretend to be victims later and so they cannot

806
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:46,303
Hurt their own case further by victimizing the victims that they are victims

807
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,143
We will see that's right that's right it could come back to to really help him out in that

808
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,471
So Alex does talk about some news

809
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,263
Sure

810
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,311
I'm sure everybody's interested in

811
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:58,847
Monkeypox

812
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
Well

813
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,199
So here we go

814
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,527
Bounce mask

815
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,319
Listeria

816
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:12,159
Either way

817
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,511
And beating the drum

818
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,047
Lee behavioral psychology

819
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:20,351
Incrementally say okay

820
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,887
Tell masks indoors again

821
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,447
Okay now only certain businesses are essential

822
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,727
Okay now

823
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,871
New California governor Gavin Newsom declares

824
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,687
Monkeypox a state of emergency

825
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:41,087
Illinois

826
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,695
Monkeypox

827
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,839
Back on the balcony

828
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,119
And the dog

829
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,935
And he's announcing

830
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,215
All the same stuff

831
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,031
Right before

832
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,823
Lockdowns you've already witnessed

833
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,151
Alex has interpreted this headline

834
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:10,015
Biden's covid sequel about being like monkeypox is the sequel to covid

835
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:14,367
But it's actually getting a rebound case of covid-19 to go back into isolation

836
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:18,463
The way Alex is reporting this headline the way he's using it

837
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,743
Is this made up

838
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,791
He's taking this headline and then just

839
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,119
Is making up and lying about what the article is about because

840
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,935
He's a lazy liar just makes things up all the time

841
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:34,335
The word monkeypox doesn't even appear in that article I mean also really I think having a double case of covid like

842
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,103
Like it's the

843
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,175
Best thing for him to riff off of right

844
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,991
Like vitamin has a rebound case of covid

845
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,271
Maybe it's out of

846
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:46,879
Control even the Democrat establishment doesn't have control over the like you could

847
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:53,279
Spin-off of that for a long time if you weren't distracted by some

848
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:59,679
Some other kind of thing those taking up all of your attention even if you have his full attention there you still wouldn't notice of his about monkey

849
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:06,079
U-Box a lazy liar

850
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,359
I would like him to say

851
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,919
Who is this the Charles Barkley of covid

852
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,991
The round mound of covid

853
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:18,111
Anyway Alex talking about monkeypox

854
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:18,879
Trunk

855
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:25,279
Of course he's bought in quite heavily into the right wing

856
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,583
And the very dangerous talking point

857
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,351
Of

858
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:33,215
Associating the lgbtq folk with monkeypox

859
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,031
India Venza it being something that is

860
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,055
Unique

861
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:41,151
To the homosexual Community which we all knew was just a matter of time

862
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,199
Yeah and man

863
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:45,503
He is going weird with it

864
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,527
Keep

865
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,807
Your piehole shut

866
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,695
You're getting a bunch of monkeypox spray in your mouth

867
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,999
Real quick I'm going to pause it for a second

868
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,279
It was pretty gross

869
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:00,863
Just be warned

870
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,399
Yes

871
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:07,519
Will be able to legally change their gender

872
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,847
Once a year all my goodness

873
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,223
Sticker on your car handicap

874
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,015
Visor

875
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,767
Red Yuma Manger

876
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,327
Homosexual

877
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,095
Image search

878
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,631
This makes sense

879
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,655
Basil plant

880
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,447
Put a lightbulb on your head

881
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,751
I mean do people have those like

882
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,055
Stickers on their car windows that have like

883
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,079
Dad

884
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,103
Mom

885
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,151
Chill child child child

886
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:51,039
May I mean maybe I don't know I like Mom I don't think a lot of attention to bumper stickers

887
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:57,439
The window you know those ones would like that they do what you're talking about

888
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:01,279
They do not there

889
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,863
Purple

890
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,887
I wouldn't do that

891
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,751
Lightbulb

892
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:16,383
Surprise getting rid of

893
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,175
Global social credit score

894
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,967
Carmen taxes

895
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,527
Bring in the yellow nothing you'll have nothing

896
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,623
You're about the only perfect

897
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,927
Greener purple

898
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,231
And you can go eat poop in the street

899
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,255
What

900
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:37,631
I mean just you can don't you believe that's your American Rights

901
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,399
Well

902
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,423
Hold on now

903
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,471
I think there's a

904
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,031
Slight bit of a discussion difference

905
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:47,359
Between painting your hair a certain color and

906
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:52,223
Eating poop in the street you know there are a lot of people who bite notice a few distance

907
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,551
I think the way you would discuss those things would be slightly different

908
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,319
MyHealth

909
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:00,415
Standpoint exist in purple hair colors

910
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:06,815
You people to wash their hands when they work in a restaurant Freddy Cole I ordered

911
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,095
Hair color

912
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:11,679
Yeah so I was pretty surprised by this because

913
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,239
Essentially what you have here

914
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,543
Is Alex is taking a

915
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,567
Very

916
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,591
Old

917
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,127
Old homophobic

918
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,663
Kind of

919
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,943
Smeared

920
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,735
Guston characterization

921
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,527
And that is all you eat poop

922
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:31,391
Combining it with the

923
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:35,999
Old Testament Passover concept of how we should move through life

924
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:40,095
Yeah and this is like it is

925
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,631
To the spread of

926
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:46,239
Monkeypox absolutely these people out in the street with our light bulbs in their head

927
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:52,639
Poop all I'm saying is that we should go from door-to-door find out who's inside put a mark outside their door

928
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:56,735
And maybe they have a son tomorrow maybe they don't it's not me

929
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,527
Well whatever you do

930
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,855
Just be aware people are eating poop

931
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,391
I'm not kidding

932
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,255
Now

933
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:11,327
I'm eating poop and peeing on each other

934
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,375
This is so liberal so trendy

935
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:16,191
And then the monkey box explodes and it's all our fault

936
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,983
Will have to be lockdown now

937
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:24,127
The pedo parade in the poop eating will continue and I'm sorry to have to describe

938
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,407
Get me to talkin

939
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,943
Gobbling

940
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:32,319
Oh really show buddy what are you doing oh my god do you remember the critic

941
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:41,279
This is the song of my home country why is everybody laughing

942
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,583
Fantastic

943
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,351
Got a joke

944
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,119
What are the greatest

945
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:47,167
Good show the critic

946
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:49,215
It stinks

947
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,775
My review of Alex's show

948
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:56,127
So yeah apparently Alex is taking up the mantle of

949
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,431
Some of the more

950
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,711
Gross

951
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,735
Dangerous

952
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,783
Types of rhetoric

953
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,063
Descending into

954
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:08,415
Obviously he's been on this like equating lgbtq

955
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:14,815
Uq folk with pedophilia for quite a while right that's kind of not new ground for him now but somehow

956
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,583
Call the

957
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:21,983
All of these Pride parades are people eating poop and peeing on each other and they're spreading

958
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:22,751
Monkeypox

959
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,567
All right I just don't see how this

960
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,871
I mean easy

961
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:28,639
I use it

962
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,431
Truly possible

963
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,991
I think Alex is trying to find out

964
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,039
Is it too is it possible to go

965
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,319
Too ridiculous

966
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,111
The even

967
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,671
An Ardent infowarrior would go

968
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,439
Listen man

969
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,487
Nobody's eating poop

970
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,255
The pride parade

971
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,791
I did I just

972
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:48,095
No I just got to say that no

973
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,655
It really isn't I do think that

974
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,703
There are people in his audience that

975
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,495
Would be like yeah that's

976
00:51:54,751 --> 00:52:00,895
What I kind of always thought I can't believe they're eating it always looks so fun with all the candy cuz you know what

977
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:04,479
It's cuz of the Liberals and let it get out of control

978
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,503
Forget it's cuz of liberal

979
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:13,183
So we get to the point of this episode where the issue with talking s*** about the plaintiff

980
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:13,951
Just comes up

981
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,487
Not a good idea

982
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:19,839
I think that there is an argument to be made that the clip

983
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,887
That they played in court was shorter

984
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,935
I think it was

985
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,983
Now do I think it matters

986
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,263
No

987
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,799
Yeah I think it's worse

988
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,079
When it's longer

989
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,615
So here's the beginning of that

990
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:35,455
Segmented it into century

991
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,223
3-part

992
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:39,039
Because otherwise it would be about

993
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,575
6 minutes or so

994
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:45,439
Ouch but you'll see that each clip ends with where the next one begins

995
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:48,255
So this is all tore to make sure that we're not getting

996
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,047
Doctored video

997
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:55,935
Did the people go straight through the thought goes

998
00:52:59,263 --> 00:52:59,775
Bill Haslam

999
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,591
Those people are real

1000
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,943
Is the government lie so much

1001
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,479
Question

1002
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,695
Anomalies I was the first to bring up the anomalies

1003
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,303
Literally

1004
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,471
And

1005
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,287
I thought it was

1006
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:35,103
When I saw some of the stuff on TV just because

1007
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,895
Became office show

1008
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,783
What you say

1009
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,087
He's he's he's a he's a he's a nice man

1010
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,111
And

1011
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,671
He is

1012
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:50,975
Being manipulated

1013
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,327
He slow

1014
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
Okay

1015
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,375
And

1016
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,167
Got to be honest

1017
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,447
Stupid

1018
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:09,663
Ottoman

1019
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,015
Subway

1020
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,063
Inflow and others and he's

1021
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,487
Makes me feel like an even bigger jerk

1022
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:31,167
And now that I've been around for over a week I'm like okay

1023
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,463
So the Clippers they played in court

1024
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:58,047
Did not include the part of the beginning where he says that they're real people

1025
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:00,607
I think it's irrelevant to the larger point

1026
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:04,447
Like how the clip was it was playing

1027
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:10,079
And then the clip ends with just include those last like 5 Seconds

1028
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:13,407
Which I'm really only using there is a hinge to get to

1029
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:18,015
The next segment obviously is

1030
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:18,783
Is that

1031
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,063
If I was allowed

1032
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,599
To play for the jewelry

1033
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,135
That I

1034
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:28,767
Magnanimously admit the people I'm sitting across from nearly

1035
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,303
Less than 10 feet away

1036
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,119
Are in fact real

1037
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:37,727
Very proud of myself sure and if the jury had seen that

1038
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,775
They would have been like

1039
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,335
Not only should we award him $1

1040
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,615
He's innocent

1041
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:44,383
And

1042
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:48,991
We've hired a second line band we're having a parade

1043
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:03,327
Phillips because you did that I couldn't get it occupants in the feet

1044
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,887
So I was wondering

1045
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,983
And somebody who was in the courtroom as I didn't see this show live

1046
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,775
I didn't see all of it

1047
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:14,335
Probably did

1048
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,383
You know express some kind of

1049
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,407
Sorry

1050
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,175
At some

1051
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,223
I mean I mean

1052
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,759
Really do you know

1053
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:26,111
Cuz that's the argument that he's making Universe things that are cut off

1054
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,671
And so I was like all right I'm going to listen to this

1055
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,207
Let's see where it goes

1056
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:32,255
Here's what happens now

1057
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:39,167
I said I get to news

1058
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,775
The office

1059
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,567
Talk to me

1060
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:50,943
And

1061
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,575
Basically

1062
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,391
Without even

1063
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,183
Watching

1064
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:02,719
The trial

1065
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,255
This is what happened

1066
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,423
And all the stuff

1067
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,127
A fly on the wall

1068
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,663
Fascinating

1069
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,223
It's just fascinating

1070
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,527
How the scammers work

1071
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:39,327
Government who work for the Rothschilds and Rockefellers

1072
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:47,263
The argument that he's laying out is essentially that

1073
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:53,663
Leo and Scarlett but mostly Neil who's writing a mad right they are on for

1074
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:56,479
We've been fooled by these ambulance Chasers

1075
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:59,551
Into doing this lawsuit

1076
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:02,111
Mlr I mean I think that there is there is

1077
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,159
An element is this that

1078
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,975
Gets dangerously close to the things he's being sued about

1079
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,743
Yes there is

1080
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:08,767
Because

1081
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,327
In essence you do at the

1082
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:17,727
At the core of the claims about crisis actors it is these are people who are feeling a roll

1083
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:21,055
That is deceitful about what is at the core of

1084
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:27,455
You know there isn't somebody who died according to these theory that they are acting as if they are in order to it

1085
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,735
The Second Amendment

1086
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,271
In this case

1087
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,855
The argument that Alex is putting forward is they don't actually

1088
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,647
We care about what I said

1089
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,439
They don't actually filled defame

1090
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:44,095
The mental anguish that they're describing isn't anything to it's either not real or does nothing to do with me

1091
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,375
Any of this stuff

1092
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:48,959
They are people who have been willfully

1093
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:54,335
Or tricked into acting as if they were rendered to be used by these ambulance Chase

1094
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,639
This to me

1095
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,687
Seems maybe acronym

1096
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,223
Let's talk about

1097
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:01,247
Movie

1098
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,015
He's real quick down

1099
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,319
Now I want to call.

1100
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,111
As as we all know

1101
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:09,951
Every time you have an actor in a movie

1102
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:15,071
All of their dialogue is required to be direct quotes from real life

1103
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,095
Otherwise

1104
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,887
Every movie would be defamation

1105
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:21,215
So we know that actors

1106
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,775
Only tell the truth despite

1107
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,311
Being real people

1108
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:31,199
This actor can only tell the truth in this workout lie lie

1109
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,831
I understand what Alex is doing

1110
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:37,855
I get

1111
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,159
I also think that it's

1112
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:45,279
Maybe the worst idea ever normally in a

1113
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,047
Defamation

1114
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:48,351
In trial where you're trying to determine Ennis

1115
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,119
Centor guilt

1116
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,655
Then at the time

1117
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:51,679
You can

1118
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,959
Then say

1119
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:55,263
These people are only out for money

1120
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,823
Because if they're only out for money

1121
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,127
Then maybe I'm innocent of the charge

1122
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,175
Now here's the twist what's the twist

1123
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:04,991
0 landforms

1124
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:08,319
These people are Patxi's that are being used

1125
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,343
As Pawn

1126
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:15,743
In Alex's the game against Alex can I hear the original conspiracy theory again

1127
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,047
It was that these people

1128
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,839
We're being used as Pawns

1129
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,631
Any attack on the second

1130
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,911
Alright I balance

1131
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:29,311
Until they were being so they're suing him for saying that they're what very least

1132
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,591
Did this attempt

1133
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,871
Depriving

1134
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:38,527
Neelix Scarlet of the agency that with which they're using to sue him

1135
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,295
Trying to deter

1136
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,319
Define

1137
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,879
The criticism is pretty

1138
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,159
And I think

1139
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,439
At bottom

1140
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,719
At minimum

1141
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:49,535
Yeah what you are doing is calling in

1142
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:53,631
The question the experiences of a testimony that they have given in the trial

1143
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:57,215
Painting them as

1144
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:02,847
People who is with Scarlett is he saying that she's really smart

1145
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,383
And nice you painting

1146
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,919
Neil is a dupe

1147
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:10,783
Yeah who's been suckered into going along with this which raises the question

1148
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:13,855
What are you actually saying about star that this Tuesday willing

1149
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:17,183
Person who knows what she's doing and going along with them

1150
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,207
This

1151
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,743
Sucks and doesn't

1152
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,023
It's not better longer

1153
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,047
Nope but

1154
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:27,935
The appearance that Alex can get out of insisting that it's better if it's longer

1155
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:31,263
It's basically the exact same game that he plays with all of his clips

1156
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,823
You need to watch the whole show

1157
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,359
Second of stop it it's it's

1158
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:41,503
It's really not better well if that's your only excuse to just about anytime anybody ever plays a clip

1159
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,527
Then it's

1160
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,343
Glaring that because we play the entire clips

1161
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:46,879
He does not talk

1162
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,183
That is suspicious

1163
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:52,255
Yeah you were suspicious that Alex wasn't actually going to

1164
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,279
Forgive an apology

1165
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,815
In these in this

1166
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:59,423
When you bring up what I was suspicious about

1167
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:05,823
I'm interested to see where this goes

1168
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,319
What

1169
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:19,903
The world

1170
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:26,815
There's a

1171
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,447
The sabotage our nation

1172
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,239
And I'll bring it down

1173
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:37,567
And so I can really see how the sauce

1174
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,591
Getting made

1175
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:49,343
Give my asking questions about public events hurt these people's feelings I'm sorry

1176
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,487
And the most important point is this

1177
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,327
Knowingly promote Sandy Hook questions

1178
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,639
And they love

1179
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,455
Single

1180
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,479
Second

1181
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,015
This stuff

1182
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,599
They are just living off Sandy Hook

1183
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:24,159
Look alive

1184
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:25,951
Bring it to me

1185
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,959
Until the point of

1186
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,919
And there's some other lawyers there

1187
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,551
Adam Lanza

1188
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,111
They think I did it

1189
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,671
And one of these lawyers that's a well-known lawyer

1190
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,255
Who's Adam Lanza

1191
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,583
This is y'all on Friday

1192
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:06,399
I'm sorry that your lawyer friend is dumb

1193
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,447
But that doesn't mean anything

1194
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:15,359
Does your lawyer think you did it does your lawyer friend take you did it I mean

1195
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:21,759
Alex Jones must have been the shooter I've if I understand correctly it walks free

1196
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:26,879
Out in the world having killed all of these school children and teachers

1197
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:29,695
What could his lawyer friend possibly think

1198
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,999
If his lawyer friend being a lawyer

1199
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:34,047
Would have to know that he's already been

1200
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:34,815
Found guilty

1201
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:38,655
What is the lawyer think if he's like

1202
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:44,543
Never heard of this and Adam Lanza cash but I know you're guilty of this trial I figured this person doesn't

1203
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:51,711
So that is the apology that Alex was so insistent that the plaintiffs attorneys didn't include in the clip and therefore we

1204
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:54,271
We're trying to mislead the jury with an edited video

1205
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:59,903
This was the basis of the fight that Alex in the plaintiff's team got into at the end of the day and what Alex was talking

1206
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,439
Think about outside it's a lotus

1207
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,487
This isn't an apology

1208
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:06,047
This is a statement disguised as an apology

1209
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:12,959
In order to accept this apology you need to accept Alex's framing of what he's apologizing for and that

1210
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:14,495
It's not based in reality

1211
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:17,311
He's not apologizing for what he actually did

1212
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,591
He's apologizing

1213
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:23,455
Questioning he did of anomalies around Sandy Hook hurt them

1214
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:28,575
That's not a real apology in anyway and I'm entirely certain that the jury would be able to

1215
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:32,927
I understand that could easily put that in its proper context

1216
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:38,559
You wouldn't want to play this whole clip though because it's a long it's stupid and it really

1217
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:42,655
Mostly is just Alex whining to his listeners but everyone so mean to him

1218
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:48,287
This falls back on the fundamental defense Alex seems to have to offer which boils down to

1219
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,567
I did the thing you want

1220
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:51,871
Me too. Just a little bit after that clip ended

1221
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,687
He's essentially appealing to the unknown

1222
01:05:54,943 --> 01:06:00,319
The part of the knowledgebase that isn't available in order to undermine the premise of the plaintiffs

1223
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,111
It's pretty dumb

1224
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:05,951
But it's kind of how information Works in his world and it's kind of like

1225
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:06,975
I mean I hate to

1226
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:09,023
They'll fall back on this event but

1227
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,303
Basically what killed

1228
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,351
I mean

1229
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,399
Sometimes

1230
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,447
When I listen to the

1231
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,471
The consist

1232
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,239
Threads

1233
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:21,311
If there was a pole you know

1234
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:24,383
You know that whole thing

1235
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:26,943
Like if we got rid of all politics

1236
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,479
Text Em we're just like asking

1237
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,247
People straight up

1238
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:30,527
Do you think

1239
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:33,087
If I hurt you

1240
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,111
Then I'm sorry

1241
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,135
Is an apology

1242
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:39,231
I think we will be able to see 100% exactly where the far-right

1243
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:43,839
Haha cuz that's the one thing that I hear from that nobody says

1244
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:46,399
I'm sorry I'm sorry I hurt you

1245
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:48,959
I realize the damage that I've done

1246
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:52,543
I'm going to seek to correct it and then no longer continue the behavior

1247
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,079
How many gigs is the most

1248
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,895
Generous perspective on the if I hurt you

1249
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:58,687
I'm sorry thing

1250
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,479
Sure that is fine

1251
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,015
If it's a first step

1252
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:05,855
Like if it's a I don't understand if I hurt you

1253
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:09,183
Now let's engage in a process where I understand better

1254
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:11,231
How I hurt you

1255
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:19,679
No. Once I what is what that apology wants to appear.

1256
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,471
People want to look at and they want to see

1257
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:25,055
They want to hear you say the words sorry and then forget all the rest

1258
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:30,175
Yeah it's disgraceful and

1259
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:32,223
It's only made worse

1260
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:34,527
By where we all know where this is going

1261
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:37,343
Here's the end of the stereo

1262
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:41,695
Who is Adam Lanza we all just looked at him

1263
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:44,255
Who's Adam Lanza

1264
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,279
You don't think

1265
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:54,751
Put on me and made me a

1266
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:56,799
Money off of it

1267
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,391
This is the beta test

1268
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,183
And this is what they're doing

1269
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,719
Imma stop ranting

1270
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:17,791
I need to hit the energy news

1271
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,071
Stop going on with loveseat

1272
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,863
I'll give you my take on that

1273
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:23,935
Got so much more and we're going to have

1274
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,519
Studio

1275
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,823
Also help blisters understand that

1276
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:33,151
Infowars really is fighting for his life

1277
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,527
But will be able to stay on the air

1278
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:39,807
Indefinitely

1279
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:42,879
If you will just continue to support but we need folks

1280
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,927
Want to know what the globalist

1281
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:52,095
Infowarsstore.com right now

1282
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:55,423
Appeal a plug

1283
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,959
Give me money

1284
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:57,983
Yep

1285
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,775
I guess all of that

1286
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:00,543
Italics w

1287
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,615
All of that to be played in court I don't think it helps

1288
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:05,663
I think I make some Oak way worse

1289
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:08,223
Yeah it's the

1290
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:14,623
Uncertainty of what else is there at Alex can play with that unformed space

1291
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:18,719
That he can mold into being whatever he wants it to be

1292
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:22,815
And it's an abusive tactic it's really it's cuz he knows what he said

1293
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,583
He knows

1294
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,351
Babe

1295
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:27,167
There isn't things that we're completely Miss

1296
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:29,983
By the end of the video that was played in court

1297
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,007
It's a

1298
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:31,775
Antabuse

1299
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:36,127
You know it is it is one of those things where I keep thinking about this

1300
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,919
During the trial specially while listening to

1301
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:38,687
To the full clip

1302
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,455
Casino

1303
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,503
If we were in the jury

1304
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,039
You and I

1305
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,063
Catch

1306
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:46,111
All of the Liza

1307
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:52,255
Right really wanted you know what it why we shouldn't be absolutely

1308
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,279
Play but my point is

1309
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:58,399
If I were in the jury and I was the lawyer for me in the jury

1310
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:00,959
Then I would play that whole clip and I would be like

1311
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,519
Here's where he goes into that sales sales pitch

1312
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,311
Do you remember on the stand

1313
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,871
Whenever he's suddenly started telling you about

1314
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,407
Ales for some reason

1315
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:13,759
Play let it happen earlier today

1316
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:16,575
That's the kind of thing that you could pull in there but

1317
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:19,391
If you were to play an entire 6-minute clip of Alice

1318
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:23,231
To a regular human people jury

1319
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:24,511
How is

1320
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:30,911
Is it possible for you to get them to like your eyes are glazed over that you be like I genuinely don't know what he just said I don't

1321
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,935
No

1322
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:38,335
Good skipping around there's so many things he's saying I said like

1323
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:40,639
The only thing I think of is that

1324
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:42,943
The juror who put his Pad down

1325
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,223
You know like it's bad

1326
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:49,087
It's 102 make sense

1327
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:54,207
That's a moment that a live forever you know

1328
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:54,975
Yep

1329
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:59,583
Why you promised talk about Pelosi

1330
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,863
True

1331
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,399
Well it's

1332
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:05,215
It's kind of hard for Alex to talk about right

1333
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:05,983
Cuz

1334
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,263
Well you'll see

1335
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:12,127
Pelosi in Taiwan

1336
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:15,455
Call Melo

1337
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:17,503
And a woman is a total joke

1338
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,063
And roll

1339
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,135
What

1340
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,159
Explain that

1341
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:29,279
Obviously

1342
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,047
She's doing

1343
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,863
Probably

1344
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,703
More money

1345
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,983
He directly aligned

1346
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:42,591
Alright Alright you're just lazy somebody

1347
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:49,247
Nancy Pelosi is a decades-long communist agent working for China but also she's going to Taiwan

1348
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:52,319
Yes and this is not something the China likes

1349
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:55,647
So we have to make sense of this until it is is it.

1350
01:11:55,903 --> 01:12:02,047
Stunt because Biden's going to step down and something's going to happen to Kamala Harris

1351
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:08,447
And then Pelosi zombie president be able to help China Crush Taiwan I guess

1352
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,471
I I mean

1353
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:10,495
It's all the

1354
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:14,079
Stunts in order to rationalize her Ascent to power

1355
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,871
So she could be an even better

1356
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,407
Agent for communist China

1357
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,199
It makes sense

1358
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:19,967
You know

1359
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,247
When you put it that way

1360
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,527
I really can't argue

1361
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:29,183
You don't want to know point

1362
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,207
Between video

1363
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,511
It is about 2

1364
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:38,911
To Dismount and it makes a bad prediction and that is that he's going to do is.

1365
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:46,079
Oh that's true the talk show right now his prediction is that he's going to do his whole show tomorrow

1366
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:48,639
He is not know he's going to be in court

1367
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,943
For the full show tomorrow

1368
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:51,967
I'm sorry

1369
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:56,831
4 months in Connecticut

1370
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,415
That's why we do the bankruptcy

1371
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,695
Because work

1372
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,975
Don't have the money

1373
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:04,767
To do three trials at once

1374
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:08,095
Because I've got to be on here we don't bring the funds in

1375
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:13,215
I'm almost resigned all of this because

1376
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,199
Stop

1377
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:26,527
Credibility is exploding

1378
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:28,575
But just as an instinctive level

1379
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:34,463
Enjoyed talking to you everyday I enjoyed being here I love the crew

1380
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:38,047
Give up I won't give up

1381
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:44,447
It's probably going to be a nuclear war

1382
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:47,007
Okay

1383
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:48,543
Call Josh

1384
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:53,663

01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,247
Chills right now

1386
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,575
Just real quick

1387
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:04,671
When Alex is receiving $8000000 in Bitcoin

1388
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:06,463
Are we about to have a nuclear war

1389
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:09,279
When Alex is about to lose all of it everything

1390
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:11,071
Are we about to have a nuclear war

1391
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:15,679
And he's getting chills talking about

1392
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,959
Yep yep

1393
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:18,495
So

1394
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:22,847
I mean I don't know go f****** prepare your family newsletter

1395
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,127
You dick

1396
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:30,271
Subset that works old people hard copy that's a good point he's got to get a printing press

1397
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:34,111
Back to the early days

1398
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:38,719
Guinea pigs edible type eating out to be sitting out their hands taking a zine

1399
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:42,303
Or something like that today was like Hey listen

1400
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,863
You need to tell us about your

1401
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,631
Time

1402
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:46,655
Coming up

1403
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:49,215
About how you turned yourself from us

1404
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:51,519
Nobody into a man with

1405
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,311
Almost 50 employees

1406
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:59,711
Is gold

1407
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:03,039
Bought me a show right all of this is not help with a myth

1408
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:07,647
Doesn't how I think that if Alex is going to start busy

1409
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,927
But I'm imagine

1410
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,975
Global is proof

1411
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:13,791
He also going to need to make his own paper

1412
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:18,911
So yeah some Lumber he's going to need some land where he can grow trees

1413
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:26,591
Some trees isn't Papyrus a lot easier on terms of like what kind

1414
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,383
Dovetree like you don't want to waste too many tree

1415
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,919
Look man

1416
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:36,319
I don't believe the dump

1417
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:41,439
He's the one who needs to start his being out in the woods so the Goldbergs can stop at that does make sense

1418
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:49,119
Alex versus the hour comes back for a little bit and starts rambling about how

1419
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,399
Bill Maher w

1420
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:52,447
Depopulate the planet and I was like

1421
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,727
I heard that in court today

1422
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:59,103
You said that he was a secret Patriot ago

1423
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,383
Come on man

1424
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:03,455
Different types of bankruptcy

1425
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:07,039
Is a reorganization

1426
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,087
To keep Infowars going

1427
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:12,159
There is a point

1428
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:13,439
Easy projection

1429
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:16,255
Do that and not laying people off

1430
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,935
With this headline

1431
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,823
Lawsuit

1432
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:43,135
And that's what this is

1433
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,695
Usher

1434
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:49,023
If you hadn't messed with me

1435
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:57,471
6 years ago to be phased out at all fair by now

1436
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:00,031
Maybe doing a podcast and writing a book and maybe

1437
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:00,799
Film

1438
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:06,687
Enjoy certain levels but it's time for a change

1439
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:13,599
Never now

1440
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,511
If we don't get the funds we need so help

1441
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:25,887
Amazing

1442
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,959
Tony infowarsstore.com right now

1443
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,239
How about you go f******

1444
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,263
That is

1445
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,287
That is

1446
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:33,567
A

1447
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,359
And almost

1448
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,127
Like

1449
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,663
It is

1450
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,711
Gone through to the other side

1451
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:42,527
To become a heroic

1452
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,295
Belief

1453
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,599
In that if I get this money

1454
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,647
It will not go directly

1455
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:50,719
To the family everything will be fine

1456
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:54,047
Lake Daddy's that is the most delusional like

1457
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:58,911
I would I would honestly if I was in his situation be actively telling people

1458
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:02,751
If you don't want to give money to my dad

1459
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,031
Shmoney

1460
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,823
Give it to anybody else

1461
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:12,479
Yeah give me a other newly founded company in Hood probably exists somewhere

1462
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,015
So I think

1463
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:17,599
Another thing I'd like to highlight In that clip is

1464
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:22,207
And Circumstance that I'm in right now

1465
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,743
Hotel

1466
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:30,655
But I would say if you hadn't messed with me I would have quit long ago

1467
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,423
In this

1468
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,471
Hour of his show where he is

1469
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:36,031
Preoccupied right with

1470
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:36,799
Melding

1471
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:39,615
Scarlet and kneel with

1472
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:44,223
The Democrat conspiracy ambulance Chaser nonsense

1473
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:46,271
Teddy's going often because

1474
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:49,343
I think it's pretty easy to hear that say

1475
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:54,975
Niall and Scarlett if you hadn't messed with me I would have quit long ago I don't think there's any way to hear that

1476
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:59,071
Fine I mean with the part where he says it

1477
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,863
Yeah that would make me hear it

1478
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:01,887
Sure

1479
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,679
Yeah but what if I

1480
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:04,959
What if you told me you didn't

1481
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,775
Then I wouldn't have any idea

1482
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:09,567
You're out of control

1483
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,359
So Jordan yes Dan

1484
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:13,151
Bedtime

1485
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,503
But

1486
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:21,087
What is until advised is the way Alex is playing at

1487
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:23,647
Yeah you know the Booty like

1488
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:30,047
Yeah if only people that seed all of it they'd see that expires it creates a distraction from the actual topic

1489
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,071
Totally

1490
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:34,655
I do appreciate that I don't feel like the judge

1491
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:38,751
And the court had much patience for that I don't think that it played

1492
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,519
And

1493
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:43,615
I think you know the clip that we played of him talking to people outside

1494
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:46,175
I don't think they were putting up with it very much

1495
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:52,575
Alex maybe in the past was more able to steamroll Media I don't think I'd

1496
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,343
I didn't get the sense

1497
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,367
Of much

1498
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,647
Of that

1499
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:56,927
Tolerance

1500
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:59,487
Positive thinking

1501
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:01,279
You know I mean to that point

1502
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:02,303
To that point

1503
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,071
Especially

1504
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:05,631
Like when we were at the end of the trial

1505
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:09,983
I didn't have any problem rushing out of there

1506
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,263
Immediately after the judge

1507
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:12,799
I didn't

1508
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:17,408
I intersect I still kind of Beyond how horrific a treatment it is of

1509
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:20,480
Neon Scarlet

1510
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,808
His behavior after the trial

1511
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,344
To me is less important

1512
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,160
Then what the judge said right before the end of

1513
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:28,928
The day

1514
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:29,696
Which is

1515
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:32,000
That she basically agreed to marks

1516
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,024
Instruct

1517
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:33,792
Hints for the jury

1518
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,840
So tomorrow morning

1519
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,120
The judge

1520
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,424
Without Alex on the stand

1521
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,728
Will say directly to the jury

1522
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,264
Alex is guilty

1523
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:45,056
Yeah Alex

1524
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:49,664
Alex has plenty of money

1525
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,968
To the extent

1526
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,736
That

1527
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,296
The defense is trying to

1528
01:20:55,808 --> 01:21:01,184
Push things in that direction or apply those things out your to disregard any of that

1529
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:06,560
It is going to be you know like in a in a law show and all that stuff because this is what it

1530
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,328
It's become

1531
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:11,680
That's what Alex is trying to turn this into is a TV show

1532
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:15,008
I'm going to have it you know

1533
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:15,776
But

1534
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,312
This is the moment

1535
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,592
In a movie trial

1536
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:19,872
Where's the judge

1537
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,664
Outside of like

1538
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:27,040
This lawyers a character and that lawyers character in these lawyers are representing people

1539
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,856
And the people have a vested interest in all this stuff

1540
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,648
When the judge says

1541
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:32,672
To the jury

1542
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:33,952
This guy

1543
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,488
It's f****** guilty

1544
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,792
And you have to know that

1545
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:41,888
There's no lawyers arguing there's no ambulance Chaser at all

1546
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,472
Yeah Alexandria

1547
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:51,616
Alex's fishing for a let you go see where you're going with this and he got a

1548
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,640
Shut up

1549
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:55,456
And that's a positive sign is a good times

1550
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:58,784
So I will

1551
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,064
I don't know

1552
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,136
We will it'll be a day

1553
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:05,440
It'll be a day and a half

1554
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:09,536
It's already past midnight

1555
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:11,072
So let's

1556
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,656
Please see what

1557
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:17,984
