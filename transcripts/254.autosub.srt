00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
Alex

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:16,896
Novelty beverages

00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,664

00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,712

6
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,320
Silver dresser

7
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:27,392
Have you been late to work.

8
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,160
In big trouble

9
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,792
Open fired for it

10
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:37,120
Habitually

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,960
Through my

12
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,728
What off

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,520
I can't think of any luck extreme

14
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,336
Examples

15
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,640
The 25 year-old

16
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,408
Dave

17
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:55,296
I had a lot of jobs I worked a lot of places and

18
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:58,880
I worked hard but

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,672
I just

20
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:05,024
Hated hated almost every place I ended up attics

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,816
I love that

22
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,424
My life

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
In terms of like

24
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,984
You know hourly wages

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,008
Stuff like that but

26
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:15,776
I work today

27
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,872
Car wash for a while but he's miserable bit about it

28
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,456
That was just based on the whole idea of like it's nothing like the song

29
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,808
I built a B Justin

30
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,648
I used to work at this terrible car wash at my buddies socks

31
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,672
Got me a job at

32
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,464
It was so bad I just got some

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,072
Just got screamed at by the co-worker

34
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,120
It was a terrible

35
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,144
Terrible scene

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,752
Oh yeah it was horrible

37
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
Horrible

38
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,288
And then you get

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,360
I was on the end of it

40
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,408
Three main station

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
Be like people at the

42
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,760
The beginning of a new start the washer and it goes where

43
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,784
Get sprayed down in a

44
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
And then it comes out

45
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
And because that

46
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,744
Isabella customer-facing position

47
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:13,376
You know you hand the car back to the customer and give you a tip

48
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
Humiliating

49
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,728
Well

50
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,568
It's customary to tip at that point

51
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,104
At one time

52
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,272
That deserves an app

53
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,344
Ice

54
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,112
Like how do you

55
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,648
I dare you

56
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,280
The worst f******

57
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
Arable time

58
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:51,008
Yeah what was that guy's

59
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:57,408
Might be too long of a story to tell in our intro for the episode there was a suspected

60
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,344
Everyone who works there knew that this dude was straight-up

61
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,952
Everyone knew you was a queef

62
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,768
Customer complained about it

63
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,304
To the manager

64
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:24,288
Do operation

65
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,568
Pacific change

66
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:30,944
In a dummy car through the carwash

67
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,040
The quarters and stuff like that all set up

68
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
Music

69
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,600
When is the strangest missing

70
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
Will look in his pocket

71
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,952
And if those specific

72
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,792
Will know that he stole the change

73
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:52,192
So he goes through with it low and behold changes gone on the other side

74
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:58,336
That change

75
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,432
Matters like this doesn't prove anything

76
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,600
I was like

77
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,184
Could be a coincidence

78
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
I was like 17 18

79
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,815
Teenage years old and I think I was like

80
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,887
I got to do better than you

81
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,239

Sir Foundation

Amanat Ali Aprilia someone sodomites Italy

We come in and on April 9th

134
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,983
Alex Jones starts the show talking about goddamn chemtrails

135
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,775
For about the first 40 minutes

136
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:45,151
Of the show alright I am not

137
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
You know what it is

138
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Remember how I meant

139
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,879
On April 8th to overdrive. Really

140
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,863
You bet I think so but okay

141
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,887
Doing so on this

142
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,471
April 9th episode he's letting his sores narrative completely slip

143
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
Favor against

144
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
To do

145
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:16,383
Or self-defense against a valid criticism

146
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,175
I'm from one of his listeners

147
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,247
Chemtrails

148
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,527
It does not do it for me

149
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
And I'm not interested

150
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,879
For the first 40 minutes of the episode but

151
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,927
The first clip we will hear Alex make

152
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
Some

153
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,255
Incredibly untrue predictions about

154
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:50,175
This time I have the DVDs come in for Obama Deception was released

155
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,783
Before

156
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
April May

157
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,287
His little secret

158
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,079
4

159
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,551
3 days before the official release workout

160
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,367
You will get it on the release that's what we're doing

161
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,703
So we are just

162
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,495
Intensifying what we're doing

163
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:03,135
Interesting little add products and services that he's offering

164
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Interesting

165
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,231
It's very familiar

166
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:15,679
On the 4th of July and you will have it on the release date

167
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,983
Does not come out on the 4th of July comes out a bit later

168
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,311
But he's also saying the day he's done with the Obama film

169
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,871
He's going to start a new documentary about chemtrails

170
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
And I'll say this

171
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,199
That never got made

172
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:31,807
Next Obama film is the last documentary

173
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,927
No cuz there was at 1 with Joel skousen

174
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:42,303
Interview about relocation

175
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,607
Although Jason bermas one of Alex

176
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,143
Does end up making

177
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,727
Call Jack what the hell are they spraying

178
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,519
So maybe Alex is a good enough

179
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:56,639
What's up

180
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:01,503
I felt like he was just asking

181
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:06,623
Where somebody's like to go to a car wash

182
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,183
Is it straight up that the Khan where they're like

183
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,255
Okay

184
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,583
You give me five

185
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,631
I'll give you these $4 to drink

186
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,703
Fusee with release date

187
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,103
He's like it's going to be out but also for some places

188
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,687
Another day

189
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,247
I think he's sincere in his intentions

190
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,903
But none of that happened

191
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,719
This is what's going to happen and we know now none of that

192
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,815
Kind of a little bit of an add pivot to

193
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,143
But it happened almost immediately after

194
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,191
He does what I would describe as

195
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,727
Like a modern-day kind of

196
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:17,535
We need your financial

197
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Then now

198
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:25,215
That that the intent expression of like

199
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
Pause

200
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
Pivot

201
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
To the ad that is

202
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
Present day

203
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,223
Level Alex Jones at pivot and we have not seen much of that in the in this era

204
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,551
It's just learning how to use

205
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,575
Flex like

206
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,879
Eventually that that is going to turn it down

207
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,999
Have you found our products instead of him being like

208
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
Now I should

209
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
It's interesting to see

210
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
We're just seeing the evolution of

211
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
Receding be like

212
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
The salesmanship

213
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
Get better

214
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
He directs himself more towards

215
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
Being a sales operation

216
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,479
As opposed to

217
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
Pretending to be

218
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,343
Right right right I think that's kind of interesting will see where that goes

219
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,903
In terms of actual narrative

220
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
I'm telling you man

221
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
It is

222
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,999
90% chemtrails

223
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
I got nowhere

224
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
90%

225
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,143
He has an interview with this guy named captain Sweeney

226
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,103
Captain

227
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:40,223
In early April 2009

228
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:45,855
Captain Phillips got taken by the Somali pirates

229
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,439
This Captain knows the guy who took over the vessel

230
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,535
Captain Phillips got taken by the Pirates he knows that guys

231
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,583
Kevin Bacon

232
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,911
Straightforward

233
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:05,311
No-nonsense kind of interview so we don't need to listen to it

234
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
This is okay

235
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,431
It's kind of a conversation about like the dangers of sea piracy

236
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:20,671
Is Kevin Sweeney his kind of trying to make himself part of the story a little bit

237
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:27,071
Coronavirus knows the guy who's there

238
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
What it is

239
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
Presenting

240
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
The information

241
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
And I don't

242
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
In this

243
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
In this instance

244
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
I don't think there was

245
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,871
Coming up with crazy narratives about it or anything like that

246
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:46,271
It's like wow this is an interesting story story almost no take on it

247
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,063
Can skip that question

248
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,135
Really f****** not about that

249
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
Sue

250
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,975
Is he eats like a private

251
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
Fisher

252
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
He's like a privates

253
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,167
If you just have a boat you can call yourself cap

254
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
Is that

255
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,519
But he's not in the associated with the military

256
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
Was he born

257
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
I don't know I don't know he's not very clear on that

258
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,247
I just want to know what did I do

259
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
And have people

260
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,343
You can but I also don't think

261
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
You can vent

262
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
Contracted to

263
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,927
To do like run

264
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
And stuff like that

265
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,999
Actually like a license

266
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
Commercial

267
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,607
Sea captain

268
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
There is a line okay

269
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
He's above

270
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
Batman

271
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,567
So after she talks to Sweeney

272
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,871
He gets Tyler Palmer

273
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:49,503
In-studio ecoloblue sponsor

274
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,903
Techmeme school bus school bus

275
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,743
And in the middle of them talking about their water filter

276
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:06,399
America was talking

277
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,935
About it

278
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,031
If this tickles me to no end because

279
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
You could be so excited

280
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:17,919
Find out who this is

281
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:23,807
No

282
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,231
Degenerated light on

283
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:37,631
They are

284
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,007
There's so much cussing

285
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:02,975
They put out

286
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
You know what

287
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:16,799
I wish you was being raped their biggest fear is is that no one gives it

288
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,135
Coming from that

289
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,799
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

290
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:55,199
Not really

291
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:28,479
Never did I imagine in my wildest dreams that marinwood come up episode

292
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:34,111
What are you I remember this

293
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:39,999
Blaming Soros Soros mansion

294
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:44,095
On the show but they're both in the context

295
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:48,191
Running

296
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
Is not accurate

297
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
I would be

298
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
Highly surprised

299
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,567
If Mara never got any

300
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:59,967
George Soros money

301
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
So

302
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,855
I would say that Alex is a little bit uptight here

303
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,159
He's being a little bit

304
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:15,839
Snowflake

305
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,143
You're the ones who don't want us to have guns

306
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,895
I think it's a far stretch for Alex to be saying that Marin is

307
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,431
Calling for him to be raped

308
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,759
Whenever what is really saying is essentially like

309
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,319
This guy is really over exaggerating

310
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,927
Maybe off-color joke

311
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:45,791
2009 get away with

312
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,911
WTF Marc Maron

313
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:57,311
In the depths of depression

314
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:03,711
WTF with Marc Maron are you about to start

315
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,991
Dairy Queen

316
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,343
Piquant

317
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,463
Marc Maron

318
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
As opposed to

319
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,815
Oh he's accusing me of exaggerating

320
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
My

321
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
So

322
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
Responding

323
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,495
Got Tyler Palmer just sitting there

324
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:31,615
Come on

325
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,431
And put my water filters

326
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:39,039
This f****** junior varsity guy on air America I don't know

327
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,367
What's going on here

328
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:47,999
Of Marin

329
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,815
Oh he's on home

330
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:56,959
But actually

331
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,823
Come down on

332
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,359
Marc Maron is

333
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,639
Incredibly insightful

334
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,687
About the people like Alex

335
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,223
Yeah it's first clip

336
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,015
He basically is trying to express

337
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,295
Alex

338
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,319
Muselk

339
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,111
Beer the idea that they are inside

340
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,672
Metallic spruce

341
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,792
You know what

342
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,584
I wish it was being raped there

343
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,424
These people's biggest fear is is that no one gives it

344
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
Their biggest fear is insignificant

345
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,056
Their biggest fear is that they really aren't that

346
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:39,456
Important

347
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,600
Power Mountain

348
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,696
So that's his overcompensation

349
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,256
No no

350
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,536
Do you want

351
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,840
He wants you to recognize that you

352
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,144
You fear the idea of being insignificant

353
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,680
Not that you actually are

354
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,496
But what motivates you

355
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,544
The defensiveness Invicta posturing

356
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,848
Is the ID without it you aren't any

357
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:10,688
Without the presentation coming to get my guns what are you

358
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,016
Without the

359
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,112
Charade the silhouette of a globalist

360
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
You ceased to have any

361
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
And Alex Cruz

362
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
Now that

363
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,608
Elvis Presley

364
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,888
On Merrick Park

365
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,656
But this makes

366
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
Clip

367
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
I will say is almost

368
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,240
A psychic level

369
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
Prediction

370
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,032
Set Marin ends up

371
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,592
I was kind of Blown Away

372
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,640
Based on what we know from 28

373
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
2019

374
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:50,368
Can you then get mad when we stand up you're not

375
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,608
Their biggest fear is that they really aren't that important

376
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,264
Their biggest fear is that no one's going to recognize him

377
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:14,944
Your biggest fear is we're figuring out how much power we got

378
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,248
These are all distinct

379
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:21,344
And dangerous Cry for Help from poorly parenting

380
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
Who seek to harm

381
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,744
And hurricane the name of Jamaican Soldier

382
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,888
To make themselves known to pee

383
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,424
They're misguided

384
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,704
And when they are charismatic

385
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
Like someone like Glenn Beck

386
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,776
Or somebody like Alex Jones

387
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,824
And they were exploiting the damage

388
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:46,944
A people who live in this world for desperate angry and misguided

389
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
That they become

390
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,248
Dangerous

391
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,528
Populist leaders

392
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,552
They are the criminal

393
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,856
If the FEMA camps are for anybody

394
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:57,184
It's for what these people will do when they think the end of the world

395
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:04,096
There's a way to fight this.

396
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,424
Propaganda

397
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:14,336
FEMA camps are real they will be what these people use

398
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,128
Whenever they think the end of the world is coming

399
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,736
Is essentially they will use these

400
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,504
Tactic

401
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,784
Whenever they feel threatened

402
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
And that's what you're seeing

403
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,600
Fears of

404
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,648
It being done to them when it's not being

405
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,952
When their fear of being

406
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,976
True witch

407
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:34,304
When we now see or whenever they have the

408
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,096
Sort of cover to do it

409
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
Alex's

410
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
Complete

411
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:46,848
Slipping on his position about rex-84 his open opening up to the idea

412
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,872
FEMA camps for

413
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,664
Immigrants and asylum-seekers in

414
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
Some stuff like that

415
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,992
Marin was a hundred percent right on

416
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,272
If FEMA camps exist

417
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,040
It's for them

418
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,320
If

419
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,368
Crazy when I heard that

420
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,928
Goddamn

421
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
So

422
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,424
You're very wise. Your career

423
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:17,056
So we we about all that I found interesting

424
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,080
In this episode

425
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:18,848
Cuz the rest of it

426
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,688
Dogshit he sits down with George Humphrey but Alex

427
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
Unexplained

428
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,480
At the beginning of the

429
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:32,160
I'm having George Humphrey, and because we didn't interview on the documentary straight

430
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,696
Shuffle timer

431
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,000
Really terrible

432
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,328
He's talking about a coffee shop and a third of them are Democrats

433
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
Third Republic

434
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,376
Dependence

435
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,288
Everybody's talking about

436
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,080
Is it complete horseshit

437
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,784
Where is this is inside like the five corners of this day Rocksmith

438
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,344
Like precursor to like that you know

439
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
He would constant

440
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,416
We tweet about being at a coffee

441
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,720
Coffee shop in overhearing liberals they like

442
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,096
Formula

443
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,424
MC George Humphrey

444
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
It's just

445
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,544
This washed over b******* about like

446
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,104
I'm out there

447
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,712
Cific anecdotal

448
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,992
Redman whatever

449
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
Trends Wiki

450
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,600
I don't know if you noticed

451
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,440
Alex has an interview with Rosalind

452
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
Peterson

453
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,488
Who is a chemtrail

454
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,584
I don't care about that

455
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
It's real stupid

456
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
A couple years after

457
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
Rosalyn

458
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:53,312
She said I literally have no evidence of chemtrails I have no documents

459
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
Nothing

460
00:26:54,336 --> 00:27:00,480
Just a thought

461
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,368
Two years prior or whatever

462
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,000
As soon as I found that interview from after this

463
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,536
She said I don't I don't have any

464
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
Is it b*******

465
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,824
One of the most

466
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,360
I've ever

467
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,968
So we saw on the 8th

468
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,392
It's almost like he's forgotten that he's supposed to be talkin about Soros

469
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
38

470
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,464
Just bring him up a couple times.

471
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,328
I guess

472
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
Which

473
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
And also

474
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,680
Somali pirates

475
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:56,288
ISM play

476
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,336
On the 9th

477
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,664
Pirate stuff is pretty on

478
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,224
It's pretty normal

479
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,808
Oh s*** Are we going to get with soros-funded pirates

480
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,624
No okay but that would be great Musical

481
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,648
Could be

482
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
Put the

483
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,304
You could knock me over with a feather after I heard this

484
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,728
Compared to the Gilded domesticated westerners

485
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,568
Battle

486
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,920
Fantasy movie

487
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,456
Waterworld

488
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,760
U.s. Navy

489
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
Just people are unbelievable

490
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:42,880
Army Rangers

491
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
Wow

492
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,120
Your Love

493
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:59,776
Is a crazy pivot I don't understand

494
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,592
Hugo

495
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,152
No

496
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,464
You got to give up. I give it to you

497
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:23,072
Holyshit

498
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,376
I heard a lot of Alex's like

499
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:31,776
Weird

500
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:36,896
Is it all those guys

501
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,432
Nut to me

502
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,968
And then I thought like

503
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736
Okay

504
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,296
That's probably just weird phrases

505
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:47,136
It's probably just a Sebring pot

506
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:54,304
White supremacist

507
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:00,704
This is what in relation to the Pittsburgh shooter

508
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,264
This is it

509
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,360
This is him just being self-defensive about the

510
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
Relation

511
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,160
So real quick

512
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:23,488
You can even here in there that he is defending the Pittsburgh

513
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,560
Because he's coming for the guns

514
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,888
Not that he was acting out of paranoia

515
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,216
Through his constant

516
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:33,984
Exposure

517
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,752
These narratives

518
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:38,848
So he knows that they're coming for the guns it's something we already covered when we talked about

519
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,152
Alex's dealing with Tesla

520
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,224
It wasn't rational decision to kill

521
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,272
He knows we're coming for the gun

522
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,552
You got a killer

523
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:52,928
So that's f***** up a defense of his

524
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,256
No no I didn't make that guy killed that guy

525
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,816
1/10 killed

526
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,352
Instead of 9:10

527
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,912
Right right

528
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,192
Ancestry

529
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
Involves

530
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,336
Yeah it's bad

531
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:22,112
At 90%

532
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,168
The face down

533
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,032
AK-47

534
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
So he's a good guy

535
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,200
What

536
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:51,552
I really don't know

537
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,088
Wearing a flower outfit

538
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,744
They really don't want that so they never satisfied.

539
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:11,008
Okay so we drifted too deeply Mr a kind of territory there

540
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,616
The way we are exposed to

541
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
Do you like this

542
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,920
Yes

543
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:24,576
These women are supposed to be that way at least

544
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:29,696
Rational

545
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:40,192
Desperately need no fight

546
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:46,592
Then he goes on to say positive things about the arrow

547
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,432
A net positive statement

548
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:56,832
Just because you're giving lip service to not liking piracy doesn't mean that you're not in good things about

549
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,160
I don't like the target

550
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,696
I love the way they do it

551
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,768
They got a verb

552
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,816
Because you saying these positive things

553
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,584
About

554
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,120
Somali pirates

555
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,144
After

556
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,680
Comparing them to

557
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,704
Do the Pittsburgh shooting

558
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,264
It is kind of a language works

559
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:23,200
With his classic denigrating

560
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:23,968
Pittsburgh

561
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:28,320
Computers mail. He's all alone he's fat he lives in his mom's basement

562
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,392
Desperate

563
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,672
The cops are coming for his gun

564
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:37,792
Just like these awesome badass hardcore

565
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,864
Somali pirates

566
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,936
And that's what is just like

567
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,984
But I love the whites

568
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,264
Supremacist shooter didn't I

569
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,104
Oops

570
00:33:54,944 --> 00:34:00,576
Alex isn't taking into account like possible other variables

571
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,368
They make a f*** ton of money

572
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,464
Most of the ransoms are paid

573
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,584
You know they take over bumper boats and because

574
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,352
Insurance

575
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,888
Stopping all that

576
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,424
And the difficulties of trying to get

577
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,704
Get the boats back by 5

578
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,056
Absolute must Molly Pirates

579
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,360
Or epitome

580
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:27,968
2 problems

581
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:32,320
A function of a economically depressed Somalia

582
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:36,928
Where there is a Outlaw business where people are very very successful

583
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:42,816
I think that it might have more to do them with that as opposed to being attractive

584
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,352
Pirates for their gun

585
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,168
So you're saying that

586
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,472
These women who who are with me

587
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
Cartels they aren't attract

588
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,312
To the brutal

589
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,592
Vicious nature of the

590
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,920
But instead

591
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,224
The large sums of money that these guys

592
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,600
And the way we are supposed to

593
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,952
Too much into sort of misogynistic ideas if we say

594
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:14,048
Whether you're attracted to the brutality

595
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,584
To the money but I don't think

596
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,400
Necessarily in any way offensive to say

597
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,424
It's a

598
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,984
Incredibly impoverished country

599
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,520
These are people who have

600
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,312
Some sort of inability to pay

601
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,592
Provide secure

602
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,384
Situation

603
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,408
Anomic

604
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,480
And it does make sense

605
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
The people Woods

606
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,528
Steve m

607
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,320
More attractive partner

608
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
Then someone who

609
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,648
Is a broke fisherman

610
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,464
Socioeconomic

611
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,048
Parallel

612
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,352
I don't really know or

613
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:52,704
Yeah

614
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,240
This is

615
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,776
Real men's rights

616
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:59,104
Realreal.com

617
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,152
Coming out

618
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,968
Defending the Pittsburgh

619
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,016
Shooter praising the Somali

620
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,296
Pirates drifting in

621
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,064
Massage

622
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
Just

623
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:15,744
I don't know what's happening man doing everything possible to

624
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,280
To say out loud what he

625
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,048
He really feels

626
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,888
I love that Pittsburgh shooter

627
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,192
Absolutely

628
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,752
Fighting viciously to keep

629
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,544
Keep the real part of him inside and it

630
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,312
It's not going

631
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,784
Just like them Somali pirates

632
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,088
Great

633
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,440
Shooters but they are a lot

634
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,976
I do love you can drive drunk

635
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:52,864
Pittsburgh shooter was motivated by these ideas

636
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,656
For your guns and what do you know Alex

637
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,704
Reinforces exactly that idea

638
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,504
Tellez tamales

639
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:21,024
Cruisin for a Bruisin

640
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,584
VIP for buying guns

641
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,144
Isn't evidence that the government's propaganda

642
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,424
Is not working

643
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,728
It's evidence that Alex is is

644
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:35,616
The idea that the government is trying to put out anti-gun propaganda

645
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,920
It not working

646
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:40,224
Is evidenced by gun sales doesn't

647
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,808
But the idea that take your gun

648
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,344
You should get more

649
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,440
The propaganda is working

650
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,232
Just looking at this backwards

651
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,024
Sideways and wrong

652
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
Child support

653
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,608
The reason he's doing it is

654
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,656
Force them same narratives

655
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,424
Is it leather

656
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,216
Shooter down the path that ended up

657
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
Murdering

658
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,544
Officer so that's real cool

659
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,568
I like that

660
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,128
I say facetious

661
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:11,456
So I told you I can't talk much about chemtrails

662
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,016
Yeah but Alex does bring up one single

663
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:14,784
We talked about

664
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,808
The past

665
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,112
Be fun to make sure that everyone understand

666
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,440
Understand

667
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,720
Inability

668
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
I have been consistent

669
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,280
Through the last.

670
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,472
Warrior terms the testing

671
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,824
Or is other people call them

672
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:46,272
Terraforming

673
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,320
Technology

674
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,800
Actually it doesn't say anything about

675
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,848
He's talking about

676
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,408
Prohibited

677
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,688
Activities but

678
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:20,832
Petty

679
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
Can we talk about this

680
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,568
Before but just because it bears

681
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,104
Consistent

682
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,384
His stupidity is

683
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,432
Yes there are these exceptions

684
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,712
In paragraph

685
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,736
But the exceptions

686
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,040
Begin subject to subsection C

687
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
CBN

688
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,344
The prohibition in subsection

689
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,624
Hey does not apply to a

690
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,672
I carried out for the following

691
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,976
Subsection C says

692
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:03,328
The Secretary of Defense

693
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,608
Only if informed

694
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,400
Consent to the testing was obtained

695
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,680
Each human subject

696
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,264
So the exception

697
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,288
Or actually

698
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,848
Enclosed Within

699
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,176
Kunsak thing

700
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:21,504
The consent is imposed upon the exception

701
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
So Alex

702
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,552
Just doesn't know how to read

703
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,088
This is infuriating

704
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,624
He's a very

705
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,648
Yes

706
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
So

707
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:35,072
I just bring it up every now and again

708
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,864
Yeah

709
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,632
I forgot

710
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,960
A little bit let's just make sure that

711
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,752
Just cuz you can

712
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:47,616
Say a lot of words in a row

713
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,408
Does not mean that those words

714
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,688
Correlate to the paragraph

715
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
To which you are

716
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,040
Meaning of anything close to what you're

717
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:55,808
Describe

718
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,136
I'm so happy we got through that

719
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,672
And now guess what

720
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,488
Pirates are back

721
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,848
What

722
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,944
Good

723
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:28,320
Yes you can you can help it. I'm watch the film

724
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
Cowards

725
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,447
Not like

726
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,567
I don't understand

727
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,919
Neither do I

728
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:32,319
Because I scrambled on this I was like okay is this an indication of something that means more than we realize

729
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:36,927
Is there some world power that was aligned with the Somali pirates

730
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,487
That maybe Alex is being

731
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:45,119
Gowanda Subway

732
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,911
They're only on board with them

733
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,215
Russia was even bombing them

734
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:54,079
Somali pirate vampire

735
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:57,407
It was it was almost one of the most

736
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:00,479
Probably the most universally opposed

737
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,599
Videos

738
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,695
I don't f****** know what he's doing

739
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,463
I think

740
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,231
He's just making sure

741
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
Devilish

742
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,935
So I can put him on a ship

743
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:24,031
I don't think we fundamentally misunderstood about the Somali pirates

744
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:24,799
We're doing

745
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:28,639
New York Times

746
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,943
The guardian among other Publications

747
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,247
Tyrus

748
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:36,575
Their only motivation was money

749
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,111
They're committing these crimes just

750
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:44,511
Extort The Ransom money from the ships there was no grander political statement

751
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,815
There any government and work fighting for freedom

752
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,607
It was just a criminal racket

753
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,631
That's all it was

754
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,423
This is super interesting

755
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,727
Because what else is done in his head

756
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:56,287
He's transformed this Mafia activity into something

757
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
Grandeur

758
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:57,823
Summit Fitness

759
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,151
Community

760
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,687
Give me work so cowardly

761
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,223
But that's all it is

762
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,759
Just his fantasies

763
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,039
No

764
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,343
It should be noted that there were side benefits

765
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,111
To the Pirates

766
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:13,183
The primary reason

767
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:13,951
The crime

768
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:18,559
Because they scared off a ton of fishing boat traffic local fishermen were able to boost

769
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,607
What are the real help the local economy

770
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,423
Additionally the ransom money the Pirates received was in

771
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,191
Refused into local

772
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,263
Community which in turn began to help them flourish

773
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,311
None of this excuses

774
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:35,967
And none of it was a reason

775
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,527
Cuz there's inflows

776
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,319
Somewhere

777
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,599
These people are in these

778
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:45,183
It's interesting it's not

779
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,975
Exculpatory or excusing them

780
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:52,351
Anyway whatever you have a

781
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,423
Economically

782
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:59,007
Exploited by others

783
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
And then

784
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:05,919
Part of that economically depressed regions like holyshit

785
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:15,903
Right right

786
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,671
AIDS

787
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,695
Go to the

788
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,631
You have to give it up today

789
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,055
It's just more complicated

790
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,127
Although his version

791
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,503
Weird sure

792
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,855
About Pirates

793
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,647
He seems to think that they're the same

794
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,951
Who fought the US in Mogadishu in 90

795
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,719
3

796
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,487
But that's absurd

797
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:56,607
Mogadishu's on the south coast of Somalia

798
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:59,167
Which is between the northern coast of Somalia

799
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,447
NFL statistics

800
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,727
Years later at the

801
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:06,335
I sure there overlap like a couple of the Pirates were veterans

802
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,991
But it's crazy to think that it's mostly the same

803
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,575
Seems to be conflating

804
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,343
Is mine

805
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,367
Because

806
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,671
Mogadishu was an embarrassment

807
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,743
You when there's a possibility

808
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,767
These are the same

809
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:29,375
Somalians who

810
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:33,215
Maybe that's the only Theory I can come up with

811
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:39,871
But that's not good enough.

812
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,639
On the Blackhawk

813
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,455
Grew up in this is what

814
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,991
16 years later

815
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:49,343
So now he's grizzled he's going to be played by

816
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,415
He's

817
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,559
This is exactly the same Catherine

818
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:02,143
Tom Hanks

819
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:06,495
So he's he's like

820
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:09,055
And start our own piracy business

821
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:14,687
Try to build it up go to the North Coast successful for a wire

822
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,735
Enough attention

823
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:19,551
People finally Crackdown on as and straight-up murder

824
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:24,415
Yeah that's because I said that most of it was

825
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
Surrounded

826
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,487
That doesn't mean that all of it

827
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,559
Like most hot

828
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,119
Is a geographic

829
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,655
Kind of weird to assume

830
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,191
I do I just picked it out

831
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,239
I don't know what he's

832
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,359
The association with embarrassment

833
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:52,319
Alex

834
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,391
Like Outlaw assholes who killed

835
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,975
I don't think you're wrong

836
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,999
Sweeney on again

837
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,815
And here's how he introduces him

838
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,215
Thank you Alex great being with you

839
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:18,687
What

840
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:25,087
I don't know the craziest thing I think I've ever seen

841
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,439
Not just that they were not just

842
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,999
Give it up to him now we're at

843
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:36,607
Howard wrestler people

844
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,911
Because I think that he thinks that they're locked

845
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,191
And some sort of a

846
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:40,959
Like

847
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,007
Nationalist struggle against

848
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,031
The globalist

849
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,895
When it's just

850
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,503
Totally

851
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:59,647
Chemtrails

852
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,999
This next clip I think brings it into a little bit more Focus

853
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,791
Interesting

854
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,559
Because

855
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,839
Alex

856
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,679
More crime in this

857
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,447
Next

858
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,543
Very strange

859
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:25,247
I think another reason that he

860
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,039
Is respecting them

861
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,319
Is he thinks that there

862
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,343
Real terrorist

863
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:34,207
All of these fake terrorists out there and stuff like that

864
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:38,303
So I think that he thinks that there are noble enemy for him to fight again

865
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:42,655
And therefore you got to give it to him but I'm still going to fight you

866
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,983
A great warrior can only be killed by a degrader warrior

867
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,591
Really really

868
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:54,943
F***** up that is not is not reflective of reality

869
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,711
At all

870
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:06,719
And you destroy

871
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,791
The first

872
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,559
I would like

873
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,887
The restriction on Merchant vessels having a weapon

874
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,191
You taking off and have it be a requirement

875
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
They have

876
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,495
Either armed guards on

877
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,031
Board for train

878
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:23,359
Cruise that with weapons onboard to high-risk areas

879
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:27,199
I would also like some kind of mechanism for trying

880
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:32,831
Is this is also bogus

881
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,159
Because they had no they didn't know what to do with

882
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,567
Right now yes and I'll tell you why

883
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,103
How do you

884
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,663
Vietnam

885
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,967
And I was in the Army just after that but

886
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,319
We have a heck of a time deciding who was

887
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:10,207
The good guys

888
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,047
Say we have

889
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,583
Floating base

890
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,351
But even then

891
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:21,983
Delete a few weeks ago the Indian Navy

892
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,263
Via tide fishing vest

893
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,055
And they killed off work

894
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,127
It's like

895
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,943
I think personally that we need to have a defense

896
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:31,711
5

897
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:38,367
Especially the part about no you don't

898
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,135
Killing

899
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:43,743
People who are pirates which is evidenced by what happened

900
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,023
Response to that

901
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,303
She knows about

902
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:51,935
Brings up that Indian Navy taking out the Tie Fighter

903
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,703
Alex

904
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:59,615
Before he even says before Sweeney even said that Alex knows what story he's going to bring up which means that Alex is aware

905
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:04,991
If you do just indiscriminate League Obama going to end up killing

906
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,295
Who were the wrong people he doesn't give a

907
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,087
It will your bum and I'm out

908
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,391
It's like that

909
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:14,463
You can see how deflated with

910
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,863
Bring that up

911
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,887
Come on

912
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,215
It's so weird

913
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:29,055
Millwall I'm saying is you can't figure out his position

914
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:31,359
Take a main economic

915
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:34,175
Not just illegal act

916
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:39,039
Regular activity and just blow it

917
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,575
And destroy the area

918
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:43,647
Get rid of all of their whatever fishing

919
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,695
Community does exist there whatever economy

920
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:54,143
Does the air

921
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:57,215
Pirates

922
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:57,983
To eat so you should

923
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,055
Destroy all food sources around the area as well.

924
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,847
Douglas

925
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,063
Horrible

926
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:15,391
I can't imagine he hasn't thought that through

927
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,183
I don't know

928
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,023
Narrative

929
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,559
Complicated

930
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,839
Because on the 9th

931
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,863
It wasn't weird

932
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:29,215
Lens interview with Sweeney it wasn't weird he wasn't saying positive things

933
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,799
Amazing

934
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,103
It does kind of sound like also what he did

935
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,431
Started talking about Somali pirates

936
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,967
Little excited

937
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:46,367
And then spent the rest of the night Clips in every possible

938
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:50,463
Immediately like

939
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,511
YouTube clips in between that chemtrails

940
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,791
And I'm telling you

941
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:54,559
You got to give it up

942
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,375
It is very possible that's exactly what happened

943
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,471
I mean this plays out over like

944
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,239
The next

945
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,519
Waze like app

946
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,543
Phillips was held

947
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:09,919
Evolve

948
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,783
I thought I used to

949
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:20,159
I honestly wonder if he'll be mad that

950
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,183
Took out

951
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:27,839
I wonder if that will be his approach

952
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:29,119
They should have pulled out swords

953
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:36,799
I can't wait to find out cowardly to shoot a man from Vista

954
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:43,199
Could you look up in the eyes Dan never gives you what you expect

955
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:48,063
On some level you expecting Soros

956
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,647
F****** doesn't Eddy Deb's like tomorrow

957
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,951
Don't know what to do anymore

958
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,631
Fat fat

959
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,703
That's the kind of Alex

960
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:08,287
Out-of-left-field support

961
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:11,871
Yeah

962
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:17,247
It's it's like his

963
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,831
Ability to support and love white supremacist is restricted

964
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,623
Because when they kill people

965
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:25,695
Transfers

966
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,719
Because their Romance

967
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,487
Exercise murder

968
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,559
Give me some of that

969
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:33,375
Somali pirates

970
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,167
Alex

971
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,471
Complains more bikes

972
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:43,359
You just got to give it up to the that's okay

973
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,687
Now Alex is going to

974
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,223
Complain more about

975
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:48,991
Pittsburgh

976
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,367
He's going to blame the Southern Poverty Law Center in the

977
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,391
ATL

978
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,927
For feeding his name

979
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,487
But this clip is

980
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,511
46 seconds

981
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,279
Long

982
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,351
In the beginning of the clip he's going to blame them

983
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,119
For doing that

984
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:10,239
And by the end of the clip he's going he has no idea if they did that

985
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:15,615
This is quintessential Alex Jones you need a sound bite of how Alex Jones

986
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,383
This is it

987
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,135
It always is

988
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,319
I don't know

989
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,879
Amor amor

990
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,207
That needs to be investigated

991
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,791
He made a direct accusation that the Southern Poverty Law Center

992
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,607
Said his name to the media to associate with it

993
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:12,191
That's crazy you can't do the

994
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,215
They did that

995
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,799
You can't do that

996
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:23,199
You can't do that I don't know if

997
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:27,039
Every single time you say I know this

998
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,575
Because you do I don't know

999
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,927
So

1000
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:34,975
The perfect like

1001
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,255
Distillation of Alex

1002
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,559
I know it but

1003
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:39,839
It's true we should look into it

1004
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,399
The standard everybody was

1005
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,423
Oh man

1006
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:51,359
Crazy stuff

1007
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,151
The MacArthur Foundation

1008
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:53,919
Probably

1009
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,991
Now Alex has another guy

1010
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,575
No

1011
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,415
The situation

1012
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:08,511
I should also tell you

1013
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,791
But it was

1014
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:10,815
Meandering nonsense

1015
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:19,263
I don't know

1016
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,567
Because of the

1017
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,335
Interview with

1018
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,895
Developing

1019
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:29,759
Weird crazy add pivot

1020
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:34,111
Stream sell all of Alex's stuff that does include the gold

1021
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,671
There is a little bit of

1022
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,439
You were

1023
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:40,255
Alex uses Bob as a setup to bring in

1024
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:45,631
Pirates on the brain

1025
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:52,799
Somali pirates in their economic

1026
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:55,103
Alex

1027
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:55,871
Another guest

1028
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,407
This is a really

1029
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,431
Syngas to heaven

1030
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,455
Because

1031
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:01,247
He's not an

1032
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,039
Okay

1033
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:09,951
Mr. black right now mr. black

1034
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:19,167
Complete the interviews even gracious enough to do with us

1035
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,703
Are there in your offices

1036
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,751
Talkin about any

1037
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:25,055
His offices

1038
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,335
You better

1039
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:31,455
Begin because I was accidentally found himself a credible guess

1040
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:33,503
Oh no William black

1041
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:37,599
Black is a professor of economics and law at the University of Missouri

1042
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:40,159
Kansas City into the deep resume in the world of science

1043
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,975
He played a major role in mitigating the damage

1044
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,767
It was done during the S&L crisis

1045
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,047
Which SE

1046
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,887
Re-regulate

1047
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,471
I thought that was when they hired Janeane

1048
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,263
Oh I got it

1049
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,055
Dick ebersol

1050
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,847
I have to assume

1051
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:01,663
Has no idea who Alex Jones is

1052
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:05,247
I can come to no other conclusion as to why he

1053
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,271
He agreed to come on

1054
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,807
Because as we will find out

1055
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:08,831
Shortly

1056
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,111
He doesn't agree with Alex

1057
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:10,879
At all

1058
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,671
So here's the first clip

1059
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:19,071
We're discussing about how the banks are a bunch of

1060
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:19,839
Fusions erotic

1061
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,375
Control Federal Reserve

1062
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,911
No but doesn't come up really

1063
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,935
Because

1064
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,239
Is not an anti-federalist

1065
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,543
Kia

1066
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,567
A guy

1067
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,615
It is very

1068
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,383
These Lending

1069
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,687
Incorrupt memes

1070
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,551
2080

1071
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:41,855
They have both

1072
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:42,879
The same sort of

1073
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,415
Idea about what

1074
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,183
Problem is

1075
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,839
His talking points blacks

1076
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,119
Just with

1077
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,679
Scholarly aplomb and what-have-you

1078
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:59,263
The idea of what is going on

1079
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,543
Is socialism

1080
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:13,343
President

1081
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:20,767
I guess

1082
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,071
Arrangement

1083
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,007
Comparing either of these

1084
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,543
I don't think that

1085
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:35,359
Misuse of the phrase

1086
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,711
Really diminishing whatnot

1087
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,575
The economic system is

1088
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,623
I think the best way to describe it is

1089
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,391
Boney Kapoor

1090
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:51,231
Terrible system anybody was ever

1091
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:57,631
In a nation like that

1092
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,855
He already in the earlier the interview Alex tried to characterize

1093
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,879
Hyperinflation

1094
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,903
That he's afraid of

1095
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:22,207
Republic

1096
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,999
Hyperinflation in Black disagree

1097
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:25,791
What does misrepresent

1098
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,583
Yeah that there but

1099
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,863
Two important things there

1100
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:35,519
Start that music

1101
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:40,127
We got the sound bite he needed and then we're going to move along we got it that's great

1102
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,151
Second thing

1103
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,431
Alex and necklace

1104
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:44,223
Very clearly demonstrates

1105
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:46,527
He is aware that the National Socialist

1106
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,063
Just called themselves social

1107
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,135
So

1108
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,159
Every time he tries to

1109
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,463
Represent the idea that Hitler

1110
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:57,535
Go fuc yourself

1111
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,071
There's a level of like you

1112
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:00,351
You know it Improv

1113
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,887
Or like if your

1114
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,959
We are playing a character in a scene

1115
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:11,103
You have to adjust your level of intelligence like aware of X Y or Z

1116
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:14,175
Like if you're playing some sort of like Backwoods character

1117
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:16,991
You should know about Noam Chomsky

1118
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:19,551
Even if you do as the actor

1119
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,087
Alex's

1120
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,367
F****** up his intelligence

1121
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,927
He's f****** up what he should be aware of

1122
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:28,255
According to how he presented his worldview

1123
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,047
He shouldn't have your awareness

1124
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:32,351
But Nazis just called them till social

1125
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:35,167
Yeah that's true

1126
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,959
I think it's probably partially because

1127
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:37,727
Excited

1128
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:40,031
That William blackett saying a lot of things

1129
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,335
His

1130
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,383
Description

1131
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:48,991
The market is going to use them

1132
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:52,831
Rice crackers

1133
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:55,391
So how do you feel about the Federal Reserve being

1134
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:57,183
Voted on by three congressmen

1135
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:59,231
I got to go

1136
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:08,959
They agree about the description of the problem with the bank from Lending

1137
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,031
Crisis

1138
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,567
But I think almost everyone

1139
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:15,871
About that stay for the politicians

1140
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:18,687
Filtercopy

1141
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,223
So they Grill the

1142
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:21,759
But if you take a look at Black

1143
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,783
His public statements

1144
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,343
You'll see that he's not at all on the same page to Alex

1145
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,695
One small caveat though they are in agreement

1146
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,767
Prices on trial

1147
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,791
And if necessary

1148
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,839
Alex probably lesson

1149
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,167
Call for Samara Lee locking up bankers

1150
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:43,263
But the two guys definitely are on the side of

1151
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,055
These people need to face consequence

1152
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,127
Who's not

1153
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,431
Tobias

1154
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:55,807
Agrees on that to themselves agree that they caused the problem

1155
01:04:56,063 --> 01:05:00,159
Right or they wouldn't be reticent to admit it or not

1156
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,743
Here's one piece of information that

1157
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,535
Everything you need to know

1158
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:11,679
In the 2016 election official economic adviser for the Bernie Sanders campaign

1159
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:19,359
The same Bernie Sanders economic positions of the u.s.

1160
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:25,759
Collapse becoming a totalitarian hellhole William black is Bernie Sanders economic advisor

1161
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,551
Crazy

1162
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,599
Really blacks pretty far-left dude

1163
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,879
Especially from an economic

1164
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:35,231
Is testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the financial crisis

1165
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,791
Could not be more clear in its point

1166
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,095
The failure brought on by deregulation

1167
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:43,679
And not enforcing the regulations exist

1168
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:47,775
Glass-steagall

1169
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:51,615
Deal but what was worse was how the Clinton administration

1170
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:54,175
Quote implemented the

1171
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,991
Which was hostile to regulation enforcement

1172
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:00,831
We were instructed pursuant to that initiative

1173
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,623
And think of the industry as our client

1174
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:05,695
That's a mindset that destroys effective supervision

1175
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:08,255
He goes on to spell it out saying quote

1176
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,279
The 3D

1177
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:13,375
Deregulation D supervision and de facto decriminalization

1178
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,679
I returned with a Vengeance in 1990

1179
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:16,959
Expanded over the

1180
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:21,311
The most difficult aspect of the current prices to

1181
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:25,151
It contains was it roughly 80% of non-prime loans were made by aunt

1182
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,175
He's not subject

1183
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,967
Direct Federal Regulations

1184
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:28,991
Primarily mortgage

1185
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,807
All The Regulators needed to do

1186
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,831
Preventic rice

1187
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:36,927
Was-band lending practices that were rational only for control frauds

1188
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:37,951
Engaged in lewd

1189
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,255
Consistently refused

1190
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:43,071
To do so because of their anti regulatory ideology

1191
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,119
Do you have

1192
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:48,703
Effective Financial regulatory cops on the beat

1193
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:50,239
Are essential to our ability

1194
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,543
Please prosecute Elite white-collar crime

1195
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,103
Economics is very

1196
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,895
The game

1197
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:58,431
Argument is very simple

1198
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,503
Engage in what he calls

1199
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,271
Control fraud

1200
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:04,575
Pioneer

1201
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,855
Which is the idea

1202
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,135
They take their

1203
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:07,903
Fusion

1204
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,183
And control it as an insult

1205
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,207
Frog

1206
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,999
The cheap way that this fraud was done

1207
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,023
Was in the form of

1208
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:13,791
Call Milan

1209
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,839
What the industry calls Liars

1210
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:20,447
Where the lender knows that the recipient doesn't have the ability to repay the loan

1211
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,495
And assist them in lying about their ink

1212
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:27,615
According to Black's testimony was nearly 90

1213
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,407
That's a lot

1214
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,175
Yeah

1215
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:33,759
It's complicated

1216
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:36,063
Institution that's engaged and stated income loans

1217
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,599
Clearly doing so.

1218
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,367
Tomato frog

1219
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,159
It should be on everyone's radar

1220
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,975
Because of deregulation and deprioritization

1221
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,071
The Regulators were hamstrung in

1222
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,631
Which led to what amounted to a

1223
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,399
Decriminalization

1224
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,423
Control fraud

1225
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,447
In the large Finance

1226
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,471
Institutions

1227
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,519
In that environment there's no incentive

1228
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,543
Play by the rules

1229
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,847
And doing so is actually a great disadvantage

1230
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,383
Which increases likelihood

1231
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,151
Behavior

1232
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:01,919
Come on dammit

1233
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:06,015
The problems that William blacks on the financial world where all things

1234
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:09,343
Taken care of with regulation and Regulatory follow-up

1235
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,111
Which Alex

1236
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:10,879
Would not be insane

1237
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:13,951
He also advocated for tying

1238
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,231
Professional compensation

1239
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:18,047
Quotes demonstrated long-term performance

1240
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:20,095
But you're something else

1241
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:22,143
Unless the John Birch Society

1242
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:28,031
Instead of paying Mortgage Bankers

1243
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,823
S*** ton for doing something

1244
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:30,847
Immediately

1245
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:31,871
And then dump

1246
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:35,199
Later

1247
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,735
Long-term performance

1248
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,647
It really boils down to In terms

1249
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,671
What is positions

1250
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:49,535
There were these for the regulatory where The Regulators were

1251
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:53,375
Treating their the people they were supposed to be watching over as their client

1252
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:56,191
As opposed to be collected

1253
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:59,007
Because during the

1254
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,151
Look at these

1255
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,175
At these

1256
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,199
Situation

1257
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,479
Outside of Toronto

1258
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:10,783
Politics

1259
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,063
To blame

1260
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,343
Extra wires

1261
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,623
It's foolish

1262
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,927
Because you just need to deal with the problem as the problem

1263
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,719
The problem is.

1264
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:19,743
Fusions

1265
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,279
Taking

1266
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,047
There

1267
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,071
Durability

1268
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,399
Turn themselves

1269
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:31,007
The big deal and the way that they do that

1270
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:31,775
Chief way

1271
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,847
Was through these Liars

1272
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,735
Research into this

1273
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:45,855
These stated income loans that he's talked about which 9%

1274
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:50,719
They were fraudulent at the direction of the lender not the lendy

1275
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,487
It wasn't

1276
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,791
Massively

1277
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,583
More

1278
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,351
Traveling

1279
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,399
For the person giving out the loan

1280
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,423
2

1281
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,447
Course

1282
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:04,543
Lie about your income in your ability to pay back the right

1283
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,847
Because they were lying about

1284
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:11,199
If the security of these loans

1285
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,735
Create

1286
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:13,759
A blossoming

1287
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,135
I want your

1288
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:19,903
Grossen

1289
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:23,487
Wow you approved for this loan

1290
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,255
If you give this is

1291
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,023
Is your gross income

1292
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:28,607
You give just a little bit more is your gross

1293
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:32,447
They're going to approve you for this life

1294
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,471
To get this I need

1295
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:36,287
I don't know exactly the words

1296
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,567
Probably felt

1297
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,151
Test

1298
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,431
Judiciary

1299
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:46,015
Find distillate

1300
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,551
A lot of what

1301
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,343
Lot of it

1302
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:50,623
Thumbs down

1303
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,903
Regulatory failure

1304
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:55,231
And a need for stronger regulations

1305
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,511
And enforcement of those rigged

1306
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:58,815
So

1307
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,863
I don't think Alex

1308
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:05,727
I don't know if Alex knows what William black is about

1309
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:07,007
Outside of having seen

1310
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,799
Do an interview with Bill Moyers

1311
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:10,847
Talkabouttd

1312
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,151
Now it's probably just a

1313
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,431
Surface-level things

1314
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:16,735
About

1315
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,271
We must believe all day

1316
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:20,063
Globalist stuff and all that other

1317
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:27,231
Doesn't know who he is

1318
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,583
I'm excited

1319
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,399
That interview for the

1320
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:39,519
Cuz maybe he will have figured it out by the I don't know

1321
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:40,799
Yeah obviously

1322
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,871
Based on the way the Alex

1323
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:47,711
From what I've heard and can gather from there they're like

1324
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:48,991
The Voice

1325
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:51,807
Alex probably does know more about

1326
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,343
Then

1327
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:54,879
Just

1328
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:56,415
Like a surface-level

1329
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:58,463
Belief in his globalist

1330
01:11:58,975 --> 01:11:59,487
Just because he's

1331
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:00,767
He's clearly trying to get

1332
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:01,535
He's sound

1333
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:04,095
He is not trying I think I do

1334
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:04,863
In an actual

1335
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:07,423
Discussion I think Alex knows his resume

1336
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,727
Is a credible dude

1337
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:13,823
She knows I don't read

1338
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,103
I don't think he's

1339
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,151
Like what

1340
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:19,711
Specifically involved in during the S&L crisis

1341
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:22,783
The guy I really I really don't think he does cuz

1342
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,831
He does

1343
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:28,159
I guess it wouldn't serve as interested all to debate him

1344
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:30,719
Because William black so much smarter than

1345
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,791
Maybe he's just trying to exploit

1346
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:38,399
No matter what but it's hard to tell if it's

1347
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,727
It's born out of ignorance

1348
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,263
Or Malik

1349
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:51,199
I'm not sure but

1350
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:56,831
It's fine interview as far as it goes it never gets hostile or anything like that

1351
01:12:57,087 --> 01:13:00,159
A number of points where black has to

1352
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,439
Clarify

1353
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,743
Stuff like that cuz Alex assertive

1354
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:07,071
He is constantly trying to lead him down the path that

1355
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,863
If you need something

1356
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,423
He just comes back to regulation

1357
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,447
And stuff like that

1358
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:14,495
Fairly regularly without

1359
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,543
Without making them super over

1360
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:18,079
Which I am not sure why

1361
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:23,455
Could be because he doesn't know about Alex and doesn't want to bring up regulation

1362
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,223
I'm not sure

1363
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,551
He brings up what happen

1364
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,087
Depression

1365
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:30,623
Isn't important

1366
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:33,183
I think our Mantra should be

1367
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,719
Not a penny

1368
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,511
Until we have

1369
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,815
Cora investigation started

1370
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,095
Cora

1371
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:41,631
What's the guy

1372
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:43,167
Billions prosecutor

1373
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:43,935
Broadcast

1374
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,959
The Great Depression

1375
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,263
Find Alpha

1376
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:48,799
Anthem

1377
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:49,823
Wall Street

1378
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:50,847
Fat cat

1379
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,455
Every step of the way

1380
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:59,551
Eastbound the widespread fraud

1381
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,575
Lead

1382
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,623
Yakitori

1383
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,695
50 years

1384
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,999
Work so successfully

1385
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:10,815
In America what happened to Charles Broad Street

1386
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:11,839
Finally

1387
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:12,863
Got enough

1388
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:13,887
Vertical juice

1389
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:14,911
Get rid

1390
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,191
Aftermarket

1391
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:18,239
Right near the end

1392
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:23,103
So you bring up the Cora investigation

1393
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:26,943
Interesting. Right after

1394
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,063
Dunking on them

1395
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:38,463
Embarrassing them to the point where they had to resign and stuff like that

1396
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,487
Verity

1397
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:43,839
What was the name of the bootlegging movie with Sean Connery and Kevin Costner

1398
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:44,863
Do you remember that one

1399
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:52,799
Dammit I just cuz that was about

1400
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:53,567
Breaking up

1401
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:58,943
Bootleggers

1402
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:01,759
Socorro

1403
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,295
And it just

1404
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:07,391
Didn't have enough action I don't have any Gunplay

1405
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,463
Wrote like like that was the other guy

1406
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:13,535
That Will Ferrell

1407
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,119
The pecora investigation

1408
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,143
A buddy cop

1409
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:21,727
Perhaps it's

1410
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:22,495
Find

1411
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:26,335
Sing is it interesting

1412
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:28,383
The system worked well enough

1413
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:31,199
Aftermath of the Great

1414
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:35,551
That be conclusion of there the report of the investigation

1415
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:36,575
Dexter go back

1416
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,367
It talks about how like

1417
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:40,927
Lace out all the causes

1418
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,975
Feelings games

1419
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,999
We're being played

1420
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,535
By Banks and lenders and

1421
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,303
Stuff like that

1422
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,071
And then

1423
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:47,839
Seems like

1424
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:50,911
We don't really have recommendation

1425
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,447
Because they have already

1426
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:54,751
Taken care of over the course of this investigation

1427
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:57,823
Because by the time the investigation ended glass-steagall it already

1428
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,871
We passed along with the other banking

1429
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,639
Reform bills

1430
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,943
Did system

1431
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,967
Even work better

1432
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:07,551
Because during the investigation people like

1433
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:09,599
Over starting to learn stuff we better fix it

1434
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:17,791
It's just another symptom of how broken fix our problems

1435
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,559
The problems they were like

1436
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:24,703
Instead of being like what what if we just rode out the investor

1437
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:27,519
I just saw where

1438
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:33,919
I wonder if we could Coronavirus

1439
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,711
So we can bring another

1440
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:36,735
Years

1441
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,015
Is much money out of this is

1442
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:40,575
Responsible

1443
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,671
The important things

1444
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,695
Number is that

1445
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,719
When the chorus

1446
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:49,279
Ahead and win the S&L crisis

1447
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,863
All of it was about regulation

1448
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,887
Regulation

1449
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:54,655
Markets that

1450
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:55,423
Falling into

1451
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:56,959
Negative patterns

1452
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:57,983
So

1453
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,031
For Alex

1454
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:00,799
Sort of

1455
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:03,103
Like bread and butter and everything that

1456
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:09,247
Kind of comes down to regulated market doesn't seem like that's something that

1457
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,527
Alex should be

1458
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,575
Into but

1459
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,343
Expert

1460
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,879
Enough Alex

1461
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:17,183
Him to sign off on this idea that

1462
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:17,951
The collapse

1463
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,023
Plant

1464
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:24,095
That's okay

1465
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,143
He tried to lead him down that road

1466
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:27,935
And we'll see how black

1467
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:28,703
Response

1468
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,239
You're saying

1469
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:46,367
He was against it

1470
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:55,583
No I'm not saying that I'm not I don't know the Congress

1471
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,119
I'm telling you

1472
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,655
In the trade

1473
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:03,007
Everybody knew that if you made something called a liar

1474
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:06,079
It was because they were fraud

1475
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,103
Overwhelmingly

1476
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,151
And I think it's going to produce

1477
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:12,223
Horses paid not to know

1478
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,503
Right

1479
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:16,063
Sneakers don't go in front of Congress

1480
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:22,207
Play Count Congress

1481
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,535
Financial derivative

1482
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:27,583
And everybody

1483
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,887
Wall Street

1484
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:32,191
This is the greatest thing

1485
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,983
Since sliced bread

1486
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,263
Right

1487
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:37,055
Everything's going to be wonderful

1488
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,103
Adidas

1489
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:40,895
Because we have it

1490
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,943
Can't compete with a German

1491
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,759
Universal Banks

1492
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:50,367
So we have to get rid of every protected we never put places

1493
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:52,159
In place the United States

1494
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,695
Mukbang

1495
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:54,975
Complete

1496
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,583
It's like a little bit

1497
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,863
Narrative

1498
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:01,887
Is Maury real

1499
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,423
That's a tough thing to yell

1500
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:05,727
That's a problem for that is a tough

1501
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:08,543
He doesn't get to demonize the politicians

1502
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,567
Stuff like that

1503
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,871
When it's easy to demonize them as just be

1504
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:18,783
Willfully composite

1505
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:19,551
Because

1506
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:22,111
They look the other way

1507
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,647
You know baby

1508
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:27,999
Some people had misgivings about looking the other way

1509
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:31,839
Had a suspicion that something bad could happen of course no one was

1510
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,447
Having

1511
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:40,031
Having him on there it's really interesting

1512
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:42,079
It's that late I was definitely

1513
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,103
An attempt on Alex's

1514
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:46,431
Hard to get that sound bite

1515
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,991
But because black nose thing

1516
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,271
Understand

1517
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,063
He's like well

1518
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:55,135
On the part of people committing the fraudulent

1519
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,975
There's more new wants to it now it's not it

1520
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:01,791
So it doesn't get hostile

1521
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:02,815
Interview

1522
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,607
Amanda to go there

1523
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:05,631
Separate Ways

1524
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,679
And then Alex gets back to

1525
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,447
Complaining about the

1526
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:12,543
Very

1527
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,311
Itachi

1528
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,080
Subject

1529
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,456
Even if he wasn't attached to it before

1530
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:21,504
What kind of people were just saying

1531
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:24,320
Lego he's attached to it he could have just not said anything

1532
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:25,856
But now that he's

1533
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,648
You like

1534
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:31,232
I'm going to talk about it all the time

1535
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:33,024
Between

1536
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,328
He's only doing that

1537
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,352
Is the media

1538
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,168
He needs to fight back

1539
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:40,192
Against

1540
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,472
Explain

1541
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:51,200
They say you want to murder cops

1542
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:58,112
Cops murder

1543
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:01,696
Collapse

1544
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:08,864
Mha

1545
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,936
You know what your cocktail

1546
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:14,240
I mean

1547
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,544
This is psychological warfare

1548
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:22,944
They need it to be wild

1549
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:27,296
Why do they come out in November

1550
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:47,008
So I don't know who that Al-Qaeda members been killed

1551
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,288
X

1552
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:49,568
Pacific

1553
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:51,104
Let's talk about chemical Ops

1554
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,712
Ali Hassan almost

1555
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,504
Who is the cousin of Saddam Hussein

1556
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,808
And also God who authorized

1557
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,088
Use of chemical weapons on

1558
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:01,856
Records

1559
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:02,880
Attempted genocide

1560
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,672
On June 24th

1561
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:06,976
2017 guilty of crimes against

1562
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:10,560
Is execution was postponed

1563
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:13,120
And then president

1564
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,912
Was hesitant to find the Executioner

1565
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:15,936
Over political

1566
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,496
This was allegedly all cleared up

1567
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,776
On February 2000

1568
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:25,408
Chemical Ali

1569
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:28,480
This time for quick play no role in The Killing of between

1570
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:31,296
Shi'ite Muslim

1571
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:33,856
During the Revolt in southern Iraq that followed the night

1572
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,624
91 /

1573
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,392
Persian Gulf War

1574
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,928
He was also sentenced

1575
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:39,488
The death of third time on March 2nd 2009

1576
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:42,816
This time for the assassination of grand Ayatollah Muhammad Ali

1577
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:45,120
He's also been

1578
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:45,888
What's the Death Punch

1579
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,568
It's not like

1580
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,848
He's been

1581
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:55,872
He's been sentenced

1582
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:59,712
You don't need to retract it because he wants it

1583
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:02,272
Almost blue.

1584
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:05,088
Confused because he's an idiot me can't read

1585
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:09,952
Instead of getting to the bottom of where is confusion stems from

1586
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,768
Proof of immediacy

1587
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,560
Pathetically childish behavior

1588
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:17,632
Chemical Ali was executed on

1589
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,656
January something

1590
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,424
2010

1591
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:20,704
Exact date

1592
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,240
But that's the time that he died

1593
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,520
All the other times are Alex

1594
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:24,800
Just misunderstanding

1595
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,336
Different trials

1596
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:28,640
That he had over the course of

1597
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:29,664
2 years

1598
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:32,224
It's real stupid

1599
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:38,880
It's real f****** stupid sentenced to death like you walk out of the courtroom and then you

1600
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:41,696
I don't know

1601
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:45,024
In the interest of total fairness I should point out there was a Reaper

1602
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,096
The chemical Ali was killed in Basra on April

1603
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:49,120
6 2003

1604
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:53,472
They wasn't that reported it

1605
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,008
So that's the only thing I can

1606
01:23:55,264 --> 01:24:00,128
You think over that's still only one that four times about the four times he was sent

1607
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,152
Absolutely

1608
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:02,944
So this is Dad man

1609
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,480
B dad

1610
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,504
That b*******

1611
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:09,344
Alex has a breakdown about how

1612
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:40,320
Shut up conspiracy theorist

1613
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:45,440
Is a weird metaphor

1614
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:50,816
The floor

1615
01:24:54,656 --> 01:25:00,288
I don't know who's who in this medicine

1616
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,568
Now it's a mine

1617
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:31,520
What's going on or what

1618
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:45,088
Dammit you still my screenplay

1619
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:49,440
Where they at

1620
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:52,000
Reminder

1621
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,792
Prophecy

1622
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:17,600
And you have no idea how bad this is going to get

1623
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:25,792
That was a protracted metaphor

1624
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:31,168
We're good guys trying to help everybody metaphorically stupid stupid

1625
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:33,472
I can't believe that he imagines that he is

1626
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:34,240
Goodbye

1627
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:36,544
I can see that delusion but the idea

1628
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,080
In his house

1629
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,872
Flash my metaphors like

1630
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:43,200
Please stop doing this politely

1631
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,480
Is very bizarre

1632
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:53,952
Can't you tell if this is a self-fulfilling prophecy about the Pittsburgh

1633
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:58,560
The Pittsburgh shooting happening is a self-fulfilling prophecy because

1634
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:00,864
Of what all of these gun-grabbers are doing

1635
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:05,472
So again he's trying to justify the actions

1636
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:08,288
I'm complaining about people who sang

1637
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,056
He's advocating

1638
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:09,824
For this

1639
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:14,688
Please himself

1640
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:17,248
As the true victim of that crime

1641
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:20,576
Alex

1642
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:27,232
This is your fault for putting out that much

1643
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:33,632
People who sings like this guy

1644
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:35,680
Sensationalizing that miac report

1645
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:42,080
Making guys reinforcing now paranoid world

1646
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,872
Against you because the mic reports

1647
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:47,200
Conclusions are correct

1648
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:48,736
Existed

1649
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:50,272
If you hadn't put that

1650
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:53,344
So who's really at fault here

1651
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:08,448
About the very things that he was complaining about previously

1652
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,312
Mystery

1653
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:20,480
Yeah she's a how many narratives if we go through

1654
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:22,016
15 state

1655
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:23,552
To keep our bearings about it

1656
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:24,832
We've got to get to something

1657
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:25,856
Concrete

1658
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:31,744
So we got to we got to get on

1659
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,304
Actually exist

1660
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:36,352
Like Desmond.

1661
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:40,448
Need to find

1662
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:42,752
Find my constant

1663
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:44,288
Alex bringing up

1664
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:47,360
An actual thing that I can look into

1665
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,408
Turns out to be

1666
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,432
Document

1667
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,456
Council on Foreign Relations

1668
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:55,808
No one's ever wanted to rule the world there aren't Global Elite

1669
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:59,136
Relations in literally hundreds of documents

1670
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:00,928
Justin last few years

1671
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,448
May 1st 2008

1672
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:17,056
David Rockefeller

1673
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:26,528
Well then

1674
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:30,112
That's a reference to one of his sponsors

1675
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:30,880
Home game

1676
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,184
Home game gorilla

1677
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:35,744
He was just doing a plug for them

1678
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:37,280
Plush gorilla toy

1679
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:41,376
Easy to do a little product plug

1680
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,912
Subtle

1681
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:44,192
Is a

1682
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:47,264
Address

1683
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:50,080
The estimated value

1684
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:52,128
It's a scam

1685
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:55,968
Yeah

1686
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:02,624
But this document

1687
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,160
Institutions of global government

1688
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:07,744
Governance program

1689
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:13,376
Title

1690
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,400
For someone like out

1691
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:16,192
You actually read the document

1692
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:17,216
First thing to jump

1693
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:21,568
The first paragraph literally say the program is funded by a grant from the

1694
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:22,336
Foundation

1695
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:25,408
Organization I have literally never heard

1696
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:29,248
Also it specifies who's running this program

1697
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,784
Who's in charge of Usher

1698
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:32,320
It's not David Rock

1699
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:34,880
This report at all

1700
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:37,696
His name does come up but only is like

1701
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,232
Foundation with

1702
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:42,816
Doesn't doesn't

1703
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,864
So personally involved in

1704
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:47,168
As is always the case

1705
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,472
Does about

1706
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:54,592
You're out of a title that includes words like Global governance

1707
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,384
In reality what that refers to

1708
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:00,736
Do here is not so much the creation of a world government but the idea of managing approach

1709
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:02,272
The issues that aren't isolate

1710
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,296
Country RV

1711
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:04,832
As the document

1712
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:05,600
Explain

1713
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:06,624
Quotes

1714
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,184
The program will take an issue a area approach

1715
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,464
Focusing on Arrangements

1716
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,072
Governing State conduct International

1717
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:17,120
A meeting for broad sets of challenge

1718
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,144
1

1719
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,680
Caltrain transnational threats

1720
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:22,496
That's including terrorism for proliferation of weapons

1721
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,776
Construction inspector

1722
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:24,544
Diseases

1723
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,360
Protecting the environment in promoting energy secure

1724
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:29,664
Three managing global economy

1725
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:31,200
And for preventing

1726
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,224
Responding to fire

1727
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:36,576
They going to explain the variety of approaches that they are

1728
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,136
In each of these figures the program book

1729
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:41,696
Consider whether the most promising framework for governance

1730
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:42,976
Is a formal organization

1731
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:44,256
Universal membership

1732
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:46,048
EG the United

1733
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:48,864
A regional Regional organization

1734
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:52,448
Or a narrower informal Coalition of like-minded

1735
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:54,752
Or some combination of all three

1736
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,824
A narrower informal Coalition of like-minded

1737
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:00,128
Breezes basically description of a lion

1738
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:02,944
This is saying that it's possible that it's them

1739
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:05,760
The best equipped

1740
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:06,784
Respond to a crisis

1741
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:07,808
But in others

1742
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:09,856
Perhaps just countries on the same page

1743
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:10,624
Will be back

1744
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:14,720
That seems counter to the idea that this document is about establishing a one-world government

1745
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,536
If you read the whole thing about global cooperation

1746
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:18,560
Not Global governor

1747
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,352
Governance is the word they chose

1748
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:22,400
Which sound similar to government

1749
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,448
Man we got a

1750
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:25,216
Figure out how to

1751
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:32,384
Yeah I'm probably a lot of people don't understand

1752
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:34,432
What people with bad wheel

1753
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:38,272
Jerome guys and got them

1754
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,296
Just call it though

1755
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:42,112
Happy Funtime hour and it would have been

1756
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:44,672
Fine like

1757
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:49,536
Book

1758
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:50,560
One of their

1759
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,888
Yeah probably

1760
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:54,912
I can't believe how

1761
01:32:56,192 --> 01:33:01,312
What they're describing is just what the world is interconnected

1762
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:04,896
You thought that you could just be a place by yourself but it turns out

1763
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:08,736
That if there's an earthquake in Tokyo that can affect your s***

1764
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:15,136
So how are we going to deal with all of this the best

1765
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:17,696
Is it going to be through Us in Mexico being like

1766
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:21,024
Let's fix this f****** Canyon earlier all of that show

1767
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,584
It's what are the best ways to diagnose problems

1768
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,888
That aren't just yours

1769
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:28,448
Is very specific

1770
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:30,496
About this program

1771
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,264
These problems

1772
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,288
And approaches

1773
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:34,848
With a broad spectrum

1774
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:36,128
There are multiple

1775
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,432
Paradigm

1776
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:39,456
I guess

1777
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,736
Organization

1778
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,016
They're being looked at

1779
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:42,784
Does

1780
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,600
The possibility that

1781
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:50,976
Itself is great

1782
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:54,816
This is not at all advocating

1783
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:56,608
Nothing to do with it

1784
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,360
I mean like

1785
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:09,152
Hundreds of

1786
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,224
I mean

1787
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,504
Whatever

1788
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,552
I don't care that's the one you specific

1789
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:18,368
That's okay

1790
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:23,232
It's just the same thing he does with new stories

1791
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:26,304
Read the headline in the eye

1792
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:31,680
Coda

1793
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:35,264
She called back to Somali pirate hideout in great

1794
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,544
Now that's done for the day

1795
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:40,384
Amazon you was a very reputable source

1796
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:41,920
Measurer

1797
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:44,224
Informed

1798
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:47,040
Who ended up becoming

1799
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:49,088
Yep this is just I can't get over this

1800
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:51,392
For a fact

1801
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:57,536
Alex responded to

1802
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:58,560
Delete down pads

1803
01:34:59,072 --> 01:34:59,584
And then

1804
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:02,144
Gain credibility

1805
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:02,912
To his

1806
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:03,680
Attached

1807
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:04,960
To William black

1808
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:05,728
Yeah

1809
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:06,752
Now he's callers

1810
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:08,288
His listeners

1811
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,312
Maybe don't

1812
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:17,248
Let's just go to your phone calls right now as promised

1813
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:18,528
Alex

1814
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:24,928
I'm getting kind of frustrated here and I was listening to that William black interview with you

1815
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:28,000
And I went I watched his Moyers

1816
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,584
People got to go back and watch the third segment on that

1817
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,864
This guy is

1818
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,144
He's holding back

1819
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:36,704
You know you you are a true Seeker

1820
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,056
So

1821
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:43,104
He's pulling a Glenn Beck

1822
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:47,200
This is what happens when you internalize narratives like Alex

1823
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:50,528
What you do is you exclude people with actual expert

1824
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:51,552
What to use on issues

1825
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,088
And because they don't

1826
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:59,488
Fall exactly in line with Alex's ideas but the Federal Reserve and that everybody crash the economy on purpose

1827
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:01,536
They are now Glenn Beck

1828
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:03,072
They're controlled opposition

1829
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:05,888
When in reality they're Towing

1830
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:07,424
Studied

1831
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,704
Approach

1832
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:09,984
To why what happened

1833
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:12,032
So what you do is

1834
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:13,824
You Poison the Well in more ways

1835
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:14,592
One like

1836
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:16,384
You ruined your own ability to look at

1837
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,688
And then you also

1838
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,456
Create

1839
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:22,016
I don't know if you call it an Oppositional defiant

1840
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:24,064
But you create a hostility

1841
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,088
Towards people

1842
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:26,112
Who knows things

1843
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:27,136
Who don't agree with

1844
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:30,208
Do you have it you have a built-in excuse

1845
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:31,488
S4y the world.

1846
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:33,536
Conform to your expectations

1847
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:35,072
And that's super Dave

1848
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:37,632
It always has the same endpoint

1849
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:38,400
Is cannibalism

1850
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:40,192
Anytime these kinds

1851
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:40,960
Situations

1852
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:42,752
With this

1853
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:46,080
Oh we get rid of all of the the liberal

1854
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:50,432
We don't have an enemy

1855
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:59,136
We don't have anybody to

1856
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,632
None of it means anything because all that they do for them

1857
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:11,936
Is the desire to get rid of

1858
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:13,728
Who created

1859
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:18,080
And from that perspective that

1860
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:19,104
Just like a piano

1861
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:20,384
The right

1862
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:22,688
Just thing to do like in terms

1863
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:27,040
That that delone is enough of an Argy

1864
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:28,064
To be like

1865
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,904
Exclusion

1866
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:34,720
It's just it always will end up

1867
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:36,768
Become like it's a piece of paper that's folded over

1868
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:44,960
We got rid of all the

1869
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,384
You're never going to

1870
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:55,712
Is a fractal always

1871
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,576
That's what his colors

1872
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:02,880
Because of the rain

1873
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:05,696
Sad

1874
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:11,072
Somali pirates

1875
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:13,120
Bananas

1876
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:15,936
It's weird

1877
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:17,216
Strange places

1878
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:18,752
Take your claim playing

1879
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:19,520
Your flag but

1880
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:21,312
Respect

1881
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:27,712
It honestly I think you got to give it up to these tamale pie

1882
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:31,040
Apologist in the world like Alex Jones what the f***

1883
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:37,440
You know what that's where we use that's where we've gotten away from our Roots which is apologizing for somebody

1884
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:38,720
Anyways

1885
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:42,048
I find this more interesting than the Soros

1886
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:47,936
Is a story that needs

1887
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:51,520
Play out further

1888
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:53,056
It's like

1889
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,920
There is nothing I need to know more

1890
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,968
That to me is a

1891
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:01,760
Juicy Alex Jones f******

1892
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:07,904
By virtue of the show that we do and who we cover

1893
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:08,928
Unlike

1894
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:09,696
Script

1895
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:10,976
2Cellos where it's like

1896
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:14,816
Jennifer like Breaking Bad whenever they have an episode that setting

1897
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:17,888
Entire that the bottle

1898
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:23,008
Episode

1899
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,616
Narrative
