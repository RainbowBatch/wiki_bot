1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Just wanted to give you a little introduction for this episode

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,960
And I recorded before he left for vacation

3
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:14,848
Neither of us has any idea of the news that broke over the weekend

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,408
Jeffrey Epstein death

5
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:25,856
To turn around and get an episode out for Monday about

6
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:29,440
Ryobi take care of that

7
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:34,304
By the time I would have been able to make an episode out of something

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,144
The only content that was really available of Alex covering it

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,472
Is there a 2-minute video that he shot in an airport

10
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:45,568
Where people behind him

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,664
Being in the background

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,480
Are Will and now it's Jones video

13
00:00:55,296 --> 00:01:00,160
About a minute about feelings about everything set

14
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,232
Of a commercial for his

15
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,536
Survival Foods at water filtration

16
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
So that's

17
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,352
The goods a good sign

18
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,168
Make for episode

19
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,568
So anyway

20
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680
Damned important

21
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:50,080
I have great respect for knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guy

22
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,880
MoneyGram

23
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,520
College vype.com

24
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,784
What up Jordan

25
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,088
When you were

26
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,648
Oh boy

27
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,952
Not a ton

28
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,560
I would Satan have any but it wasn't as big a problem as

29
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,376
Media had led me to believe it would be

30
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,216
I thought for sure based on all of the teeth

31
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,520
Teen dramas that it would be like

32
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
The biggest crisis

33
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,384
Philly weather

34
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,176
I did feel embarrassed

35
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,712
When you have a big

36
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,760
But it wasn't sad with that

37
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
I really want was where you were going to go

38
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:16,096
Because I was watching

39
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
One of those teenage

40
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,704
Series with my girlfriend

41
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,032
And it was very much like I was trying to think back on

42
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,592
I didn't really have that many

43
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,920
Puberty really early

44
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,832
Earlier than a lot of

45
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,696
Did you literally just tell me when you got your beard

46
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,000
I know I also my voice

47
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
It was pretty low.

48
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
Noticeable

49
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
People around

50
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,728
Answer the phone.

51
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,872
I always assumed growing up

52
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,896
That it was going

53
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,664
Going to be like

54
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,944
I'm going to get

55
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,760
Haier pimple face cuz my little sister

56
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040
I don't know

57
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,832
Oh man

58
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
She did the whole

59
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:14,720
You got to do the whole thing

60
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,000
It was brutal

61
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,839
I felt amazing

62
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,399
To struggle

63
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,591
Give experience but I do know a lot about Alex J

64
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,991
And I don't know where you are on vacation

65
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
Vacation

66
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,087
But you will be gone

67
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
Open this comes out

68
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:46,207
And you'll be free of any consequence

69
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,839
. until I get back.

70
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,631
Because I don't want to get on that I don't have that

71
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
Experience

72
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:03,615
All the internet just killed me I lost my job

73
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:10,271
I wanted to get together with you and recording episode in advance

74
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,343
The people walk

75
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,647
Week Plus without the two of us hanging out

76
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,487
Nothing about Alex

77
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Enough course

78
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,471
You know we can't really do a present-day episode

79
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,751
As well because we

80
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
According to

81
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,615
Preemptively so we got to stick around or do

82
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
Wacky Wednesday

83
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:43,039
Decided we are looking at March 13th and 14th

84
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
2013

85
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,367
And I think we're actually turning a bit of a quarter

86
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,183
Couple days

87
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487
Have some pretty wild s***

88
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
Zodiac

89
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,559
That's not what

90
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:07,615
Happens over the span of days

91
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,895
Think about

92
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:15,551
This is a couple days

93
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,623
Very excited about this

94
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,927
Bulls angles about it nope

95
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:27,071
This is just a racist massive a couple days this is one of the most racist

96
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:34,239
Things I've ever heard from Alex's show this couple days is profoundly racist

97
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519
No s***

98
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
It's deeply

99
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,103
Deeply racist

100
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
Tipo pain

101
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:44,991
Let's gets racist I think that makes perfect even up about

102
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,319
So we'll get to that and I will also get to the

103
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,391
Shoutouts

104
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
2 out of context drop

105
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,999
For Today Show so let's get one of them

106
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,543
Alright

107
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:14,943
Not too much

108
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,247
I know guilt only appreciation

109
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:23,647
For the people that I would like to give a shout out to now

110
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:36,447
I have a bit of guilt about anybody who's for socio-psychological mess

111
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:42,591
Appreciate everybody from the bottom of my heart

112
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,383
Today is lousy with joke

113
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,479
This first one is somebody who I was

114
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,551
But I'm not sure that I endorse the message

115
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,343
That your name implies

116
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:05,119
We do not advocate for cryptocurrencies of any swap

117
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
Next

118
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,663
Alex Jones dog thank you so much

119
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,183
So I finally like to get some chat at some people donated on an elevated level we appreciate it very much so

00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,719
Thank you so much

121
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Thank you so much

122
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:39,167
There are no wild wolves in Chicago coyote thank you so much

123
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,959
And that very well might be

124
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,495
I'm willing to accept that

125
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:50,687
I believe it to be a wolf but if it's a coyote then so be it whatever

126
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:56,319
I will take your criticism and accepted at thank you along with Melissa and

127

You are all wonderful technocrat

128
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,399
Heroin

129
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,239
Freakishly large

130
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,663
Thank you so much Melissa

131
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,343
Tell me somebody that they're wrong

132
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,695
Well also donating some of

133
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,999
It really does

134
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:40,351
Leaping catch while well-supported feels familiar

135
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,167
Jordans

136
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:49,311
We've got this episode to go if you are listening and you like sports

137
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,639
Please do

138
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,967
Text Rob from Today Show

139
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
Hats

140
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,023
Alright alright can I have the most racist couple of episodes

141
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,351
It started off by

142
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,935
I think if I recalled the context of that

143
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,495
Outward assault on the testicles

144
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,287
Pharmacological

145
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
Who cares

146
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,615
Alex is worried about his balls

147
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
Start on the 13th

148
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,991
And I we get to

149
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,015
Big guests

150
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
Alex is going to have on

151
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
And this is continuing

152
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,415
Right before you went on vacation

153
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,207
He had like

154
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,255
Ted Nugent Michael Savage

155
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,535
Daddy's big dick

156
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,119
Yeah

157
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Hoes fighting

158
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,751
Piers Morgan in other people's Market spaces

159
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
And now he's trying to

160
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,639
Continue that with that

161
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Gigante

162
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
Presence

163
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,319
I've seen the numbers

164
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:15,071
Certainly

165
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
Years ago

166
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:36,063
Coasttocoastam for

167
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,215
Yesterday

168
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
Every show

169
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,247
What singers of police

170
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:14,975
I would argue that your hearing

171
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,535
Iran

172
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,071
Is there air in your show

173
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,375
Directed towards

174
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,679
Similar topic

175
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,471
Also

176
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,263
That's not a good thing

177
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
No

178
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,127
My ships going world 1

179
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:36,479
Is George Noory from coasttocoastam

180
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,039
George Noory was the first person

181
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,855
To give him a large platform is a perfect argument

182
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,671
Programs like coasttocoastam

183
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
Be pretty dang

184
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,999
They're usually not most of the time

185
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
More critical

186
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,519
George Noory

187
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:06,175
It's hard not to be

188
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:13,343
Most of the time I don't think the problem isn't a problem

189
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,647
Ideas

190
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,231
There's so far past the point of believability that they're not really threatened

191
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,047
However a platform like that where the host has

192
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,887
Cultivated an audience full of open-minded but not that critical people

193
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:30,495
Where the host has a policy of not being the Hostile interviewer and letting people speak their piece

194
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,055
A platform like that isn't ideal Target

195
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,079
For someone like Alex

196
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,151
It's the greatest gift you could ever give a malignant

197
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
Looking to expand

198
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,039
What does Coast-to-Coast the hard work needs to be done in the booking

199
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
Process

200
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,647
You can have a loose freewheeling non-confrontational interview

201
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:52,255
But if you do you have a responsibility to not allow people on your show

202
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
Who are only there to

203
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,583
Put your audience and get them into their called

204
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,143
If you encourage open-mindedness and

205
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,423
Complete naivete

206
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
And you're off

207
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
Give an obligation to

208
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,519
Protect them from delicious

209
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,359
And that's a part of the equation

210
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:13,759
If they don't book they're so very carefully what they're basically doing it

211
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,319
Where they can be targeted by someone with bad well

212
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
And that's

213
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
At least

214
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,695
Alex Jones

215
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
And for this

216
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,255
And many other reason

217
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
I would like to say the George Noory

218
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
Can go f******

219
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,679
George Noory put all that fish in the barrel and then Alex

220
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
Yeah that's

221
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:39,103
Exactly what happened I don't know if I don't know that necessarily A lot of these people are all of that

222
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
Cognizant

223
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
Engaging

224
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,247
But when you have a show like ghost ghost

225
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,039
Everything is based on a lack of evidence

226
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
Possible

227
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,231
Is a breeding ground

228
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
Petri dish

229
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
Of

230
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
Graduate

231
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,287
Well now I need to know what is

232
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
I can't keep

233
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,407
I can't stay open-minded and all that stuff

234
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:19,807
But you're not going to the proof or

235
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,743
The open-minded

236
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,327
Yo-yo are towards

237
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,935
You'll certainly be directional going

238
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,471
Exactly I'll be there

239
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,567
I don't think this is any

240
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,639
Statement that I'm making her like something like Coast-to-Coast shouldn't

241
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,711
To be censured

242
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,063
These people running shows like this

243
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,647
Or they need to be open about the fact that like

244
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,183
We're trying to do

245
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,767
People you shouldn't be able to

246
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,095
Pretend that your your intentions aren't in that direction

247
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,399
And then behave in every way

248
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
That leads towards

249
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
You need an outlet

250
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,031
Sure I don't know what they do but yes

251
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,639
Clip they're also saying that

252
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,831
There's a little bit of a delusion of grandeur that's in there too

253
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,159
Because he's not just saying that his ideas are all mainstream

254
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
He's

255
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,975
Convinced that he's the reason

256
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
They're mainstream

257
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,303
And all of these people are just following

258
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
In his wake

259
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,119
Might be some truth to that

260
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,271
This was

261
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,623
Without even being on Infowars it was it was not even a mean in the media

262
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
Yesterday

263
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,303
And when you see a chain reaction

264
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,607
More and more

265
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,911
Or something

266
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,575
It's not on Infowars

267
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,415
30 seconds later

268
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:38,815
I mean it wasn't on the website

269
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,935
And then also

270
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:49,311
Real dangerous mentality to have that everybody gets all there already

271
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,151
I think he accidentally

272
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,735
Most radio

273
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,527
No it's okay that I

274
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,831
Most rated most radio show

275
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,903
It does

276
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,743
So I told you this really racy

277
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
Couple of days

278
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,815
And it starts pretty quick

279
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
Because Alex

280
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,959
Is on storm like they're attacking white people

281
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,007
Is Big narrative on the 13th

282
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,103
To the bottom of what's going on here

283
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
His intentions

284
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Become Crystal

285
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,039
Not manual

286
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,095
How could you get that wrong

287
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,167
The LA times has Emmanuel

288
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,383
Nevermind

289
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:32,735
So apparently there's an LA Times article that

290
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,551
Sound

291
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
Closet

292
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:41,695
Didn't know really what to go on here I wasn't quite sure it just

293
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,743
He could be talking about nothing

294
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,047
Or anything

295
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
I need more details

296
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,631
Until a little bit later in the episode

297
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,423
Details and we

298
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
Figure out what is

299
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
Jones

300
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,751
Who is that

301
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:31,871
I love that

302
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
It's not even

303
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,503
Sowega

304
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Issue

305
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
Attention to

306
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,559
He wasn't right

307
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,119
The good thing that nobody ever listen to him

308
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,383
But hear what we're seeing Alex

309
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
As usual

310
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
Is leaving outside

311
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
Very important

312
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:12,575
Mark's comments were in response to a video that was put out by a Tennessee weapon

313
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,111
Instructor by the name of James

314
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
James Yeager

315
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:18,464
Literally say Obama put forth any gun control measures

316
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,512
It was time to quote start killing

317
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,816
Mark potok was just

318
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
Quoting James Yeager

319
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,912
It's really indicative

320
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,960
All the time

321
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,520
Some gun weirdo threatens to kill people

322
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:37,920
Someone who works at the splc says to kill people

323
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:41,760
And people in his community

324
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:47,648
And Alex ignores the original threatened pretends that the sblc guy is not so just saying that all white people are terrorists

325
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:53,280
This really is one of the main tricks that Alex uses on his show and the robbing a story

326
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,352
That would make it make

327
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:01,472
What happened here was that potok wrote an article about this threat

328
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
And provided some

329
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:05,568
Specific examples of other groups and individuals around the country were making

330
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Similar threats

331
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,152
About a violent revolution that they were ready to set off

332
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:13,504
This article was published in salon on January 11th

333
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,552
Infotalk

334
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,576
To discuss the topic

335
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
Alex

336
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,624
Responding to

337
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,696
I know that he needs to make a big deal out of every procedure

338
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,976
You played against white people

339
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,048
You should know what's going on here

340
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,352
You should know what actually is going on

341
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,656
Because this is what Alex's

342
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,960
Turning into all whites are terrorists

343
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
But there's more

344
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,824
The original article at the center of this whole thing like I said

345
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
Who is Mark potok

346
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,128
Responding to

347
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,688
And once you realize who James

348
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,712
Everything comes in

349
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,040
Yeager's the CEOs tactical response

350
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,112
A company that sells weapons weapon parts in tactical training

351
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,160
They're also a sponsor of Alex's

352
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:57,280
Jagr has been on the show many times and Alex sell gun parts from his sight

353
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,816
His website

354
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,888
Or at least he definitely did in the past I'm not sure if he still does

355
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:07,264
That relationship is mysteriously undisclosed and Alex's commentary about Mark

356
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
Time

357
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
All of it

358
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
It's nonsense

359
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:12,896
No

360
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
That's not okay

361
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,248
How is that

362
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,040
How's that can happen

363
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:19,808
I feel like

364
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,392
There's so many things that aren't

365
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,928
Illegal and that

366
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,464
I don't know how to

367
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
Police correctly

368
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,792
Really shouldn't be

369
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,072
Possible or okay

370
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,144
Yeah I mean

371
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,448
Manipulation

372
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,984
And a level of

373
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,336
Absolutely

374
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:46,944
So park photo center who is behind

375
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,760
Report that the LA Times article is

376
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,808
The root of all of this stuff

377
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,368
Articles

378
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
4 salon

00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,952
Of this

381
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,232
This commentary

382
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,536
Is about James Yeager

383
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,584
Okay

384
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,864
Explicit connection

385
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:11,520
Between this all being about people explicitly threatening to kill people

386
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,616
You got a cart and horse

387
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,640
Situation

388
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
That's completely

389
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:21,504
Alex's forgetting about with actually behind

390
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,600
The chicken-and-egg whatever the cause and effect

391
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,880
He's ignoring the cause

392
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,928
Talk about the effect

393
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,696
In a vacuum

394
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
Because it's b*******

395
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,584
And he only does this

396
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,608
What is issues

397
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,704
White gun owners

398
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
You should be able to threaten

399
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
Kill people

400
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
Eyewitness

401
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,944
Terror

402
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,248
He's a terror

403
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,600
What would what's really interesting about this

404
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:04,768
Because of the LA Times article the mark potok

405
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
Because of all that

406
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
A big predict

407
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,424
In this next clip we will see

408
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,728
And it's pretty

409
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,264
And I think I understand

410
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
And they are

411
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,792
And 5 minutes

412
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:44,192
So here again this is what your talked about are on our last episode

413
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,848
It is coming around he's a Star Wars

414
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,712
Coming around

415
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,016
Is coming around

416
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,376
X

417
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,192
What's really interesting here is that

418
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,728
Within a couple weeks

419
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,752
The Boston bombing

420
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,080
So Alex is here

421
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,408
And people are going to interpret predicting

422
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,688
The boss

423
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,992
And when the Boston bombing happen

424
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,296
He's going to be able to say I predicted

425
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,856
He's not responding

426
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,392
To the LA Times

427
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,672
For the splc

428
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,696
ER mark potok

429
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,256
He's responding to knowing the

430
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,280
Did James Yeager

431
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,608
And people like him are threatening to do stuff like this

432
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
Yeah

433
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
This is

434
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,704
This is self-defense

435
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,752
This is preemptive Justice

436
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:28,896
Application for things that he has a very good idea that his militia buddies are going to do

437
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,432
That's what's going on here

438
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:33,248
Conspiracy

439
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:37,088
See even from his predictions

440
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,112
A terrorist

441
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:38,880
What a car

442
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,904
Faster route

443
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,928
His militia Buddies

444
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,952
Sing a terrorist attack

445
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
Telling him about it

446
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
Having him

447
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,560
Say that there's going to be one that

448
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,352
Going to blame on them

449
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,656
To be clear that's exactly what I'm saying

450
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:57,056
The weather of the world

451
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,872
Corners of the world

452
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
This

453
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,456
Fplc guy coming out

454
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
Warning

455
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,504
And saying hey this is

456
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,784
Problem

457
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,320
There are these white

458
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,856
Right-wing militias

459
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,488
It would be wise to pay attention to Alex knows that that's in response to things

460
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,048
That are people he knows people who

461
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:24,448
Sponsor his show he knows that they are the people who have made threats like that

462
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
Comments don't exist

463
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,264
Devoid of contact

464
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,848
Do you think this

465
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,640
Because other people have made

466
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,688
These threats Alex knows that

467
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,712
Panino's

468
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:40,320
The people who play for me

469
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,600
If they're protected business

470
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:48,256
To go ahead and create a pre-emptive narrative

471
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,608
I can create

472
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,912
Whole new season based on that

473
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,728
And then it's a perfect strategy for him

474
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,544
He's running interference

475
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,664
That's a big part of it

476
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,272
Motivation motivation

477
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
4

478
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,648
The terrorists because

479
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,256
We would we would almost certainly have done more to investigate

480
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:23,072
Are the FBI would have done more to investigate White

481
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,912
If there weren't a massive amount of people who are

482
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,216
Supporting the present

483
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:35,616
You know what the biography people like

484
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,920
Alex

485
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,736
Looking at

486
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,832
Broader problem than just

487
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
People from The Middle

488
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
Right

489
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,184
Yeah absolutely

490
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,720
You know there is a

491
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,744
There's an even

492
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,304
Further benefit to it

493
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,072
No one

494
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
Does anything

495
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,680
Militia guys italic

496
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,448
Text nose

497
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,984
And support

498
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,264
Is Cool Whip

499
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,872
It's still good for his business to act this way

500
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,920
Because where is the

501
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:14,016
Griezmann

502
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,808
Did he make so much money off

503
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,856
It's so Central to

504
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,904
Being the fuel for his world.

505
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:25,024
In the chance that something happens

506
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,560
In case it nothing happens

507
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,584
We're still making money

508
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,864
We're still making money

509
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,656
It's the perfect thing to happen

510
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,984
For him to have

511
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,776
To somebody

512
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,128
These guys are planning s***

513
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:43,200
What they're going to do

514
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,600
To do it eventually

515
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:54,720
Enter in a long enough Spanish

516
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,512
If you give it given enough time

517
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,536
And enough

518
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,352
Support

519
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,120
From

520
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,656
Media figures like Alex

521
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,752
Especially now that we live in

522
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,056
What is zodiac

523
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,616
Certainly with the context

524
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,896
More years of History

525
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
It does feel

526
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,504
I don't want to I don't want to apply that to Alex

527
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,272
Mentality

528
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
We can always

529
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:21,856
Speculate that

530
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,160
Or

531
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,464
Likely is just

532
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
Let's

533
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,768
Let's build this narrative

534
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,560
And also a money money money

535
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,168
Get around to reading some of the LA Times

536
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,192
Stop it

537
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,160
Homegrown extremists

538
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,952
Look who they shows extremist

539
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:05,120
What part of

540
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
With the US government

541
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,072
They are white

542
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:49,920
You see how easy a jump he makes there from the saying

543
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,224
Subway terrorism

544
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,784
To being like they're saying

545
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,088
Right

546
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,880
Well I mean it is

547
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,904
The only thing that he

548
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
Can say

549
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:07,840
Everybody who's a Muslim

550
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,608
Who is a terrorist

551
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:11,936
So far

552
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,472
But in the Attic

553
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:18,592
Why do radical Islam is because they're all secretly radical Islam

554
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,152
So every brown person is at

555
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:21,920
Terrorist

556
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,504
If he wants to maintain any kind of ideological

557
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,808
If you call one person

558
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,832
A terrorist in a group

559
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:34,464
There's probably

560
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,744
He's not doing that a

561
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,352
Probably take the larger piece

562
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,144
Can't argue on the merits

563
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,960
Are there white people who are terrorists

564
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,544
Because if that's the conversation that that falls apart entirely

565
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,384
He's going to have to go out of his way to deny Every Act

566
00:33:54,944 --> 00:34:01,088
He has no awareness

567
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:05,440
How does radar work but these specific cases

568
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,768
Conspiracies

569
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,840
The argument that being

570
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,144
They're saying people are terrorists

571
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,960
Nonspecific

572
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
Stupid

573
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,032
You can just grandstand on that

574
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:20,800
Go ahead

575
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
The point massage

576
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,992
Send lose the argument that people are committing terrorist Act

577
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:33,856
Yeah I know there's nobody has more in common with ice

578
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
White crested polish

579
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
Alex

580
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,488
So Alex

581
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,792
It's around 2

582
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,816
Stream

583
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
Was going to happen

584
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,608
Because this

585
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
Shrimp

586
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,216
So it's going to be a false flag

587
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,312
It's okay

588
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,640
Don't want them to do cuz then they like

589
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
It was a

590
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,784
What he can do that

591
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,064
Take the parts out

592
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
I like it

593
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,864
Bright

594
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,632
His

595
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,424
Pressured tone about like

596
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,472
There's going to be there going to blow something up

597
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,520
But when he gets more specific

598
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,288
You start to under

599
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
Understand

600
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,848
He doesn't know what he's talking

601
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,896
This is such a vague idea

602
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,688
This is

603
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,712
Extreme level that

604
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,480
You predict it

605
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:37,088
Drudgereport.com

606
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:03,200
In 2019 when we were discussing Alex's narratives that he was building about the El Paso in

607
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,480
Shooting he discussed

608
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,272
The Arlington Road model

609
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,832
Arlington Road system

610
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,624
In 2013 here

611
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,440
He's talking about the government nuking a city

612
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:16,000
And then killing him presumably I guess

613
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:21,376
Kind of discussing the Arlington Road system

614
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,448
That movie was out before then

615
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,776
Eviter products

616
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,336
This is stupid

617
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,856
Did you see how the 24 seconds of a clip took a little journey

618
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,672
It started with you know I break down crying

619
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,976
Cuz I have a feeling that

620
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:52,608
I bet he said Obama and his controllers are considering using a low-yield nuke

621
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,888
American city

622
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,448
From a prediction

623
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,496
That tone is reporting

624
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:03,872
Obama and his controllers are considering their okay I feel like they're going

625
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:10,784
The tone of that is very much like as if he has a reason to believe that other than his stupid

626
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,320
Analysis of the world

627
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,600
That's

628
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:19,744
Even though I don't know if it's easier or harder now

629
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,536
Mix up those tone

630
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,608
Everything he says

631
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,888
Is a Feeling

632
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,680
And is based in

633
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,704
At bat

634
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
7

635
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,032
Hand knowledge of

636
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,080
The summary of somebody else's

637
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,384
Sure

638
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,944
So whenever he changes

639
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,528
Opinion reporting

640
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,296
I really

641
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,064
Noticing

642
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,344
Because I it's all

643
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
The same thing

644
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,928
Yeah I can see how if I didn't

645
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,952
Can have this level

646
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,000
Experience that that would be

647
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,536
Serious way of

648
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,072
Transforming

649
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,608
Your

650
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,632
Apocalypto

651
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,704
2 prediction

652
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,288
Is reporting listeners purposes

653
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,080
He's doing it probably

654
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,104
I would say

655
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
I don't know how much

656
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,176
Muffled

657
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,736
But with the hopes that people will take it more serious

658
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:16,064
Absecon

659
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,088
And talkingshit

660
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:20,160
Clips of George Noory interview cuz it's

661
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,440
Really boring

662
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,256
Been very bad but what does solidify

663
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:28,096
Nori f****** loves Alex Jones

664
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,168
The two of them are on the same page about political stuff

665
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,496
Would you would know if you listen to a little bit of Coast to Coast AM

666
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,568
Yes he does let that show a little bit more than

667
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:41,920
Someone who is presumably impartial in

668
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,736
Just like a guy wants

669
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,784
Like he's very very

670
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,552
Against

671
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,856
Circle coffee

672
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,488
Who cares

673
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,048
Good Times

674
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
Coming up on the show

675
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
That is

676
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,120
James O'Keefe

677
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,656
Project Camelot

678
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,752
We don't have to listen to him

679
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,016
You shouldn't

680
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,952
Broadcast

681
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:30,560
I'm coming up here in about 30 minutes

682
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:36,960
Keith Campbell.

683
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:41,056
I'm sorry I gave a Freudian slip

684
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,592
Easter Easter

685
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,384
I don't believe he's sick

686
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,200
I believe I don't want to do this

687
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:53,600
Seems like a hassle I don't want to make this 15-minute phone call

688
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,648
Busy

689
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,768
Beginning of the episode we get a new pope

690
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,352
And on the 13th of March

691
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
Smoke

692
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,936
The white smoke came above the chimney

693
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,568
Found it there was

694
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
The new pope

695
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,648
Here whenever we get a chance

696
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,184
To do that

697
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,512
And we will be breaking more of that down

698
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:39,680
Reporting of the fact

699
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,312
Commentary about the new pope

700
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,360
We don't know that it's Francis

701
00:40:55,808 --> 00:41:00,928
Anticipation

702
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,560
So this is

703
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:12,960
Episodes around the time the Pope Benedict

704
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:17,568
Is Pope Goodwin off episodes

705
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,872
I thought the odds were pretty strong

706
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,664
But Alex is going to be freaking out about it

707
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,944
Big World News

708
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,344
But Alex is on vacation when that happened

709
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,160
That was the vacation we just passed here in 2013

710
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:35,488
Benedict resigned on February 28th 2013

711
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,768
On March 3rd

712
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,096
Alex Jones response

713
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,888
News

714
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,168
Which I would describe as

715
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,728
Curiosity

716
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,264
This is interesting

717
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:51,104
Because it tells me Alex had no idea who the new pope was going to be

718
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,919
But according to his own self told backstory

719
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,943
He should know

720
00:41:55,455 --> 00:42:01,599
According to Alex nowadays Leo zagami predicted

721
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,903
The way Alex tells the story

722
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:10,303
It's heavily implied that Alex knew about sagami predicted in watch them play out in real-time but here we see our

723
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,583
Wondering

724
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
Ponte

725
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,119
Is going to be

726
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,655
I think this is

727
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,727
Probably because Alex didn't meet Leo zagami until 25

728
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,775
15 which is a bit of a problem

729
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,847
For that for that time

730
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:26,687
Alex has just taken his truth Leo's claimed that he predicted the Benedictine

731
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,735
Substantiate

732
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:33,599
I can find zero proof that Leo zagami made this prediction before Benedict resign

733
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:37,695
And knowing as much about him as I do I'm very comfortable assuming

734
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:40,511
After the fact and pretended he'd known all along

735
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,047
Most of the citations

736
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,071
To this prediction

737
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,607
Go back to Leo's book

738
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,631
Pope Francis

739
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,911
The last Pope question

740
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,679
Cinemark

741
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:51,519
Money Mason's and occultism in the decline of the Catholic Church

742
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,055
First of all to subtitles

743
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,895
But that wasn't published until April 25th

744
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,943
A further reason to be

745
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,039
Suspicious is better in October 2015

746
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,855
He said that he knew from high-level Vatican stores

747
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:11,231
The Francis was going to step down and resign

748
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,023
And that was going to happen

749
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
In 20

750
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,839
This didn't happen

751
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:18,143
Which calls into question the veracity

752
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,679
Between that

753
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:22,751
Every other piece of information in the world about Leo zagami

754
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,823
And the fact that literally no one seems to be able to produce evidence

755
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,871
The actually predicted Benedict

756
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,407
Resignation before it happened

757
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,455
I'm comfortable with my position

758
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:38,879
And it's a load of b******* that Alex believe when Leo told him about it probably again

759
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:43,743
Just because Leo's Italian Improv

760
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
To say it doesn't

761
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,583
The veracity of

762
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,351
Leo zagami

763
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,423
But their existence

764
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:53,983
You bet

765
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,775
I really clearly see here

766
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,311
2013

767
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,615
No idea who the new pope is going to be

768
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,151
And he doesn't even bring up

769
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:04,735
But his good buddy Leo zagami made a very real prediction

770
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,783
That happens to come true

771
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,063
What's Alex

772
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,087
Freaking out

773
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,391
Not just about the white smoke

774
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,183
He should be freaking out about the whole thing

775
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:17,023
Because Leo's

776
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:23,167
World Arena events the resignation of a pope

777
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,959
It's crazy

778
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:31,359
We're already deep into his prediction coming true it's not like the prediction is only true

779
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,383
Francis's

780
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:38,783
Should have every reason to be in the middle of a

781
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,063
Extended freakout

782
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,159
No

783
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,535
So if you predicted that one

784
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,863
Even though you knew he was in

785
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,679
If you predicted that

786
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,215
Evidence of

787
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
Either

788
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,287
You do have good sources

789
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:07,967
You're the kind of crazy person who would make a f****** The Longshots

790
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,783
Headlight

791
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:17,439
And knowing what I know about inclined towards the latter

792
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:20,255
Pantheon situation where I

793
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:25,631
Could have made it but

794
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,935
Like real any made that prediction in a

795
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,703
I came true

796
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,495
That is not convincing

797
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,871
But it's enough to make me like I got to track all of his other predictions

798
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:40,735
Because you are

799
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,503
Right that's

800
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,783
Very very

801
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,831
Yeah.

802
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,879
Considering almost all of his other predict

803
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,439
Can push it took credit for 9/11

804
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,719
And said he was Jesus

805
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:57,119
And clients who created a cult based on the movie The Matrix

806
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:02,239
This is created as part of his fictional eyes backstory and Alex

807
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,775
Hook Line & Sinker

808
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,847
The present-day buddy

809
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,407
That does always make me think of the reality that

810
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,711
With the infinite number of pi

811
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,247
Possibilities and probabilities

812
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,015
In the universe

813
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,807
It is entirely possible

814
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,087
For one person

815
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,623
To live their entire life

816
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,927
Every prediction that they've ever made

817
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,999
And it just be a coincidence

818
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:27,839
And I think about how miserable you miserable you would be

819
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,607
If you are that purse

820
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,655
It would be the worst

821
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,423
Feeling in the world

822
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
Yeah

823
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,287
You recognized it

824
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,847
At some point you'll probably start trying to make really

825
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:45,247
F***** up predictions trying to ruin the street so you wouldn't have to feel like you predict

826
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:49,343
Everything is fine

827
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,903
You agree plagued by it

828
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,695
Everybody

829
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,023
Better luck

830
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,047
Let's

831
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:58,815
The things

832
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:02,655
To go there was a kind of unhappy about

833
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:06,495
Something about losing that makes you feel more in control of your

834
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:13,407
Like the exact you don't have to do that when the road is really easy

835
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,711
Every one of your

836
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,247
Directions right you won't sink

837
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,807
Oh I'm so brilliant

838
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,575
Captive

839
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:23,391
Some sort of drug

840
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,183
Did you know what Alex probably does

841
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:31,583
How to spell all the time

842
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:34,399
His brain is so narcissistic

843
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,959
He transforms

844
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,775
Bananas

845
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,567
Yeah I made it

846
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:45,407
So on this Alex get back to the

847
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,431
The white

848
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,455
Quite

849
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,479
Tamara

850
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,159
Statement

851
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,839
Constitutionalist

852
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,471
White Al-Qaeda

853
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:45,311
What a little

854
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,103
The loser little titty baby

855
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,127
Like this

856
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,919
Soft man

857
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:54,271
I give your that Shakin by

858
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,039
Either have

859
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,063
Just a business

860
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,623
Skin imaginable or you are really worried

861
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,159
Edgewater

862
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:04,255
I guess either you're the most sensitive person in the world who can't handle any form of credits

863
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:09,375
You are keenly aware of the world that you are surrounded by

864
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:12,191
The right-wing militia world

865
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,983
How volatile

866
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,263
Those people are

867
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,823
You like that

868
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,103
Need to defend against

869
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,383
It's one of the two

870
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,943
My gut tells me

871
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:23,967
It's both

872
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,503
For the ladder

873
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:29,599
Well the reason I would keep.

874
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:32,159
Where is all of the

875
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:36,255
The militias that have existed from the 70s

876
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,047
60s and 70s

877
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,327
The resurgent

878
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,631
You cannot not be aware of the order

879
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,679
Absolutely

880
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,471
He can't not.

881
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:51,615
Booking one of his big sponsors Larry Owners of America

882
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:54,687
Ethan said that he would like to imagine

883
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,967
Do you have to wear that

884
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,271
Get think it's all fake

885
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,367
Makes me agree with

886
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,647
The latter being

887
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,671
True

888
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:05,695
Nelse

889
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,511
Just like we talked about before with

890
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,535
His support of trump is

891
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:16,703
He's he was all about like all freedoms all that stuff because it could happen to

892
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,263
And then once you remove that Baxter

893
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,799
None of it

894
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,359
Yep it's still one

895
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,151
Clear

896
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:27,455
Cuz you're probably wouldn't exist

897
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,735
If it wasn't

898
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:29,759
Absolutely

899
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:33,343
So Alex talked about the

900
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,135
Completely lying about

901
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:48,703
Headlines

902
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:01,503
Inherently is Terrorism and over again

903
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:06,367
It is

904
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,951
That this was coming

905
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,511
So

906
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,071
I don't know what else to say about it

907
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:18,143
It's just a white fragility White

908
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,959
Desperation is a Feeling

909
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,751
Cuz they move product

910
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,799
Key people in this world

911
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,335
Do you know what he

912
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:29,919
Will never do but would reveal everything

913
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,455
Define

914
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:39,135
You know I would love to do that

915
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:50,655
No no no

916
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,423
Probably

917
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:54,495
So Alex that got stood up by James

918
00:51:55,007 --> 00:52:01,151
Project Veritas called every woman who agreed to

919
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:08,831
This other guy from Project Veritas comes on and I don't respect him enough to know his name

920
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,367
So I don't remember what it was

921
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:13,183
Other guy from Project veritas

922
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,975
Matt there's even one guy

923
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,511
So you shows up

924
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:20,095
And a video that they put out is about going to

925
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,119
To Police Department

926
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,679
Having discussions with cops

927
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:27,263
Where you say like okay so if I call the police

928
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,031
They're going

929
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,055
How to take 3 minutes

930
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:29,823
To respond to

931
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,639
To do someone's brakes

932
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,687
To my house

933
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,039
Well

934
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,343
They want the police.

935
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,511
It seems like

936
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:50,047
It seems like

937
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,071
To endorse

938
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,095
Here's what I'd say

939
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,143
I don't want the cops to ever get the message

940
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,959
Set like we really want you to go ahead and kill people

941
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,239
I haven't

942
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:06,431
I don't want to take the laundry

943
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:09,503
Now somebody who has that that is of course Sheriff David

944
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:14,623
Clark

945
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,671
I don't think there is anything

946
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,207
Like just in

947
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,487
Entirely wrong

948
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,511
With

949
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,607
To be able to defend yourself

950
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,631
It's situation

951
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,703
Appropriate law enforcement

952
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:33,311
If people who

953
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:36,127
Two are responsible. Having a gun at home

954
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,407
For protection I don't

955
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,711
Implicitly wrong with

956
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:40,991
I think it would be something

957
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:41,759
Dangerous

958
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,783
About police

959
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,063
On the job

960
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:45,599
Well

961
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,647
So I can shoot people

962
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:51,487
I think it sends the wrong message

963
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,767
Off the job site

964
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:55,071
They sure probably do a lot

965
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,863
I think

966
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,399
Culturally it gives the worst message

967
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:02,495
Did you say a uniform special representative

968
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:05,055
Or be a torrid implied

969
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:09,151
So they get a dog

970
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,967
I like have a dog

971
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,295
Fine for a cop to say

972
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,063
Whatever

973
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,087
That's what the

974
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,879
Project Veritas video is

975
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:25,023
Dog

976
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,559
Shity

977
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,351
Just enough

978
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,631
White gravy

979
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,423
The conservatives who want to believe it no matter what

980
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,983
Interviewing

981
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:37,311
Dum dum to from over at project veritas

982
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:40,639
And he's making that argument that like we went and we were talking

983
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,967
All about being able to

984
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,759
Defend yourself in that 2 minutes

985
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,039
Before the police show up

986
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,831
That's the entire

987
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,599
Defense

988
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
Videos

989
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,159
Existence relies on

990
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,439
Alex

991
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,975
Because he is such a fuk

992
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,743
Idiot

993
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,023
And a violin

994
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:03,167
The idea of shooting somebody keep it together

995
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,727
And he immediately invalidates

996
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,263
Their entire argument

997
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,287
For this video

998
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,871
Thomas Baxter covers I can get

999
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,223
I am going to dissociate and kill a man

1000
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:26,879
Wow I mean like I did the whole point of the video really relies on the pretense of we are trying to do

1001
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,159
Do everything possible

1002
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:33,791
Not to kill a bag

1003
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,591
Well it's I don't know if it's

1004
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:51,455
Quiet or loud

1005
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:57,087
That they project

1006
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:59,903
Which I find hilarious

1007
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,695
It's pretty nice.

1008
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:10,911
Yeah

1009
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,679
Jesus

1010
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:13,471
So Alex goes into overdrive

1011
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,775
Episode

1012
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,431
Another half-hour this power

1013
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:25,247
He doesn't and most of it is this

1014
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,015
Which isn't

1015
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:26,783
Impression

1016
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,575
Giant her to do I don't think

1017
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:31,903
Terrible neighborhood

1018
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,463
It's a McGruff the crime dog

1019
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:38,815
Nevermind

1020
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:01,087
I honestly think that he's in and out of the impression

1021
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:03,391
He's close to his Pennywise

1022
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,183
Impression

1023
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:08,255
It's it's not as good as I remember it I apologize for saying that

1024
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,047
But there are moments where he hits

1025
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:10,815
Just the right

1026
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,351
Do you know what he did

1027
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:18,751
A really great impression of a bad guy from like a Humphrey Bogart

1028
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:24,639
Who is the closer to that

1029
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:42,559
Wait

1030
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:53,567
Trash

1031
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:05,087
This message brought to you by

1032
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:10,463
The boy that was in a word

1033
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,487
Coherent

1034
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:15,839
I would also like dogs album

1035
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:23,263
Good stuff album Bud like not doing drugs

1036
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:35,551
Overdrive do a minute-long impression of McGruff doing if

1037
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:39,135
TSA about the terrorist

1038
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,671
We are entering

1039
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,463
A white identity

1040
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:47,583
Season on Alex's Shelby real strong scent

1041
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,375
We got this

1042
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,167
The next

1043
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:54,239
Couple days probably next week at least

1044
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,287
It can be Alex going out of his way

1045
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,567
Define any

1046
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,615
Way to make stories about

1047
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:03,711
This is going to be what it's all about

1048
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:06,783
And there

1049
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:10,367
Unfairly maligning us as if we were

1050
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:17,535
And it'll just be like bulshit

1051
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,559
In order to

1052
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:19,839
Make these stories

1053
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:24,447
And I was not surprised at all

1054
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,007
Exactly what we got

1055
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:32,127
University

1056
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:36,735
Scholarship Center

1057
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,111
Today

1058
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:48,511
Hardware a

1059
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:06,943
It actually says that

1060
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,991
Because anybody who designed that

1061
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,783
F****** exercise

1062
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:18,463
Yeah this is just

1063
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,743
Escalating

1064
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:20,511
I gets crazy

1065
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:26,655
Not only that LA Times story

1066
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:28,959
Quotes

1067
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:31,263
Now he's come across the story of white people being

1068
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:37,407
Inw followed around by non-whites to yell at them but how bad they are

1069
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:40,735
Darren Dyke story that Alex is basing this recording on

1070
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,759
Initiate is weak

1071
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:44,831
According to Infowars and their primary source

1072
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,111
Cnsnews

1073
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,927
The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction

1074
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:52,255
People in their Vista program

1075
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,023
To take steps

1076
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,815
Consider how their there

1077
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,863
Being white puts them in a privileged position in

1078
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,631
Society

1079
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:01,727
What are the examples of to wear a wristband which of the conversations to happen

1080
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:04,031
When people ask you why you're wearing wristband

1081
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:10,943
It seems like a shity plan in the post Livestrong era

1082
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,991
Accessory

1083
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,527
Bananas

1084
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:17,599
Vista stands for Volunteers in Service to America

1085
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,879
It's part of America

1086
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:23,487
This was involved with the Department of Public Instruction

1087
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:26,559
Volunteer to help with school and Library

1088
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,607
Cuz that's what the epi

1089
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:32,447
Is about 41

1090
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:36,543
Even if the b******* that Alex is saying is true there still wouldn't be forced to do any of that

1091
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:40,127
Franklin

1092
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,943
Here are some of the things that are not true

1093
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:46,015
That Alex

1094
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,551
In anyway and it's just making

1095
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:52,671
He saying that universities in group that's what the Unabomber called a ricer

1096
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,207
They're forcing people to do this to

1097
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:54,975
To get their tuition

1098
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:55,999
This is

1099
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:56,767
Tier program

1100
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,327
A prerequisite of getting a scholarship

1101
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,375
Who is Delta

1102
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,399
The PC the band

1103
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,935
The program were too much of them

1104
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:08,031
We could still get their volunteerism requirements fulfilled by taking another opportunity

1105
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,055
Or

1106
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:12,639
Volunteer coordinator supervisor

1107
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:15,199
Which is strange

1108
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:19,295
There's no indication that anyone who was complaining at all

1109
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,831
The only people that were mad about it

1110
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:23,647
Right-wing pundits was sketchy Histories on Race issue

1111
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:24,927
So

1112
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,255
For something that

1113
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,303
Would fit the narrative they want

1114
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,071
Almost

1115
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:34,143
It's almost like that really close to me

1116
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:36,703
The manuals were written by the splc

1117
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,727
That's another claim that

1118
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:42,591
Neither Alex nor any other reporting on his website prove this in anyway

1119
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,663
The Bengals are written by a nonprofit called DB

1120
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,455
Beyond diversity Resource Center

1121
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,735
And I can find do connect

1122
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:49,759
Green diamond

1123
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:50,527
DLC

1124
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,087
Oz creative is completely false narrative

1125
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:57,439
About the splc running the Oklahoma City bombing

1126
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,255
Which is helpful

1127
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:02,559
To help create the appearance that all white terrorism

1128
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,631
Is the second use for that narrow

1129
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:09,215
Anytime there's a social justice type organization

1130
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:12,543
Immediately neutralize whatever

1131
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,847
By claiming they're mixed up with the splc

1132
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,895
It doesn't matter if they are or not

1133
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,919
None of his listeners are going

1134
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:18,687
Check

1135
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,223
What's important is to mirroring

1136
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,015
So their ideas and information

1137
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,039
Consider

1138
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:25,343
And whatever horrible s*** you're going to make up about them

1139
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,879
Becomes completely believable

1140
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:31,487
They're mixed up with the people who tried to smear Whites by doing Oklahoma City bombing

1141
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:35,839
You could just invalidate kind of social justice

1142
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,375
That's pretty much all you have to

1143
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:41,215
And also Alex claims that these are their printer

1144
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,519
Really fast

1145
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:46,591
Who's printouts

1146
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:51,711
Is it America

1147
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,759
Construction is it the splc

1148
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:56,575
When you try to trace down the actual document from

1149
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,343
Infowars

1150
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,623
You end up on

1151
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,647
Cnsnews

1152
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:03,231
And then you'll eventually find the site where it was originally posted

1153
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:05,279
Which is still hyperlinks on their website

1154
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:09,119
Pediatric explained

1155
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:13,215
The document previously available via this URL is no longer here

1156
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:16,543
It was not a Vista document Nora Wisconsin

1157
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,567
DPI document

1158
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:23,199
Including a resource pack Vista volunteers

1159
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:26,015
The document was not referenced in that train

1160
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:30,623
And the training session was conducted by individuals external to-dpi and Vista

1161
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:34,463
Unfortunately misconceptions and misinformation about the documentary

1162
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:37,791
Spread by an out-of-state entity that has no connection

1163
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:39,071
With the public schools in Wisconsin

1164
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,863
To be absolutely clear

1165
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,911
No DPI official has asked

1166
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:49,311
Requested or encouraged any school district educator or students wear any wristband and none of our Vista volunteers event

1167
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,103
Any children put on any wristband

1168
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,127
Again

1169
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:56,223
No DPI official nor any Vista volunteer has used Quest

1170
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:59,551
Or encourage anyone in the school to use a wristband activity

1171
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,599
As reported in quote

1172
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:03,647
And shared by external

1173
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,463
This is this is the point that I made

1174
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,231
On the winds

1175
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:08,767
In that

1176
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,047
We are absolutely

1177
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,583
Complicit in the rise of

1178
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,911
Because you know what

1179
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,703
They went out of there

1180
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:19,007
F****** way bending over backwards

1181
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,031
For these fun

1182
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:23,103
Who came up with this b******* bad faith argument

1183
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,151
To the point where they write this statement

1184
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,175
It's still up there

1185
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:32,575
6 f****** years later or whatever it is

1186
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:37,183
Here's the f****** f*** you Alex

1187
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,511
I fully support

1188
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,279
Chittering

1189
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:43,327
These bulshit

1190
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,863
Criticize

1191
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,143
Absolutely

1192
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,959
Absolutely if it's summer

1193
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:49,983
He's criticizing you

1194
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:55,615
And they have a good point doesn't matter what side of the aisle there on consider their there

1195
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,407
But this is

1196
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,967
Lies and you don't need to

1197
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,503
Come up with some like

1198
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:07,903
We don't support this was all the f*** you Alex Jones should be there and here's what

1199
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,839
Because it is

1200
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,631
On cnsnews

1201
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,655
Infowars

1202
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:21,983
That their information now links to a page that explain

1203
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,775
Misinformation

1204
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:31,455
So it is it should say f*** you

1205
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:36,575
Innovations

1206
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,343
It probably be

1207
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,367
That would cause

1208
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,135
Because

1209
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,415
Stop these people

1210
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,439
Like Alex or

1211
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:45,279
Opportunistic infection

1212
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:51,679
But

1213
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:57,311
Stop saying wrong

1214
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:02,175
Over and over and over again

1215
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:07,039
I agree I agree

1216
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:07,807
An important

1217
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,111
And I also think that it is

1218
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:13,439
You make a good point

1219
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,743
I just think there was also a qualification

1220
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,815
Very still

1221
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:24,191
Just because whatever you do they're going to pay the same way

1222
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,215
These propaganda

1223
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:25,983
The news

1224
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,263
These folks are going to do it

1225
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:31,103
Whether you give them ammunition or not.

1226
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:31,871
That

1227
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:34,943
Still needs to be tempered with a little bit of her like

1228
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,991
Give car block

1229
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,015
Just behave

1230
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:42,367
However a little bit restrained

1231
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:47,487
These organizations that are about like

1232
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,255
Getting handy

1233
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,791
Accessible ramps

1234
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:58,495
Go fuc yourself out I think it would be fun to see it once

1235
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:04,895
Maybe in the same way that like I don't know Arby's will tell someone to f*** off on Twitter

1236
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,319
It might

1237
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:15,647
It might be a step backwards

1238
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,927
In terms of something

1239
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:22,559
I know I don't I don't disagree with you at 100%

1240
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,863
I agree with you

1241
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,215
Accommodate

1242
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:33,311
I absolutely want them to have that statement of like

1243
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,615
Hey this is a complete disinformation

1244
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,407
What they did

1245
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:40,223
Is lie about us

1246
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,831
Yeah I'm just saying that it needs to be

1247
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:46,111
It needs to be

1248
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:48,927
To have

1249
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,951
People

1250
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:52,511
Focusing on D propaganda Outlet

1251
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,791
Like us

1252
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,559
And

1253
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,327
Institution

1254
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:58,399
Protecting themselves simultaneously

1255
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:01,727
Have a full spectrum of protection

1256
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:07,615
Perhaps because we don't have to worry about you know if we start telling people to go f*** themselves

1257
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:11,455
We're not at risk of losing State funding that will hurt libraries

1258
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:12,991
So

1259
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,087
Consequences

1260
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,879
Is for people who are vulnerable

1261
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,183
Disadvantage

1262
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:25,279
Children in Wisconsin

1263
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,047
To begin with

1264
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,583
Spelling of right-wing

1265
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:29,375
Trollberget to f*** off

1266
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:33,727
Could fuc with your funding as opposed to a of the right-wing troll Brigade

1267
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,663
I'm not disagree

1268
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:44,479
Bring

1269
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:46,015
What we would like of course

1270
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:52,415
Actually 100%

1271
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,463
Behind it which is what right-wing troll

1272
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,231
Cannot do

1273
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:59,583
Extra layer of complexity

1274
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:03,679
Documents

1275
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:07,775
Really wrong Beyond diversity

1276
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,335
There was giving people as they left

1277
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:15,455
Meeting seminar that wasn't even being run by DP Orvis

1278
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:18,015
Some of the suggestions are a little bit

1279
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:18,783
Cheesy

1280
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:22,879
Corporate seminar type of document is going to be

1281
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:25,951
Like I would say that some of them might not be the most productive

1282
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:26,719
Suggestion

1283
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:28,767
Wanted to make that kind of criticize

1284
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,815
I really don't think there would be that big of a deal

1285
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:33,375
Like if you were to make an argument of like

1286
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:37,727
They're telling people to wear bracelets in order to have conversation

1287
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:42,079
The bracelet about

1288
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,359
Have a conversation

1289
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:47,199
Not racist nature about how like

1290
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:53,599
Does a hokie idea

1291
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:59,999
Really doesn't address the problem it just seems like it might without ever actually do

1292
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:04,095
What you can have a conversation

1293
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:06,399
And still be on fairly Solid Ground

1294
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:07,679
I think

1295
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:10,495
The bigger issue though is that I used to see something

1296
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:14,847
You see that how something so small localized in minor

1297
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,383
Can be spun by Alex

1298
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,943
Sweet government sanction

1299
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,247
Splc run attack on white people

1300
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,039
Which is white supremacy

1301
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:25,343
Look what they're doing what's going on

1302
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:29,695
Clarify the document doesn't say you have to have a minority follow you around

1303
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:32,511
Can tell you how bad you are

1304
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,375
About

1305
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,655
The privileged status

1306
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,215
Were YouTube

1307
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,007
You happen to be white

1308
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:46,847
His quotes find a person of color who's willing to hold you accountable for addressing

1309
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:54,271
There's a slight difference there and I also think that's a bad suggestion

1310
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,319
Accountability partner

1311
01:12:56,575 --> 01:13:01,183
Which

1312
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,463
Discussing race on

1313
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:03,743
Other people coming to

1314
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:08,095
Do you or something about reflection

1315
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:10,655
Fought

1316
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,423
Yeah

1317
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,703
Fox2 haven't

1318
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:16,031
Explore other suggestions are like put a note on your

1319
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:16,799
Computer screen

1320
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,431
But like I think it's at suggestion

1321
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,711
It's kind of like that

1322
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,735
It is

1323
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:25,759
Weird

1324
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:26,527
To be like

1325
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:32,671
I'm going to go find a person of color that I can have keep me accountable on someone out

1326
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,767
Color who is

1327
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,559
Willing

1328
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:41,375
I don't exclude the possibility that that person biting

1329
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:44,447
And not think it's insulting for me to come to them be like

1330
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:48,799
Hey can you call hell yeah

1331
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:50,079
I will

1332
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:54,175
Yeah I don't think anybody I don't think the Southern Poverty Law Center is like usual

1333
01:13:54,943 --> 01:14:01,087
We take a book out of game we take a page out of Game of Thrones we have people of color follow white people run

1334
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,927
Is the splc didn't do

1335
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,463
Life

1336
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,559
Somehow subcontract an organization that were not involved in it all

1337
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,863
To make a printout

1338
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,935
Being handed out to people at 1 seminar

1339
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:22,591
It's not even being run by the Wisconsin the PPI for the program or Americorps

1340
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:30,271
Also

1341
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:32,831
Cnsnews is owned by the media research

1342
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,391
Which is a conservative propaganda Outlet

1343
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,671
Rapunzel funding

1344
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,231
Escape Foundation

1345
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:41,791
And ExxonMobil thanks

1346
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:44,607
They are not a good source of information

1347
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:47,167
Straight up right-wing misinformation

1348
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,447
Campaign operator

1349
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:50,239
And that's where Alex is pulling

1350
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,031
For the beach

1351
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,311
The story

1352
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,103
For the Infowars article

1353
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,639
So that's where we're at

1354
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:58,431
This is just

1355
01:14:58,687 --> 01:14:59,199
Finished

1356
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,479
F****** worst

1357
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,759
Wate 6

1358
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:02,783
Type bulshit

1359
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:06,879
Start to see this narrative and this season

1360
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:07,903
Taking shape

1361
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,951
We are in the last season

1362
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,487
Was before Alex been on vacation

1363
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:13,023
It was all strfkr

1364
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:16,095
It was all just like people on here

1365
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,887
We're having celebrities it's going to be awesome

1366
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:19,423
Mary comes back

1367
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,215
Can I get the very strong scent

1368
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,007
Be a lot of weight

1369
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,287
White identity

1370
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:29,663
We're getting used to

1371
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,711
So Alex

1372
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:36,063
I want to play this life and it doesn't include the part of the clip where Alex

1373
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,111
Does explicitly say that Hitler was

1374
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,391
Buddy.

1375
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,303
He is also a complete

1376
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:48,351
As we all just started

1377
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:56,031
It's less important

1378
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:56,799
Something besides

1379
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:00,895
Praise for Hitler

1380
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:01,919
But he does

1381
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:04,991
Spend

1382
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:18,303
Lamar

1383
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:30,335
We really don't have to get it at up to

1384
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:38,783
Adolf Hitler was a prosperous class in the first World War

1385
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:43,903
It's a Nazi propaganda the painted him as a war hero when reality does not setup

1386
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:50,303
What are the problems of sorting out the reality of Hitler's military history in World War II

1387
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:52,863
No one knew he was going to become Hitler back then

1388
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:56,703
There are records of his life as a normal run-of-the-mill Soldier

1389
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:59,519
What was known as the he was a runner.

1390
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,823
War

1391
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:07,455
Two-factor accepted to me that he was the sort of message carrier

1392
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,735
The frontlines a Dodge

1393
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:09,759
Machine gun fire

1394
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,039
To get the orders where they need

1395
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:11,807
Needed to be

1396
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:13,343
That is not true

1397
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:17,439
There are two varieties of runners in the German military in World War 1

1398
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:19,231
There were those who were on the front line

1399
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:21,279
Scaring orders through dangerous

1400
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,815
And office workers

1401
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:25,631
Who delivered messages between the offices of The Wretched

1402
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,655
Metal headquarters

1403
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,191
Far away from the siding

1404
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:31,263
Hitler was the second kind of Runner during the war

1405
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:35,359
Historians have noted that it's likely that he was given the first class award

1406
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:37,407
After a battle where Messengers were

1407
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,687
Particularly important

1408
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:40,991
And it was likely that his inclusion

1409
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,271
Any award recipient

1410
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,831
Was the result of him having close Association

1411
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:45,599
What's a higher rank

1412
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,367
Officers

1413
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,391
Due to him being

1414
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,159
Station

1415
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,183
Inside the headquarters

1416
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:52,255
Alex is confusing things also

1417
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:55,071
About how many Iron Cross first class metals

1418
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,375
He's thinking of the highest-ranking

1419
01:17:58,911 --> 01:17:59,935
Of which only night

1420
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:00,959
Forever giving out

1421
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,775
Between 1870 and 1980

1422
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:08,383
5.7 billion Iron Cross first and second class metals

1423
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,151
We're giving out

1424
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:12,479
Hey well the second-class ones we're definitely more commonly awarded

1425
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:15,295
The first class work some kind of super rare thing

1426
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:18,623
Some numbers I've seen to put the number of recipients at about 100

1427
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,647
65000

1428
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,439
Wikipedia short of 10

1429
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,743
Of them being awarded everyday

1430
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,279
Between 1870 and 90

1431
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,839
Alex bacon me

1432
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:32,703
These comments in the context of

1433
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:34,239
But it's also

1434
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,775
Super Brave

1435
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,823
It's supposed to be making

1436
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:42,431
I'm not actually sure what point he hope to make

1437
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:45,247
But it really highlight something that I think is super

1438
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,039
Alex Jones

1439
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:48,831
Versions of History

1440
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:51,903
It really like it was part of Hitler's propaganda

1441
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,927
Videos of War

1442
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:55,743
It was an essential piece of his appeal to the people

1443
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:58,047
And a lot of the German public

1444
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:03,167
Historians and researchers head to bump this

1445
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,007
Still preaching to his audience about the

1446
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,287
The positive parts of Hitler

1447
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,823
This is a trend

1448
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:10,847
It's not just

1449
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:11,871
Isolated incident

1450
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,151
Alex is very in

1451
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,431
Inclined to believe

1452
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,479
Between this

1453
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,783
The stuff about the Hitler was set up the

1454
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,063
Peace treaty

1455
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:20,831
The

1456
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:27,231
Waterloo him directly taking the story that was

1457
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,511
Amplify

1458
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:34,399
And put into it sort of canonical form by a gerbils film

1459
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,423
History

1460
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,703
Revision

1461
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,007
Not based on reality that Alex

1462
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:39,775
Except

1463
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:41,823
Cool cloth is real Nets

1464
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,103
That's disturbing

1465
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:44,895
What do you say

1466
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:45,919
Because we've

1467
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:54,623
You say you've read 100 books on WWII 100 books on World War

1468
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:58,463
30 books at least of Nazi propaganda it's

1469
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,999
Seems like

1470
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:03,839
There's there's no way that at least

1471
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:04,607
Coming from

1472
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:10,239
Even if he's doing his best job to to critically analyze

1473
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,775
Which is not possible

1474
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:16,640
Stories

1475
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,664
If you're reading a

1476
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,712
100 different books on WWII

1477
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,480
Might see

1478
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,504
Through

1479
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,272
Might just

1480
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:25,344
Steep in all of the correct

1481
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:26,624
History up but

1482
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,720
For some reason there's this one story that's only in this one Nazi propaganda

1483
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:41,216
Exactly

1484
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:46,336
Because you brought up the book

1485
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:50,176
On this one because a lot of people didn't actually

1486
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:52,992
Look through the records enough to figure out what

1487
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,528
Kind of Runner Hitler was

1488
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,808
Right until

1489
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,344
Fairly recent

1490
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,368
To this episode

1491
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,160
Like it's not like it's

1492
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,952
It's been a part of scholarship 450

1493
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:02,720
The years

1494
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:03,744
And Alex is just

1495
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,024
Like that off

1496
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:09,120
Yeah the books that he had read

1497
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:12,192
War based on

1498
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:12,960
Ink

1499
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:13,728
History

1500
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,520
Ab2 there's a chance

1501
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,824
He had read in a book of Hitler

1502
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:18,848
Heroic

1503
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:24,736
To reflect

1504
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:25,504
That

1505
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,272
Possibly

1506
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,808
But history

1507
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,856
Add more information at 2

1508
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:32,416
And people

1509
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,184
The part of

1510
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:33,952
Hitler

1511
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,232
PR campaign

1512
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:39,840
Recognize

1513
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:40,608
Disposition

1514
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,400
Is not done

1515
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,192
When history

1516
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:47,008
Yeah

1517
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:52,640
Yeah it's really interesting

1518
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:54,176
Furious people worth it

1519
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:56,224
Pluto stop being considered a

1520
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:56,992
Planet

1521
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:59,040
Compare that to how much white matter

1522
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:01,856
Nationalism

1523
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,440
The idea that Hitler was

1524
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:06,976
Yeah

1525
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,512
Pitstop

1526
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:09,536
I feel forum

1527
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,584
Shout out

1528
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:17,984
I got to go to the Nazis who are struggling with

1529
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,288
Finding out their hero hero

1530
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:22,336
Episode

1531
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:24,128
Let's get back to this

1532
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,664
This narrative about the

1533
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,736
Why people need to wear bracelets

1534
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:30,528
And find a minority to Yellow.

1535
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,320
He updates

1536
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,088
Narrative

1537
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:38,208
Becky is taking the colonel that he's already established

1538
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:40,512
And now he's embellishing

1539
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:42,048
Theme in order to make it

1540
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:43,584
For more Universal

1541
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,352
But it actually is

1542
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:58,688
The symbolize that they're badass

1543
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,528
Americorps

1544
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:08,928
Inherently

1545
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,232
The evolution

1546
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:14,304
Universities all across the

1547
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:18,144
Yep are forcing an order to get their tuition

1548
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:18,912
Forcing

1549
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:23,264
Yep

1550
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:25,056
I told you that this was very real

1551
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,712
Deeply racist

1552
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:34,016
Call absolute

1553
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,808
It was almost shocking.

1554
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:38,368
To me like the consistency with which

1555
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,904
He's he's dipping into

1556
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:46,304
That were illuminated

1557
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,656
Yeah but it's just

1558
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,192
Brings it all in

1559
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:52,960
Almost

1560
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:54,752
Like a tornado of racism

1561
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,312
Parts of his narrative

1562
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:58,336
And his

1563
01:23:59,104 --> 01:23:59,872
Just talkin

1564
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,408
Then we heard a hundred time

1565
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:03,456
Margaret Sanger wants to kill black people

1566
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:05,248
Abortion is about killing black people

1567
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:07,808
Like I just all of this stuff it all

1568
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,112
The March 14th episode

1569
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:11,648
Is just all of that

1570
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,464
Lucky's shooting

1571
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,512
Semi-automatic blast of

1572
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:18,816
Rapist.

1573
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:21,120
If you

1574
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:23,680
Heard for our radio show

1575
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,216
And you heard one of those

1576
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,240
Things where you're like

1577
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,544
Is that a racist

1578
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:32,896
Maybe you know you can even Blow by it but if it's

1579
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:33,920
Just no other kin

1580
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:34,688
Conclusion you can come

1581
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:38,528
All over the place in the

1582
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:39,552
14th episode

1583
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:41,344
I considered

1584
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,368
I considered like

1585
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,136
Maybe just

1586
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,416
Taken

1587
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:48,768
Overkill

1588
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,304
Entire episode of Alex being

1589
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:55,424
But I realized it wasn't a ton of value in that anybody wants to listen

1590
01:24:56,704 --> 01:25:00,544
Already talked about the make-out with the rapist enjoy

1591
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,336
I thought I would focus more on

1592
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,616
Things that are new to

1593
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:06,432
Yeah live within that

1594
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,528
Yeah it is one of those

1595
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,344
The thing about it

1596
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:14,624
That I think of

1597
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:16,928
Talking about a show

1598
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:19,488
Entertainment show ranoush or anything of that Valley

1599
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:21,536
Naturally

1600
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,584
We've said that Alex

1601
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,352
This is a racist

1602
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,680
And I can understand why it would get

1603
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:29,728
Boring or white Woodfield

1604
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:30,496
Repetitive

1605
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:31,520
Fight

1606
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:33,568
Never not be men

1607
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,360
It has to be

1608
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:36,384
Consistently mention

1609
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,408
Over and over

1610
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,176
Over again

1611
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,968
Because you can't for a moment for

1612
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,528
And I don't think we do a good enough job about that

1613
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:45,344
Maybe just because it comes up

1614
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,624
You know like when he is

1615
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,696
Right

1616
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:51,232
There's not a moment where

1617
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,512
At least since like

1618
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,072
Couple months into doing the podcast

1619
01:25:55,584 --> 01:26:01,472
I was a little resistant to call him racist

1620
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:03,776
It's overwhelming

1621
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,568
Define deposition.

1622
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:07,104
That you like in terms of that thing

1623
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:10,176
He gives us clues about Justice

1624
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:10,944
Specific race

1625
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:15,296
Christian

1626
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,856
Dominionist ideas absolute

1627
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:22,976
Pope

1628
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,512
Like it seems like

1629
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,048
World news

1630
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:28,608
Yeah

1631
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:32,192
How many Catholics are there is tons of them around the world billion

1632
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:34,752
Show me Catholic Church

1633
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:39,104
Affected by

1634
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,384
Non-catholics or effect

1635
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,408
Hell yeah

1636
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:47,808
It becomes a huge political story so many angles to

1637
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:49,600
That one

1638
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:53,696
20 weird word redshift

1639
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:56,768
Going to change the world

1640
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:58,560
It's interesting as a story

1641
01:26:58,816 --> 01:26:59,328
It

1642
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,608
She is compelling

1643
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:04,192
It's a news comprehensible is a Cuban

1644
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,984
Touches Alex's world

1645
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:10,592
He should have known who the new pope was going to Facebook

1646
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:13,664
So I was really disappointed that he doesn't really cover it much

1647
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:15,456
This is most of his coverage

1648
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:18,784
It's kind of dismissive

1649
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:27,488
The first Latin American first

1650
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:35,424
And the first world Catholics

1651
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,216
Alex is almost dismissive

1652
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:41,568
Conspiracies about the Jesuits running into the Catholic church and being involved in

1653
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:47,968
New world

1654
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:53,088
That'll feel the fire of Jesuits

1655
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:57,952
I don't I don't I don't understand why you so dumb

1656
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:04,096
He hasn't come around upgrade

1657
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:13,312
That's most of it he's like yeah we got this South American Jesuit that's going to make people

1658
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:15,104
The conspiracy world's freak out

1659
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:17,152
Analysis Alex

1660
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,688
Most of it

1661
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:20,992
So the guy who wrote the article for

1662
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,784
Yeah about this

1663
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,320
Wristband

1664
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,856
Is a Aaron dykes

1665
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:26,880
One of his

1666
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,416
Employees

1667
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,952
Don't think you still there

1668
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,512
I'm not sure

1669
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,608
Lot of his ex-employees

1670
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,144
People like him and the others

1671
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:43,264
Don't think there's a lot of

1672
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:49,664
Ex-employee

1673
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,504
I'm carrying the torch

1674
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:57,344
So Aaron Dykes comes on

1675
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,880
To talk about this article.

1676
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,416
And

1677
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,184
Man

1678
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,464
He is

1679
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,256
He displays

1680
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,280
Some

1681
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,304
Ratably

1682
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,352
Disposition

1683
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,120
But I think

1684
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:14,752
Excludes as to why he wrote the article that you wrote

1685
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:30,368
Racism

1686
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,536
I was really disappointed Alex cousin

1687
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:47,008
I don't know what that implies

1688
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:50,592
Explain

1689
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,896
Confusion is Facebook

1690
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,736
Expressing the globalist

1691
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:58,784
Soul Sister

1692
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,856
Urban Plates

1693
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:06,464
People's butt

1694
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,744
Inexplicably

1695
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,024
Fei3

1696
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,560
Sure

1697
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,352
And also

1698
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,400
Pushing other races but

1699
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:16,192
Through things like

1700
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:17,728
Civil rights

1701
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:21,568
Whatever their social justice cause

1702
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:23,360
Like let's say

1703
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:25,408
Black people

1704
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,176
Felicia

1705
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,200
Stop killing us

1706
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:30,528
Targeting us unjustly

1707
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:31,808
Unfortunately

1708
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:33,344
Sing that is making

1709
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:39,744
Can be racist black people

1710
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,536
So they are more

1711
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,888
Nonsense

1712
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:46,656
Argument

1713
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:47,936
Anyway

1714
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,008
Alex

1715
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:52,032
Gets into talking about it

1716
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:52,800
Is Dad

1717
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:54,848
Now we know that

1718
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:55,872
Listen to Alex

1719
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:56,640
As much as we do

1720
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:59,200
Houses that has people in Texas

1721
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:01,248
Globalist

1722
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:05,600
Tried to recruit absolutely took him into a meeting and they tried to recruit him

1723
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:07,136
He was younger

1724
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:07,904
And

1725
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:11,232
Here sitting with aerondight

1726
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:13,280
Okay

1727
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:14,560
This is really great

1728
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:15,840
Because our

1729
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:16,608
Probably get

1730
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:17,632
Specific

1731
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:18,912
And

1732
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:20,192
Figure it out

1733
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:26,848
Windstone High School

1734
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:29,920
A junior

1735
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:01,920
So Alex no better than

1736
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:02,688
Use real name

1737
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:03,968
Yeah that'll get him into two

1738
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:09,856
Crime

1739
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:13,184
Alex is referring to doctor doctor Irwin

1740
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,232
Spear in the botany and biology

1741
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,024
Departments at UT Austin

1742
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,560
1853 to 1990

1743
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:23,424
Students that they were posted in the alumni magazine

1744
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,240
And from everything I can tell about him he sounds like a great

1745
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:29,824
2011 interview with someone who took his class

1746
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,616
40 years prior

1747
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:33,920
It made such an impression on it

1748
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:35,456
Single visit

1749
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:37,760
Irwin speedbor out as like an important

1750
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:40,064
He inspired us

1751
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:41,600
He was a very difficult teacher

1752
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:45,696
Discuss anything we didn't understand

1753
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:46,976
And his exams

1754
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:50,816
I think it was the first time that I was taking exams or you had to really think

1755
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:52,352
You didn't just regurgitating

1756
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,120
Information

1757
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,912
Dr. spear was so challenge

1758
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:56,448
Stimulate

1759
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,776
And started many of us on the right road to how to study

1760
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:01,056
How to prepare for exam

1761
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:03,360
And how to appreciate what we were learning

1762
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:05,920
That's why I stuck with medical technology

1763
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:06,944
With Organic chem

1764
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,992
That's a great teacher

1765
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,296
Do changes people's lives

1766
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,064
With learning

1767
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:16,672
I know from Alex's dad's Dental license that he was born in 1950

1768
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:18,976
About 7

1769
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:21,024
19 when this meeting allegedly happen

1770
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:25,888
Right cuz he still in high school at Junior the general would be 17 or wrestling

1771
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:27,936
1967

1772
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:32,288
Well I happen to find a copy of an article from the Austin Daily Texan

1773
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,056
From March

1774
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:36,384
Talk to Irwin speaker

1775
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,944
His title is listed as associate

1776
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:39,968
Professor of botany

1777
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:44,576
Also from a copy of publication the alcalde

1778
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:46,112
From October 19th

1779
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,136
54

1780
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,160
Also

1781
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,696
Professor

1782
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:51,744
So from 19th

1783
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:52,768
For tonight

1784
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:53,792
68

1785
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:55,328
Associate professor of biology

1786
01:33:56,096 --> 01:34:01,472
Are outside by professors are typically professors that are on the 10-year

1787
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:04,288
Working their way towards becoming full professors

1788
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,312
Add an academic

1789
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,080
Katusha

1790
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:08,128
They've paid their dues as an assistant for

1791
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:10,176
And now they're in that middle step

1792
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:16,064
There's absolutely no shame in being an associate professor even if it's for a long time

1793
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,856
Cuz the super competitive ranks

1794
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,392
To achieve at most talk to you

1795
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:21,440
Your school and ut-austin is not a bad

1796
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,208
That's cool

1797
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:24,512
I found all this out because

1798
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:25,280
Dr. Irwin

1799
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:27,072
Spear would have to have been in

1800
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,376
What Alex's dad would have been the Apes

1801
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:31,168
He's supposed to had this completely not

1802
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:36,288
There's literally zero reason to believe that the globalist

1803
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,336
For having us do see a professor

1804
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:40,640
Working their way towards their tenure

1805
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:46,016
Take a little break from their Scholastic nefarious eugenics

1806
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,088
This story is accusing

1807
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:50,368
Specific person

1808
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:52,160
Of being involved in a plot against

1809
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:52,928
Humanity

1810
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,464
It's a conspiracy

1811
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,488
And Erwin

1812
01:34:55,744 --> 01:35:00,864
The story I was just telling you trying to recruit people with this Pacifica

1813
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,400
Genocide and crimes against

1814
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:03,168
Humanity

1815
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:06,240
I'm not sure Alex feels like he's safe

1816
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:10,080
Because they're Winspear died in 2002 but still this is some

1817
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:11,360
Shady s*** Alex

1818
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,128
Is doing

1819
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,176
This story absolutely didn't happen

1820
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:15,712
There's no way

1821
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:18,528
There's no way associate professor Irwin

1822
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:21,088
Spirit

1823
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:21,856
Hey David

1824
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,392
Jones future dentist

1825
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:29,792
I'm going to try and enlist you in life Global us Eugenics you know it's like Hitler but I'm not like Hitler I'm Jewish it's

1826
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,328
Totally cool we're going to get everybody

1827
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:34,912
You're way off on this one of course

1828
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:35,936
It's him because

1829
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:42,592
Such b******* if anyone cared Alex

1830
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:43,872
Easily be sued for

1831
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:45,408
This is slander

1832
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,432
Yeah unfortunately

1833
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:49,760
Latest episodes

1834
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:50,528
Is over

1835
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:52,832
Like 2013

1836
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:56,928
John verea circumstance

1837
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,256
Can be charged with

1838
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:01,280
But if he was

1839
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:02,560
I would f******

1840
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:04,608
B-real

1841
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:08,192
You get in touch with you

1842
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:13,056
From now on

1843
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:15,616
I will be keeping a very close ear

1844
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:17,152
On the present day episode

1845
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:19,200
For Alex telling this story

1846
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:22,016
Because if he tells this story in the present

1847
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:24,832
Yes

1848
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:28,672
You will have committed a crime

1849
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:29,440
You know what

1850
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:30,464
I bet I can find

1851
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:32,000
This story

1852
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:33,536
I bet I can

1853
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:41,472
I'm digging through the archives and actual

1854
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:43,008
Hard crime

1855
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:50,176
Attempted

1856
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:50,944
Genocide

1857
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:54,016
Conspiracy

1858
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:58,368
You shouldn't use specific names

1859
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,136
What a f***

1860
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,952
So about 5 minutes on this

1861
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,232
Maybe more

1862
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,120
It's taken up with Alex getting a caller

1863
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:11,424
Who accuses him of using

1864
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:13,472
Exact

1865
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,520
He accuses the globalist

1866
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:18,080
Super defense

1867
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:19,104
About it

1868
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:23,200
I don't I don't know if this clip is

1869
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:23,968
Is worth it

1870
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:28,064
Because I think I think there's something worthwhile in it

1871
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:30,368
There there there is a point

1872
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,392
28

1873
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,928
Does the point where Alex's

1874
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:35,232
Defensive is minute

1875
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:36,000
Before this

1876
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:37,536
Actually before commercial

1877
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,072
But I think this

1878
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:40,608
This clip really highlights

1879
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,400
Alex kind of losing it

1880
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:44,448
Like this guy is making

1881
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,472
Decent courtesy

1882
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:48,032
Of him

1883
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,568
Okay I think this is

1884
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:52,640
I think this is a that you know you should know

1885
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:54,176
U-save-it

1886
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:54,944
All of these

1887
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:58,528
The globalist do divide-and-conquer but

1888
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:00,832
You and I

1889
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:01,856
The group

1890
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:04,160
And then further the guys other credits

1891
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:05,952
You just try and like

1892
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:07,744
All the time

1893
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:11,328
Totally

1894
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:15,936
EBenefits

1895
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:16,704
Response to it

1896
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:20,544
I think the biggest reason that I think it's worthwhile.

1897
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:23,616
It demonstrates how

1898
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:24,640
Confronting Alex

1899
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:26,176
You're correct

1900
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,456
Is not worth it

1901
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:46,400
Brooke was very upset

1902
01:38:54,336 --> 01:39:00,480
How can we provocative

1903
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:06,880
The emotion which is a human circumstance

1904
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:10,976
Is out of

1905
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,536
Are we going to

1906
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:32,992
Just get it

1907
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:36,320
Because our headlights

1908
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:37,600
Yeah

1909
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:56,704
Hang up

1910
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,752
If you're going to take the time

1911
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:02,336
And make these criticisms of Alec

1912
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:04,896
You're not going to hang up when he starts

1913
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:14,112
Respond to absolutely absolutely

1914
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:14,880
Then

1915
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:21,280
Of all the time

1916
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:24,608
That's show me show me

1917
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:29,984
Although I would hang up the moment somebody started

1918
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:32,800
Show me why fear monger

1919
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:33,568
Okay

1920
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:34,848
Here's why your fear

1921
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:36,384
And I'll give you some

1922
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,944
Everything everything

1923
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,808
What

1924
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,112
Reclusive

1925
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:49,952
Yeah he's very sensitive no other one is very very

1926
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:50,720
Yeah

1927
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:52,768
And that's something you don't understand

1928
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,816
With kid gloves

1929
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:58,144
But also there's no way to do that because

1930
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,936
He has around issues that are pretty

1931
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,216
Yeah

1932
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:03,776
You can even approach without

1933
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:05,056
Triggering that respond

1934
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:05,824
Absolutely

1935
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,616
It's kind of its kind of

1936
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:10,176
Now for the rest of this episode

1937
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:10,944
Kind of Hazzard

1938
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:12,480
He's like

1939
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:14,272
I'm being accused of fear monger

1940
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:19,904
Which is kind of a sign that he got like

1941
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:22,464
Criticism

1942
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:25,792
Is it goes on

1943
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:28,096
And I think it also has to

1944
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:29,376
Why he's got to

1945
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:31,680
But you know what he does

1946
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,472
What to do

1947
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:34,240
Goes for his

1948
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,032
Oh no

1949
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:36,800
He finds his

1950
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:37,568
Security blanket

1951
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:39,616
Whiskey

1952
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:42,176
Ted Anderson

1953
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:48,064
Resources

1954
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,344
He comes in as a guest

1955
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:52,160
Alex introduction

1956
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:53,696
F****** hilarious

1957
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:57,024
Gold sponsor

1958
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:03,424
Better Business Bureau

1959
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:07,520
That have broadcast to

1960
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:25,184
16

1961
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:31,328
By the way real quick Stormfront also had a plus rating on

1962
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:36,448
There's are like the Better Business Bureau ratings are a very

1963
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:56,672
Years ago

1964
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:03,072
Better Business Bureau

1965
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:04,608
Plus

1966
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:11,264
Smash cut 22 years later today

1967
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:13,312
Because of a

1968
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:14,592
Systemic

1969
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:16,896
History of defrauding customers

1970
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:18,432
Still hasn't

1971
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,456
Of course

1972
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:21,248
Do you know

1973
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:26,112
Hey to get an A+ rated you know what's really

1974
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:27,136
Sing to me those like

1975
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:28,416
Is this point in farts

1976
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:29,184
23rd

1977
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:31,744
Like this is

1978
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,792
When

1979
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:35,328
He's really shady biz

1980
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:37,632
Yeah

1981
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:39,680
Where is the mid

1982
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:41,472
2015 when he acts

1983
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:43,264
We gets his license taken away

1984
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:46,080
Offense

1985
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:49,920
Happened prior to that he's actually

1986
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,248
Taking people into frogs

1987
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:55,040
So what Alex is doing is like

1988
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:55,808
Really

1989
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,112
Throwing people into the ring

1990
01:44:58,624 --> 01:44:59,904
He's

1991
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:00,928
This is abuse

1992
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:03,232
Do you know what what's fun is that this is

1993
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,256
Almost like it

1994
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,304
Preemptive

1995
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,328
Defensive whitener

1996
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,352
Terrorism

1997
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:09,120
You going on

1998
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:10,656
Long diatribe about how

1999
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:14,240
Greek and his gold sales are amazing

2000
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,776
All the while

2001
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:18,336
At least

2002
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:20,896
A little bit aware that

2003
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:26,016
There's no doubt he's almost 100% aware

2004
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:26,784
Come on

2005
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:31,392
He's committed all the crimes I wasn't clear that it was

2006
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:32,160
Introduction

2007
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:33,440
Pretend I thought it might

2008
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:36,000
Plug-in

2009
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:39,328
I didn't realize this this just turns into a

2010
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:47,264
Because of that caller who asked Alex Bell

2011
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:50,080
Alex is really defensive about it anyway

2012
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,200
Here is the answer to that

2013
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:28,224
Alex

2014
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:34,880
Your unprofessional

2015
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:36,416
Another sponsor

2016
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:40,768
Really implying that this is not just a sponsor

2017
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:45,120
Chiefly in business

2018
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:49,984
Alex

2019
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:51,776
I know we have a

2020
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:55,360
Difficult Power Balance relationship

2021
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:59,456
But in some ways I am your boss and at the very least

2022
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,224
Colleague

2023
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,248
I am not here

2024
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:02,784
To make you feel good

2025
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:09,440
Kowtow

2026
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:12,000
To Alex

2027
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:16,352
To be made feel better make me whole again after that call

2028
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:18,144
Servient

2029
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,192
You know what's really interesting

2030
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:22,240
The rest of this

2031
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,544
Interview with

2032
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:26,336
Is largely

2033
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,360
Alex

2034
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:28,128
Bullying

2035
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:35,296
Gold prices

2036
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:41,952
I was just start screaming at

2037
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:45,024
It's almost like he feels

2038
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:47,584
A program directors voice in his head Buick

2039
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:50,912
Pick it up

2040
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:52,192
His

2041
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:52,960
Like

2042
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:53,984
The story of his mom

2043
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,520
Taking a bath

2044
01:47:58,592 --> 01:48:00,896
So much of his relationship with Ted Anderson

2045
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:01,920
It's weirdly

2046
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:02,688
Mommy

2047
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:05,760
As opposed to anything else like it's always like

2048
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:07,808
I think it's a brotherly more than anything

2049
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:12,416
Ted like a brother

2050
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:16,000
Older brother kind of wise

2051
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,072
Less than mother or father

2052
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:19,840
It's more just like

2053
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:24,192
Suck this guy's squirrely

2054
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:25,984
You listen to 10 million more hours

2055
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:30,592
Well I mean

2056
01:48:30,848 --> 01:48:33,920
But I do have a better assessment

2057
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:36,736
So

2058
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:39,552
Also I think that in that clip

2059
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:42,368
Is it

2060
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:44,160
Is it fear mongering for me

2061
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:45,696
Need to save it you know

2062
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:46,464
Gold

2063
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,744
260 in to feet

2064
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:48,512
1600

2065
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:51,840
It's like 10 years later it's at 1600

2066
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:55,424
The way you sell gold

2067
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:58,240
Is not saying eventually it will be worth

2068
01:48:58,752 --> 01:48:59,264
1500

2069
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:02,592
You sell gold by talking about financial collapse

2070
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:07,456
Yes you are even though the price

2071
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:09,760
Yes

2072
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:10,784
That's fine

2073
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,064
You you have

2074
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,344
Towards

2075
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:15,392
Not a terrible

2076
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:18,464
Investment if they have the money to make

2077
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:21,280
B

2078
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:23,584
The way you sold it is fear monger

2079
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,632
Even if the end result

2080
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:26,400
Wasn't

2081
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:27,168
Negative

2082
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:30,496
The other stuff

2083
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:32,544
Is like

2084
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:38,432
Because you knew that

2085
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:42,272
It's a Sound Investment if you wait

2086
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:45,600
800% return

2087
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,880
Youself

2088
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:52,000
Markets about to collapse in the dollar will be worthless you'll be the king with gold

2089
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:57,376
Any good fighter boggart

2090
01:49:58,656 --> 01:50:02,496
Gambling on Commodities in the short-term is a brilliant idea

2091
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:05,568
That's what sound tell everybody

2092
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:07,616
On

2093
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:08,896
Short-term

2094
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:09,920
Income

2095
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:11,200
Advice

2096
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:12,480
Absolute

2097
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:16,320
Is rat.

2098
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:21,696
And that comes in

2099
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:22,464
Play the snake

2100
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:24,768
Like everytime Ted's on

2101
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:26,048
Alex

2102
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:28,096
Beat up on him and not let him talk

2103
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:33,472
Alex is on there

2104
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:34,496
2 days

2105
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:40,896
And so what he wants to Riff on is the idea that anytime you say anything people call you

2106
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:41,664
Racist

2107
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:43,456
And so

2108
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:18,528
Lesbian Saturday

2109
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:27,488
If end if you respected salesman this is a bad way to treat it

2110
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:29,280
Nut

2111
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:33,888
If you and I

2112
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:35,680
Are we okay

2113
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:38,240
If we're reenacting this conversation

2114
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:41,824
We're just friends

2115
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:42,592
At a bar

2116
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:43,616
This conversation is

2117
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,152
Hilarious

2118
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:47,712
I was never there

2119
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:54,112
I agree with you

2120
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:57,440
That you and I sitting at a bar having this conversation

2121
01:51:57,952 --> 01:51:58,720
It goes like this

2122
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:00,000
Whatever the risk

2123
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:02,816
Because

2124
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:06,912
That say you're the one who's yelling racist

2125
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:08,704
We laugh and then we move on to the

2126
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:13,824
This aggressively

2127
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:15,872
Now the B ended when he went

2128
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:17,152
Yeah

2129
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:21,504
After the second round

2130
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:28,160
Yeah right

2131
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,232
Tries to deal with this and he's very on

2132
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:32,256
Unsuccessful

2133
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,560
Here's how Alex

2134
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:44,544
It sound like

2135
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:50,944
You have

2136
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:55,040
Now that's fine

2137
01:52:57,088 --> 01:53:01,440
Really really satisfying about treated so poorly

2138
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:06,048
In context of the episode when I cut the

2139
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:07,584
Eclipse

2140
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:09,120
That is what happened

2141
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:12,704
Really sounds like

2142
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,752
I just edited together Ted

2143
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:21,152
With Alex saying things over it

2144
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:27,552
You made that very self-conscious of it like I do I do

2145
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:34,976
A professional call your main sponsor

2146
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:38,560
But he's yelling at your right right

2147
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:44,960
I get that you're passionate about that I'd love to talk up I'd love to talk about going

2148
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:51,360
It's almost like I have a soundboard

2149
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:54,688
That is how he treats people

2150
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:56,992
That is one of

2151
01:53:58,016 --> 01:54:00,320
Best bits of abuse I think we've ever seen

2152
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:03,136
I have no root

2153
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:05,696
Did either one of those people's feelings that I hope they both

2154
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:06,464
Get hurt as much as

2155
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:10,560
Real sympathy for

2156
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:21,056
He's a piece of s*** he hasn't come around

2157
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:27,968
When you're trying to make a point that's beneficial to both of us trying to make

2158
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:28,992
That will

2159
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:30,784
Financially benefit

2160
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:32,576
Right

2161
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:37,184
Nana nana.

2162
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:42,048
I got a head of steam I got this caller said I got to do this

2163
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:46,400
And you're my Whipping Boy

2164
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:50,240
And you know better than to.

2165
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:55,360
To my abuse of every person who got f***** over by Anderson

2166
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:56,384
Listening to that cliff and I'm

2167
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:59,200
Like I'll man If Only They Knew

2168
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:01,504
If only they could listen in here

2169
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:05,088
But

2170
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:05,856
For sure

2171
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,648
Not unique

2172
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:09,184
Take it all like Alex treats

2173
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:09,952
Like that quite a bit

2174
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:11,744
Which I cannot hilarious

2175
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:17,376
Indicate to me that Alex is like cool think about I wasn't a bully when I was younger

2176
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:18,400
Is probably not

2177
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:19,936
Does

2178
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:24,032
Traeger like what bullies like to abuse he's a bookish dork

2179
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:27,104
Yeah

2180
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:35,808
What's really f*** you nerd at the Alex responding like

2181
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:37,856
Tatooine is kind of indicative

2182
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:40,416
Maybe that is how you operate

2183
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:41,952
People who have detail

2184
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:43,488
And substance in like

2185
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:45,536
A little bit of a nuanced position

2186
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:46,816
That frustrates you you

2187
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:47,840
You want more of the

2188
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:48,608
Intensity

2189
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:50,144
Until you take it out on

2190
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:54,240
Totally if you could take it out like that on someone who is

2191
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:55,520
Basically

2192
01:55:55,776 --> 01:56:00,384
Your meal ticket I would leave

2193
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:02,944
I've also

2194
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:07,040
Maybe

2195
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:10,624
And

2196
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:11,648
He's fine

2197
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:12,928
With

2198
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:15,232
Letting out on air

2199
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:17,536
Difference

2200
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:20,096
Maybe they are the same company

2201
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:21,888
And the next clip

2202
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:22,912
Kind of makes me

2203
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:23,680
We feel like

2204
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:27,520
Gyros

2205
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:30,336
TV ad script

2206
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,072
If you are somebody who is being sponsored by

2207
01:56:51,584 --> 01:56:52,096
This company

2208
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:53,376
It doesn't make sense

2209
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:55,424
Have to write

2210
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:00,800
Different

2211
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:01,824
Kind of relationship

2212
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:06,944
Alex is here talking about on-air like away we wrote this for Midas

2213
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:08,480
Why

2214
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:10,528
I should be there at

2215
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,088
That's them

2216
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:18,720
I mean

2217
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:19,488
Like

2218
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:23,072
I'm not sure about this

2219
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:24,096
But I think that's

2220
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:26,656
Very borderline

2221
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:29,728
Illegal illegal

2222
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:30,752
It's just like

2223
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:32,544
It's an indication

2224
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:36,384
Print all intents and purpose

2225
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,688
No I know

2226
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:39,712
Babe

2227
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:42,016
It's it's

2228
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:43,808
Motorcycle

2229
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:45,856
Revenue through Midas

2230
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:46,624
Is

2231
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:48,928
A lot of it is

2232
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:50,976
Alex Jones based advertising

2233
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:54,816
Gcn

2234
01:57:55,072 --> 01:57:55,840
As a radio

2235
01:57:57,632 --> 01:57:58,144
It's because of Alex

2236
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:02,240
Even if some of them are on board Market

2237
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:06,080
The none of them are nearly as huge

2238
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:10,944
And the shows that they have that have grown into something

2239
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,480
Are only possible because

2240
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:14,528
Cuz of the relationship that started

2241
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:16,320
9

2242
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:17,600
Between Alex and

2243
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:18,880
You can't

2244
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:19,648
Disentangle

2245
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:21,696
They are the same company

2246
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:24,256
They've come up together through decade

2247
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:25,280
Right

2248
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:27,072
And that's why I went ahead lost his

2249
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:29,120
To sell gold

2250
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:32,448
And had a billion dollars that he had to pay off for his mouth

2251
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:36,288
And Alex immediately after that.

2252
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:39,872
Is not a coincidence

2253
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:42,176
I'm paying off

2254
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:43,456
Define

2255
01:58:44,736 --> 01:58:45,504
Needs to pee or else

2256
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,600
These two companies are

2257
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:55,488
For legal reasons

2258
01:58:58,816 --> 01:58:59,840
I think

2259
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:02,912
That's why what he said that we're writing ad copy

2260
01:59:03,168 --> 01:59:03,680
For you

2261
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:07,776
That is where legal reasons get into that's why I legal reasons

2262
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:10,336
No ad copywriting

2263
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:11,104
Isn't

2264
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:11,872
Enough

2265
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:13,920
No I know that is a favor

2266
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:16,736
I know I know we presented as like

2267
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:17,504
Look at

2268
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:24,928
He's great with gold not good with the word bully

2269
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:31,328
They can put together an invoice or whatever like that I know I know that's what I meant

2270
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:33,632
He's not good at.

2271
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:38,496
Extend also to the ad copy that

2272
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:43,872
We're all better for it we're all

2273
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:44,640
Alright

2274
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:45,920
Literally literally

2275
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:48,224
It's

2276
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:48,992
Indicate

2277
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:50,016
Such a strong

2278
01:59:51,808 --> 01:59:52,320
So much

2279
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:53,344
Deeper then

2280
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:56,416
Recognize

2281
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:00,512
It makes all of the other time

2282
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:02,048
So

2283
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:02,816
Embarrassing

2284
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:03,840
Only sells gold

2285
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:05,376
So much more

2286
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:08,960
Like all of the financial collapse narratives

2287
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:10,240
You talk about what

2288
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:16,384
Yep it it all is

2289
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:18,688
It's so gross

2290
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:20,224
So f****** gross

2291
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:25,600
Yep say one more clip and it's about a story that had come out that Michael Moore

2292
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:27,392
Is apparently trying to

2293
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:29,440
Work towards getting

2294
02:00:29,696 --> 02:00:30,208
Photos from

2295
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:31,232
Sandy Hook real

2296
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:33,536
Because he has

2297
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:35,584
Effuse

2298
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:38,144
The other situation

2299
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:39,936
It will lead you to recognize the

2300
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:41,728
The severity of the situation that we're dealing

2301
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:43,776
That poor naive idealist

2302
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,592
And so Alex response

2303
02:00:54,272 --> 02:01:00,416
That's

2304
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:05,536
Photoshop

2305
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:11,168
This is looking more and more like

2306
02:01:14,752 --> 02:01:16,800
Nope.

2307
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:19,104
I know that it seems like

2308
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:21,920
There has been nothing throughout this course

2309
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:23,712
Of this episode about

2310
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:25,504
The main idea that we're looking at

2311
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,040
Madden 2013

2312
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:29,088
Progression

2313
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,112
At the end of this

2314
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:32,416
March 14th episode

2315
02:01:32,672 --> 02:01:34,208
Him saying like

2316
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:36,256
Michael Moore wants these photos

2317
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:38,304
Which would

2318
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:40,096
Shock people into recognizing

2319
02:01:40,608 --> 02:01:41,376
The real tragedy

2320
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:42,912
Awful

2321
02:01:43,168 --> 02:01:44,960
Situation

2322
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:46,752
Brought about

2323
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:48,800
I need to defend from that

2324
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:53,664
The only way I can do that if those photos come out there Photoshop

2325
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:54,432
Photos

2326
02:01:57,248 --> 02:01:58,272
All the way and save it

2327
02:01:59,296 --> 02:01:59,808
Event

2328
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:01,856
They still not saying their act

2329
02:02:09,024 --> 02:02:10,816
Like in the last couple episodes of dirty 30

2330
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:12,096
Any indication

2331
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:12,864
Studies

2332
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:14,400
Going in that direction

2333
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:16,704
To be like a pretty out of nowhere

2334
02:02:17,984 --> 02:02:19,520
I don't know what that was

2335
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:21,056
But I do think

2336
02:02:21,568 --> 02:02:22,336
Set this

2337
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:24,640
This white

2338
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:26,688
That he is he's deeply on

2339
02:02:26,944 --> 02:02:27,712
This prediction

2340
02:02:27,968 --> 02:02:28,736
There's going to be

2341
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:29,760
False flag

2342
02:02:30,272 --> 02:02:30,784
Treason

2343
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:32,320
Preemptively

2344
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:33,088
Define encase

2345
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:34,368
Some of his buddies start doing

2346
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:37,184
I think a lot of it is

2347
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:37,952
Is tide in

2348
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:39,232
I think all of it is

2349
02:02:39,744 --> 02:02:40,256
Thursday

2350
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:42,048
It is being woke

2351
02:02:42,816 --> 02:02:43,328
And I think you said

2352
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:44,096
Sandy Hook

2353
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:44,864
Denial

2354
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:48,192
It can't be understood

2355
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:49,472
Side of those other

2356
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:53,568
Interested

2357
02:02:53,824 --> 02:02:54,336
To know

2358
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:57,152
It is impossible to quantify this or or even

2359
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:58,432
Fight

2360
02:02:58,944 --> 02:02:59,456
The

2361
02:02:59,712 --> 02:03:00,736
They thought that I have is

2362
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:02,272
What is it

2363
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:03,040
Wasn't

2364
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:03,808
Michael Moore

2365
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:06,624
I think you're going

2366
02:03:07,136 --> 02:03:10,720
It would probably be the same but the fact that it's Michael Moore

2367
02:03:11,232 --> 02:03:12,000
Raises that

2368
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:13,792
Alex Jones has those

2369
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:14,816
Hackles in

2370
02:03:15,328 --> 02:03:17,376
Michael Moore

2371
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:18,400
Some of his

2372
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:19,936
Especially his early work

2373
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:24,544
Like I imagined

2374
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:25,568
If it was

2375
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:27,104
Somebody else not

2376
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:30,432
Internet from

2377
02:03:32,992 --> 02:03:33,504
Impersonal

2378
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:35,552
Yeah

2379
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:41,184
Like his reaction to Michael Moore doing something is going

2380
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:42,464
To be more exact

2381
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:43,232
Stream

2382
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:44,768
I8u

2383
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:45,792
You would assume

2384
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:47,840
Yeah we're just somebody else

2385
02:03:48,352 --> 02:03:50,144
Yeah yeah

2386
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:51,168
Pollock like

2387
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:56,288
I agree I agree and I think also Michael Moore is more of a threat

2388
02:03:57,312 --> 02:03:59,104
That's true

2389
02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:07,552
I think he'd respond similarly

2390
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:09,856
Even though he hates

2391
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:11,648
Michael Moore

2392
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:12,672
Yeah

2393
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:15,232
I think it all this

2394
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:16,000
Important about it

2395
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:18,304
Of relative

2396
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,584
Cultural importance

2397
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:20,864
Sayings

2398
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:22,912
That is why I must

2399
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:23,680
Respond

2400
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:25,984
And if that is

2401
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:27,008
Is what makes him

2402
02:04:29,056 --> 02:04:30,080
Dance closer

2403
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:31,104
2

2404
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:31,872
Like it being

2405
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:34,944
Just different then

2406
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:38,016
False flag

2407
02:04:38,528 --> 02:04:41,600
Like his before is the globalist went and killed the children

2408
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:42,624
The Black Sea

2409
02:04:44,672 --> 02:04:46,720
Volkswagen different person

2410
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:48,512
Very

2411
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:51,840
So I don't know I don't know what that pretends

2412
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:52,608
The future

2413
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:56,192
But I should tell you I have cut out an entire hour and a half

2414
02:04:58,752 --> 02:04:59,520
Events

2415
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:00,800
To an interview with

2416
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:01,824
A grandfather

2417
02:05:03,616 --> 02:05:04,384
And I don't care

2418
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:05,152
About that

2419
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:07,968
The radio show

2420
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:09,248
I don't care at all

2421
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:10,784
Stupidest s***

2422
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:11,808
I'd heard

2423
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:13,600
Isn't the episode

2424
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:15,136
And then it goes into overdrive

2425
02:05:15,648 --> 02:05:17,696
Overdrive for another hour

2426
02:05:18,464 --> 02:05:18,976
But guess what

2427
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:20,256
Alex leaves

2428
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:22,560
What the grandpa host

2429
02:05:28,192 --> 02:05:28,704
No

2430
02:05:31,264 --> 02:05:37,408
Does he have an honor hung painting is that why you getting the fourth hours at all anybody needs to do

2431
02:05:37,664 --> 02:05:43,808
Formal 4th hour at this point forth hour

2432
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:47,904
I don't know why they

2433
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:50,208
It might have been brokered programming

2434
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:54,304
Is it to me

2435
02:05:54,816 --> 02:05:57,376
Alex did about a half-hour with this guy

2436
02:05:57,888 --> 02:05:58,400
MN

2437
02:05:59,168 --> 02:06:00,704
Want to talk more about any vaccine

2438
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:02,752
And they can

2439
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:04,032
Continue the show

2440
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:05,312
And Alex doesn't give us

2441
02:06:05,568 --> 02:06:06,336
Alex

2442
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:13,248
I have some Jameson just get out of here

2443
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:15,808
So that's what happened

2444
02:06:16,064 --> 02:06:19,904
That's never a dick it ain't listening to this. Time

2445
02:06:20,416 --> 02:06:20,928
I'd not heard

2446
02:06:21,184 --> 02:06:21,952
Like Alex

2447
02:06:22,464 --> 02:06:24,000
Surrender the 4th hours

2448
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:25,536
Other than one of his

2449
02:06:25,792 --> 02:06:27,584
Employees cuz there was right there

2450
02:06:28,864 --> 02:06:29,376
Think was a 2000

2451
02:06:30,144 --> 02:06:30,912
Tried to do for hours

2452
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:32,192
He had people like

2453
02:06:33,984 --> 02:06:34,752
Arab dude

2454
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:38,336
Like his employees

2455
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:41,664
Is it due the 4th hour

2456
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:43,712
But

2457
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:45,504
Rogue

2458
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:46,784
Fourth hour

2459
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:50,368
And not good

2460
02:06:50,624 --> 02:06:51,136
No

2461
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:52,672
So we come to the end of

2462
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:54,464
I think

2463
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:58,304
This is a race

2464
02:06:59,328 --> 02:07:00,608
This this

2465
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:02,912
Gets bullied

2466
02:07:04,448 --> 02:07:05,728
Encapsulated by RS

2467
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:07,776
The 14th

2468
02:07:08,032 --> 02:07:09,056
March 14th

2469
02:07:09,568 --> 02:07:10,080
Was

2470
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:12,640
Impossible to

2471
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:13,408
To get through

2472
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:15,712
Hi I'll just it was just

2473
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:17,504
You're digging through

2474
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:18,272
Racism

2475
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:19,296
The entire time

2476
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:22,368
And it's triggered by the LA Times

2477
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:23,136
Narrative

2478
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:24,160
Started on the 30

2479
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:26,720
Goodbye him

2480
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:27,744
Defend

2481
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,536
These very real murder 3

2482
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:31,328
That wanted to sponsor

2483
02:07:32,352 --> 02:07:33,120
People in his community

2484
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:33,888
Deworm a cat

2485
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:35,168
So

2486
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:40,800
Because we're in 2019 and I'm looking back on

2487
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:44,128
So many died

2488
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:46,432
He's saying if there's going

2489
02:07:46,688 --> 02:07:47,456
Beautiful swag

2490
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:49,248
And I know why

2491
02:07:49,504 --> 02:07:50,784
He's doing that because Valdese

2492
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:52,576
What I just described

2493
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:55,392
The militia people who are threatening to do s*** like

2494
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:58,464
But then the fact that a high-profile

2495
02:07:58,720 --> 02:07:59,488
Does

2496
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:02,048
And it's not playing.

2497
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:05,120
You know it

2498
02:08:05,376 --> 02:08:06,400
It is

2499
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:08,448
And tamerlan Tsarnaev

2500
02:08:08,704 --> 02:08:12,288
1

2501
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:14,592
That becomes

2502
02:08:14,848 --> 02:08:16,128
They're trying to blame me for the

2503
02:08:16,384 --> 02:08:17,408
I know that cuz

2504
02:08:19,968 --> 02:08:20,480
Like I just

2505
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:22,016
These Dynamics happening

2506
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:23,040
Really makes me

2507
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:28,928
If I'm very excited about this. But also I'm so

2508
02:08:29,184 --> 02:08:29,952
F******

2509
02:08:30,208 --> 02:08:31,232
I didn't know

2510
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:32,768
In March

2511
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:33,536
Alex's

2512
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:37,376
Predicting a terrorist attack is about to happen

2513
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:38,144
No

2514
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:38,912
Vet

2515
02:08:39,424 --> 02:08:41,472
Couple months before this one of his buddies is hurting

2516
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:43,264
The shoot and kill people

2517
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:44,800
All of this

2518
02:08:45,056 --> 02:08:46,080
Context is very new.

2519
02:08:48,896 --> 02:08:50,688
Ayam masak

2520
02:08:54,272 --> 02:08:54,784
Idea first

2521
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:57,344
Your prediction that the Boston bombing

2522
02:08:58,624 --> 02:08:59,392
Start getting Wild

2523
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:01,184
I'm really excited cuz

2524
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:02,976
Starting to sound true

2525
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:06,560
Everytime all in the past

2526
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:09,120
Suddenly you got to give it up to the Somali pirate

2527
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:11,680
It really does look

2528
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:14,240
Like things are like a solid

2529
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:20,640
We're getting a hanging cement mixer curveball at the goddamn belt

2530
02:09:20,896 --> 02:09:22,432
Because history is Prelude

2531
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:24,224
What is going to happen

2532
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:26,016
Is that he's going to start saying

2533
02:09:27,808 --> 02:09:29,088
And there were actors

2534
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:30,368
Before

2535
02:09:32,928 --> 02:09:36,000
Exactly

2536
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:42,400
Where's the Dynamics in the Boston bombing happen

2537
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:43,680
He's going to lose his mind

2538
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:47,520
In all things are going to come together

2539
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:53,920

Travel to build a time machine table to download
