56
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
My favorite

57
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,247
Conspiracy theory is the Shakespeare is a woman

58
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:13,343
Conspiracy theater everybody knows

59
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
100 that trailer with him

61
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,951
How many people have to

62
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,559

Amazing

64
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,471
The theory that Shakespeare was a bunch of different people

65
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,031
Are you sure actually Shakespeare

00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:38,431

72
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:59,423
Difficult storical Shakespeare was a much more open question but

73
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,447
I will grant

74
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:06,847
Never looked into it in the history of olives

75
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:13,247
Literature and you think people would just let that be an open question

76
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:24,767
Probably true

It's essentially an argument against Republicans

152
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,359
What country did I support

153
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,943
The first important point is that we did not do nothing

154
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,783

The strategy

164
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,975
The ultimate goal

165
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:57,375
The presumptive goals were to return Community which has not been done and to protect the economy which also is not

166
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
Necessarily happen

167
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,727
As one might have designed it to

168
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:06,591
See how bad ideas ideas of people who started this their entire lives

169
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,639
Don't work out it's like

170
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:16,831

00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,807
What will you be saying

179
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:53,439

Currently being the speaker of the house but there's no guarantee that you will still be speaker of the house after the November election

195
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,055
Election against guitar on November 3rd

196
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,575
It's not like Fatar would just automatically become the speaker though

197
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:30,975
No you dethroned the person

198
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:35,071
Whoever's in California's 12th District just gets to be speaker

199
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,423
I feel weird representative who would be chosen

200
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,727
Going to be speaker but that's also on certain

201
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:56,063
Choose the speaker

202
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,367
No there's

203
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
There's two choices and it's all

204
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:06,815
Nightmares

205
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
Hillary president

206
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:13,215
This is just about the most unlikely turn of events

207
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,751
So this is what he always chooses

208
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,567
Portray is the globalist evil plan cuz it works

209
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
Pisses off the audience

210
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,919
Revolted Hillary became president

211
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,223
If that is Nancy Pelosi was like

212
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,527
It's Hillary

213
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:35,231
WCW Wrestling ticket

214
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:46,239
In terms of

215
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:51,615
Alaska

216
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,687
I don't know I don't know how this

217
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
I'm going to fly

218
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:59,295
Interactive stories

219
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,575
Skimming some headlines

220
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
As he does

221
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,183
This is what Alex calls like covering the news

222
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Report

223
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,215
North Carolina

224
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
Good

225
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
It

226
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:25,151
Coverage of the news

227
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:29,759
Gnome says it's b*******

228
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:37,695
All right next door

229
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,487
Here we go

230
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
What's your news

231
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Okay

232
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:54,591
Nextdoor

233
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:03,039
I don't know

234
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,975
All right did we do it

235
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:17,375
I don't know if anybody has any better understanding of those stories are or anything now

236
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,399
You like we just wasted

237
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,447
Couple minutes

238
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:25,823
Great you would have known about Rick Perry being invited to join a Ukrainian oil company

239
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
Did that actually happen

240
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
I don't know

241
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
Redbook

242
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:40,927
That was brought up on Alex's show and I don't even know what those stories were affair

243
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:46,047
There's a patient's of Alex leading in this episode

244
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,911
It's all just about like how

245
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:09,599
You can't be saying it's some eventually

246
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,047
Martial law

247
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,119
Petition

248
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,191
Operational

249
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
Operation

250
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,855
Miles an hour

251
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,719
Okay

252
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,255
So you'll know when the time is right

253
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:52,863
There's a train coming to town.

254
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,911
The plan is operational

255
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,727
Like later then

256
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
I guess

257
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,823
Okay how many trains do you have

258
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,359
To get hit by before it's

259
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,783
In terms of nuclear warfare

260
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,855
Metaphorical trains

261
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:20,512
You understand

262
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:25,632
The disjointed almost self-contradictory

263
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,592
It leaves the audience in a state of

264
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,616
Completely

265
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:41,504
If you listen to this

266
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,832
You could make a pretty solid argument from Alex's words

267
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:49,440
Drive to

268
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:53,280
These are the conditions that we know and when these conditions happen

269
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:58,912
You have to go kill people and then you stopped there that you'll know when it's time and then on Tuesday you say

270
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:05,312
The operation has started they're coming to kill with a 100 miles an hour

271
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,896
Split infinitive still saying now is the time

272
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,224
Just cuz you're waiting a day in between it doesn't count

273
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,832
No it's it's really really bad to do that two to the audience

274
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,856
Alex

275
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,696
I am probably one of the biggest stories of the week

276
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,720
The last week

277
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,768
10 days

278
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:30,144
Joe Rogan what's Spotify my moms

279
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,168
Favorite

280
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,704
So far

281
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,984
This year

282
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,312
Certain episodes

283
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,592
We're not

284
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,384
Included

285
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,456
Spotify

286
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
Hello

287
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
Dave Seaman

288
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,152
It kind of makeup

289
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Total

290
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,736
And if you're Joe Rogan

291
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:21,856
Spotify is like 100 million assholes

292
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:28,256
Yes

293
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:41,056
They were trying to censor you I would hope that no matter what level of money you received

294
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,080
You would fight back

295
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
Fight against

296
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,920
Is there censoring your Alex Jones episode

297
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:52,320
You like I like a hundred million dollars

298
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:58,720
Sneaky Snake

299
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,888
He did no hook star talk about

300
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,728
Gross

301
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:14,080
River

302
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,872
That's what's going on

303
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:22,272
The Joe got a really really good deal

304
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,624
For the rest of his career

305
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:34,048
Take that money you're a weirdo comedy

306
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:40,448
Oh sorry

307
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:46,848
Or wherever

308
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
People meals

309
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
In the future

310
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,208
Not like not talked

311
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,792
Alex ever

312
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
I told you

313
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,952
Going on

314
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:52,128
Whatever the most controversial views are

315
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,272
Commercial

316
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,672
So there was some proof

317
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,440
Censorship

318
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,976
Shojin control so it's

319
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:13,888
The minute

320
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:31,296
I've heard that so very conversation, has been banned from Michelle

321
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
Like

322
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:38,720
They're going to get me

323
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:44,096
Controversial glass

324
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:51,776
Sometimes

325
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,592
5 m

326
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:59,456
R62 why I haven't been

327
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,904
This is this is Alex realizing

328
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,208
You been let down easy buddy

329
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
You been let down easy

330
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,616
Auto Brite

331
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
He is obviously right on the street

332
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,584
It is weird it is

333
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,936
It's not that weird of a rental

334
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:58,336
Commercially available

335
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,248
You know

336
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,040
Might see JoJo when he comes

337
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:15,232
Maybe I could see that

338
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,792
YouTube

339
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,608
Grogan to have Alex on

340
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:27,008
Really

341
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,592
Interview with Alex ism

342
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,760
Seas of the Spotify deal but

343
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,320
I would guess episode

344
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,856
Did not make the migration

345
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,536
Issue

346
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:54,912
Amazon

347
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:59,776
There's there's Black Tuesday and then there's the day Alex's allowed on Spotify

348
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,920
It's going to be in a studio and it's not going to be

349
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,688
Experian

350
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,040
For a while

351
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:15,392
And he starts ranting about what it's going to be like when the death of a dollar comes

352
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
You are

353
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,536
Will Annandale

354
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,360
Prophet

355
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,040
We're talkin

356
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,856
Pressing button.

357
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,232
Speak of the devil

358
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,536
Watching

359
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,008
Boris and the Republic

360
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
Save yourself

361
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
Okay

362
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,824
Speaking of the devil

363
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,592
I got it

364
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,920
So we can fight the literal devil

365
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:16,832
Everything is going to be

366
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:22,976
Now

367
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,816
Your money immediately

368
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,584
Rambo

369
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,144
Episode

370
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:36,544
Future and as is

371
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664
I'll just tell you

372
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,344
Falling apart

373
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,512
Real war

374
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,328
T-shirt

375
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
Overtime Super Bowl

376
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,592
Future everybody

377
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,688
Things are going on

378
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
100 mile

379
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,232
50 MI

380
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,328
There's a lot of things I can do

381
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,448
Support we just got

382
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,240
Boss baby

383
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:52,064
No and I'm not I'm definitely not dealing with a barrage of similes like that ever again master of

384
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,088
Metaphor

385
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,160
He knows how to really just

386
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,208
The word picture

387
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,000
It's like

388
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:06,400
I got to go 100 miles

389
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:12,288
I only have one donut hole so you guys got to give me more donut holes otherwise

390
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:16,384
My stomach is going to be update

391
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:35,584
I wonder why

392
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,240
Bad

393
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:48,640
Yeah I didn't feels almost exactly

394
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:53,504
Exactly

395
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:59,648
Because I heard that kind of ship before December

396
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:04,512
Escalate to like new levels of

397
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,840
Support

398
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,632
Or if possible

399
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
That was

400
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:16,800
IND accurate

401
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,872
I don't know but

402
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:24,480
Okay I'm not taking the bait is going on again

403
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,016
Happening again

404
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,880
Overwhelming

405
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:37,280
What do you listen to the if you listen to his episode is like wow this is over and over and over again

406
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:42,400
So a little bit of etymology here

407
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,728
We know that a lot of his guests don't know how words work

408
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:49,824
No that's definitely true

409
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,104
Doesn't understand

410
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,272

Lily in the mud

414
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,928
That's not true

415
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,352
Just such a

416
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,656
Just like any object has a

417
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,472
Do you know where the word pain comes

418
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,032
It comes from the Sumerian for pain

419
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,056
Cool

420
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,080

Different

424
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:10,976
Between being like it you're just as valid as anybody write to the New York Times where the person

425
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,000
Like you

426
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,912
That's why you should arrest an FBI agent if you don't like them

427
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:24,032
Yeah there's different preposition

428
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
You know

429
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,968
A handcuff you can arrest me

430
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,272
Because a functional plan

431
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,112
Open the movie rapper

Who do The Killing

437
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,240
We're on the ground

438
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,312
We see what's really going on

439
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
Queen

440
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,344
Busy

441
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,240
Stop with killing Joshua

442
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,544
You're creeping me out

We're the ones are doing The Killing

447
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
That's fine

448
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,464
Because the other side

449
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,024
Ain't got no soul baby

450
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,216
This is slave doing this

451
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,240
These are pathetic

452
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,896

Is all synthetic.

456
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,648
First people on earth

457
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,472
What is the symbol of energy

00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,592
50% off 40

459
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:41,504
That was impressive. Really was impressed

460
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,368
There is craft

461
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:52,768

462
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:59,168

Rihanna

464
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,944
I could see that being a ruse that was just

465
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,272
Going on too long and that he hurt himself save money and he's like

466
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:18,112
Money's my albino

Cuz he knows what is weird

470
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,816
So

471
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,120
This gets back from break

472
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,680
Talking about some culture issues

473
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
And

474
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,752
This dude to get mad about anything

475
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,896
The biggest video game

What are we doing

480
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,400
What are we doing

481
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,680
I'm leaving the race

482
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,472
Race racism

483
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:12,640
Man I can't imagine how angry

484
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:23,136
You know what NBA used to be about the rating

485
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,416
Drilled three

00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,944
Here's what here's what Alex is missing

491
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,784
What he needs to do is stop complaining about adding people to game

492
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:54,112
And start inviting them to add more people to different types

493
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,136
Mortal Kombat

494
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:59,488

00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496
And

497
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,592
Let me go ahead and respond to this by saying

498
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,872
I don't

499
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,456

Yikes

511
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,080
Zuckerberg

512
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,896
He appears to be rich

513
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,944

Destroy democracy

517
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,648
Ask for permission

518
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,440
Zuckerberg

519
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,208
Cold

520
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,744
How big is

K

523
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,520
Table

524
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,848
In the 12

525
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,895
Menu

526
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,343
Zuckerberg

527
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,391
What's up

528
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,047
So

529
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,119
Jeff Zuckerberg

530
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:13,887
Fezzo's

531
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,191
Zuckerberg he does that a lot

532
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,727
It's really sloppy

533
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:26,943
Zuckerberg is told how many houses you can buy by his financial advisor

534
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,991
Who is Ella Mai

535
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,783
Still don't care

536
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,599
Do you have more than one house

537
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,135
I'd still don't

538
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:39,231
I still don't care

539
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,255
Sort of

540
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,047
Schrodinger's Bill Gates

541
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,839
Situation where he's a member of the

542
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:48,959
Council leaders of the world

543
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:55,615
Gia Edward Griffin is on the show and he thinks

544
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:59,711
Middleman

545
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:04,319
And now Bill Gates is in some kind of limbo where he was a middleman but

546
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:10,719
Now he's finally got a seat at the table but even then we don't know if the table is the 12

547
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,255
We might have gotten rid of the 12

548
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,047
I don't know

549
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,607
Still mad about Cabernet

550
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759

Did I just hear it

553
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:49,375
Colin Kaepernick a guy who is blackballed for kneeling during the anthem

554
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,167
Is actually a Nazi

555
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,983
Because he was blackballed for kneeling during the anthem

556
00:43:54,239 --> 00:44:00,383
Closest black celebrity

557
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:08,575
Kind of arguing that there's an equilibrium of black celebrity kids

558
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:12,159
The other is closest to Jesus

559
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,695

00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,743

That's not a follower

577
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,479
This is the Georgia story is a problem

578
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:47,135
Institute

579
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,743
Conspiracies about mail-in vote

580
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:55,839
History also highlights

581
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,607
Caught

582
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,703
What do you mean

583
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:07,103
Well the situation here is very unclear because the investigation is still ongoing

584
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,943
Fear that aren't good

585
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,711
Brought

586
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:15,807
One possibility of the people sent an absentee ballot

587
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:21,439
Which is

588
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:25,791
The second possibility is brought up in an article in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution

589
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:32,447
Quote Motors are allowed to cancel their absentee ballots and then

590
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,471
Yet been received

591
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,751
By election official

592
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:38,079
It's unclear whether the voters under investigation at

593
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,103
Tempted to do so

594
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:43,967
!

595
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,015
Poor communication about the process

596
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,551
But not Criminal Intent

597
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,343
Yeah I do

598
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,879
Been on Yahoo answers

599
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,999
If you feel like you voted wrong go to the

600
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:59,327
The go to the polling place and vote for the other guy to cancel it out

601
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:05,983
Well

602
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:11,615
North Carolina last week

603
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:18,783
Now you're assured

604
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,367
Tropos explicit

605
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:26,975
The very thing

606
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:31,583
Democrats and Republicans

607
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:36,191
I don't know

608
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:40,799
Happens in the Democratic primary

609
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,079
Even eat each other

610
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,615
Cuz blue states don't have

611
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,431
And also I'm going to have to

612
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:49,503
To save it or iguana is a blue State as well

613
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,575
Understand exactly what the

614
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:58,975
Point here is I don't really know what all the details are

615
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:05,375
And I think more information will be known eventually

616
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,703
Too fragile

617
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:11,007
Whatley phone as much as people didn't know what

618
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:11,775
The deal was

619
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:15,615
Selection cycle you would expect to see

620
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,431
Increase incidences of

621
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,991
Totally just completely screwed up voting system

622
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,295
People who don't understand

623
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,087
You know

624
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:29,183
Absentee ballots not knowing the process exactly

625
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,279
And the fact

626
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,303
They're able to catch

627
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,071
What's this

628
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:35,839
Memes

629
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,191
This type of

630
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:43,007
Mail-in fraud ballots or whatever it is

631
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,055
If you want to deal with that type of fraud

632
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,871
If you made Election Day a holiday

633
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,711
Make sure that everybody had the education on how to vote

634
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:56,575
Got paper ballots only in standardized across the entire country

635
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,367
We wouldn't be in this kind of situation

636
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,671
Nah

637
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,439
Fair enough

638
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,351
I'm bored

639
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,911
Episode

640
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:15,263
Hour of this episode

641
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:21,663
Shane Steiner elk parade

642
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:24,991
About it

643
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,423
This Saturday

644
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:48,031
A show that HD footage say weather

645
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,823
So yes

646
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:56,479
So he's not that's he's burying the lead on that wood right

647
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,015
In his in his bike

648
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,879
That was the most fun I've ever had

649
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:11,327
People that it was not the most fun I've ever had cuz they were inside the water under

650
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,863
Broke

651
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,679
Man says that

652
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,775
Gaslighting is

653
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,615
Where is now

654
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,431
Something different than your being told is going on

655
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,503
The whole day was

656
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,807
Articles

657
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:38,463
7 bulbs

658
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,935
It was going down

659
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:58,687
I still don't think you understand

660
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:02,527
Difficult

661
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:11,999
Approach

662
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:14,047
The coverage of the event

663
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:16,351
Did largely focus on the fact

664
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,311
What makes it newsworthy is

665
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,359
Welcome Center

666
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:33,759
None of us really scared

667
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,319
This

668
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,623
Is the weirdest tower

669
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,439
It has nothing to do with anything important

670
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:45,023
Adventure in Lake Travis

671
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:50,143
It mostly has to do with how great

672
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:03,199
I don't care I don't care

673
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:08,831
Psych commercial around

674
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:14,463
I believe that

675
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,559
The Drone flying around actually arrest

676
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,175
He did

677
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:40,831
Amazon

678
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,511
Aren't you glad Star Wars

679
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,047
Franchisee

680
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,655
I mean it

681
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,959
Yeah it's kind of

682
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:04,639
Star Wars franchise has brought in approximately six billion dollars at the box office

683
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:16,415
Force awakens number for highest grossing film of all time

684
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:24,351
With their opposition to divorce cast

685
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:41,759
So this is like a guy would like

686
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:48,159
Champs Diner

687
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:53,023
Moorage

688
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:59,423
2012 Ikea

689
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,055
Battle course makes Alex turn into

690
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:11,455
I'll roll over and let you scratch my belly

691
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:15,807
Emperor Palpatine

692
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,975
I just think it's a great

693
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:29,375
Newark, Delaware

694
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,167
Bankruptcy

695
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,191
Star Wars

696
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:37,055
It's the size of a small economy

697
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:43,455
Star Wars movies that came out

698
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:47,039
Of course they are

699
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,111
It's kind of a big deal a lot of people

700
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:55,743
Helicopter talk

701
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,535
Alright

702
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:02,655
Well we are you going to have to get rid of my new phone number idea what 800 helicopter talk

703
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:09,311
That's too many letters

704
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:19,039
I mean

705
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439
Trump

706
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:30,815
Trump did Trump said something about

707
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,095
Some sort of

708
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,143
Like Global disease I think

709
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:37,215
I'm pretty sure he said that it was a giant hug

710
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,751
And that no one should pay attention to

711
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:43,103
He was recorded saying it CNN put out those tapes that he said he was a giant hug

712
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,127
Way back right

713
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,663
No no it's not

714
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:54,623
I was being sarcastic Coronavirus

715
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:59,231
Auntie said

716
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,935
Boarding

717
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:08,703
Because

718
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,471
Terrifying

719
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:13,567
Because it makes Trump a premeditated murder

720
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,919
There

721
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,991
You can hear

722
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,015
Literally say

723
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:28,415
Who was Anthony atamanuik

724
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,279
Going to be

725
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,047
You trouble

726
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:34,815
For Ally

727
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:44,799
Subway too much like again

728
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:51,455
I figured there was something he was going to be able to do or like

729
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,807
This is all part of his

730
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,391
Euro 2020

731
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,439
53 days

732
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,743
Greenhead

733
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:09,375
Mattis discussed secret military coup

734
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:11,423
Call Irving

735
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,983
Want to overthrow

736
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:22,431
Here you can see how there's two different media ecosystems and they're reporting on the same underlying

737
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,711
Story with a different

738
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,479
Virginia

739
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:32,927
From Bob Woodward's new book

740
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:35,743
General Mattis

741
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:38,815
About how is there may come a time when action will need to be

742
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,839
Trump was Danger

743
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:46,495
The story and that's most important

744
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,799
Ignore dismiss the other elements of the story

745
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:51,871
Like we talked about

746
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:52,639
Which

747
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,175
Is terrifying

748
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,479
Yeah you know I do

749
00:57:56,735 --> 00:58:00,063
You know what what

750
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:03,391
Two different systems two different realities

751
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,415
Except

752
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:07,999
The mainstream press they also cover the elements of the story

753
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:17,471
Wonderful to also spend some time

754
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,543
Goodwill

755
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,615
More about Woodward's book

756
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,687
Is a lot of lies and a truth

757
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,671
Almost all of it lies

758
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,487
And I will dictate to you what the truth is

759
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:45,887
Matter of

760
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,239
Which is

761
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:53,823
The big reason the Bob Woodward can go f*** himself forever

762
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,383
F*** him

763
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,711
Those tapes could have come out

764
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,735
In what March

765
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,783
I believe it's somewhere around there

766
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,575
Then we were still in

767
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,879
It's over for Humanity mode

768
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,159
In March

769
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,207
If those tapes 2 come out

770
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:15,839
Then the right-wing propaganda narrative would have had to go in a completely different direction

771
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,119
It would have

772
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:20,447
Yeah other way

773
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,239
And energy is not coming back

774
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:30,687
Sprite

775
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:36,063
Decision

776
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:41,183
Baseball practice without earlier

777
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,999
Gone and the consequences

778
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:51,167
The only reason I haven't heard a reason why he

779
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:51,935
He didn't

780
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:57,055
And I wonder if there's some reason that I'm not considering a reason and the washer

781
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:02,687
Washington Post have both given reason and not what's that

782
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:07,551
Well I needed to do more reporting on it and make sure that I got the whole story

783
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,319
Right

784
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,879
Flimsy

785
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,023
I don't see that as a really great

786
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:23,679
You said not not in that position so I don't know what legal issues there are

787
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,799
Especially in a situation like this

788
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:32,127
There you could make an argument that there's a moral imperative that you

789
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,431
Legal consequences

790
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,711
Absolutely

791
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,479
Without question

792
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,807
Change the right-wing propaganda narrative

793
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,575
Which has

794
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:43,135
Been largely the driver of

795
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,927
What is

796
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:53,119
So difficult for our country to move tab

797
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,679
Humanity they would have had to keep going on that route

798
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:56,703
I just

799
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,983
I'm just blown away

800
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,519
It just f***** up

801
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,079
I mean here's a here's what it is

802
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,895
He recorded Trump saying

803
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,991
For my personal benefit

804
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,527
And he held onto that

805
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,807
In order to sell book

806
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,855
Meaning that Bob Woodward

807
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:17,183
Is letting people die for his personal Bennett

808
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:19,487
It is the same

809
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,279
Headed to discuss

810
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,071
It really is

811
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:27,167
Yeah I find difficult to learn

812
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,983
Pretty

813
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,543
Pretty sensible point of view

814
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,591
It's a real big bum

815
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,967
Here today with Alex

816
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,503
But you need to know

817
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:44,575
Is it all of Bob Woodward's book

818
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,855
Is it true

819
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,071
Step

820
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,167
Wichita Eagle in Criminal

821
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:09,919
So the only part of this the true is the park

822
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:12,991
It's useful to me and everything else is all just ignore it

823
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,783
We need to talk about

824
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:19,391
That's me conversation about the fire

825
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:27,327
No nothing but I work all these episodes country is on fire right now

826
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,375
Because there's bigger issue

827
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:32,959
What is Mexico

828
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:42,687
The main source of meat was human flesh of children

829
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,479
They had shops out the bottom

830
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:45,247
Pyramid

831
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,527
Children

832
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,575
Shop

833
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,623
People

834
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,463
Haha

835
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,607
Everywhere

836
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:01,631
It's not a

837
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:08,031
Sustainable system and nutritious

838
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:11,359
Maybe you'd like to imagine

839
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:18,271
The need for food

840
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:22,111
Especially

841
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:30,047
If you might have time it just stational.

842
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:38,495
Now that's a poor economy there's no way you could have a main source of meat

843
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:42,079
For like a week

844
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,735
50 thing everybody gets

845
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,783
To eat one person at met is over

846
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:53,855
Yeah I didn't tell you got one

847
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:02,303
People okay with

848
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:07,167
Killing people was to dehumanize them and perhaps even say that they didn't have a soul

849
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:12,543
And they have no correct connection to your creators

850
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,847
So

851
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:15,615
I mean

852
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,663
This is this this bloom

853
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:20,479
My mind I didn't realize that

854
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,271
Did you know that

855
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:26,367
There are parts of your body called light switches

856
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,767
Turn off a chromosome

857
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,791
In the cell

858
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,559
That is a

859
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:59,647
What's happening

860
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:12,959
Cylinder

861
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:26,271
Where are the season of War

862
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,343
Horrible

863
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,415
Just Apartments

864
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:50,335
Too many times to think

865
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,615
It's okay for you to be like

866
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:57,247
I Think Jesus is going to get us through it and you need to buy storable food you can't have those back-to-back

867
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,783
You can't

868
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,367
This was pretty against that idea

869
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,671
Bob Woodward's book

870
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:11,071
Is obviously call ICE media cycle

871
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,095
About Mattis

872
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,119
And so like

873
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:16,959
If I'm going to handle this story I got a call in my big gun

874
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,751
Rodger Stone what do you make

875
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,543
Other coup plot against America

876
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,591
Zero Hedge

877
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:26,943
U.s. government

878
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:42,559
Say the n word.

879
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,687
Hey Rodger

880
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:05,855
That was that was bad praying he wouldn't say something really unsavory

881
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,135
Temperature

882
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:09,951
Rogers take on painting

883
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,231
Now you have this

884
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,255
Latest

885
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,303
Bob Woodward

886
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,351
Why would Bob Woodward

887
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,143
Anyone believe anything he says

888
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:24,543
I'm here. Stand up for Bob Woodward

889
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:30,431
Maybe Rodger Stone

890
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:32,223
Woodward

891
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:36,575
There

892
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:42,975
Believe this

893
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:49,375
About whether Woodward

894
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:55,775
Interviewing a guy about Upton Sinclair who has like a tattoo of a dirty Factory

895
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,159
A real comedy

896
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,439
In the fact that Rodger

897
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,463
Rodger

898
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:19,071
Yeah

899
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:23,679
I don't know if there is a more partisan

900
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,215
Crow

901
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,263
Nixon person to talk to

902
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:30,591
Yeah I just remember

903
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:34,687
I don't even know probably not true

904
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:43,135
Interest about that Watergate

905
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,671
Oh well

906
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:50,559
Trump needs to

907
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:52,863
In Nevada

908
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,655
Palace in Nevada

909
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,703
ABC's

910
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:57,727
Marshalls

911
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,519
And taken from the state

912
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:00,543
They are

913
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,823
Corruption

914
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:02,591
No boat

915
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,895
State of Nevada

916
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:05,919
If that turns out

917
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,991
We can prove

918
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,527
Voter fraud in the app

919
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,559
Yikes never notice

920
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:26,143
When they condemn like other countries for doing

921
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,703
And stuff this anti-democratic

922
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:31,007
That they're doing they're saying that we should do

923
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,055
Anti-democratic

924
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,687
Alex is about

925
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:41,759
To get engaged

926
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,855
Election process

927
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:48,927
Covering it might go to the court

928
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:55,327
The expert

929
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,863
Rodger Stone

930
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:03,263
Calls in the Brooks Brothers situation

931
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:08,639
Are precipitated

932
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,919
Isn't illegal

933
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:15,039
Carrying out of stealing of an election that Rodger Stone was directly involved

934
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:18,879
Alex's is is the Isle

935
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:21,439
Is not only coming on to talk about

936
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,463
Woodward

937
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:29,119
And not citing his

938
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:35,775
And probably engaging in similar

939
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:36,799
And Alex

940
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:41,663
And now it's just good stuff

941
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:44,735
Here's the problem with Rodger and Alex

942
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,271
And all of this stuff

943
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:48,063
It's how they're framing things

944
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:51,647
It it's receivers of Alex

945
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,183
Constantly

946
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:55,999
B Rodger does a little more clearly

947
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,303
Like to have an honest election

948
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,607
In which the real winner take

949
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,375
Boston

950
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,399
The real winner will not

951
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:11,615
Unimpeachable

952
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:16,735
I want to hear election

953
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:25,951
You cannot wait there for any election

954
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:29,279
Trump is the only possible winner there for

955
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:35,679
Of course everyone knows

956
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:38,495
This is a normal point

957
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:43,871
On Alex's listening to just probably absorb it as fact

958
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,431
Possible chance

959
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,455
Could win

960
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:51,295
In any Fair scenario

961
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:54,367
So Rodger

962
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,671
Alex needs another guy

963
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,463
Needs another mark

964
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,535
And when it's time

965
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,583
Talk about potential

966
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:08,703
We got one man that's right

967
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:13,567
Talk about

968
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,103
Trying to plan this to

969
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,639
And your Steve's response

970
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:21,503
A very serious problem

971
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:29,439
Whip

972
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:34,047
The man text Victor

973
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:40,447
You really threatening becoming to be like Alex the horrible everyone out

974
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:46,847
I do

975
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:52,479
Every other week

976
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:54,271
That's true

977
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:02,719
Spell koozie

978
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:08,607
So Steve

979
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,655
Our military

980
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:11,935
Like going to work

981
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:13,727
Dumb

982
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,199
Uniform

983
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:37,023
He is very smart

984
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:44,959
More serious problem

985
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,543
Getting off work

986
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:53,407
Shoreline

987
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:57,247
Edward is lying about the temperature

988
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,015
2

989
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:58,783
Oh my God

990
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:00,831
Music

991
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,855
This is unfortunate

992
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:04,927
This is what happens when the truth is just so

993
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,695
Obvious

994
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,791
They can't admit that they were

995
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:10,815
Stupid

996
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:13,887
Trump is an idiot

997
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:18,495
So f****** stupid

998
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,263
Stupid

999
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,031
End

1000
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:22,079
And so it has to be

1001
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,359
Even more out

1002
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:30,271
Alright we can only accelerate we can only Accelerate from here is what he did

1003
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,551
Is meaningless now

1004
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,575
He

1005
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:34,879
Destroy the meaning of his own work

1006
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:42,303
Angry about it

1007
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,583
But I would also

1008
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:44,863
Say that

1009
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,399
Maybe

1010
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:47,935
Know that

1011
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:58,687
More sensible time

1012
01:14:58,943 --> 01:14:59,711
Yeah yeah

1013
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:00,991
I don't know

1014
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:05,343
That's possible. It only took him forever to take down Knicks

1015
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,367
Listen to I don't know

1016
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:09,439
Camp Maranatha

1017
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:11,743
Steve

1018
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,375
This guy that we love

1019
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,399
Is so smart

1020
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:24,543
Talk to

1021
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,103
What he said

1022
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,455
Is it really answer the cell

1023
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,503
Why would

1024
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:40,927
With

1025
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,719
Edwards history

1026
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,999
He's going to get it

1027
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,535
It's going to be a

1028
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:57,823
Every night for 1890

1029
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:00,895
So smart

1030
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,431
You asked yourself that

1031
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:09,599
Do you know what it is exactly narcissism

1032
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,135
We'll go talk to the cops

1033
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:13,183
While they're investigating the crime he committed

1034
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:19,071
100% what it is now it is narcissism

1035
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,607
Yeah it's totally that

1036
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,423
Granted

1037
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:25,471
We're making an assumption

1038
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:28,543
Saks

1039
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,311
Yeah

1040
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,663
I should have known this

1041
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,343
To begin with

1042
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,879
He and I started it

1043
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:45,951
Henry County

1044
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:50,559
He never had any drone journalism behind meia operative

1045
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,583
No no

1046
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:04,895
What

1047
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:11,039
What just happened here

1048
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:16,671
Martin Luther King jr.

1049
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:20,255
Yeah he was deep throat

1050
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:24,863
Answering the question of like

1051
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:26,143
Trump is so smart

1052
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,191
You do this

1053
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:31,519
Cuz he's not well I would say describe

1054
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:35,871
A real a******

1055
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,687
Why did Trump do it

1056
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,343
We like

1057
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:49,695
Is far more important

1058
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,279
Anyone else to see now what do I mean

1059
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:58,143
Negative

1060
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,167
Mary

1061
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,239
Terrible man

1062
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:05,055
His sister says he's worse than Tara

1063
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:11,199
Michael, his Jewish corrupt

1064
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,295
Why does he do that

1065
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:17,855
One word only

1066
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,487
He doesn't give a damn

1067
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:26,559
Either way as long as you use the word

1068
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,095
Are you in

1069
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,727
Including

1070
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:48,575
Really really bad

1071
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:49,855
For a leader

1072
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:58,047
Go to its logical

1073
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:00,863
How much bad breath would you get from nuking somebody

1074
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:03,679
Like how much

1075
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,727
Terrible thing

1076
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,871
Is a really really

1077
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:15,711
Like cancer is mentality for someone with actual power to have

1078
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:18,015
Alex doing this

1079
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:24,415
Cuz he's a narcissistic psychopath

1080
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:31,071
Damn it's not about the hundreds of thousands of people that are

1081
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:37,215
So we make money if you're in the game that's like

1082
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,239
It's like a Omar

1083
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,615
Understand

1084
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:51,039
None of it matters in the more he survives this info

1085
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:57,695
You got it and that's true about Alex Jones

1086
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:58,975
Whoa

1087
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:03,327
You guys accidentally kind of got it right if you just removed

1088
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,375
Yeah

1089
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,399
Yeah

1090
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,215
Also

1091
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,799
Admission that there is a lot of real stuff

1092
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:17,920
Totally he's getting away with it because of the

1093
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:24,576
That's not good

1094
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,608
Do you want your Lyrica leaders to have and face no consequences for their actions

1095
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:40,960
Damn there's a real thing better than doing it a really bad

1096
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:41,728
Cool

1097
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:47,360
A lot of this episode has to do with Alex saying that they're the Chinese government is hacking

1098
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:50,176
I don't care so

1099
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,784
Some kind of a DDOS attack or something

1100
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:59,392
Possible that the Chinese government or anything

1101
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:03,232
I just didn't it was actually a scam

1102
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:12,448
Rodger was on

1103
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,728
Is Trump winning

1104
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,056
His position is more

1105
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:23,712
I don't want to pair election

1106
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:25,248
This again

1107
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:27,040
I said it a couple years ago

1108
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,632
Legally or illegally

1109
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:43,936
I can assure you and your audience

1110
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,176
When I criticized

1111
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:56,224
Line is

1112
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:58,784
Many ways to make sure that

1113
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:02,368
Legal way

1114
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:03,648
AutoWay

1115
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,000
Jesus

1116
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:17,472
Okay I guess that's fascism

1117
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:19,264
For you

1118
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,872
Video of supposedly news program

1119
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:34,624
Rodger stone is creating a scenario wherein only Trump winning his affair lights and everything else is like definition

1120
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:41,024
Not fair Anna and a fraudulent election

1121
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:44,608
Make sure the Democrats ever coming

1122
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:52,544
You're can you please just stop talking for that bit your fascist

1123
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:56,384
Stop trying to

1124
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:01,760
Steve is on

1125
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:13,024
I don't want I don't even want a fair election if Trump loses

1126
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,328
We are a business

1127
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,352
Alright

1128
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:18,400
You should hate this guy

1129
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:21,216
But think of the Coronavirus covid-19

1130
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:25,056
And the challenges that we've all been faced with has

1131
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,848
I've taught us some lessons

1132
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:31,456
Personally I think I've learned a lot about

1133
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,480
The different

1134
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:34,784
Struggles that people go through

1135
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:37,600
Things that you don't

1136
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:43,232
Consider because maybe it's not exactly your experience at world that other people have

1137
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:48,352
People who are immunocompromised or have other conditions

1138
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:54,752
The interactions with you might be comfortable with

1139
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:56,288
Completely different

1140
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:59,360
Verizon

1141
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:01,152
In ways that I definitely wish

1142
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:03,456
As more wear before but I'm glad I know now

1143
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:06,528
Secondly

1144
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:09,856
How much opportunity there is

1145
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,392
You know there's a lot of things

1146
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:15,232
You can do even if you feel like there's nothing you can do

1147
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,768
And I appreciate that

1148
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:18,048
Great deal

1149
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,632
Also talked me that my lifestyle

1150
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:23,168
Prior to it

1151
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:28,288
Was a little bit isolated and consigning and maybe once things open up a little more I should make

1152
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,312
A greater effort

1153
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:36,224
Where is that

1154
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,112
Has a different lesson

1155
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,648
The reality is

1156
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:46,976
Interesting.

1157
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,024
And that was

1158
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,816
We need cities

1159
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,144
Really in

1160
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:05,664
I don't know what organizational system but

1161
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:09,504
I don't know

1162
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,784
Yeah I don't know

1163
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:14,624
What kind of functional organizational structure

1164
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,768
Weird

1165
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:23,072
Personally

1166
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:28,448
You and I and everyone we've ever met will be

1167
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,472
Subway

1168
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:32,800
So I want to talk to Steve about something really important

1169
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:34,848
Because this is September 10th

1170
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:36,640
I am the next day's 911

1171
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:37,920
And

1172
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:48,416
Talk about it

1173
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:51,744
Number one

1174
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:56,864
Call Mom

1175
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:03,776
That prizes

1176
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,544
Become a joke

1177
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,592
Wow I want that went some directions

1178
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:07,616
Yeah

1179
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:10,176
I mean

1180
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,200
The Peace Prize at the camper

1181
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,296
I would

1182
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,320
Say that

1183
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,672
Weave group

1184
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:33,472
Redacted

1185
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:39,872
Sorry about that

1186
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:42,432
Pacifically avoiding

1187
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:45,248
Or does he not still think

1188
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:51,904
I don't know what events quite honestly anymore I have no idea

1189
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:56,768
Tomorrow on 9/11

1190
01:26:57,024 --> 01:27:02,400
911

1191
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,936
Well now

1192
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:08,544
Much like

1193
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:15,968
Big deal

1194
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:20,576
This is really making a meal out of like how scary China is and how

1195
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:32,608
Right

1196
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:33,632
Specific

1197
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:36,192
China right now

1198
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:39,776
United States

1199
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,824
Personal friend

1200
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:44,128
India

1201
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:54,368
Incursions into the garage

1202
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:04,352
I got to move along today at 2

1203
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:09,472
Your fears about China here's the trick

1204
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:13,056
China's not worried about our fascist dictator

1205
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:15,872
They're worried about India's fascist dictator

1206
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:16,896
Done

1207
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:24,320
Is diffuse Alex's talking point about

1208
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,648
China's the most terrifying thing in the world

1209
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:33,024
Entire reason to exist now

1210
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:35,072
Man

1211
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:41,472
Is a great one-off interview says is reset if he's like

1212
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:56,576
Hey babe

1213
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,136
He leaves and Alex's just back to normal

1214
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:05,280
Just do you just wrecked shop

1215
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:11,680
It's like Sealab 2021 every episode that explode

1216
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:23,456
You know trying to keep Trump out of office they're going to have all these

1217
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:28,064
What do you predict their do sacks are there

1218
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:33,440
What could this corrupt

1219
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:54,432
Today's weather

1220
01:29:56,992 --> 01:30:02,368
Balloon pop

1221
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:04,416
Yeah very good

1222
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:15,168
Receive discontinued

1223
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:18,752
The aggressive at pictures

1224
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:23,872
More and more of those

1225
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:30,528
Convergence eye preciate

1226
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,064
Liar

1227
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:36,928
No real talk about some of the issues that are most important to a lot of people like

1228
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:39,232
Fires in the West Coast

1229
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:42,560
No real conversation about the tapes

1230
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:44,608
That would work release

1231
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:46,400
We need to talk about

1232
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:50,240
Bright

1233
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:53,312
His version of the Woodward story based on

1234
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,848
Zerohedge article

1235
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:57,152
Rodger Stone come in

1236
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:59,200
It is a Wonder it's an a******

1237
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:02,272
I meant Steve narrative

1238
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:04,064
Weird

1239
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,088
It's very weird

1240
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,440
Specs

1241
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:13,024
It's just do sex

1242
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,352
It's frustrating

1243
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:22,752
Texting earlier I was telling you like a little bit late

1244
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:26,848

1245
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,128
Text

1246
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:32,224
It's going to be disappointed

1247
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:37,856
I'm calling it Rodger and Steve

1248
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,136
Alright

1249
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:41,696
I did good

1250
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:45,536
I do Cassidy of the show

1251
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:55,520
Thanks just a it's so boring

1252
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:58,592
The inserted unnecessary racism is always an issue

1253
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:04,992
Jesus man

1254
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:06,784
It's too much

1255
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:09,344
Yeah

1256
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:14,208
I feel like we probably should have maybe

1257
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:20,608
Discuss that but the reason that I

1258
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:28,288
Racist person that you can think of

1259
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:32,128
Quite it's awful out of her mouth

1260
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:34,944
Hey Dan Pedro

Fire fire

1267
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:50,816
Do we know anybody

Gingivitis

1269
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,192
Platform

1270
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:57,728
Which would

1271
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,568
You will force

1272
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:03,616
Twitter advanced

1273
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:04,896

1274
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,760
Was really appreciate podcast

1275
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:11,808
I think it's a great idea

1276
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:14,880
At the heel turn

1277
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:16,160
Yep to see you there

Italy

1280
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:32,544
Weather that would be good

1281
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:36,128
I could see him soft

1282
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:38,432
Little bit

1283
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:46,368
That's what you do to broaden up your base

1284
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:48,672
A big party

1285
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:49,440
Your plan

1286
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,256
This is not much

1287
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,304
Just want to call

1288
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,328

1323
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,352
Hey Gabby

1324
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:38,752
Not enough people giving a shout-out so

1325
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,800
Crystalline update

1326
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:44,128
I have murdered my cat

1327
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:46,688
Jumping I-70 a weird way

1328
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:52,064
Murder with love

1329
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:00,256
Mukbang

1330
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:03,328
Cost to balance

1331
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:07,680
Neglecting her a little bit

1332
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:12,288
It's hard to balance having a cat in the hallway and also pots

1333
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:13,568
The plant sure

1334
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:15,872
Have to find a way to make sure that

1335
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:18,688
Because if you look over there

1336
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:25,088
Yeah I see that now I've had to try and find a way

1337
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:27,904
To most of the plants are here in the office

1338
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,744
The office when I'm not in here

1339
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:38,144
And it's not a perfect system because obviously she can still if I'm not

1340
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,192
Create

1341
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:45,568
A couple times I just gone to the bathroom

1342
