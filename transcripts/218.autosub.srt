Decide which documentaries going to be

67
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,128
It looks like The Obama Deception

68
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,152

00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,448
Determines if that's what we're doing

75
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,240

77
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
Beginning of

78
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,104
I'd like to say

00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856

86
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,976
Too late November 1st

87
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,495
And

88
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
We always knew that

89
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
So thank you all very much

90
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,895
For forcing us into this position

91
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:35,967

We could only waffles waffles limit for today

95
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:53,119
What I wanted to do this earlier in the week that I was working on the 2009

96
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
Stop

97
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
By the end of the week the cake

You probably be baked

99
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,775
Cake is not bake it is not settled

100
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,311
If so I can

101
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,591
I got to put a pin in

102
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
2009 Scion xB

103
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
Probably

104
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,735
And so I thought everybody likes

105
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,039
Alex Jones to see what he's up to

106
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,719
People tell you that it wasn't a good sponge

107
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:25,119
No we have chaos all over the place

108
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:31,775
Single moment there's a new facet of already existing chaos be

109
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
The

110
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,223
Dire warnings

111
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,295
Things coming out about investigation

112
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:50,207
Trump's family business history foreign countries

113
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
The property

All this stuff is going on it's crazy

115
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,399

Mitch McConnell fulfilling the prophecy

120
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,135
Six months ago when I said that these f******

121
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
A way for them to actually a text

122
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
33rd

123
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,935
Program associate nursing

124
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,007
I don't want to take away from your predictive abilities but that's one of those

125
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
It was sound

126
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,431
It was it was

127
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,503
You didn't need a Kerry Cassidy style dream

128
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,599
I hope you see that future

129
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,391
6 hours there were a lot of fires in

130
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
TuneIn 95.7

Yeah

133
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,447
Here is an out-of-context drop

134
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,007
From today's show

135
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,223
Oh no poor man

136
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:32,607
Now I would say that I was

137
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,775
Kind of forgetting that that's not just Kanye's that's also

138
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,847
Alex Jones

139
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:50,527
It's a little little

140
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
It would have been

141
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
That's your best

142
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
Signature

143
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
This morning which is kind of

144
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,335
Set up top

145
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:20,223
So you would think you would think that delete that Alex comes up

146
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,039
Would be you know something hot

147
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
Real import

148
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
The geopolitics

149
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:33,535
20 days 12 days and the title wave of total censorship

150
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,863
Had gone into insane Overdrive

151
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,191
Unbelievable information coming up

152
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,567
Facebook Twitter you-name-it are Banning tens of thousands of pages of anyone

153
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,383
It promotes the NPC memes

154
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,879
1138

155
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,719
It's really a remake of the idea of a

156
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,511
World

157
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,863
NPC memes

158
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,655
Cool man

159
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,495
Memes

160
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,407
You're not on social media so you're probably not even aware of this is the biggest deal of the World by Prince

161
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
Oh absolutely

162
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:28,831
World we live in right now memes memes are the biggest

163
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,159
Number one

164
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,255
You know what that's fine

165
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:43,679
I don't care memes

166
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:50,079
Please gray faces on the actual Twitter Avatar not create like a full

167
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,615
Version of them

168
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,431
And then also there's other ones that are just at

169
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,991
1735

170
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,319
Impression of people on the left

171
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
Parody

172
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:05,951
The idea that there was thinking everybody saying the exact same thing

173
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,511
Like they're non-playable characters in a video game

174
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,815
Who just repeat dialog when you walk up to

175
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,375
If I know anything about the right wing

176
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
This meme is

177
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,495
Hilarious so funny

178
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
Quite like the right way

179
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
So funny

180
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,359
Amazing comedian

181
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:29,247
Overlooked

182
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:36,159
I mean you got Nick DiPaolo the list goes on

183
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,583
What's his name

184
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,191
Who's number two

185
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
Dipaulo's not not

186
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,407
Also

187
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,199
She was relevant 25-year

188
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,183
Alright alright we nailed it

189
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,023
On the right

190
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
Lost track

191
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,959
I think he was out making copies

192
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,335
Still relevant to today's office today

193
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,383
Stihl products

194
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,439
Ignored it when it was soda popping around

195
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,999
The people were tweeting about it I was like fell right this is

196
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
Cuz it's basic

197
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,191
Like a visual way of them saying

198
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,775
They just figured out a new way to articulate this idea that they

199
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
Had all along

200
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
And they're acting like a

201
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
It's new

202
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,895
And then on the other

203
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
Spot-on

204
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:05,759
The other side of it to that should be like horribly apparent

205
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,295
Anybody who travels

206
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
In or listen

207
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,135
To any of the diverse voices on the left

208
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,231
What you know is that basically you just have a bunch of people in places like

209
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,791
Reddit 4chan

210
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Where's the beef

211
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
The are their own Echo chamber

212
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:27,263
Created this image in their head of what Justice Warriors are

213
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
And then

214
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Pretending

215
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,359
But that's what everybody sounds like

216
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,711
And now they're creating a parody of this false version of the other side

217
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:40,575
But they've created in their head then engage with reality

218
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599
Created

219
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
Facsimile of a human

220
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,047
Out of some sort of

221
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,423
Yippee ki-yay

222
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,007
What was the name of that song

223
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,823
Hey dude on Nickelodeon

224
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
Donkey

225
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
This year

226
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
I really do

227
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
I don't I don't care about it

228
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
I understand one of the reasons

229
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,535
Twitter is like cracking down

230
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
Getting rid of somebody's account

231
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,119
Is that they are targeted rest

232
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
To a certain extent

233
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
If you put

234
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,959
This great thing over someone's face

235
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,751
And you're pretending that you're them

236
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
Sure I can go on one level.

237
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,407
Constitutes

238
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,967
So I don't you know I see both sides of this

239
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,527
I think this is up to Twitter to make the decision and live with

240
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
You know

241
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,111
To just choose whatever steak you want to make it it

242
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,159
We'll see how the chips fall

243
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,487
I don't Advocate them banning all of them but I also don't think

244
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
M2

245
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
Don't care at all

246
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,887
No that's my position firmly on the

247
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
Yeah

248
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:09,407
Keep coming back to bunches that like that idea

249
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,711
In life you kind of got to do triage a little bit

250
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,015
Sometimes you may just have to

251
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:32,191
They're Alex's like how they were gray faces in

252
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,751
Which was I believe the studio there pretty

253
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
Sound for Lucas

254
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:42,687
No no that's that's it was actually one of the beat the roots of that though

255
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,503
Who did the sound for that a lot of Luke

256
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,783
Closest Feldman's

257
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,623
He collaborated with George Lucas on THX one

258
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
138

259
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,415
Which is base

260
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:58,815
No no no

261
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,351
Talk about it in the same breakfast

262
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,911
Like

263
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,215
It's like

264
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
The globalist model for

265
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
The future

266
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,055
Basically prophecy

267
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:14,175
Putting refuses to bring up is that it was basically just a student film made by George Lucas when he was

268
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
USB

269
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,039
It was a man

270
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,831
You got funding for it and made it home

271
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
First

272
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,903
Directorial film

273
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,975
Yeah it was the working title was American

274
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
Thh

275
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
Right

276
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,119
Correctly notes parallels Brave New World 19

277
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,191
Thx-1138

278
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
Because they're absolutely

279
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:43,871
Lucas was a goddamn college student in the late sixties in Southern California

280
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:49,503
Thx-1138 1984

281
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Philosophy

282
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,575
If you borrowed Soma from Brave New World

283
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,623
The bouillabaisse

284
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,999
Lucas wasn't good at making things yet use a young artist

285
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:04,095
Also the end of the movie is clearly stolen from Plato's allegory of the cave

286
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,215
At the end of the film

287
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,311
Is out running some some

288
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
Police drone

289
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,407
Because that

290
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
Because they're over budget

291
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:25,343
Priority for him to

292
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:30,207
Stop getting to the above-ground realizes

293
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
There's birds up there

294
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,815
This is all just

295
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,631
It's just it's very derivative work much like

296
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,911
George Lucas

297
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,447
This is where we are going to be

298
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,519
But

299
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,991
If you take some of the more purely aesthetic stylist

300
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,551
Stick touches which of the things that Alex really gets caught up

301
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,343
I'd like the idea that everyone bald

302
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,623
Aaron shave their head

303
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,695
If you really get rid of some of those stuff

304
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
The movie really contain

305
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,535
Central ideas about States

306
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,583
Control one is forced drug

307
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
People and

308
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
Instilling the mentality that

309
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,447
The economy and money are more important

310
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
People's commands

311
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,543
Donald Trump

312
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
Has been in office

313
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,359
There been many reports of ice

314
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,687
Independent contractors for medicating immigrant children

315
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
Been separated from their families

316
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,271
In order to make them more pliable and man

317
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:30,367
This is a direct result of the approval of the

318
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
Trust

319
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,487
Grisly murder of Jamal khashoggi

320
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,559
United States internal is for the washer

321
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
You can post

322
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,631
It appears to be carried out by Saudi Arabia

323
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:48,031
They're spending $100 on military equipment

324
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
Things to create jobs for this country

325
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
I don't like the

326
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,431
The concept of stopping an investment of 110 billion dollars into the United States

327
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:59,551
Because you know they're going to go they're going to take that money and spend it in Russia or China or someplace else

328
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,647
There's almost a literal definition of putting money into supposed economy

329
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
Me over someone

330
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
Humanity

331
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,303
I excuse about jobs in the economy

332
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,071
Is Ally

333
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
From Fox

334
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,911
Overall the private us defenseman just

335
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,215
Does directly employ a lot of us workers

336
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,287
About 350 5526

337
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
16th Court

338
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Recent estimates

339
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
From the Aerospace in

340
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
Industries Association

341
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
But

342
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,199
Defense workers makeup-less

343
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
Sweet 5%

344
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
US Labor

345
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,855
And that includes every person whose job depends directly on the sale or production

346
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
Airplane tank

347
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
Baume & Service

348
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,695
For the entire US military

349
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:42,303
It's unlikely that many of them if any depends directly on weapons sale to Saudi Arabia

350
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
It's also unlikely.

351
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,375
These jobs advantage of Saudi money

352
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
So

353
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
You're saying

354
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
That the United

355
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
Government

356
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
Is

357
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,335
Defense

358
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,919
Indefensible idea already at least one guy is

359
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,991
I cannot imagine any

360
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,551
Where in the entire US government

361
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,879
Bekins lying in order to support

362
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,159
Decision in the first place

363
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,535
I would call it a turnover

364
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:18,911
That would never happen because 110 billion dollar number is not reflect

365
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
Civil contractor actual deals

366
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,775
You really look into it involve the convoluted mishmash of letters oven

367
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,359
Letters of Interest definitely nothing really buying

368
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
At least

369
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:32,223
The true number of how much is coming in for these deals it's unclear

370
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,247
But it is definitely

371
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,295
Lower than 110 billion dollars

372
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:42,463
So even the lie in support of the bad argument that is indefensible is built around another

373
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,999
At least embellishment

374
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,791
Probably outright lie

375
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:49,631
Target this is also probably from the hill

376
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:55,007
President-elect Donald Trump registered eight companies during his presidential campaign that appear to be tied to Hotel in

377
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
System Saudi Arabia

378
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
According to a report in the washer

379
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
You can post

380
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,127
The companies in August

381
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,943
2015 shortly after launching his presidential bid

382
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
According to the poem

383
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:07,551
Also at a campaign rally in 2015

384
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:13,439
They buy apartments in forty million 50 billion am I supposed to dislike them I like them very much

385
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:18,559
2018

386
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,119
But Saudi Arabia is going to have to help us economic

387
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:29,311
Just deported indefensible argument that is actually covering up a mass

388
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
Corruption

389
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,127
Yeah

390
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:38,271
I don't know him from being president in the first place under some sort of

391
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,719
Great cool as he things like Pat Robertson come out on the 700 Club

392
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,279
Supposed Christian dude

393
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
Why would

394
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,679
This weapons deal

395
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:02,591
It's great it's great that we now live in a world where I'm sure Jim Bakker saying similar

396
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,431
Obesity

397
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:11,295
Rallying people around the idea of selling billions of dollars

398
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
Weapon

399
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,391
Because that somehow helps their regressive domestic

400
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,952
It's so crazy

401
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,976
Live with

402
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,512
Suggest that we are selling

403
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
McFarland

404
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
Billions of dollars

405
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,936
Even those billions of dollars which we are selling are then being used to

406
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
Commit atrocities

407
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:37,408
Christian it's going well

408
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,624
Really old crazy dude

409
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,024
But they are with

410
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,840
Just went over there I think you're the nice Bridge

411
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
Malik

412
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,912
He's obsessed with that NPC meme

413
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,728
Brittany dog

414
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,008
Are you about a meeting or not

415
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,408
He bridges that with THX

416
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,456
1138

417
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
Who described

418
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,992
You listening

419
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
Most of the

420
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,040
Sub

421
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,064
Which if you don't

422
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
Understand the points of

423
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,904
Really point the finger at the exit.

424
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,464
Trump one of which is this

425
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,744
Humane response

426
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,768
Inhuman

427
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
Response

428
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,816
2D

429
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
Looking like

430
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,192
Assassination

431
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,288
The regime which I wrote

432
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
A very different film

433
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
I would say

434
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
In the fancy

435
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,176
Be on the side of the guys

436
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
We were like

437
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,224
This train

438
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
He's a great

439
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:51,648
Yeah I think you would be on the wrong side of that leaves us

440
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,440
I'm talking about

441
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:59,584
Indispensable

442
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
Group false flag

443
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,528
Iran

444
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,840
But not under his control

445
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,656
Just like Trump isn't controlling most of the FBI

446
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,216
I almost

447
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,776
Are most the CIA

448
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,872
Command

449
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,944
Hillary Obama and other

450
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,296
After this clip Alex had to take

451
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,344
Half an hour off of Ashoka

452
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,184
Throughout his back stretching that far

453
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,952
Razor

454
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,720
Wow that's

455
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,512
Maybe baby

456
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,304
That's maybe the most convoluted

457
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,120
Terrible plan of ever heard

458
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
If true

459
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:10,752
I respect for Obama Hillary and others

460
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:17,152
Always my favorite Alex meme

461
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,048
I hear this and I'm like this is

462
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,328
Weak stuff

463
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,400
Man

464
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
Clear motive

465
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,312
Might be the

466
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,104
Meme

467
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
Easter evidence

468
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,688
Like the motive is overwhelming

469
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,784
Because Alex does

470
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,576
Recognize that there's a motive

471
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
History of

472
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,160
Disappearing people

473
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,464
Because I reckon

474
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,000
Recognize that there's a motive or

475
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:04,768
He's not willing

476
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,328
Except

477
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,912
Is very concrete real-world cleartype

478
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,216
Reason that khashoggi would have been

479
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:17,824
A target of the Saudi Arabia

480
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Like to

481
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,640
They are 20-30

482
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,664
Enticement of

483
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,200
Foreign business

484
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,248
Infrastructure planning

485
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,784
That they're doing this big

486
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
This big push

487
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,088
It makes total sense

488
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,112
Garry's Mod

489
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:35,744
I remember when they did the very first

490
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,352
The very beginning of the beginning of this

491
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,656
Where they're like

492
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,008
Post journalist went into the Saudi consulate

493
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,800
Journalist

494
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,080
A history of

495
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,872
Criticizing the Saudi government

496
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,176
Disappeared inside the Saudi consulate

497
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
I was like

498
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,928
Yeah motive motive was not hard to come by

499
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,976
In another lifetime

500
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,768
But I mean like four years ago

501
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,144
Alex would have been screaming bloody murder about this murder of a journalist

502
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,728
Very long time

503
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,872
Dwight

504
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,432
He wasn't totally wrong on that front

505
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
To some extent

506
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,504
I don't understand the kids and such a

507
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,064
This is a crazy

508
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
Is it

509
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,672
The next eclipse

510
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,328
Popular

511
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,240
The population

512
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:04,576
You better believe me

513
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,208
Shut up

514
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,024
I mean it'll be recorded because it's in

515
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,560
The consulate

516
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:24,544
I can imagine

517
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,312
Still exist

518
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,848
You betcha

519
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,664
That seems like security

520
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,456
Then beyond that

521
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
Alex

522
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,464
Who are you man you agree with Sean what are you doing

523
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,352
I'm always against

524
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,376
Iprint

525
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,448
The idea of us other countries government

526
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
Prorock

527
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:59,360
You straight up roller on me hates the idea that these neocon Tsar demonized

528
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,664
The Iranian government

529
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,480
I don't I don't know I don't I don't know

530
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,504
I don't I know that

531
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,064
But it seems very difficult

532
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,832
For me

533
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:12,416
Believe that he's changed so much that he's now for

534
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,208
Some sort of an intervention

535
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,000
In order to prompt receive

536
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,816
So far outside of Alex Jones

537
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,096
Vocabulary

538
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,376
It seemed so far outside

539
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
His principal

540
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,680
This is just

541
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,496
Your gun-for-hire you're not even you don't even stand for

542
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288
There are no prints

543
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
I suppose there is not

544
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
Post

545
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,176
2050

546
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,736
Team whenever remodel before that

547
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,296
It's it it stopped being about Eddie

548
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
Policy

549
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,368
Strategy

550
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,392
And it just became

551
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,440
The Liberals don't

552
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
Alex playing

553
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:52,864
Information about

554
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,656
Situation in Saudi Arabia from

555
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,424
It makes

556
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,216
A surprise you that it's not research

557
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,496
Bazooka

558
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,336
21st president

559
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,920
MSNBC

560
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,224
Saudi Arabia

561
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:21,024
What's really going on

562
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,328
Deduction my dear Watson

563
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,120
No that's not good

564
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,544
That's bad

565
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,848
That's real bad

566
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,664
Eliminate all other

567
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,712
Don't

568
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:44,576
Stop trying to defend those possibilities

569
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,624
Batshit

570
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
False pretense

571
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,696
Is like that the premises

572
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,744
To be the BNN always lies

573
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,584
As he doesn't believe that Saudi Arabia has a motive

574
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,352
Which

575
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,632
I mean I'm fine

576
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,912
Believing it's possible that

577
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,728
But if you make premise

578
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,288
Saudi Arabia doesn't have a motive

579
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
Your argument is bogus

580
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,408
To begin with like from the jump your screw

581
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,712
Whatever conclusion you come to is meaningless

582
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,528
This is not how detective reasoning work

583
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,832
In a like a productive

584
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
Do you're just playing dumb

585
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,440
Distraction

586
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,976
Here's to Falls things

587
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,048
Lead to whatever I want you to believe

588
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,376
Not good

589
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,424
Here's the thing

590
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,960
A101 logic

591
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:35,776
You thinking

592
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,568
We're getting booted out of freshman

593
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,104
At a junior college

594
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,384
Junior College logic

595
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,688
Embarrassed

596
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,456
I know about this

597
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,248
It's

598
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,528
Start with the result

599
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,856
Right right right

600
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:53,952
Supported in a flimsy way

601
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,256
Women are made of abortion

602
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,280
That's true

603
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,840
I've heard that

604
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,168
Truth it's not about

605
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:03,936
The news

606
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,984
You know what it's about we all know what it

607
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,544

Not sure why we have ourselves

That makes sense

626
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,864

Coronavirus

634
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,576
For a very very long time

635
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,440
Fitbit is it matters to the world

636
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,720
He's just dismissing it with

637
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,744
Terrible argument

638
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,768
The end

639
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,816
Just lying about the structure of his argument

640
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,096
And then the other stuff that

641
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,144
Profoundly.

642
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
Crazy

643
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
Fight

644
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
Before we get there

645
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,032
We have to learn about how the global

646
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,616
They don't want you to use

647
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,968
But there is something that you want to use

648
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,760
A Mite surprised

649
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:32,672
Welcome back in the middle of the meme Revolution

650
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:39,328
To make everyone Chicago

651
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,608
Going through their Congress

652
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,336
2

653
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:54,688
Did you just find a Socialist Party

654
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,576
The Fabian socialists in England

655
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,120
Serbian Awareness on his part that he's late to the meme party

656
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,192
And he's been resisting

657
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,472
To fully embrace

658
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,240
Sing the

659
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,288
BB stupid right-wing meme

660
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
Goddamn

661
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
Fitbit goes on

662
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,152
He's coming in as if he's like

663
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,480
Oh I know about this all along is part of the Fabian socialist

664
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,784
Alright buddy

665
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,320
Alright

666
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,952
So I think what Alex is operating off of is

667
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,232
About the temp

668
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,256
Fifi meme thing

669
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:45,888
And maybe it got boards used to talk about

670
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,216
I'm basing that on the side in the middle of this episode he plays

671
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,240
Paul Joseph Watson

672
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,264
Entire report

673
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,312
I am sorry about this

674
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,128
But I do need to play yusupov Joseph Watson

675
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:01,248
Listening to him because his style is so

676
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
Obnoxious

677
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:03,808
Snarky

678
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,464
It's just full of fast edits and insulting voices that he does in order to characterize

679
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,280
Please be like

680
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
This

681
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:18,144
So just to get two people on board a little bit

682
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,728
Cut this clip is sort of indication of his style

683
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:26,336
Just so you can get a little bit of a flavor for what you'll be sitting through a few

684
00:35:55,008 --> 00:36:00,128
That's pretty indicative of his thing he does these voices that are characterized by

685
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,408
People he's lampooning

686
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,968
You'll generally use tweet

687
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:08,064
It's from people that he doesn't like and then doesn't insulting voice

688
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,624
Is robotic usually but that's trying

689
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,904
You get the idea of like all these

690
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,440
People are saying the same thing

691
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,744
They're all otamatone

692
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,424
Lame

693
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
Yeah it's pretty late

694
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,872
A bummer how lame that is

695
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,688
You're supposed to be on the Vanguard

696
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,968
Conservative right now

697
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,528
Be better than

698
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,928
Rockstar of the

699
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,976
There's a new punk rock is he likes

700
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:47,744
To say

701
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,072
Sure you'd be a little bit more

702
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,680
More interesting than just like using other people's tweets

703
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:59,776
I've proved that everyone that he's against believe the same thing

704
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,312
Like he brings up like a crash

705
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,336
Brothers

706
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:11,552
I don't know I don't know anybody who agrees with that

707
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,576
Critics

708
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,392
Huey Lewis and the News where the next big thing in Concord

709
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,608
Huey Lewis and the News

710
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,936
He's just trying to take

711
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,240
Alex is like

712
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,032
Rob Reiner speaker

713
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:32,800
Sure

714
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
That's undercooked

715
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,784
Paul Joseph Watson admits

716
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,832
He really enjoys about me

717
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:50,464
Disconnect

718
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:57,632
Is it pathetic

719
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,272
So I like bullying people

720
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,600
And I engage in playground insult

721
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:22,976
Enjoy yourself talk about you

722
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
Quick cut

723
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,560
You can always

724
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:31,424
How heavily ever imagined your job

725
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,752
That you can't speak coherently for I don't know

726
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,776
4 seconds

727
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:40,128
Like we do edit the show in terms of like sometimes we have to go to the bathroom

728
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,408
Or sometimes

729
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,944
Flips out

730
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,480
Looks like an inside joke

731
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,248
Think like that

732
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,296
Couple things out

733
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,576
Every now and again

734
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,856
But generally were sitting

735
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,392
You're talkin straight through

736
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,928
For two and a half hours

737
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,464
Bill we do not

738
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:57,280
Embarrassing to look at Paul Joseph Watson

739
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,560
Fantasy Lake

740
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,096
Why why'd you cut there

741
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,888
Those almost the middle of a word

742
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,472
The least exciting

743
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
Some sort of Longwood

744
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,616
Everybody

745
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,224
You know it's already liking but remembering Birdman whenever they was that

746
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,552
Interminable long take where they're walking and it

747
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,832
It's filled with drama

748
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,392
And eventually

749
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,208
With the drums playing behind

750
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,744
Attention attention

751
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,768
Exploded

752
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:32,096
Orange 18 million cuts

753
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,144
Between every single f******

754
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,192
No one remembers rope

755
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:38,240
For a reason

756
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,264
Now

757
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,080
Call Joseph Watson document

758
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:46,176
Use it to hang yourself movie

759
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,576
Nothing to do with police

760
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,368
Disconnect

761
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,648
I couldn't ignore

762
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,720
It's because it's go to the central thesis of his

763
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,488
Video

764
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,792
And it speaks to what Alex is trying to pitch

765
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,352

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,192
Clearly using Paul is a source

768
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,008
Material for his own reporting

769
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,312
In this clip Paul Joseph Watson

770
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,408
It's making the argument of why people on the left

771
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,688
Are opposed

772
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
2

773
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,480
These empty

774
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
DC mean

775
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:26,624
And one of the arguments that I've seen posted in articles and stuff like that is that it's dehumanize

776
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:27,904
Anyway

777
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,696
She could what you do if you put a blank

778
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,232
Face over someone else's

779
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,000
Space

780
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,560
And it's like to say all of you are the same

781
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:38,656
I think Ike mean I understand where people are coming from I don't think I don't care

782
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,192
I don't I don't think

783
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,728
I don't think that

784
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:44,800
Schoolboy Q

785
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,080
Shirts

786
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,176
Is is necessarily a real

787
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,200
Reason to

788
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,480
Be against

789
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,016
Leave memes I think that

790
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:57,088
The target is harassment aspect of it is much more salad

791
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,904
But Paul Joseph Watson's version of ateez

792
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,720
They hate this because they know

793
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:03,744
That the left

794
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,768
Can't meme

795
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
But the right

796
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,584
Baby we can meme

797
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:12,192
Edit doing so in making this argument he cites something

798
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,864
Here's the issue with this

799
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,728
No We Came Upon This

800
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,264
Because it's very Damonte

801
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:48,544
Super horn

802
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:52,895
Poachers bottom is misusing the study from the University College of London

803
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,663
Because of course

804
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,455
He didn't click the link

805
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:59,807
In the BBC article that he's summarizing or in the vice write-up

806
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:02,111
That he is saying characterizes

807
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:02,879
Is the study

808
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:08,767
Do you really have no idea what even says past the characterization the pole in the Donald are effective distribution

809
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,303
That's the only

810
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,095
Messenger

811
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,119
F****** read the study

812
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,679
If he had some information

813
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,959
It doesn't really help his argument

814
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,983
Cemetery much at all

815
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,775
First from the study

816
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,079
Our work focuses on for Webb community

817
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:25,407
Twitter Reddit Politically Incorrect board

818
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:31,807
Be even later safe note that we exclude mainstream communities like the rest of Reddit other than the

819
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,831
Donald subreddit

820
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:36,159
Twitter Hazard mangle

821
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,183
Fringe web

822
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
Communities

823
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,767
The only looked at four places in the study

824
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,839
The concluding They Come Away with his at the Donald Borden

825
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
On Reddit

826
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,631
Import

827
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,655
Give me platform

828
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:50,495
Really the conclusion more accurately state is Gavin Ghost Town

829
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,823
A Twitter mostly exists to the secondhand store or Thrift Shop of

830
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:57,151
That's really the conclusion that you should take away from this

831
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,735
Now

832
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,503
Second

833
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,295
Paul Joseph Watson and read this study

834
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,879
You would have found that one of the main takeaways for the from the study was

835
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:10,975
Communities within 4chan Reddit in Gabby's memes 2

836
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,255
Are hateful and racist

837
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,583
Among the most popular clusters of meme

838
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,863
We find variance of

839
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,655
The anti-semitic happy Merchant

840
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,983
They say in the study that means that these communities are used to

841
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,263
Express racist

842
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:27,359
Quote evidence from the popularity of the anti-semitic happy merch

843
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:31,199
Which depicts a greedy and manipulative stereotypical caricature of a

844
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:35,551
Verjus contrast Twitter

845
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:39,903
Play Heartless neutral meme which are rarely used in hateful Kant

846
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,487
One of the big takeaways again from the study was quote

847
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:48,863
Capture hateful and racist meme at a higher rate than mainstream communities

848
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:52,447
A considerable number of somatic and pro-nazi

849
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,215
Fosters

850
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:58,847
This trend is steady overtime for for chance pool board but ramping up recently with gap

851
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:02,431
Quote there are several takeaways from our measurements of

852
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:09,087
We show that Paul is generally speaking the most influential disseminator of memes in terms of raw influence

853
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,951
In particular it's more influential in spreading

854
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,279
Relatedly Paul has generally more influence

855
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,839
Terms of spreading political memes than other communities

856
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,143
What the study ultimately found

857
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,679
Is the pole is the most

858
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:26,495
Influential meme Source in the realm of their state

859
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,543
But they were woefully inefficient

860
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,335
Which is to say that they post

861
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,359
Tons of memes there

862
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,663
And a lot of them don't catch on but the ones

863
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,199
You are really popular

864
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,479
In contrast

865
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:39,295
The Donald subreddit has a way higher than expected

866
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,319
Efficiency

867
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,111
Which is honestly what you shouldn't

868
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:46,975
That's the prettiest large just base in little more than a means of weaponizing infer

869
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,535
Information and misinformation in a coordinated way

870
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,071
Exactly

871
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,887
Define Alone number of unique meme

872
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,423
Each one push

873
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,191
Any unique

874
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,215
Unified

875
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,239
Focused way

876
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,031
Paul Joseph Watson

877
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,823
What to use this study

878
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:08,223
Two things that he's a starting namely that it demonstrates why Liberals are afraid of me because his side is better attempt

879
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:12,319
He needs to accept this entire study

880
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,111
Not just a piece of it feel good to him

881
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:20,511
I know that would be inconvenient it to the middle of this darky rant. To just stop and point out that a large part of

882
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,583
Dissemination

883
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,119
And how the very places

884
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,935
The framing is being on his side or full to the gills

885
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,495
With anti-semetic characterizations of

886
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,543
And more less never-ending racism

887
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:38,943
Cuz that would be very difficult to put in with your

888
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,967
Is there a weird

889
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,735
But he likes

890
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,551
The quote

891
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,927
Bright everybody just assumes

892
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,951
Right now

893
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,535
I've explained to you what that study really says

894
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,583
And why it's not really

895
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,399
Any evidence that Liberals are afraid of me

896
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,935
Is Egypt again

897
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,959
Just studied

898
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:01,983
4

899
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,263
Fringe places

900
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,543
You going to throw away

901
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,895
Then

902
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,919
Demonstrate

903
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:12,479
Ain't nobody on Gap but people there are

904
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,319
Paul Joseph Watson is coming in

905
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:19,391
You know with this like I read an article on Vice

906
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:23,487
Said this one to act like I know everything about it

907
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,023
Just

908
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,327
A minute later it is Special Report

909
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,351
Paul Joseph Watson

910
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:33,215
Serious cultural engagement

911
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,847
Where is the consumption

912
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,975
Florida Blue

913
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,583
I mean

914
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,863
So

915
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,655
Is that the right

916
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,423
Is so

917
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,191
Great

918
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,567
His argument

919
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,847
Is those that

920
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,383
Let's just say

921
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,919
Consume memes

922
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,503
Easily digestible passive pieces of culture

923
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,183
With political opinion

924
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,975
Just a modicum of research

925
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:27,999
Help you

926
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,535
You need to go says

927
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
Once Bitten

928
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,655
Vice article and then decided

929
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:42,591
What are we doing research study dickweed I know it's hard but like

930
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:48,479
If you're going to end up exactly

931
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:55,135
I feel invigorated by glycol I did read that study

932
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,439
Slightly different things or what

933
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:01,023
I just hate I hate it the in the same breath

934
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,935
I have such a robust

935
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,727
The mark political beliefs

936
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
This is what I do

937
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,775
Research into this.

938
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,311
In the same sentence

939
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,383
Manifesting not doing research

940
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:19,711
And then he ends with a false characterization of

941
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,735
People

942
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,551
Nazi

943
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,599
Playground

944
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,159
I'm not triggered by this I just think it's

945
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,695
You don't I mean

946
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,023
I think generally speaking is best not to talk about

947
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,815
About him cuz it's it's a game that you want

948
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,839
Yeah

949
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,119
I just

950
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
It's fun

951
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:41,215
It's fun went dumb people act

952
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,823
Bit of Silence

953
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:46,847
Or pause

954
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,919
Proves far more effective

955
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,223
Or perhaps

956
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,503
More interesting

957
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,063
Jumpcut so there is

958
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,599
Is literally no space

959
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,367
Between the end of

960
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,647
Any

961
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:05,279
Freakish and disconcerting

962
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,583
Because if you pause too thin

963
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,607
For a single second

964
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,375
Can you be like

965
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,143
Oh that's f******

966
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,727
Much harder to edit

967
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,495
His stuff

968
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,519
You like those

969
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:19,871
Vic Berger would have a much harder time using Paul Joseph Watson

970
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,151
Footage

971
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,431
Oh yeah

972
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,759
Make precise chops

973
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,783
In order to get

974
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:27,807
Clips

975
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,575
You would want

976
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,855
Here is it

977
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,135
Here's what he saying

978
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,439
Because he's talking to Michael a minute

979
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,719
And there are no brakes

980
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,023
In the dialogue

981
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:44,191
What is Eddie's job is terrible

982
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,751
He's terrible at his job if his job is journalist

983
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,287
He's not bad at his job is

984
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,567
Distraction

985
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,359
Rodeo clown propaganda

986
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,383
He's pretty good at

987
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,735
Within

988
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,783
If

989
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,807
You consider

990
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,087
Like if you look into

991
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:01,855
What he saying

992
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,879
Yes

993
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:07,743
Gambit the gamble is always knowing

994
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,047
Terrible but Home Improvement was a very pop

995
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:15,167
Snarky comment about that about how like

996
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:18,239
But not about Home Improvement How I Met Your Mother

997
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,663
So Alex and the next

998
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,431
He's back

999
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:29,503
Use related to check 11

1000
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,271

1001
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,295
2mp

1002
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,063
Casey meme

1003
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,599
But then he also relate

1004
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:37,439
Commercial from 34 years ago

1005
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:42,815
The one where the lady throat Hammer throws into the big television

1006
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,839
I don't remember

1007
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,167
I wasn't watching 8 hours ago

1008
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,191
Just

1009
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,727
But that was from the Olympics

1010
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,775
This is Alex

1011
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:05,599
No

1012
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,303
Okay

1013
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,071
You need to call

1014
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,775
Need

1015
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,871
It's a little

1016
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,919
It's a little unnerving

1017
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,223
But how much potential he thinks

1018
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,015
Cuz you know what's funny

1019
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:34,783
About this

1020
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,063
This is like when we

1021
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:36,831
We go back

1022
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,111
To 2009

1023
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,671

All this is going to be the next month

1028
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,383
That's what this is but just did

1029
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,663
It's like in present day

1030
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,943
I live in igloos

1031
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,247
I don't even know why anyone

1032
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,271
UCare this is

1033
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:07,807
Cotton candy

1034
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:10,623
It doesn't feel you up it's not good for you

1035
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,391
It's

1036
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,671
It's just there

1037
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:19,071
For the right-wing find a way to make that

1038
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:23,423
Cat

1039
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:31,103
Prices on that Call of Duty

1040
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,367
Guys are terrible

1041
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:46,207
Regis.

1042
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:46,975
A little bit about

1043
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,743
His best friend

1044
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,023
Donald Trump

1045
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,047
He wants to tell you that

1046
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,071
He's basically Jesus

1047
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,375
You sacrificed so much for you

1048
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,655
If you don't even

1049
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,423
You don't even care

1050
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,447
Really

1051
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:03,359
2% control

1052
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:09,247

Enemy

1054
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:17,183
Withstand all the peer pressure the two billion dollars he's lost his fortune lawsuit

1055
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,231
Golf Course deals Boston

1056
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:24,351
Us

1057
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,143
I love this country

1058
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,215
Show me to be president be present but I got to do it

1059
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:31,263
I just can't watch him

1060
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,543
Watch the country

1061
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,591
Everybody Skrillex

1062
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,895
A good map

1063
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:39,967
Scotland

1064
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,439
The point is is that

1065
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,719
Trump

1066
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,815
Charity never tells anybody

1067
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,375
Liver kidneys

1068
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,543
Aspen

1069
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,103
You need to stop listening to Rochester

1070
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,967
Charity was

1071
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:18,367
Famous for I thought it was giving away so much money to charity

1072
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:22,463
30 was out to him and his family

1073
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:29,119
You know I don't I don't

1074
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:32,703
I don't have concrete proof that he doesn't help

1075
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,239
Videos of employee

1076
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,263
You bought it

1077
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,847
I don't know that

1078
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:43,711
To be true or not but I do know other things that are true such as him not paying it

1079
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,735
Contractors

1080
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,503
Consistently

1081
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,623
Like if you have somebody who's such a

1082
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,903
Generous

1083
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,927
Giving person

1084
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:57,023
I bet they would buy an employer house cuz they're having a bad time

1085
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:57,791
Something like that

1086
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:03,935
Generally wouldn't

1087
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:11,615
I'm not sure what he says the tightest people alive I'm not sure if

1088
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:16,223
Old timey slang for drunk

1089
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,551
That's old British slang for drunk

1090
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,879
I don't know I don't know if that's the case

1091
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:24,671
Probably

1092
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,791
Shoehorn

1093
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,559
No idea

1094
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,863
Is Mom now Alex

1095
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:37,727
New York Times

1096
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:45,151
New York

1097
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,431
That was up

1098
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:49,759
What's up

1099
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:50,783
His father

1100
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:51,807
Good

1101
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:58,463
So I am fine from

1102
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,303
Violent

1103
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,863
I can't find any evidence

1104
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,959
The Fred Trump ever beat up a bunch of Communists in New York during the skirmish

1105
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,727
However

1106
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:13,055
On the Border

1107
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,335
Cool Cuts Clan

1108
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,639
And Italian fascist sympathizers

1109
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,663
There's which led to the deaths

1110
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,943
The Italian

1111
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,735
Why were they later

1112
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:25,855
Later in Queens a little at least members marched

1113
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,135
Memorial Day week

1114
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,671
Pissed off a bunch of folks

1115
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,951
Another brawl Stars

1116
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,511
And the aftermath

1117
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,047
One of these men was Fred

1118
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,071
Donald Trump's dad

1119
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:40,703
It's unclear based on all public records exactly what he was up to but the bra when she was in was between

1120
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:44,287
Representing Protestant nativist outrage

1121
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,079
And the Catholics representing

1122
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:50,687
The group that the Protestants felt they were being oppressed

1123
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,015
Trump

1124
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,343
The other six men who were arrested were all claimed

1125
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:06,047
The argument has been made that the other six men were charged where is Fred was released at Dusty must be

1126
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:12,959
Maybe the pace equally likely he was the only one

1127
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:19,359
To be rich New York

1128
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:22,175
A lot of people have

1129
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:24,735
I tried to make the argument that before this

1130
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,295
Fred Trump

1131
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:28,831
And that's not true

1132
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,879
At this point he'd already built over

1133
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,671
20 homes or houses

1134
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,695
In Queens

1135
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,719
I'm sold

1136
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,767
So he already had a pretty

1137
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,047
Good amount of land

1138
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:41,375
At his disposal

1139
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,911
He wasn't the billionaire

1140
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,703
That he would end up

1141
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:47,007
Multi multi-millionaire

1142
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,031
20 loaded

1143
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,567
To bribe

1144
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:52,127
Notoriously corrupt

1145
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:55,711
New York judicial system in the 20

1146
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
Cheap

1147
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:00,319
Notoriously corrupt

1148
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,415
You didn't you didn't you needed

1149
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,463
Slightly upper-middle-class

1150
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:12,863
Did you did you just a good bright now ask for comment about this Donald Trump with less than subtle

1151
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:18,751
He has nothing nothing to do with this never happened this is nonsense and it never happened

1152
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:25,151
This never happened

1153
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:40,255
Little over-the-top all night denial

1154
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:45,887
Anything is possible here except for the idea that

1155
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:48,191
Did Fred Trump beat up

1156
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,287
There are some reports that I can find I'm not sure

1157
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,823
Exactly how solid

1158
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,103
These are of

1159
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,639
But

1160
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,663
Some reports

1161
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,431
Contemporaneous

1162
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:01,759
Worrying Clan Ricky

1163
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:05,599
I don't know if that's the case it's not from the New York Times article

1164
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:07,391
But there's some indications

1165
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,439
Costume

1166
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,767

30 showmax to cover today it is just unbelievable

1172
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,575
We have

1173
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,879
Honduras and Guatemala

1174
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,439
Aftermath

1175
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,231
Launching

1176
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:54,239
Sterilized

1177
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:57,311
And it's been going on for years about a body

1178
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:06,271
Humanitarian

1179
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:08,831
Promise

1180
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,623
This morning

1181
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:12,159
With an H

1182
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,719
Honduras and Guatemala responded

1183
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,791
Migrant Caravan after Trump

1184
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,863
Associated Press

1185
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,679
Diplomatically

1186
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,471
Confront playing a foot down

1187
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:28,287
I notice you got borders

1188
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,591
Story that Alex is trying to

1189
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:33,919
The page that Trump threaten to stop all foreign aid

1190
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,943
To Honduras

1191
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,479
Guatemala

1192
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,783
Caravan

1193
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,367
Presenting a story is being cut and dry

1194
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,927
We're trying to come up from Hunter

1195
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,463
Trump threatened to cut for

1196
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,511
To the country and their president

1197
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:51,839
The couch across the Bold americafirst machismo

1198
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:56,959
No no no I don't need to hear these Dan obviously correct we can move on

1199
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,519
Trumpism

1200
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:06,175
The first problem really been to the will of trump

1201
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,967
Mexico is

1202
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:11,295
Deport the refugees in the Honduran Caravan should they end up

1203
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,063
In the Border

1204
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:15,903
The most Honduras Ministry

1205
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:19,487
Maybe people

1206
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,255
Making false

1207
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,559
Promises to the refugees that they'll be able to speak

1208
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,887
And that they should not let themselves be

1209
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:30,239
Movement that is so there is obviously political

1210
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,799
And upside is meant to upset governability

1211
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:33,567
Stability

1212
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,431
Just possibly me and you ask yourself

1213
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,455
I think it's about Whitey

1214
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,479
I was just

1215
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,503
No

1216
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,783
Read the rest of this associate

1217
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,831
First article but if he

1218
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,135
Read the article.

1219
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,415
Beauty quote

1220
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:53,791
Fernando Andrew leader of the governing National party planned opponents of Honduras president

1221
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,071
Behind the migrant Exodus

1222
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:58,655
It's a strategy plan opposition

1223
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,215
Familiar rhetoric

1224
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:05,823
American

1225
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,639
Maybe not so popular presidents

1226
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:11,455
Who is gotten into power

1227
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:13,247
The Association of America

1228
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,527
States have been like

1229
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:17,087
There's a lot of irregularities with your election

1230
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,879
And now he's trying to

1231
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,647
Demonized

1232
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:20,671
How to get out of the country

1233
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,511
Soros is behind it

1234
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:30,143
The second issue here is that the threat of cutting off

1235
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:30,911
To do anything

1236
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:35,263
It was threatening to literally close the southern US border and send in the military

1237
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,823
Do that

1238
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,615
In the strongest terms X

1239
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:42,687
Mexico Mexico to stop this onslaught

1240
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:46,271
And if possible to do so I will call up the US Military

1241
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,039
Adult apps

1242
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,831
Close our Southern border

1243
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,367
It refers to ref

1244
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:51,647
Trying to

1245
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,927
Steve their lives

1246
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,207
Buy Coming to America

1247
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,231
And on

1248
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,583
It should go without saying but according to Alex

1249
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,399
Belief about the president

1250
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:04,191
TV's RV operating to mess

1251
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:06,495
Alex to be livid about that tweet

1252
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:09,055
Unless you consider this not a domestic action

1253
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:12,895
Which advocated war with Mexico

1254
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,919
And I guess Honduras

1255
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:17,503
Save it

1256
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,039
Castaic Lake

1257
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,391
On the Border

1258
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:30,047
Put in 10 to the four corners

1259
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,071
All the states of the same time

1260
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:31,839
Okay

1261
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:37,215
About 4

1262
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,751
He said he would quote

1263
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,799
Countries with

1264
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:43,615
Which seemed to have almost no control over their population

1265
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:46,431
The thing that Alex Jones yells about the most

1266
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:49,503
The biggest fear that he's ever had the idea of a government having

1267
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:51,551
All over their population

1268
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:54,879
AT&T Oculus comment from a politician he doesn't like

1269
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,671
Is magically transformed it approved

1270
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,695
The government is trying to

1271
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,463
Control him

1272
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,743
Weatherby B

1273
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,511
Precious gun

1274
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,535
Or just by making a

1275
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,327
Feel bad but he's accused bigot

1276
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,863
In reality

1277
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,911
This is largely a replaying out of attention

1278
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:07,935
What happened back in April

1279
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,727
When a group of about

1280
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:15,103
That people walked up from Central America to the border of an annual symbolic Proto

1281
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:17,151
As well as an attempt for many of them

1282
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,175
The Border

1283
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:19,711
Intentionally turn themselves in

1284
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:20,735
Libra silence

1285
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,039
Trump's our report about this on Stockton

1286
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,319
Immediately

1287
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,855
Tweeted out that this was an invasion

1288
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,159
I threatened to send in the National Guard

1289
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,951
According to the guardian

1290
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,999
Cut off

1291
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,047
Earlier

1292
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,583
Both threats were ultimately

1293
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,119
But

1294
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,679
In April Mexico did not stop the rest

1295
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,447
Fugees from reaching

1296
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:43,263
In the Border

1297
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,055
IRadio music

1298
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:50,175
We were afraid but the Mexican Government responded humanely insensibly

1299
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,455
We didn't expect that

1300
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,503
We thought they would came to Trump but they didn't

1301
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:58,111
One of the members of April Caravan was Chanel Smith twenty-seven-year-old trans woman

1302
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:58,879
From Honduras

1303
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,927
Discrimination

1304
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:08,351
It said gangs were approaching the trans population to Peddle drugs

1305
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,911
She refused and was told to change her mind Within

1306
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,679
Open 24 hours

1307
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:12,959
Instead she West

1308
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:16,543
Another was Jocelyn Amador 22

1309
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:21,151
Who operated a small business selling mobile phone accessories in San Pedro Sula Honduras

1310
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:24,735
But the also had to flee after being Unable to pair of

1311
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:26,271
$125

1312
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,039
Extortion payment

1313
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:30,111
Another was Isabel Niro Rodriguez

1314
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:32,671
2 years old who also played after extortion

1315
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:36,255
She tried to open a bakery in El Salvador but again

1316
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,279
Hundred dollars

1317
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,815
As a fee for starting operation

1318
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,375
I threatened to kill her grandson if she didn't pay

1319
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:47,263
The Mexican Government respond to their destination

1320
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,055
Sending them back to is very likely

1321
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:54,943
In June 2018 the Department of Homeland Security reported that from April 19th

1322
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:55,711
To May 30th

1323
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:56,991
At least 90

1324
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:00,319
895 children were separated from their families at the border

1325
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,855
Navigation

1326
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,671
To come out about rampant physical and sexual abuse of detainees

1327
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:09,535
Medication

1328
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:16,191
Administration to be considering implementing the family separation policy since his literal Inauguration Day

1329
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:20,031
Put a policy in action

1330
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,311
The Mexican government

1331
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,615
For not stopping the refugee Caravan in the spring

1332
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,383
2018

1333
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,687
This isn't just me make me lose conjecture

1334
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,223
The guardian even makes the connection

1335
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:28,991
Very clearly

1336
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:32,831
The Mexican Government allowed hundreds of migrants mainly Hunter and

1337
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,111
To reach the US border

1338
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,135
Irrigating truck

1339
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,951
Initiated the family separation policy soon after

1340
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:41,535
Beyond the human tragedy

1341
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:47,423
Artifact on Refugee

1342
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,263
Further analysis

1343
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:53,823
The cost of housing people who were detained under Trump separate

1344
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,871
Implants averages out to about

1345
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:58,431
$775 per person per day

1346
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,199
As opposed to

1347
01:06:59,455 --> 01:06:59,967
250

1348
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,247
$6 per person

1349
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,783
A day under the

1350
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,575
In order to compensate for this

1351
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,367
Cost of being cruel to

1352
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,903
Almost inhuman level

1353
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:10,975
The Trump Administration announced a plan to shift more than

1354
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,255
60 million dollars

1355
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:14,303
There was supposed to go to HIV and cancer

1356
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,583
Recovering cost

1357
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,351
The separating

1358
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,887
If I had to guess

1359
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,655
I would say that

1360
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,239
Doesn't care about other people

1361
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,775
But because who knows

1362
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:24,799
Holographic

1363
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,567
Med badge

1364
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,103
The Cure All diseases

1365
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,383
Are right around the corner

1366
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:30,687
And spending any money trying to cure cancer

1367
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,575
F*** all that noise

1368
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,975
I don't know I don't know how to put a button

1369
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,767
No this is all is all bad

1370
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,071
Sitz bath

1371
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:49,887
What's sex

1372
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,471
From the show first

1373
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:57,823
Ouch

1374
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,359
Stop recording for a little bit

1375
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,895
Take a breather on that

1376
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:06,783
Alex b-monster about

1377
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,575
Very predictable things

1378
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,367
I think that we've seen

1379
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,183
Play out already even the last

1380
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,487
You know it's really tough

1381
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,047
Experience that without having

1382
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,583
Some sort of visceral reaction

1383
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,119
That's wrong at all

1384
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,935
I did not predict how

1385
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:27,775
Necessarily

1386
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,103
Propaganda

1387
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:37,503
Will you swim in this all very viscerally affected

1388
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,271
Viator

1389
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,551
Is anybody else

1390
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,575
At the same time

1391
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,647
I didn't say that

1392
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:46,719
The immediate reaction but

1393
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,255
Whatever because

1394
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:50,559
I mean I'm not saying you're succumbing to

1395
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,375
Is the judgment

1396
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,679
When you have people who outwardly

1397
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:58,239
You talk and relishing the idea of

1398
01:08:58,751 --> 01:08:59,263
Bullying

1399
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,287
I'm in trying to make

1400
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,335
People angry for fun and Sport

1401
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,895
Whenever you spend

1402
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,175
12

1403
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:08,991
14 hours a day studying

1404
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,783
Andron digging into

1405
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,343
The methods of their propaganda

1406
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:15,135
It gets to a point where for me

1407
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:15,903
Especially

1408
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,463
I realize that that's part of their game

1409
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,487
And I'm

1410
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,255
So

1411
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:21,535
Averse

1412
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,095
Them getting what they want

1413
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:26,911
For everybody

1414
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:27,935
The first time that

1415
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:31,263
That's true

1416
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:33,055
Initial reaction

1417
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,359
You are doing this

1418
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,639
Listen to different way where is it

1419
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:37,663
Is all just hitting

1420
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:47,391
If you have enough desk

1421
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,159
Jordan

1422
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,951
What's good news is

1423
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:50,719
Look

1424
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,255
Bleak

1425
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:56,607
Real bad but there's one Shining Light Of Hope

1426
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,655
And that is that Alex has a plan

1427
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:00,447
Infowars.com

1428
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:02,239
Betty's very bad

1429
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:07,871
Everyone just keep making

1430
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:10,431
We're going to create a whole section for me

1431
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:18,367
Like some sort of

1432
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:25,535
Racist racist

1433
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,031
Because it's means that threaten the most

1434
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:39,103
Superfast

1435
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,343
I do not know why

1436
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:52,927
Online I do know why the first thing he comes up with

1437
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:59,327
Not racist whatever

1438
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,863
One be racist meme

1439
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:04,191
Is well-served on the internet

1440
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:09,055
There's not a need for another one already

1441
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,103
Swimming pools going to fail on that level

1442
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,127
Second

1443
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:12,895

Plenty of racism already

1448
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:22,623
Yeah you don't need plenty of Christianity plenty racism

1449
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:25,183
No not at all

1450
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:27,743
Already accomplished

1451
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:28,511
This is like

1452
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:31,071
Just discovered this is like your ex

1453
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:36,447
Explaining to Grandpa why there are too many browser extension

1454
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:42,847
It would be like you

01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:43,871
Be like damn

1456
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,943
I got to tell you about that going

1457
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:49,503
If you're telling me today

1458
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:55,903
Exciting technology on the ground

1459
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:56,927
It's f****** cat

1460
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,463
They can play a goddamn

1461
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,231
Piano

1462
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,279
I don't even know how

1463
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:06,143
Not as many points there

1464
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:08,191
It's just a little katsuto keyboard

1465
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,471
Jordan Jordan

1466
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,007
If you heard of Starbucks

1467
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,287
We got to get some

1468
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,055
Comstock

1469
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,503
So what is a Macintosh

1470
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:23,295
Like what is a Macan

1471
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:24,831
It's looking at

1472
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:33,279
The kind of apple that's why Apple named

1473
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,559
Clever

1474
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:40,703
Alex

1475
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,983
That works out there

1476
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:47,871
No

1477
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:51,455
Facebook

1478
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:53,503
Wannabe band

1479
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,343
So that's what he says

1480
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:00,159
Now immediately after that

1481
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:03,231
Show eyeshadow

1482
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:16,799
Miserable just don't go further that you don't let them go

1483
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:22,687
Govern

1484
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,711
What Akshay

1485
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:32,671
I'm going to go on there and say what I really feel

1486
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:37,535
Before the election

1487
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:52,383
That really sounds like he's like I'm going to get them to Vera me which is intentionally getting yourself.

1488
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,967
Because I'm saying things that I hourly or would have stopped myself from

1489
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,527
I don't know either

1490
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:04,927
Cool out

1491
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:12,351
There's a piece of that and then there's also duck opposition

1492
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:16,447
Defiance human resource director

1493
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:20,543
Or to the idea

1494
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,847
So I'll be the first one in the band pool

1495
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,383
Or whatever

1496
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,407
Say flagrant

1497
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,431
Misogynist

1498
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,199
Or antisocial

1499
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,479
Employees

1500
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:31,551
Thank you Dad

1501
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:38,207
Iraq

1502
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:50,751
This whole episode

1503
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:51,519
I should be

1504
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,055
I turned it off

1505
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,335
Because

1506
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:56,639
Gino's in weave

1507
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,431
We've gone down these roads of

1508
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:00,991
Outer bulshit smacking like

1509
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,807
Just eat human on

1510
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:09,183
Most of the time that we quit so we haven't played our all him talkin about this me

1511
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,487
Over the moon with this mean

1512
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,279
Then

1513
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,047
I don't understand

1514
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,887
It's a good to me

1515
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:21,727
It's really my baby in socialist

1516
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:28,383
Ian

1517
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,919
Because it restricts speech

1518
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,711
You need you need memes

1519

1521
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:39,391
Then he gets a little bit of

1522
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:41,183
Hatred for Beto

1523
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:41,951
The Rock

1524
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:44,767
Because Alex

1525
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,303
Super into Ted Cruz

1526
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,863
I would remind everyone that he was

1527
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:55,263
What Donald Trump primaries

1528
01:15:55,519 --> 01:16:01,663
Lion

1529

1530
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,527
Doesn't win

1531
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,551
His election

1532
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,575
And I take the

1533
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,855
Two pieces of this one

1534
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:12,671

1536
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,047
Reading a lot about

Pandora support

1538
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:23,423

1539
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:30,847
Need

1540
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,895

01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,807
But

1546
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:12,831
He would be

1547
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:17,951
Text Michelle

1548
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,559

Central Casting pugs

Look like slime pieces of crap

1554
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:50,975
But you wouldn't let children

1555
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,023
Abort your children

1556
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:56,095
Kill yourself

Terrible if he called them pet

1560
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:14,271
He can say they want to kill your children before their

1561
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,551
Sure

1562
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,183
Pedophiles

Irresponsible

1573
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,783
It's loathsome

1574
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,831
I just listen to stuff like that and I'm like

1575
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:52,159
That's the kind of thing I don't know I got better

1576
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:56,511
Call them pedophiles

1577

01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:11,871
Possibly

1582
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:16,479
Maybe I'm fishing in a dry well by really trying.

1583
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:18,527
Understand Alex Jones

1584
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,551

I don't know why this guy's

1589
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:29,023
Even doing the showing this is not

1590
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,863
Add in the added layer 2 of like

1591
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,143
Did you nasty stuff

01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:55,391
1138

1597
01:19:55,903 --> 01:20:02,047
Point the finger at Paul Joseph Watson for a snarkily saying everyone should do research when he hasn't done any himself

1598
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,095
View about the

1599
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,119

Caravan stuff

1601
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,935
We can do that

1602
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:08,703
Sure

1603
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,983
But the rest

1604
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,031

Waterrower

1617
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,448
That was not good

1618
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:21,664
California

1619
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,296
Affect

1620
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,576

01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:33,440
Just get out of my state you scumbag

1622
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,976
Beto grew up in

1623
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,192
There's

1624
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:47,776
Alex is not as good as his daddy.

1625
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:49,824
Trump at coming up with the

1626
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,104
Answer people cuz

1627
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:58,016
Scallywag O'Rourke well because he's a said carpetbagger right before that

1628
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:05,696
Associated is fine

1629
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:12,096
Scallywag

1630
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:14,656
I don't think it is I think it's a bad term

1631
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:18,752
I remember I looked this up a while ago I think it's actually like

1632
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:31,808
He's just ignore vernacular but we don't

1633
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:41,792
I can't remember what it was there's another one I looked up

1634
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:46,400
Scallywag cantankerous

1635
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,704
That's weak

1636
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,472
This week

1637
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:56,896
Comedy bit of like my earpiece isn't working

1638
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:01,504
And it goes on forever that clip is almost a minute long

1639
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,272
Pecos Eva

1640
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:05,600
Further with it

1641
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:10,208
I don't know

1642
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:13,280
Like I hear stuff like this and I'm just like I got it

1643
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:17,888
It's kind of like being around someone you don't want to be around

1644
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:22,240
My job to be around someone no one wants to be around your Valley

1645
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:24,032
But like I just like

1646
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,848
I want him to do better

1647
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,384
I'm not getting any

1648
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,176
I'm not getting anything out of it

1649
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,712
And I'm just hearing and be like

1650
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:32,736
Beto O'Rourke

1651
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,272
Beto O'Rourke

1652
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,088
This is

1653
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,648
On the same show the Paul Joseph Watson

1654
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:41,184
Is basically saying like

1655
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:47,840
We just do playground insults then when you respond poorly to it we keep doing it cuz that's what

1656
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:50,656
Hear him do this this name-calling game I like

1657
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,336
You can do better

1658
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:00,896
He hasn't yet

1659
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:05,248
You could do better maybe.

1660
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:06,528
He is like the

1661
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:08,320
Curt Schilling of radio host

1662
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,088
That nobody pays

1663
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,672
He's lost his fast

1664
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:15,744
That is fair

1665
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,608
Resort at 2 noises

1666
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:23,936
Because

1667
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:29,568
It's so bad so dumb I don't know

1668
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,384
I know that there's not a ton of people listening

1669
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:41,856
Somewhere

1670
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:46,464
And something better places for your raising

1671
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,512
Like

1672
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,048
If anything's

1673
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:54,400
What did diminished quality in Alex's show is probably doing

1674
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,192
Is pushing people too much harder

1675
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:57,728
Stop

1676
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:59,520
You know what's going on there

1677
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,872
I'm laying here having a meeting

1678
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:06,944
No

1679
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,528
Bennigan's would no longer handle the alright anyway got to respect Bennigan's

1680
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:15,648
It's not a popular decision they're going to get a lot of bad Yelp reviews but

1681
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:16,416
Pakistan Subway

1682

I can't do this yeah we got it

1685
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:29,728
Take a break.

1686
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,056
Nothing but a trap

1687
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:43,040
Knowledge underscore what if you wanted to watch The Social Network

1688
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,320
You could do that

1689
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,088
I think you're

1690
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:46,880
Do what

1691
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:51,744
Cuz I was that how you would do it maybe maybe it's on Amazon Prime

1692
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:55,072
Baby fight on YouTube

1693
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:58,912
Alright can we

1694
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:04,288
We can do the whole thing

1695
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,432
What's up Dan

1696
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,480
I feel like you've got some information

1697
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:14,784
You been hiding this for

1698
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:15,552
So long

1699
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:18,112
Time to come clean well I would say

1700
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:20,160
I don't have a lot of experience

1701
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:20,928
Dance with gaming

1702
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:21,696
It's not like

1703
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:22,976
