1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,048
Holding

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,736
Distance

7
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,504
Renovate

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,624
We will be drinking

9
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,928
Delicious cotton

10
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:35,328
Candy Faygo Brazen that it bothers to say

11
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,120
Nothing but carbonated water

12
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:37,888
And high fruit

13
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:42,496
We family up in here man

14
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,080
Water with sugar in it

15
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,152
Are flavored like cotton candy which is just

16
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
Sugar

17
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,456
That is

18
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,760
Candy that's great

19
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:00,416
Where I

20
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,184
You do not

21
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,536
Call

22
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,376
Eerily like cotton candy

23
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:12,192
Beverages in the past

24
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:12,960
What is it like

25
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,544
They have weird flavors but they mail it

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312
Perfect

27
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:18,848
It's

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,896
It's Eerie to drink

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
You don't want you don't want to liquid where you expect solid

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,672
It is truly horrifying

31
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,696
Animal sound

32
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
Human sound

33
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,488
Should come

34
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
Human sounds

35
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:38,816
Anyway

36
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,144
What is not a Lovecraft podcast

37
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,936
Although I mention him a bit

38
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,216
But that's just because we

39
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,520
We're starting to live in Eldridge

40
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,288
Terror

41
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,568
The world

42
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,432
It does seem like the other ones will be arising from the depths any moment

43
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,136
That would make more sense than anything he's doing

44
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,584
What's his face from Men In Black

45
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,680
The guy wearing the red and black

46
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,240
He's wearing another per

47
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,032
I take my restaurants was better

48
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,128
So

49
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:28,992

Of those who are interested in Polish

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,960
For the price of just one cup of coffee a day

You can give us one cup

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
One cup of coffee

Anyway

59
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,600
Of the investigation that I've been doing

60
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
2015

61
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:16,352
What the f*** happened to Alex Jones

62
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:27,360
Also honored

63
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:33,760
This is the prologue to the disasters

64
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:38,368
Because people have asked on Twitter you just asked me right before the show I want to get everyone up to

65
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,696
Speed with what's going on in current-day cuz we're not going to

66
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,352
There was no show on Monday again because of Memorial Day

67
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:54,496
Rodger Stone talked about I am a real American

68
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:59,360
Hulk Hogan's theme song amazing Wednesday Mike cernovich

69
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,456
Jones announced

70
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
Set. It's on Wednesday

71
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
Thursday

72
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,184
They don't talk about that

73
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,559
Alex's but he's moved on

74
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,143
And now he's super into how cool it is

75
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
That Trump left

76
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
The Paris agreement

77
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,239
Great because

78
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
Did Alex Jones is

79
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,567
Conception in his framework

80
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
The planet

81
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,151
Is carbon starved

82
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,223
There's not a carbon dioxide issue

83
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,831
No pirate Cole

84
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:48,767
That's the one we're not going over and Rainbows are made of Starlight

85
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
Oh okay then

86
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,583
He's made of Starlight and Rainbow

87
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:57,727
We're not going to do an episode on the whole episode is Alex losing his mind

88
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
You still in his mannequin

89
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,847
And so he's talking about how July

90
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
First 2017

91
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,687
Will be the most important day in history

92
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,967
And here's why

93
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,503
Because we believe

94
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,295
Did the weight of the globalist

95
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
Upon themselves

96
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,111
Is through this carbon

97
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
That's been imposed

98
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,743
Climate change isn't real it's all a charade

99
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
To create a carpenter

100
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,071
Goes to Al Gore

101
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
I don't I don't

102
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,423
I don't get 28

103
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,007
Lovett the he's celebrating losing his shoe

104
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,335
He's going on and on about like weird biblical stuff

105
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
So strange

106
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,943
She's talked about God's eye

107
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,271
Which may or may not be a reference to Fast & Furious 6

108
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
Or Lord of the Rings

109
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
Could be that too

110
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,367
Or I think one of the assassins

111
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,951
Oh yeah so

112
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,487
Pizza

113
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,071
We discussed it a little bit on the last episode

114
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,703
It's tough to talk about it without making fun of

115
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
What is

116
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,311
Sort of overt mental illness

117
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,335
On the same token

118
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,895
The climate-change stuff is Giselle Looney

119
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
That I don't want us to make it

120
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,271
What is the score

121
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,111
Listening to it already freaking out when you just said

122
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:23,743
We're carbon. I'm protecting my neighbors from your screams

123
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,423
So the other thing I want to talk about

124
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,775
With the along the same lines as be we shouldn't mock Alex Jones

125
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,799
In the middle of

126
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
Episode

127
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,639
Hey came out on the internet last week

128
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
The Paul Joseph Watson

129
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
Eats books

130
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,479
I want

131
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,783
To make it very clear that I hate him

132
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
His his beliefs

133
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
But I resent everybody make

134
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Fond of him

135
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
4

136
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,767
You know

137
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,047
And I really don't like to

138
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
To see people

139
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
When

140
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,655
So f****** open to attack with so many other things

141
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,215
All of these people making fun of him because

142
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,263
He came out admitted that he eats paper

143
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,055
I don't think that's okay

144
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,871
Monster filled with

145
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,895
Transphobic

146
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
Homophobic

147
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Sucking it

148
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Hate

149
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
I hate

150
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
Philmont

151
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,671
Absolutely Visser rated everything

152
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
Single day ever

153
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,487
Yeah forever

154
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
Like

155
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,303
Greek myth

156
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,887
He pulled from him every morning he should

157
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
Did he land it

158
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
Should happen again

159
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
The very next

160
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,615
Brought up the torch of light

161
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,735
It's the same thing with

162
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,271
All the paper

163
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:57,439
He is a bit of an agoraphobic and Raley's it apart

164
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,255
Right again that's a thing that I don't feel any interest

165
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,327
In making fun of and I emphasize I feel really

166
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,119
I feel bad for him

167
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935
So when I see people making

168
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
It bums me out cuz he suck

169
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,823
But not for these reasons it is unfair

170
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,407
And it gives him an opportunity to reattach back and be like

171
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,455
Oh isn't this the tolerant left making

172
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,503
Fun of my mental illness

173
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
Trap

174
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,343
I'm not saying that he's faking it as a trap

175
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
But it is

176
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
Attract you can fall in

177
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
Of course

178
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,743
Really bums me out when people don't take the right Tech plan

179
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
On the exact toll

180
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,327
I just stick to the reality

181
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
Don't insult them

182
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,375
4 things

183
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
Bitter humor

184
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
Don't

185
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,495
Make fun of him for being afraid to leave

186
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:47,359
Make him afraid to leave Jim Morrison

187
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:53,759
Attacking the moment he walks outside

188
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,295
Ravens

189
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
Their own families too high

190
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,927
We need an army of birds

191
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,975
I think that's where my

192
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Because

193
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,815
You know they're the only ones who are going to survive once they

194
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,375
Not as the owls have

195
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,799
We're going to start our investigation today's episode

196
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
To July 13th

197
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,943
We're going to be going over there

198
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,247
But to give you guys a little bit of a last time

199
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,039
I'm on vacation

200
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,135
Donald Trump for a long time

201
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,487
Spent a lot of time misrepresenting the Civil War

202
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,815
You're up to speed

203
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,119
123rf

204
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,471
This is a very good question has brought everybody

205
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
2 seconds

206
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:51,615
Because you can go on July 5th

207
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,919
Very strongly indicated that he

208
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,735
He is fully aware of Trump's mob connections

209
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,783
So we go from

210
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:03,135
Dismissal and not within a couple days

211
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,439
Is a trumpet announce

212
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,023
Alex Jones is saying this guy is

213
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:15,679
Sprint and I only 25%

214
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,007
Trust him he agrees with the distrust of immigrants

215
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,335
Fred agrees that rhetoric but he knows the Trump isn't

216
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,359
Going to follow through on it

217
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,431
Also at the end of our life

218
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,015
Also at the end of our last episode

219
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,063
We revealed the Paul Joseph Watson

220
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
Also

221
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
Thanks the trumpet

222
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
He's just in a

223
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,927
A publicity

224
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,999
Threat

225
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
Joysticks

226
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
The fuckedupshit

227
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,375
Phone call

228
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,215
Is the weird headspace

229
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
And I don't

230
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,031
Mikey really wants to do is show

231
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,591
It takes a lot of phone calls

232
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,127
And they're all pretty boring

233
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,455
Write but in the time

234
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
It's a lot of race

235
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,039
You talked a lot about

236
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,367
Guilt only a month

237
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
From the

238
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,183
Charleston

239
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,767
Torso is the first clip where we start

240
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
Explaining

241
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,863
Best Kilt

242
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,911
I want explain something

243
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,823
I really don't care what color you are

244
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:31,455
Where you came from if you support

245
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
You support

246
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,783
Plainfield

247
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,855
You're not a wannabe social engineer

248
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,927
Trying to guilt me into film

249
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,071
I care about you and I want you to succeed

250
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
There's two issues

251
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,751
This is Donald Trump situation

252
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:03,199
Donald Trump

253
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,319
Most of what he says makes a lot of sense

254
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
You're really smart.

255
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,695
She won't deliver on what

256
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,975
Experience

257
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,631
That's just what my gut tells me

258
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,727
Jerome corsi

259
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
Bureau chief

260
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
Infowars

261
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,335
Who is no Donald Trump for 40 years

262
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
In 2015

263
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,247
The Donald Trump is an establishment

264
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
And he is just there for

265
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,319
Oh yeah

266
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
But this is

267
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,135
Now he's saying one of his sources

268
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
Well

269
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
I mean

270
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,231
We all know that

271
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
We all knew that

272
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,815
That's what he was

273
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:55,167
Waiting for Alex to say that he

274
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,215
You can throw like the next show is like

275
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,287
Also I can throw an elephant as far as

276
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,151
Human being

277
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:11,551
That's his way out if he's actually so strong he can throw an elephant a billion

278
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,623
I will not be made a liar

279
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,999
Gonna Fly now is playing in the background we get a nice little rocky montage

280
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
I mean

281
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
Isaac that you're under playing

282
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,631
Revelation is also on the same page

283
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:30,239
Cuz dr. corsi is now a major player in Alex's

284
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
Propaganda

285
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,799
He's a major player in

286
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
Pushing Trump

287
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,663
The thing that is

288
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
The thing that mitigates that

289
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Me is that

290
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
Everyone

291
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Was

292
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:48,671
Like no we don't want Trump we don't want Trump we don't want Trump until it became apparent that

293
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
They had to

294
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,255
His friends

295
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,583
We're saying does he have friends

296
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,471
Come on

297
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
Supreme a Leverage

298
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,823
Applejack

299
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,943
A good point exclusively at Trump's places

300
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,015
If possible

301
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,855
We have this reiteration of I agree with

302
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
Brace s*** that he's saying

303
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Fifth

304
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,999
The stuff cuz beat the Trump situation that he's referring to is

305
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
Still

306
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
Just the comments

307
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
About

308
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,607
That's still what's going on

309
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
That's the only contact

310
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
Covers Trump in

311
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
Pretty much

312
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,007
I think throughout the entirety of this episode

313
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
The Trump situation

314
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,103
It's all just there

315
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,383
Which at this point

316
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,175
In history on July 6th

317
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Is old

318
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Huey

319
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,159
He's not he's not wrestling with up-to-date s***

320
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,487
His is preamble

321
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:03,167
And then here's his list of things that are pro-human are

322
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
Self-defense

323
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,263
Don't Make Me Feel

324
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,847
That's the wrong priority for Amy

325
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
Human being ever

326
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,663
No cuz that's the Bedrock

327
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,991
Human dignity

328
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,527
Care about others

329
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
Boo

330
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,647
Respect

331
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:28,511
Respect for yourself and for others

332
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,815
Let's do understand know to get white people to feel bad

333
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
Vulcanize

334
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:37,471
Oh okay come to realize something that I think

335
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,031
Empathy is a globalist platinum like

336
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Yeah that makes sense

337
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,407
Yeah let's go along with that

338
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
The Alex believe

339
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,247
And I'm not sure about that

340
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,039
To think that he believes

341
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
The DIA

342
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,087
Dia of

343
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
People

344
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,159
Complaining about legitimate racial issue

345
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,951
He interprets that as a

346
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,535
Plot to split white people as one cohesive group

347
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,071
As a voting Bloc

348
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,351
Into

349
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,191
Split group and some of the people will go along with the broken

350
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,751
Clinton put together

351
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:15,359
And other ones will become white supremacist

352
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,175
It's not how do you how do you

353
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,247
Look I'm just I don't like it when they

354
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
Split white people

355
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
Voting Bloc

356
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,623
Right we should all be United

357
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:34,047
I don't care what color you are so long as all white people are on the same team

358
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,351
I want to be clear he hasn't said as much

359
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,655
But I'm starting to glean some of that

360
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
From

361
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,727
His interviews that he's had with like Larry Nichols

362
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
And just some of the other things

363
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,543
My Isaac

364
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
Part of it

365
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,383
It's part of so many old white.

366
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,455
It's not like it's not like it's a thing they actively

367
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,551
I think about it just there there tribalism in the back of their head is like

368
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,391
Well you look like me so you must agree with me

369
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,463
Which are of course private property self-defense

370
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,535
I don't feel guilt

371
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:10,399
Especially about comes from

372
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,471
Old white people self defense

373
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:19,871
Interesting

374
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:24,991
Prior to the private property that you have because of the system that is

375
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
Place

376
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,855
Literally on racism

377
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
The self-defense

378
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,927
You need because of

379
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,255
All three Pence most important things

380
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,535
Are white supremacist

381
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:41,119
Somewhat anyways

382
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,191
Apologist idea

383
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,079
Is basically acceptable

384
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,943
You got to ask yourself what is that agenda really all about

385
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,159
We all agree that

386
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
Any crime done by black

387
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:11,839
We just ignore blacks

388
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
No

389
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,423
That's crazy

390
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,703
We just ignore it

391
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
At the end

392
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,919
What's the agenda there

393
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,735
And I think it's fascinating because

394
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,783
Do you talk about yourself

395
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,135
Don't like that

396
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,183
You know I'm saying

397
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
It's

398
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,815
Explain

399
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,887
What's my plan on this

400
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,215
Explained by

401
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,007
Considering what sources Alec

402
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
Steaks in

403
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055
Next clip

404
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
I'll explain

405
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:59,967
What is news diet is like Bono and I don't want to know

406
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,503
Depressed this morning

407
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,599
Articles

408
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,999
What

409
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,839
Reading the comments on your own articles

410
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:19,679
4 tips

411
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,335
San Francisco

412
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
Out of jail

413
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
People then it spread

414
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,399
In the comments

415
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
Grammar

416
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:03,199
Basically not just

417
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:08,319
Donald Trump

418
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,135
It was

419
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:20,095
One of the things that I think is interesting is one I have developed

420
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
Two theories

421
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,887
In my investigation

422
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,423
Fart

423
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,983
One of them is reasonable

424
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,519
And the other one will get you later

425
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,591
The reasonable theory is I think

426
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
Alex Jones

427
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,175
At some point around

428
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:34,943
Here

429
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
July 6th

430
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
7th

431
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,319
He starts to get really jealous

432
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
Is Donald Trump

433
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,135
Is getting a lot of press

434
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,159
Same thing

435
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,695
Things that are very similar

436
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Okay

437
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,279
Alex Jones starts

438
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
To get

439
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,351
Petty

440
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
Angelus

441
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,679
Why the run lumping me in with him

442
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,983
Why am I not getting all the attention

443
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,543
And then on top of that

444
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
I think he starts

445
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
Emphasize

446
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
A little bit

447
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,895
Because of the way the media treats

448
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
I think if there is a

449
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,479
There is an identification Factor

450
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,015
Alex starts to feel with

451
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,039
Okay that's

452
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,831
The most reasonable Theory I have

453
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,367
About what gets him

454
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
To sort of

455
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,159
Shift over

456
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:22,304
I have an insane Theory that's an emotional human beings

457
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
Like I can understand that

458
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:29,728
Bandits

459
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,520
Because you and I can understand

460
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,360
Because

461
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,128
Trump

462
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
Kill the globalists

463
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,480
Back left the head on Alex Jones

464
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:44,832
The doorstep.

465
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:49,696
The psychology of both individuals

466
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Because he's an artist

467
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,584
I'm at Alex's

468
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,120
Any feels like

469
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
I'm gentleman

470
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,752
I see what's happening with him if I identify myself with him

471
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,032
Maybe I will get the

472
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,616
He's saying exactly what I've been saying

473
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,896
For forever

474
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
Be more popular

475
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,736
Here's what I'll do I'll drift

476
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,784
And there are a couple instant

477
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,136
Two of clipsville play where Alex says things that eventually Trump

478
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,184
There's also a possibility

479
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,816
I don't know but there is also a possibility that Alex

480
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,888
Just lives his life and spouts the hate that he spouts

481
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,680
Emin at some point started

482
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,984
To see Trump Joc hairstyle

483
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,264
And be like all right

484
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
He likes me

485
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,592
Disappeared

486
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,200
I don't know that make sense

487
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,760
Like I said I'm just sick

488
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,344
July 6th episode

489
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,624
More less yet

490
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
New strfkr

491
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
But he chooses

492
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
Weird Stars

493
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,256
Anyway this Mexico

494
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,840
I told you July 6th is a weird day that I weird

495
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,400
And they finally sort of blows

496
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:05,984
Episode

497
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,568
It's almost like claustrophobia

498
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,640
I just want to hide from everybody

499
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,704
Car wash videos

500
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:56,672
Stupid white people is dumb as a so-called minorities are

501
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:03,072
Everywhere

502
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,472
Juxtaposition there is amazing

503
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:14,336
Play music screaming about Pacey dumb white people

504
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,384
If it was from

505
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,688
If it was from Beverly Hills Cop

506
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,480
Eddie Murphy said that

507
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,528
I believe every word

508
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
Like it's not Mark Dice shooting these

509
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
Exploitative

510
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:39,936
Erroneous videos where it goes I'll talk to dumb people on the street

511
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,728
We don't know what the 4th of July

512
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
All this stuff

513
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,592
Reaching out

514
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,384
Music

515
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,432
And then here is how he comes back from

516
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,344
Because I've been holding my anger in the last few

517
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,744
He wakes and during the break I had a controlled rage just walking around

518
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,144
Back in the storage area of the facility

519
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,496
For a half hour

520
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,080
Because my rivocean

521
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:24,992
AR

522
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:33,696
I just wonder what is wrong with this conversion of

523
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,792
I don't know

524
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,096
That's a really good question

525
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,936
Don't know why we put up with a second

526
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,496
Pretty shorts

527
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:50,848
Episodes we've covered he's had to leave the studio and headache

528
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
Controlled rage

529
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,176
Yeah I want I want to see what his

530
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:57,504
Controlled rage

531
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,880
He's a freaking he's at

532
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
Kizi

533
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,952
Either

534
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,024
He's not mentally well

535
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,632
He's not in a

536
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,912
Emotional

537
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
Spiritual

538
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,776
Self-control kind of situation

539
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,568
Where he should be doing this

540
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,224
Right with my mind a little bit and I'm losing it a tiny bit covering him

541
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,248
I have developed

542
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,832
White agoraphobia I don't leave the house as much as I used to

543
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:39,232
But I've never gotten so mad listening to him that I've gone into a controlled rage

544
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:42,560
I think it's code for a raise

545
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:47,168
I think it's time to put a PR spin on

546
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
Call Matt

547
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:52,800
I threw s*** in my office for a good half-hour and I know I have a cleaning lady

548
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,080
Yeah

549
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,616
So

550
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,432
4 man you should not you should not be doing this

551
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,456
You should not

552
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,528
You shouldn't shouldn't be in the news

553
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,552
It is

554
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
Like

555
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,392
Like how do you look at somebody

556
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,672
Who is soak

557
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,208
Clearly unhealthy

558
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Of his life

559
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,096
There's no good there's no

560
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
Good thing that we've seen

561
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,912
Other than

562
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,192
Once a year he smokes

563
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:26,592
The only bright spot the only healthy see the old me healthy

Make sure that

00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,224
7 gone too far with that

567
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,136
Respond to in him

7

Percent White

What are you can also if you're a

575
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,448
Disenfranchised

576
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
White dude

577
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,080
You can absolutely sublimate some of your anger through hit

578
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,480
Yeah what are the ways you can get it out as you allow this man to speak for you

579
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,760
Nana you feel

580
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,808
You know you get that dopamine reaction

581
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:14,208
Terrible anger based on feeling like

582
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,768
And you listened to his show

583
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,328
He screams about it

584
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,400
It's somehow you can vicariously feel those feelings

585
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,984
Maybe they come out maybe maybe it is a release

586
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
I hope

587
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,568
Cuz I think I think

588
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,616
It's reinforcing

589
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:38,272
You have to imagine some of these people work in the office they go to the office and rather than take out all this weird

590
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,064
Angry conservative White

591
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,624
On their co-worker

592
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,904
They just sit there listen

593
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,952
Gorillaz

594
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:47,744
4 hours

595
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:53,632
I'm really scared that my co-workers has being that I'm watching

596
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,168
Infowars at work

597
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,472
I'm really worried that they think I like

598
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:02,848
I don't know no one's brought it up but I'm so scared people think I'm in into a warrior

599
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,384
Huge beard

600
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,712
I could be one of those crazy

601
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,016
Clip from July 6th

602
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,088
Blimpie on

603
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:17,440
Here is an interview with this dude

604
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:18,976
Friends

605
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,256
That's not a job

606
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,048
Heeee does predictions

607
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,864
Is to come okay

608
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:32,800
He has a lot of similar Tendencies Alex to predict the collapse is coming

609
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,104
A bunch

610
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
Buy gold

611
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,176
But

612
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:41,248
What I think is more important interview is this place that I'm at

613
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,880
Gerald Celente really reinforcing

614
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,184
The Savior narratives that Larry Nichols

615
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,208
Who's laid out for Alex

616
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,232
Impasse episode

617
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,816
You said you were depressed because of the masses

618
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,864
That are so out of touch

619
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,936
So I had this little

620
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:06,336
That really says it all

621
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,200
But rather an Irate tireless minority

622
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:15,040
Keen on setting brush fires

623
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,088
In the minds of men

624
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,416
It does not take a majority to prevail

625
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,952
But rather an irate

626
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,744
Tireless minority

627
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,816
Keen on setting brushfires of freedom

628
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,352
In the minds of men

629
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:35,008
And that's what you are doing that's what I'm doing at the doctor Paul Craig Roberts

630
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,568
There are number of us that are doing it

631
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:42,432
It's bringing it all together to make it happen

632
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:48,832
Yeah if you just do some like warmed-over hacky comedy

633
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,904
The brush fire of Heaven

634
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,696
Going to brush fire

635
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:58,048
He's like

636
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:02,912
He's throwing it just takes an Irate minority

637
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,216
The same thing as what Larry Nichols keep saying

638
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,264
Alex

639
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,544
You are savior

640
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:12,896
He even goes so far Like Larry Nichols I don't think I had pulled the clip but he does say

641
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,432
You are the last hope

642
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,968
For the Bastion of proof

643
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,992
Jesus

644
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,344
In his life we were just

645
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,392
Completely reinforcing this

646
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,952
It's up to you now I want to rewrite

647
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:27,744
A New Hope

648
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,304
Yeah I have Obi-Wan just be this

649
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,840
Deranged

650
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:35,168
Ill-proportioned angry

651
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,192
Yeah

652
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,848
Lightsabers

653
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,456
I do sort of believe I'm fighting

654
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,736
Exotic battle

655
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:52,064
Against the windmill that is at

656
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,136
I think it's important I don't think

657
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,160
This is Jeff

658
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,952
Fun entertainment

659
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,000
I think there is something important we're doing

660
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:03,584
But I don't have

661
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,864
The music

662
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,192
Audiobook

663
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
Sixth grade

664
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,032
Love some savant

665
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,640
I don't have a Larry Nichols

666
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:21,248
I have you and no I am not going to tell you you are sick

667
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,320
Coolant

668
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,904
I was audited

669
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Alex

670
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,232
Stop

671
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:36,608
Dheere dheere vocal patterns are too appealing you need to find a way to speak clearly

672
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,656
For July 6th

673
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,752
Hellboy

674
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,520
Create a new

675
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,824
I don't want to do that

676
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,616
I don't want to do that

677
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,968
So we go to

678
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,992
July 7th

679
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,296
This episode is

680
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,112
Weird

681
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,392
That episodes are weird

682
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,928
That's because they

683
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:04,000
Yeah so is the ones that you don't think are weird art

684
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:07,840
Terrifyingly weird weird

685
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,912
I can't process my emotions while listen

686
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,960
This is weird

687
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,008
Let's go to where we are

688
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
I'm so in this episode

689
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,920
Refuse

690
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:26,272
Refuse to believe in climate change

691
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,808
Since I don't have any of him

692
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:31,904
He claims I actually was on the show just the other day

693
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,440
2017

694
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,768
To talk about how

695
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,864
That climate change is based on

696
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,424
And he's going to release a paper

697
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,960
About it how that go

698
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:50,336
Doesn't give any details errors

699
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,104
Okay were made

700
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,128
Does not explain any of

701
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,664
Any any

702
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,968
Talk about maybe it was in

703
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,504
In the measuring system

704
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,808
Now no specific

705
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
Like a calculator

706
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,648
You know like

707
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
To the exhaust

708
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
Climate

709
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,744
You know like how quick are the ice cap

710
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,328
Maybe they just got the

711
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,120
Like maybe

712
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:13,888
Simple things

713
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:19,008
Tell me the Lord Moncton or whatever the f*** is name is

714
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,360
A mathematical issue that we can

715
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
Even given EB

716
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,480
Details

717
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,272
Never f****** mind

718
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,576
The thrill climate-change still real Alex

719
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:37,696
Can 2015 table discussion about how the EU was a fascist organization

720
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,280
I didn't keep any of that stuff

721
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,376
In this clip towards the beginning of the episode

722
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,704
Some stuff that I believe Trump

723
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,984
Picked up on later

724
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,520
Stuff about how

725
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,312
Obama is the founder of Isis

726
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,104
They sort of believe

727
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,872
Are things

728
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,664
Mirrored from Alex

729
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,224
Do you know what I'd like

730
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,808
Maybe our big problem is that we just don't Define words

731
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,088
The same way like

732
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,368
What do you think

733
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:12,768
Their definition of fascism is like the actual word like

734
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,560
Beginning of knowledge comes

735
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,328
From the definition

736
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,888
The term sleep beginning a conversation

737
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:21,984
You can't believe how can you communicate with somebody who disagrees with you

738
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,800
Without first a green on

739
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
Pasticho

740
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,408
Interesting point

741
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,456
I don't know

742
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,248
I don't think Alex would it be up for having

743
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:37,088
The conversation about Justified

744
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:42,976
Queen

745
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:46,816
Like if you ever

746
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,840
Unverifiable

747
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:52,192
Like you can't disprove a lot of the things you said if you were to give definitions

748
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
The terms it would be like

749
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,520
Oh no that's absolutely not true

750
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:02,432
Crustaceans

751
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,712
Conserve

752
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,504
Before in the password

753
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,528
Okay

754
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,064
Where we're going to stop

755
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,368
This is what we are talking about here

756
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,648
The one subject

757
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,208
About that you

758
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,744
You can change your mind Bass

759
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,816
It's on so you say you know you have no evidence or what your

760
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:19,840
Okay fine

761
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,376
I will present evidence

762
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,656
If it

763
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,192
Disagrees with you

764
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
Then you have to

765
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:25,984
To change your mom

766
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,312
If you do the same for me then I will change my my

767
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,592
So long as

768
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,640
The moment I do that you don't say

769
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:37,248
Well yeah but what about now

770
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,040
Gopokes moving a chair

771
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,624
He did create

772
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,160
Through

773
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,744
Accidental foreign policy

774
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,304
Might the roots of it might go back even

775
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,584
And further than that if you really

776
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,352
Think about

777
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,656
Ronald Reagan created

778
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:01,568
Let's throw that out let's just go back

779
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:05,664
Alex has egg

780
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,480
Obama talking about how

781
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,272
We will not be able to

782
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,296
Terrorist

783
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,320
Through bombs

784
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
Open

785
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,880
We need a better ideology

786
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,928
We need to get at the root

787
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,696
Of what causes

788
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
People to

789
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,488
Join these groups

790
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,768
That's called strategy

791
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,840
That's very reasonable Alex interprets

792
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,680
Bedrock of this

793
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,496
Let's go ahead

794
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,824
Let's do it let's go to this clip of Obama

795
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:41,760
How to wear a sweater over

796
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,096
Us30 a trifold

797
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,632
556

798
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:02,752
Accidentally got Special Forces

799
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:14,016
Other areas like

800
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,808
That means that we're going to have to

801
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,744
It's also true why

802
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:31,680
Also require up there

803
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:35,008
Oh yeah sure

804
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:41,408
Mo3 leaders agree

805
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,784
Audiologist

806
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,136
Are not defeated by better idea

807
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:57,792
More attractive and more compelling one

808
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:04,192
Amarillo

809
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,312
Yeah I don't understand

810
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:13,920
He talks about how Americana is so sexy

811
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:20,320
He thinks that if we create prosperity in this Americana system of free market and what-have-you it'll be such a

812
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:25,952
The first place

813
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,000
He believes exactly what Obama

814
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,048
Word for word but he think

815
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:37,216
But because it's a

816
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,824
Obama is saying we shouldn't

817
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
The pack them

818
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,384
It's not what you saying

819
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,712
Just bombs

820
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:54,880
Oh there's going to be bop track auto box

821
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:55,904
Latta bobsled

822
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:00,512
What do you think of it like you were yelling over he says

823
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,048
Let me translate that for you

824
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,120
These are our proxy armies that are going to go kill Christians

825
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:09,472
That's not what I was saying at all

826
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:15,360
There wasn't even a word that you could twist that into

827
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,432
That was just him deliberately

828
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,736
Not

829
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,296
Deliberately things

830
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,064
Straight up Bowl

831
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,392
Otherwise

832
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,160
Just say

833
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,184
Because Obama

834
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,744
That's just not possible

835
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,304
Which

836
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:38,144
Democratic president says something that Republicans

837
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,216
If they can't agree with that then they just

838
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:45,056
Something else

839
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,360
Typical post

840
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,384
Remove the conversation

841
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:58,624
So it was next clip I believe on July 7th

842
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,928
A this is some evidence

843
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,952
Alex

844
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:02,976
Size of truck

845
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,048
More than just agree

846
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:06,816
His rhetoric

847
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,144
This clip shows

848
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,424
Some kernels

849
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,472
I see myself in

850
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,312
Engineers

851
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,248
If you want to come here

852
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:36,768
After you arrive you will get your extended stay

853
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,120
I don't want

854
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:50,336
How much really got me

855
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,872
The Donald

856
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,735
Abdominal

857
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:01,087
He's here where

858
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:08,767
Wherewithal

859
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,799
Personal shopper

860
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,335
The point is

861
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,151
Minority

862
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,687
Of the people

863
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,855
If you can't

864
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,487
This is chump

865
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:45,631
Mexico or Guatemala

866
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,423
Columbia

867
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,007
Brazil

868
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:55,359
Or chili let's just go south and show up at

869
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:05,599
Food stamp program

870
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,159
Text

871
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,095
Donald Trump Signature Collection

872
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,887
Made in Mexico

873
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:28,639
I'm all for

874
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,831
Helpful

875
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:45,023
Is going after Trump

876
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:48,095
What is an article

877
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,527
Donald Trump

878
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:22,911
He's created a straw man of the Ark

879
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,983
You meant that Trump made is that Mexicans are lazy

880
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,031
The easiest stereotype that Alex

881
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,055
Can grab onto

882
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,615
That's not what people responding to at all

883
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,663
So he responds to this fake argument

884
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,015
Invicta look for himself

885
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,575
He's starting to see the way that the media treat

886
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,599
Donald Trump

887
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,415
Mirrors the way the media treats out

888
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,695
And I think

889
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,719
That he's internalized

890
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,535
What's fascinating to me there is

891
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,559
Egos

892
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:57,471
And then earlier in that very same clip

893
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,543
Maybe we should

894
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,103
You

895
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,407
Alex

896
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,175
Alex

897
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,455
You did that

898
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:15,391
People talked about him being a hypocrite for having his clothes made in foreign countries is it is hoe

899
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:18,207
When was America first

900
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:24,607
Yeah so that's the reason the people clowning on in 4th

901
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
Cuz it's

902
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,167
Hypocritical

903
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:31,775
It's ridiculous the argument that he got a good deal

904
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,799
Doing

905
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,079
Isn't a good

906
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,127
That doesn't work

907
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,151
No you got to go

908
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:43,551
Cuz if you care about America at all

909
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,623
Coffee farmers

910
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,439
What's the best coffee for my palate I don't know

911
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,975
IGo Ethiopian yirgacheffe

912
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,815
IGo Folgers

913
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,399
Sure hates like balls

914
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,679
America first

915
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,703
Boulder coffee

916
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,519
I'm just

917
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,287
That's pretty

918
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:07,103
Cuz I

919
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,151
Deceive

920
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:10,943
Treatment

921
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,759
I don't get them on board

922
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,783
Obvious

923
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,575
But

924
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,855
There's trends

925
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,415
Gerald Celente

926
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,743
Starting to Bubble up once he starts defending Trump

927
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,023
It's a pretty short walk

928
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:29,119
Right once you start once you start defending a guy

929
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
He's going to be coming

930
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:32,959
Still just defending the words

931
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,495
You still attacking the man

932
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,055
He's still saying that I don't trust him

933
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,591
Even if he is defending

934
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,871
But I think there's

935
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:43,199
Conscious forces that are going on inside out

936
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,271
Like love

937
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,855
I told you the July 7th episode

938
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:50,879
Here's why

939
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,903
Presented

940
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,671
Without comment

941
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:07,007
Official channels unofficial channels

942
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,223
What's a false flag

943
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:16,991
Yes you did

944
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,575
Criticized

945
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,399
Isn't the official story doesn't add up

946
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:39,519
And that when police officers and school investigation experts

947
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,823
And school safety experts and others

948
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,407
They were

949
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,735
No emergency helicopters

950
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,879
DHHS an hour and a half later with a timestamp

951
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,327
But like a big PR stunt

952
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,631
Bloomberg

953
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,703
Before

954
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,823
A major operation coming up

955
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:21,503
Emails from school

956
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,039
A year before

957
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:27,647
We have demolished in

958
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:30,719
Yep we have videos

959
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:46,591
This is something that that that

960
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,127
So here's a couple important things

961
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:52,479
To break down here all the things that he brought up have been explained

962
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,503
Frat if you look in

963
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:57,599
The person that he's talking about the school investigator who's been threatened

964
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,647
Is a guy named Wolfgang halbig

965
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:03,743
Everybody's name alone is enough

966
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,535
To threaten him if you look into him

967
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,559
He is

968
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,167
Crazy amounts of money

969
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,983
Investigating

970
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,287
Be the guy who is offered

971
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,311
Bounty

972
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,591
4 proof

973
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:21,407
That various things

974
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,943
People have provided

975
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,247
I even like not real

976
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:29,343
He's like I'll give you $1,000 if you can give me a picture of x y and z

977
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,135
People show up giving pictures

978
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,927
Nope not good enough

979
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:39,327
Nope don't have metadata on the image

980
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,935
He's been harassing the family members of the children who died

981
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,703
It's

982
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,983
Disgraceful

983
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,519
He makes the argument that the kids

984
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:51,615
Who are the Super Bowl

985
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,895
Who got the thing

986
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,967
Jennifer Hudson

987
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,503
Fuse to even

988
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:03,903
Forensic specialist

989
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
No right

990
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,023
Know who cares I refuse

991
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,935
Oh I know where we're going to hide these kids

992
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,727
Next to Jennifer Hudson at

993
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,287
The Super Bowl flusher Magic

994
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,567
Lesser Magic

995
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,663
The story that Alex Jones

996
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:28,735
Keeps pushing whenever he brings up Sandy Hook is that Michael Bloomberg

997
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,015
Because he wants to take

998
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,575
The night before told everybody

999
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:36,415
Time to

1000
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:43,327
Leading a posse in the old west I've looked at I looked into this I've tried to find evidence

1001
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:49,727
Evidence on any reputable source

1002
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:53,567
I can't find any article even about this on Infowars

1003
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,943
Make that s*** I found one article on Infowars about Mike Bloomberg and how he wants to take your gun

1004
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,599
Links to another article

1005
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,623
About

1006
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,415
After the Aurora shooting

1007
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,439
The Batman shoe

1008
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,231
Michael Bloomberg

1009
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:13,023
Made a very serious effort

1010
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,815
In order to push gun control

1011
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,863
Because he was shot

1012
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,935
Yet another senseless

1013
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,959
Shooting

1014
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,495
And if you look at my Bloomberg

1015
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,543
History one of the big things that he folks

1016
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:28,639
Chris is on to be a real big issue for him is unavoidable.

1017
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,175
Do it

1018
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:34,015
We would like to clown about how he tried to Outlaw big sodas

1019
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,319
Little Giant sodas in New York

1020
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,599
But the reason is

1021
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:40,927
Sugar kills a lot of people that don't need to die

1022
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,695
Right

1023
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,095
Begun

1024
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,399
The gun stuff matches up very

1025
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,447
Close with a lot of his philosophy

1026
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,215
Please about

1027
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:57,311
Desperate don't need to happen don't need to happen the Aurora shooting

1028
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,359
He did try and put together some

1029
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,151
Some organization

1030
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,687
Some allies

1031
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,223
To work on

1032
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:04,991
Control

1033
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,527
And that's the only evidence

1034
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:11,391
They offer at all

1035
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,927
Three or four months

1036
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,207
Before Sandy Hook

1037
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,767
And so whenever Sandy Hook did end up happening

1038
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,815
Of course you was

1039
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:19,839
Prepared

1040
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,935
He didn't talk to people the night before with

1041
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,703
Foreknowledge

1042
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:31,103
The most also need to set one up you can just wait there's going to be another Mass shoot

1043
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,455
Why would you ever why would you ever need

1044
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,247
Two false flag of mass shooting

1045
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:43,135
Bloomberg started making moves after the Aurora one knowing that eventually

1046
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,927
Something's going to happen we should be

1047
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,207
Be prepared to

1048
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:46,975
Help

1049
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:49,023
Alex laying out that evidence

1050
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:54,399
Is it sounds like if o.j. defended himself in his trial just like

1051
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:57,215
Yeah I know this is true

1052
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:00,799
This is bulshit so this isn't

1053
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:01,823
We're going to get into wise

1054
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,359
But I want

1055
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,919
Take note of one thing

1056
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,479
From that clip that is very important

1057
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,015
He's talking to Rob do

1058
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,551
Resurface

1059
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,415
He's gotten back from his detox

1060
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,183
To get all that

1061
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,463
Supermale out of them

1062
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,743
At the end of that clip

1063
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,023
He says

1064
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,303
You have a degree in

1065
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,071
In theater

1066
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,863
Updo with maternal

1067
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,399
He's a degree in theater

1068
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,239
Does he have an MFA

1069
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:35,359
I don't know I

1070
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,639
Trained

1071
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,407
In journalism

1072
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:38,943
Music Theatre

1073
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,479
And he is

1074
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:44,575
Terrible actor

1075
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,391
He should have

1076
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:50,719
Focuses

1077
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,999
In terms of Sandy Hook

1078
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,023
But

1079
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:55,071
The real story here

1080
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,887
Nice to discover that Rob is actually in a

1081
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,167
Playwright

1082
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:03,775
Like he's just so good this is tour cover research or

1083
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:07,359
She is an amazing vibrant super interesting guy who's

1084
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,127
Playing boring

1085
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:13,503
That could be a terrible actor or maybe

1086
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,271
He's the best

1087
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,575
Possible you know what he has family member

1088
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,367
That's something

1089
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:22,463
Important Daniel do Luis febles

1090
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,023
We're going to get into robbed right now

1091
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,559
But now

1092
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:30,655
Your Uncle John

1093
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:34,751
What's the successful security company

1094
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:51,391
I heard you talking about it yesterday

1095
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,071
That's why I'm trying to get mine

1096
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,863
More

1097
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:05,471
Because he's been

1098
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:24,159
So Rob dues uncle is investigating Sandy Hook

1099
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:27,231
Stealing

1100
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:28,511
Okay

1101
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,887
Alright

1102
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,447
I called bulshit

1103
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,079
But he was there he was

1104
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:47,455
It will get to the actual interview

1105
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:49,247
Iraq

1106
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:52,575
Okay and then they have Tim do

1107
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,391
Sleepy do angry

1108
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,183
Morning dew

1109
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,719
Mountain Dew

1110
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,607
Going on

1111
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,399
There their they're

1112
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,703
Taking something very small

1113
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,727
And spreading it out

1114
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,007
To be something major

1115
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,287
As big as it could

1116
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:15,871
And the reality of what they could

1117
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,919
Cuz it's nothing

1118
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,687
10 different types

1119
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,223
My uncle was in Connecticut

1120
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,063
That's the news

1121
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:28,159
Let's just get through some of these clips

1122
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,695
Because it's nonsense

1123
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:32,255
A Connecticut Yankee

1124
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,815
Europe travel

1125
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:37,375
Without getting into the personalities involved

1126
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,415
I love that

1127
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,439
A Manhattan

1128
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,207
Project

1129
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,999
The gun grabbers

1130
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,815
But so based on what he's saying is

1131
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:10,143
I can't believe there's this evil you have to have so many people involved

1132
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,679
That's the reason why

1133
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,727
Very unreasonable

1134
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,287
Right there in that cliff

1135
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,311
Alex

1136
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:18,591
In present

1137
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,639
Claims

1138
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:24,223
He never said all that we have them we have V1 clip we

1139
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
Routinely play

1140
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,015
What do you say

1141
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:30,367
No one died it was all actors

1142
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:32,415
On the June 7th 2015

1143
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,607
I want to see Robert Redford

1144
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:41,631
Star in the

1145
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,423
I think that would be good

1146
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:46,751
Louis

1147
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:51,615
So if we get to the actual interview with

1148
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,407
Yeah probably

1149
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,175
No I think it's

1150
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,735
Spaghetti Western

1151
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,295
There was a secret

1152
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:02,367
Nope

1153
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:09,023
If we get to the actual interview with John 2 and crack reporter

1154
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,631
Anymore

1155
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,935
I mean ladies and gentlemen

1156
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:22,335
With your uncle this is John

1157
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,895
News directors to Uncle

1158
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:58,687
But you was the one

1159
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,991
Is the guy who sounds like he's from Jersey

1160
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,063
How do you take a man like that

1161
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:07,647
Most reputable news organization

1162
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:10,975
Don't send somebody don't send a man on the street interview out there with like

1163
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:16,095
Hey what do you feel about Obama doing this stuff huh

1164
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,191
You think this is a cover-up

1165
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:22,495
Yeah

1166
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:28,895
Yeah I know even the local Chicago news

1167
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,503
Oh absolutely

1168
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:36,319
McAlister's

1169
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,391
10-second

1170
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,439
Clip where all he says is

1171
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,207
This is weird

1172
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,487
Never seen anything like this

1173
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:48,351
Which could mean I've never seen anything this horrifying I've never seen something this tragic

1174
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,887
Could mean any number of things

1175
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:52,447
And they're just extrapolating it because

1176
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:56,031
There's private conversations that Rob do is had with his uncle

1177
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,079
Don't spell out anything

1178
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,151
Alex

1179
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,199
To get robbed too to give a quote

1180
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:08,575
About the private conversation good idea if you're a b******* artist

1181
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,367
I do not ask

1182
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,135
Direct Quest

1183
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,927
Like in the Press pool

1184
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:15,743
At the White House whenever they're asking Sean Spicer those

1185
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:16,511
In name

1186
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:17,791
Pointless Quest

1187
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,327
If you just got

1188
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,631
Like if you just got a direct

1189
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:22,655
From somebody

1190
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,191
Venue

1191
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,495
But if you're like vedanti

1192
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:30,335
You can just ask

1193
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,127
Could be and that's

1194
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:36,479
That means that you can say whatever you want

1195
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:39,551
Like I said Alex is pushing

1196
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:44,159
For some inside information about the conversation that robbed who had with his uncle

1197
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,695
Comedy in this clip

1198
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,463
For Alex

1199
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,999
Sort of tri-tip

1200
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:48,767
Explain what

1201
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,047
Raptors job

1202
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,583
A little bit

1203
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:57,983
This is really funny

1204
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:01,823
Denny's been in court cases

1205
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:15,903
This is your uncle

1206
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,439
Go back to the

1207
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,303
Remember

1208
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:27,167
Good cuz I was in the car driving while talking to your PC

1209
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:32,543
Because I wanted to get something out of before we did that cuz we did the show that night on the 4th that day on the 4th

1210
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,871
I want to talk about today I've got the short interview with you

1211
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:41,759
Estranged

1212
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:44,575
People don't know anyting Alex's sick of the bulshit

1213
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,903
Hung up with a quote

1214
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:50,975
How do you say I don't really remember what exactly

1215
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:57,375
F****** credible you're the news director to say whatever

1216
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,399
It's look like

1217
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:00,191
Tell me the truth and more like

1218
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:06,591
Look up something good a****** that what do you think I paid you have credibility or the news director make up something

1219
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,639
Just lying

1220
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:10,175
In a good way

1221
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,223
A tall Rob Dulce is

1222
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:17,087
Stop that comes from that 10-second video

1223
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:24,255
Even the stuff that you said that he said in a private conversation is just the same stuff that's in that damn but

1224
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:27,839
There's nothing here he said he's never seen anything like this in the car Pursuit

1225
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:32,191
No Alex Jones court cases before

1226
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:38,335
All of them everyone know that he's never seen anything like that

1227
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,103
So Alex

1228
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,639
At this point is sick of the b*******

1229
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,991
Sort of giving Rob do some s***

1230
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,527
This is this is also pretty funny

1231
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,623
Connecticut

1232
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:52,927
New York

1233
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:57,023
New Jersey

1234
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:03,423
Come on it's not a secret agent thing

1235
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:12,639
Yeah it's just like your uncle lives you dumbass

1236
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:14,943
Jesus

1237
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:19,551
Brighton New York

1238
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:22,879
I love that but that also the other important thing there is just freezing

1239
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:25,439
Cuz he's like the people who did Sandy Hook know where you

1240
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:29,791
Your uncle live

1241
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:32,095
You know what you believe

1242
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,655
There's no way around it

1243
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,703
I mean we have now two episodes

1244
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,471
Where are you

1245
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,495
Straight up

1246
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,311
Do exactly

1247
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:44,127
We've at least touched on it on

1248
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:44,895
Three other

1249
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:49,503
Everyone thinks

1250
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,295
But he said Jade Helm was real

1251
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:57,695
And I don't care to go back and dig through

1252
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:01,535
All the episodes and find out where he actually said

1253
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:07,935
100%

1254
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:14,335
Going back whenever you whenever I didn't say this we like Oh and it was this it's in the mainstream

1255
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,639
Stream news everybody knows

1256
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,175
It's not true if he says

1257
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:23,295
So we're done with

1258
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,831
I know we moved to July 8th

1259
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,647
Right and one of the important things that I don't have

1260
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,671
Audio of

1261
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,463
I just because it's long and boring

1262
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:32,511
Is in this episode Alex

1263
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,535
Express

1264
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:34,815
I'm pretty strong

1265
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,863
Support for Nigel farage

1266
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:37,887
And the UK

1267
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,655
Not good

1268
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:41,983
Now part of the FBI

1269
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,007
Investigation

1270
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,335
Is almost certain

1271
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,895
Rodger Stones back channel to Julian

1272
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,943
You think so I would say almost

1273
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:56,831
Nigel farage has been seen going to the

1274
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,367
And

1275
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:01,183
He was questioned when he came out of the embassy what were you doing

1276
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,719
I don't remember

1277
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:08,863
Ecuadorian Embassy

1278
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,263
I forgot what it was

1279
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,847
We can assume

1280
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:20,895
It's not good Julian Assange

1281
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,991
Batman

1282
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:27,039
Oh yeah there we go

1283
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:33,695
Too many black references on the same episode guys you're all getting policy wonk material for free

1284
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:37,791
Can we make a hat-trick

1285
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:42,399
So he presses

1286
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,679
Right

1287
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:44,959
Nike Huaraches

1288
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:45,727
Just

1289
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:51,359
4 time failed politician whack-job anti-immigration

1290
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,175
Anti-eu kind of guy

1291
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:55,711
Which makes up white

1292
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,759
But it makes sense why Alex would be on

1293
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,831
There are similarities

1294
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,367
Between the two of their worldview

1295
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:08,255
It's important that we bring that up because it does feed into my crazy theory that I'll be getting to at the end

1296
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:10,559
Yes this is one of the important building block

1297
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,863
The grand unified field theory of right way

1298
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,399
Wing propaganda

1299
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:17,983
How our last episode super into Jeff session

1300
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,263
Even before he was part of

1301
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,567
Trump campaign

1302
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:22,847
Free brexit

1303
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:23,615
Free

1304
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,919
Trump involvement with Nigel farage

1305
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:26,943
In

1306
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,711
With

1307
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:31,551
He's been on the show before

1308
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:33,599
I don't have I don't have episode

1309
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,903
I haven't heard any episode with Rodger.

1310
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:39,487
It's like we're doing the Marvel Universe

1311
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:42,815
Like we're doing the the films that they used to set up

1312
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:49,215
Let's call Nigel farage

1313
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:49,983
Let's do that

1314
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:56,383
He's from a different country he's a fish out of water

1315
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:58,943
Squad backstory

1316
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,223
Then also

1317
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:00,991
Very

1318
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:05,343
Result

1319
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:10,719
Nigel farage is sending his cast members used condoms

1320
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:13,023
So on July 8th

1321
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,303
He talks a lot about

1322
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,095
Collapse

1323
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:17,119
Of course Will Smith

1324
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:23,775
So much better than this is also somebody quit the movie come out

1325
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:29,919
On July 8th stories that Alex covers is the Chinese stock market

1326
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,943
It took a little bit of a dip

1327
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:35,807
Huiclaims

1328
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:42,207
Apparently also the stock market went down.

1329
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,231
After the Chinese

1330
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:43,999
Stock market

1331
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,279
Thought went down

1332
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:49,887
And did read the story that the stock market

1333
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:52,191
People gave was that it was a technical glitch

1334
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:55,007
He believes that it's the globalist

1335
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,287
Come again to stop

1336
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,823
The market for being destroyed

1337
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,359
I think the reality is

1338
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:01,663
That thing that we've discussed in the past a bunch

1339
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:04,991
Is B so much trading is done on a micro-scale by robe

1340
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,295
Shut down the market

1341
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,063
It's because

1342
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,367
These robots would misinterpret things

1343
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,903
And start selling off

1344
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:14,207
How do you would have an artificial clap

1345
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,791
Read Michael Lewis's book

1346
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,583
Electronics

1347
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:23,679
Most likely scenario

1348
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,447
If it's just we have

1349
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,215
To save the ship

1350
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,751
So shutdown

1351
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,287
Because he's robots

1352
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,311
Destroy the market

1353
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,847
So

1354
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:32,895
6 or something

1355
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:33,663
He's just using

1356
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:34,431
Get to push

1357
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,199
Selling gold

1358
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,735
So

1359
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,015
It's not all that interesting

1360
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:41,599
But what is interesting is he does get back to talk about Trump

1361
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,695
Do you I haven't heard

1362
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:50,047
Of this Republic

1363
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:56,703
Filled with people I want to kill in California

1364
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:01,567
They did on their way is regulations

1365
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:03,103
People

1366
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,199
Destroying Society

1367
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:13,855
Celebrating in the streets downtown

1368
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,647
Donald Trump Donald Trump

1369
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:22,559
How do you like it even matters

1370
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:25,631
Story the rebel flag

1371
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:28,959
Willie Havens

1372
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:35,359
Member removed this is why kptp hallucination

1373
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,199
What do you think your boy

1374
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,479
Trump's in trouble

1375
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:45,343
Donald Trump's net worth

1376
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:06,847
With

1377
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:13,247
Non matching socks I don't understand

1378
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:28,863
But you're running around celebrating

1379
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:37,567
Galatians

1380
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,527
Generations

1381
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:54,719
Mustafa

1382
01:10:55,231 --> 01:11:01,375
14.3 thousand

1383
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:14,431
What what is it you don't get about this

1384
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:26,719
I legitimately don't get why you're

1385
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:28,255
Computer

1386
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:36,447
I don't know what your self is we've lost 90% of

1387
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:43,103
Weather weather track that track

1388
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:50,015
Okay play that again just to figure out where we start

1389
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:55,647
Was endless

1390
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:59,743
Write the first part of believing that he's on board with Trump

1391
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,535
Because

1392
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,583
Even though he's not

1393
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,607
Guitarra

1394
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,887
Mirror lot of trump

1395
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:11,519
Negative people are mad about Trump

1396
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:13,823
Him sort of

1397
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:14,847
Realizing

1398
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,871
Everyone else's

1399
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:16,895
Judgment

1400
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:18,431
I guess

1401
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:22,783
Inasmuch

1402
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,831
People attack them similarly

1403
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,111
Because they're both

1404
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:26,879
Bigoted

1405
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,183
The second part is

1406
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,207
Trump

1407
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:33,023
Distraction in the same vein is complaining about the

1408
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,559
The flag the Battle Flag

1409
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,167
Art

1410
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:42,495
He's not my boy I don't care about him

1411
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:45,311
It's just a distraction and a more important

1412
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:47,615
Is that the globalists are attacking us

1413
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,895
And killing our sperm

1414
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,199
And GMO Foods

1415
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:53,503
Kill the pop

1416
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:58,111
The reproductive capacity of mammal species

1417
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,719
Makes perfect sense

1418
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:06,303
Now that you've just convinced that 3-minute VarageSale

1419
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,607
People who are different types of

1420
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:12,191
Also I didn't have time to do this

1421
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:14,239
Just because of my schedule but I was going to make a

1422
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,007
Supercut

1423
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,055
Of all the times we talked about mismatch

1424
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:23,455
You talked about it a lot three episodes during this time span he's mine

1425
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:31,647
I can't f****** handle that another episode

1426
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,927
It seems to be hit like

1427
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,463
Handlebar mustache

1428
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,487
Mismatched socks

1429
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,511
That's a trend

1430
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,303
That's sort of like his go to

1431
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,583
And the other one is

1432
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:43,679
He believes that liberals and trendy's love Islam because they smoke hookah

1433
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:48,031
Of course it's sort of like his way of being productive and not having to wrestle with

1434
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:49,823
Anyting

1435
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:52,383
So dumb

1436
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:54,943
But it still indicates that as of July 8th

1437
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,735
Alex Jones Belleza Donald Trump

1438
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,015
Completely

1439
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:02,367
He's a ringer for Hillary's there.

1440
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:05,951
Distract from her emails

1441
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:07,487
Make sure that rampaul does

1442
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:12,607
Specific prediction that Alex Jones is making

1443
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:27,199
Music

1444
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:34,623
The last time I saw

1445
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:38,975
Wait no

1446
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:43,583
He's a mortal isn't he

1447
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:46,911
It could be

1448
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:47,679
Done

1449
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:54,591
Listen to some f****** meal game and specifically made the claim that the big one the big

1450
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,895
Big collapse is coming this winter which is pushed

1451
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:59,455
From somewhere

1452
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:04,575
End of July that hasn't happened

1453
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,343
He's being metaphoric

1454
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:07,135
Immortal

1455
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,415
He's mortal

1456
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:11,231
Lemmings in 2018

1457
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:15,327
No not important

1458
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,607
What happened

1459
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:17,887
Well

1460
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,447
But it wasn't as big as the one in 19

1461
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,471
29

1462
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:24,287
And it really wasn't as big as the one in that

1463
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:26,079
74 whenever he

1464
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:29,919
Well that was when he continued fighting the Civil War by himself

1465
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:34,783
Write whatever he was actually fighting in the Revolutionary War there was

1466
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:35,807
The collapse of the

1467
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,087
Town back then

1468
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:39,647
Then whenever he was

1469
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,695
Fighting for Galls

1470
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,255
There is a collapse

1471
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:50,655
On what episode is Sean Connery in Highland

1472
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:56,287
Episode I don't remember where it was

1473
01:15:56,799 --> 01:16:02,943
I meant also on another episode another episode he said he's related to Nathan

1474
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:09,343
Bedford Forrest confederate general the person who invented the stock

1475
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:18,559
Annoying kids use like I'm just ended from Cleopatra

1476
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,607
What are you talkin about

1477
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:24,447
Disparate pieces

1478
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,983
Yeah

1479
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:29,567
Spell statistically isn't it something like if its eighth generation

1480
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:35,967
Back we're all related to everybody or something along those lines literally almost everybody is related to Genghis Khan

1481
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:36,735
Kangaskhan has

1482
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:37,503
But

1483
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:44,159
80% like 5% of China's population is entirely descended from Genghis Khan

1484
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:49,535
Anyway we are now done with July 8th kind of boring

1485
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,559
Stuff that we talked about

1486
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,327
The past

1487
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,095
And now

1488
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,375
We get on

1489
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,143
2

1490
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:54,911
July

1491
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:56,703
July 9th

1492
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:59,263
This is what I think is illustrative

1493
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,287
The list

1494
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,847
I think it's

1495
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,871
About Alex Jones

1496
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:05,407
Weather broadcast

1497
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,783
He goes from

1498
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:11,551
Collapse

1499
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:13,599
Sandy Hook one day collapse

1500
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,367
The next day

1501
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:16,159
And onto July 9th

1502
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,695
This episode is

1503
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,255
When he debuts is lineup

1504
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,023
Zupas

1505
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,559
Might as well

1506
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:28,703
This episode is all about this MTV show that

1507
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:33,055
There there was a preview that came out for an MTV show called

1508
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:39,199
In the show

1509
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:42,271
Desire reporter Washington Post

1510
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:48,415
Set out to make white people understand

1511
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:49,951
The nature of white

1512
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,999
Understand

1513
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,535
Systems of Oppression

1514
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,559
These sorts of things

1515
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:58,911
The trailer for the show is mostly white kids crying

1516
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:02,751
Alex

1517
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:06,591
Alex is furious.

1518
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:09,919
He spent almost the entire episode complaining about the show

1519
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:10,943
It's complete lunacy

1520
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:14,015
But before he does at the beginning of the episode

1521
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,295
He's got it something else.

1522
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:18,623
Scroll scroll which is

1523
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:19,903
The gay agenda

1524
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,743
This is Sumner redstone

1525
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:29,375
Nickelodeon

1526
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:34,751
In a corporate press release

1527
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:41,151
With transgender and homosexual messages

1528
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:48,063
Sexual sex messages

1529
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,599
When they're six years old

1530
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:00,607
It's creepy but not really

1531
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:19,039
I mean it is just Twilight Zone level

1532
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:22,367
Alex Jones

1533
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:28,767
19 okay okay Nickelodeon

1534
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:30,303
150 women before he was

1535
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:33,887
16 have sex with another man

1536
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:34,911
Turn off

1537
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:39,263
Stay he didn't even know about that

1538
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:43,103
Disconnected misunderstanding about the idea

1539
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:46,431
Of making queer kids feel okay

1540
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:48,479
Normal

1541
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:55,135
Sexualizing people

1542
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,159
Also

1543
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:59,231
What do you mean if you send a six-year-old sex mess

1544
01:19:59,487 --> 01:19:59,999
Messages

1545
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:02,559
A six-year-old can turn on TV

1546
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:05,631
That's true that's what you're talkin about

1547
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:08,959
But that's what I'm saying you can find CVS for adults

1548
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:10,495
I'm fine flat affect

1549
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,031
Watch Franklin & Bash

1550
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:16,640
Heterosexual sex messages all the f******

1551
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:19,456
Remember where Alex just doesn't notice it because

1552
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,736
It doesn't matter

1553
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:27,136
Crying here is sort of the ideas of making

1554
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:30,208
Characters who are gay or lesbian or trans

1555
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,256
We shouldn't

1556
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:37,120
Creating positive role model

1557
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,240
People have these

1558
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,032
Identities

1559
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,568
From very young ages

1560
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:49,152
It's not something that comes up

1561
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:51,456
I guess I can people discover things later in life

1562
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:53,248
The time people

1563
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:58,368
Before they even understand what gender is no different

1564
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:01,440
Doesn't matter

1565
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,464
Previous episode

1566
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:03,744
Talking about

Trans identity from you

1568
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:11,936
Everybody who identified

1569
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,960
Once they were in the

1570
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,032
Percent went on

1571
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:16,800
To identify

1572
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:20,128
Was like 40%

1573
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,552
Like you can be

1574
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,088
From the get-go

1575
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:32,160
Understanding

1576
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:38,560
You shouldn't be made to feel shame all day everyday it doesn't understand is that there's a difference between

1577
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:43,680
Encouraging someone to do something being okay with them doing something

1578
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:46,752
There's a

1579
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:47,776
I haven't messaging

1580
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:50,336

Yeah that's what I say

1584
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:58,528
Just to say

1585
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,808
If you are

1586
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:02,112
You should feel fine about it

1587
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:04,416
What I do is I go to elementary school

1588
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,184

1589
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:09,792

I hope the doctor removes

1598
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:30,016
Started into his own a******

1599
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:33,856

1604
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,840
It is a long ramp

1605
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,120
It has to do with race

1606
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:47,680
Let's do let's do it

1607
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,704
Cult conditioning

1608
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:56,896
So he's like the end of the

1609
01:22:57,152 --> 01:23:03,296
The hour or something is like all I've been talking about MTV too long

1610

Stop

1612
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,440
I guess that is part of this

1613
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:14,816
Common illegal alien on TV

1614
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:23,520

Proud of themselves

1629
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:51,328
With your child

1630
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:54,912
It's their child

1631
01:24:55,168 --> 01:25:00,544
Kids want their parents

1632
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:05,152

Suspension system

1641
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:50,720
Before that can happen

1642
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,792
They have to take out men

1643
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:59,680
Selected

1644
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,336
The nesting areas

Starting point

1653
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:53,952
Want you to be whatever gender you're not

1654
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,744
Because you're

1655
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,024

Yeah this is him like completely misunderstanding reality like

1666
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:53,344
Just basic biology like you just doesn't have any

1667
01:27:56,416 --> 01:28:00,768
Female and then some became male in the biological prototype

1668

01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:09,728
He doesn't understand events with all mammals and birds

1672
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:13,568
Not at all he doesn't largely all of that is

1673
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:15,104
Like a cultural construct

1674
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,664
That's all

1675
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,968
So stupid

1676
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:24,576
Is just bigotry

1677
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,856
What

1678
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:35,072
It's like he's describing a cartoon

1679
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:41,984
Like that's what he just described Felix the Cat cartoon from the 1930s

1680
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,520
Or whenever

1681
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,800
Color

Be like okay

1686
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,904
Let me tell you about how let me tell you the story of the birds and the bees

1687
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:03,488
What junior college class that he dropped out of the dealer net

1688
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,560
So the other thing now is he's doing all this

1689
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:08,608
Like a little girl do you want to be a boy

1690
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:10,144
That was that was very crate

1691
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:16,544

01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:22,688
Set the doctor asked

1696
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:23,968
Her daughter

1697
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:25,504
Are you a girl

1698
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,600
Which is a reasonable question to ask

1699
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:31,136
It's sort of a silly question

1700
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:33,440
I remember getting questions like that from doctors

1701
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:35,744
They have children

1702
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,768
Simple question

1703
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,048
And stuff like that

1704
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:39,584
In order to create a report

1705
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,144
Cuz there a stranger

1706
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:48,800
How old are you how many times has like a six-year-old come up to you and

1707
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:59,808
For me it doesn't even have to do necessarily with some sort of the fairies transgender

1708
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,600
It has to do with a doctor

1709
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:07,232
Made up drinks right more to do with the doctor with probably clunky bedside manner

1710
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,256
More than anything else

1711
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:17,728
Fluoride McDonald's McFlurry

1712
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,568
Weigh-off

1713
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,848
Really awful

1714
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,152
And Alex

1715
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:26,176
Even more often

1716
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,272
What is

1717
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,296
I can't even do that voice

1718
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:33,088
Anymore it's really starting to hurt my throat

1719
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,416
I just

1720
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:38,208
I just don't understand

1721
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,744
I don't understand how you can

1722
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,024
Turn that into something

1723
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,304
Nefarious

1724
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,352
But I mean I mean

1725
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:46,400
That that idea of

1726
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,448
Well

1727
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,472
What goal

1728
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:52,544
Controlling men

1729
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:53,824
Destroying

1730
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,640
Confusing everybody vulcanization

1731
01:30:57,408 --> 01:31:03,552
Use the Edwards

1732
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:06,624
Stupid it's just

1733
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,184
You thinks everything that is not

1734
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,000
Supportive of white

1735
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,792
Heterosexual Christian identity

1736
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:15,840
Is divide-and-conquer strategy

1737
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:16,864
That is it

1738
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:17,632
That's what he said

1739
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:18,912
Do you know what I

1740
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:20,704
Here's the theory that I've started

1741
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:24,032
The more like

1742
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,056
We're not

1743
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:26,336
Full

1744
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:27,616
Creatures

1745
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:29,664
You and I

1746
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,944
I think he's human being

1747
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,248
People talk about how

1748
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,272
The internet

1749
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,040
Is divided

1750
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:37,600
Siri is more becoming

1751
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:39,648
Look at how far you have to

1752
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:41,696
To go to deny your own human

1753
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,000
Okay look at how

1754
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,024
Look at how

1755
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:46,560
Twisted

1756
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:47,328
And like

1757
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:49,632
Look at how big this ideology

1758
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:51,680
He has to be for him to just say

1759
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:58,336
I'm freaked out by trans people

1760
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:03,456
Nation of globalists are trying to baba baba baba baba baba

1761
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,320
You're also not

1762
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:10,880
Into account with that how much

1763
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:11,648
She needs

1764
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:12,416
Cover

1765
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:15,488
He needs to protect his business in

1766
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,280
Mystery

1767
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:23,168
F*** you. I just wish I just wish you would come out

1768
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:27,008
Hey it makes me feel uncomfortable because I don't understand

1769
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:33,408
So far outside my window in the world and

1770
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:39,552
Can't be flexible about it all

1771
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:42,368
Like I would be interested in having that discussion

1772
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:45,184
If you say to me like

1773
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,488
I get

1774
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:50,816
To transfer

1775
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:51,584
People is

1776
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:52,864
Revulsion

1777
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,912
I'm not fine with that

1778
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:55,936
Because

1779
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:57,472
I think it's an okay reaction

1780
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:59,264
I'm fine with that because you're just

1781
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,056
How you feel

1782
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:04,128
Really you don't really have a

1783
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:07,712
If you don't have any framework for that like I grew up

1784
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,480
Small town

1785
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:09,760
If I

1786
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:12,064
Just stayed in that small town forever where is

1787
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,600
It's just a bunch of

1788
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:14,624
Who look like me

1789
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,160
And then I see some

1790
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:17,184
Something that is so

1791
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,512
8 of that like someone with mismatched socks

1792
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:25,376
Freak

1793
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:26,400
Right right

1794
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:29,728
Of course your your basic tribal inside

1795
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:30,752
Is like

1796
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:31,520
Oh that's

1797
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,288
An enemy

1798
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,312
Something along those

1799
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:36,896
Describing is essential to go to college

1800
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:39,200
It's important for people to go away to college

1801
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:41,248
People just go other

1802
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,808
Yeah it's big and you should have crazy

1803
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,624
It's important for you to

1804
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,904
Have those feelings

1805
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:48,928
Emmett Beacon

1806
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:50,976
Confronted with reality and grow through it

1807
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:56,864
That's what I'm saying because quite frankly I thought

1808
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,144
Incredibly f*****-up

1809
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,472
Because most of my contacts for it was listening to Loveline

1810
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:04,288
Very Anti Trans

1811
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:05,312
He is

1812
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,592
You super like

1813
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,640
It's just weirdo dudes

1814
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:09,664
And stuff like that

1815
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:11,968
I'm so that was my contacts for everything

1816
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:12,992
Until I met

1817
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:14,272
Some people who identify this

1818
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,064
Conversation

1819
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,880
And watch some documentaries and looked into

1820
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:21,440
Little bit more had a crisis of

1821
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:25,024
Oh I don't trust this Adam Carolla that I listen to for so long

1822
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:28,864
And you grow through it if you could just

1823
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:29,632
Admit that

1824
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,192
Converse and then like

1825
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,216
Experian

1826
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:39,616
So stay just behind all of this

1827
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:43,456
That's how I can get away with having a conversation with a transfer

1828
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:45,504
Who is completely and utterly

1829
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:51,904
Normal and reasonable in all of those things so I can never be that there with the globalist framework is

1830
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,512
Fortunate

1831
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:57,280
Exactly

1832
01:34:57,536 --> 01:35:03,680
And that's the same thing that

1833
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:05,472
Hiding behind like the

1834
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:07,520
Care of your weight or black or whatever

1835
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:11,872
No you do admit you care and then we can deal with it

1836
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:18,016
We're also getting too I think it's dangerous for people who are young is because

1837
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:21,344
If you do get this brain virus of the globalist

1838
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,648
Some stuff like that into your head too early

1839
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,184
You don't really have any

1840
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,720
Escape Plan you don't have a hat

1841
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:28,000
You can get out of

1842
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:29,792
Like with Adam carolla's

1843
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:30,560
Bigotry

1844
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,864
I was very able to get away

1845
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:33,888
Because it

1846
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:38,240
Not defended by anything other than

1847
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:41,056
Whereas if Adam Carolla was saying

1848
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:47,456
If he's very about there is an evil cabal that is making people do things because they have a vested interest in

1849
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:51,808
Destroying masculinity it would be much more difficult for me even when

1850
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,344
Confronted with reality

1851
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,880
I to get away from

1852
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:56,160
Cuz there's a mythology

1853
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,208
It's a story

1854
01:35:58,464 --> 01:35:59,232
That you can

1855
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:00,768
Reinforced again

1856
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:07,168
And so then that also

1857
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:09,728
It's across-the-board

1858
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,264
His his place

1859
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:14,592
Michaels.com

1860
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,360
Equally across

1861
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:20,224
Not everything is private property

1862
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:23,552
Self-defense and don't make me feel guilty about being white

1863
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:25,600
What do you think about even those things

1864
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:28,160
Take private property out of because

1865
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:30,976
Second Amendment is self-assigned

1866
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:33,792
National

1867
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:37,120
Is the things that he's super

1868
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:43,008
Conversation

1869
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,056
So this next clip

1870
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:50,688
We get into more specific feelings that he has about this white people show

1871
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:52,992
This is kind of a short clip but it's Alex Jones

1872
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,040
Baby mocking

1873
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:55,808
About

1874
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:58,624
People believe the reality about races

1875
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:06,816
I mean

1876
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:19,360
I don't think he's coming from a genuine cartoon character to he can get out some truth

1877
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:21,152
Feelings that he has that he is afraid

1878
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:22,176
People calling a race

1879
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:23,456
Because that is

1880
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:25,760
And who conceptional able to people use

1881
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:26,784
To take power over

1882
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:31,136
I meant when I said the reality is

1883
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:33,952
I believe that racism is a bigger problem than terrorism

1884
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:36,000
Viabill

1885
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:38,560
Yeah and he's doing that mocking voice

1886
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:39,328
To sort of

1887
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:42,656
Take discredit that opinion

1888
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:48,032
Very small problem compared to ingrained

1889
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:49,824
Deeply entrenched racist

1890
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,688
His belief that our president

1891
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:55,712
Is actively

1892
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:56,480
Destroying the world

1893
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:58,528
Well-known

1894
01:37:59,040 --> 01:37:59,808
He's a f****** Loop

1895
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:01,344
It is the entire G

1896
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:05,696
Also because I wanted to get that

1897
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:06,976
Foundation

1898
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,304
Being called racist is the worst thing

1899
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,608
Justin advances this next clip

1900
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:15,680
Which I think is one of the craziest things out Jones ever say

1901
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:18,496
Antonio Vargas

1902
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:23,360
Is a journalist immigration

1903
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:33,344
He was part of the Washington Post team

1904
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:36,416
Recover to the Virginia Tech shooting

1905
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:44,864
Broadcast in 2004

1906
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:51,520
Pushes the DREAM Act for the children

1907
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:07,904
I just

1908
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:23,520
Got beat up quite a few times that racist white people you money

1909
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:27,104
People did Martin Luther King's batac by Whitefield

1910
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:31,456
Just like the white people

1911
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:49,120
And we've been given this guilt

1912
01:39:57,312 --> 01:40:00,384
I really do care about you I really do

1913
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:03,200
52%

1914
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:10,880
Flies

1915
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:31,104
Bargain world government

1916
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:36,224
So Alex Jones is like Martin Luther King

1917
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:40,320
Jordan

1918
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:48,000
You got a tough time with that

1919
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:54,400
I did not do well with that I did take the headphones off first the first time taking the headphones off

1920
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:55,680
The second is the second

1921
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:59,008
Do you know why I was the second you know I remember the last time

1922
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:04,128
He was very much very very weird

1923
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:05,920
Very weird

1924
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:08,736
It is almost convincing

1925
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,272
Just say that

1926
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:11,040
Does

1927
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,576
Care about everybody like

1928
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:18,208
A whiskey the number of black people

1929
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:18,976
To keep shifting

1930
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:25,376
49% is 51% of 52 percentage in that ballpark

1931
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:26,656
Not have it like

1932
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:27,424
Straight

1933
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:29,472
He's not quoting any

1934
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:34,848
It's my also Gardasil there are negative side effects

1935
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:35,616
Can come up

1936
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:37,920
But all of them are much better than cervical cancer

1937
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:41,504
So

1938
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,296
There's a necessity

1939
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,088
To play this game words

1940
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,880
Hbv isn't bad

1941
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:50,720
That's not the problem HPV in women doesn't lead to cervical cancer often

1942
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:53,024
It's a big deal doesn't really matter for

1943
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,304
That it's just warts

1944
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,072
Produce

1945
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:58,144
Doesn't really do anything all that terrible

1946
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:00,448
Watch for women it is a very big issue

1947
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:03,776
And so the idea that he doesn't have to

1948
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:04,544
Scared

1949
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:09,408
Really

1950
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,432
Gets rid of

1951
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:11,968
Biggest causes a circle

1952
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:12,736
Okay a

1953
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:13,504
So

1954
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:17,856
It means even he's not being specific about adjust

1955
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:20,928
Women what does that mean

1956
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:24,000
Epsom salt

1957
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:30,144
Direct competitors

1958
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:31,680
His

1959
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:34,240
I understand where you're coming from almost

1960
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,520
But it's not

1961
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:36,544
Because he's the wrong

1962
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:37,824
Bulshit spaghetti

1963
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:40,384
Does

1964
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:42,176
I do think

1965
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,456
In his mind

1966
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,248
He believed

1967
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,528
That he cares about

1968
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:51,904
What do you think that he and his mind really believe that he's been beat up as much as Martin Luther King

1969
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:56,512
Do I think he believes it well that's proof that he doesn't know any

1970
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:58,816
I don't I think he believes it

1971
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:01,888
Okay it's obviously not true

1972
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:03,424
He's convinced himself of it

1973
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,192
Reality

1974
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:06,752
If he's ever

1975
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,056
Been in prison

1976
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:10,592
Because he's white

1977
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:13,408
If he's ever

1978
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:15,456
Had people throw bombs at his house

1979
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:19,040
He has not been imprisoned because

1980
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:21,600
Aziz light

1981
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:29,792
Is like

1982
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:31,840
He keeps referring to these fight

1983
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:34,912
Regarding it as a used but most of those are street fights

1984
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:37,728
Nothing was Art racially-motivated Attack

1985
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:39,008
Whether or not they happen

1986
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:40,288
And it all is still in quest

1987
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,824
It's very dubious

1988
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,360
But at the same time it's

1989
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:44,640
He seems to think

1990
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:46,944
That these fights that he had a part in

1991
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:47,968
Getting into

1992
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:50,528
Depression

1993
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:51,296
And they're not

1994
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:53,344
They're just him as a kid

1995
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:54,880
Being obviously full of s***

1996
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:56,416
Obviously an a******

1997
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:59,488
He claimed he slept with 150 women

1998
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:01,792
16 he was kicked out of his school

1999
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:02,560
4 year from

2000
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:03,328
For fighting

2001
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,632
He's he's a guy who when he was young

2002
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,192
I mean embellishing every

2003
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:09,216
Except

2004
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:09,984
Endicott school for you

2005
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:12,544
The guy who was like

2006
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:14,592
He he was a problem kid

2007
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:19,456
It's I don't think I bet he did have a couple of times book called

2008
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,736
Cracker for something like

2009
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:22,016
I would believe

2010
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:23,808
But I don't believe

2011
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:25,856
He's been targeted for being white

2012
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:30,720
Of course not and it's degrading for him to compare himself horse number

2013
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:36,608
Degrading for everybody but Nelson Mandela

2014
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:38,400
Yeah

2015
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:39,424
Yep

2016
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,288
Our old friend is back

2017
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,872

Aeropress

2020
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,688
But Christ

2021
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:52,736
Still on the July 9th episode

2022
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:58,880
Our old friend Larry Nichols comes back

2023
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:00,416
Martin Luther King

2024
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:04,512
Martin Luther King jr. is it a no

2025
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:08,096
Earliest

2026
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:12,192
Sure

2027
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:13,728
How do you

2028
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:14,752
Bengal

2029
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,312
Civil rights

2030
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:18,848
Movement into I think

2031
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:21,152
Beat up more than Martin Luther

2032
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:24,224
I got pea

2033
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,016
Of the entire

2034
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:27,552
Civil Rights Movement

2035
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:30,112
Was MLK got beat up a bunch

2036
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:31,648
And then black people

2037
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:35,232
But because that is the masculine way to look at it

2038
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:37,792
Toxic masculinity

2039
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:40,352
How much do you believe in what you believe in

2040
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,680
Ma'am

2041
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,496

Stevie Larry Nicks

2045
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:55,200
He throws a lot of bulshit around about how again Alex is our only shot

2046
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:56,224
But this time

2047
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:57,248
He is f***

2048
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:58,528
Soliciting money

2049
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:00,064
Hard

01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,440
Are you just asking for money

2052
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:10,560
Narratives that Chelsea is not Bill Clinton's daughter

2053
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:14,144
That's his step one of his big is Big narrative

2054
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:19,008
I'll bet you dropped this one this is this is Larry Nichols moment of the day

2055
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:28,480
Indian education campaign

01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:39,232
Here's what's going to come

2058
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:41,536

2059
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:46,400
Delete

2060

Call Joel

2061
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:53,312
Turning us into an Islamic caliphate

Stop that from happening

2063
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:08,672

To see all these things that Larry Nichols believe

2068
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:26,848
Such a bummer

2069
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:28,640
Obama

2070
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:31,456

01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:46,560
You have to leave the leader of

2076
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:47,328
Islam

2077
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:50,400
Worldwide

2078
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:52,704
He's trying to start caliphate

2079
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:57,056
No but this actually is in line with that interview that he did with Mother Jones

2080
01:47:58,336 --> 01:48:01,920
He was talking about how Clinton's are our only hope

2081
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:07,552
Of destroying Islam because they're cold-blooded

2082
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:13,696
Contradict entirely all the other stuff that he says about

2083
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:14,720
Destroy the world

2084
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:16,512
She's going to turn us into

2085
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:18,048
Describe

2086
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:19,072
Is communism

2087
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:19,840
He describes it as

2088
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:23,168
Destruction of America

2089
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:26,496
He is an unreliable maybe a big fan

2090
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:28,544
He needs money

2091
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:33,408
You wants to be interesting so Alex will have him back on his show so people will send

2092
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:35,968
Money

2093
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:41,600
How old Obama become the leader of Islam globally

2094
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:43,392
Conversation

2095
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:51,328
Do you feel about Indonesia

2096
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,144
Nickelsville

2097
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:57,216
Billions of people who are Muslim or not

2098
01:48:57,984 --> 01:49:00,288
It's not from the Middle East

2099
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:03,872
Probably not

2100
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:08,224
There's tons of Chinese Muslims there's

2101
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:09,504
American

2102
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:12,576
What would we would Obama done have

2103
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:20,256
There's also different branches of Islam but definitely wouldn't all fall under Obama

2104
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:21,792
Civilization game

2105
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:24,864
Don't bring the tempering Sampson today

2106
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:28,704
Okay if

2107
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:32,544
Two hexagons to the left that will be in the appropriate place

2108
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:37,664
I'd like to point out at this point that I haven't liked

2109
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,200
Ignored or cut out stuff that

2110
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:40,224
He said about Trump

2111
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:41,248
You still is

2112
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:42,784
Exactly in the same position

2113
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:43,552
He has been

2114
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:44,320
Sense

2115
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:45,344
July 2nd

2116
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:46,624
But now

2117
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:47,904
We get to July 10th

2118
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:49,696
Can Alex Jones is out of school

2119
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:51,488
David Knight

2120
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:53,280
And it is our tradition to never listen

2121
01:49:53,536 --> 01:49:55,584
David Knight correct

2122
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,120
No no

2123
01:49:57,376 --> 01:50:01,472
I accidentally how did you do that I accidentally listen to

2124
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:02,240
Because

2125
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:03,008
At the beginning

2126
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:07,104
David Knight says Alex Jones will be in later with a special report

2127
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:10,432
How to spell ice

2128
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,456
And I couldn't find

2129
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:13,248
I'm not going to listen to the whole thing

2130
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:15,552
But I accidentally found this clip

2131
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:17,088
And it is amazing

2132
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:17,856
David Knight

2133
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:18,624
Is crazy

2134
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:28,352
Came in and told me that he went to Disney World in the 1970s

2135
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:32,448
Ride

2136
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:39,872
Soldan in

2137
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:40,640
Anaheim

2138
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:41,920
And you know that

2139
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:48,320
Sisqo Let It Go

2140
01:50:54,208 --> 01:51:00,352
They had the song

2141
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:08,288
Fun Whimsical character

2142
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:15,200
Here's a gun by and we went back to Disneyland and always

2143
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:18,272
Has completely changed

2144
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:36,448
Aspersion taken out

2145
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:40,800
Takeout

2146
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:43,616
I thought one of the most beautiful things about it was

2147
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:50,016
No no of the older black man Henry

2148
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:53,600
1940s

2149
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:55,648
Animation mixed with live action everything

2150
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:57,440
Yeah buddy

2151
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:01,280
No negative talk about Song of the South

2152
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:03,072
Have they ever seen song

2153
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:04,096
I watched it

2154
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:09,216
What I was seeing for a little while accidentally found it

2155
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:09,984
You don't

2156
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:27,392
Old man who tells stories is a horrible

2157
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:29,696
Black stereotype

2158
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:34,560
Is Karima sound also

2159
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:39,424
Splash Mountain is based on

2160
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:41,216
They just took out all of the races

2161
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:46,592
It's top of the

2162
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:47,872
It was Song of the South

2163
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:57,344
Splash Mountain the original

2164
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:00,416
And they're like little things

2165
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:04,512
Retained from the ridge

2166
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:05,536
As I understand

2167
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:06,560
But also

2168
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:07,584
You're totally right

2169
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:10,144
Don't let go

2170
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,424
You're not

2171
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:14,496
David Knight

2172
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:16,288
You ain't right

2173
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:23,712
What do you mean the most racist people I can think of aren't going to jump on

2174
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:27,552
Song of the South is weird

2175
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:30,368
But also

2176
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:32,416
They took down song in the

2177
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:37,280
For you that you're like

2178
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:43,680
I'm going to get to engineer to chime and about how Song of the South isn't the ride at Disney anymore and he discovered

2179
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:45,984
Years ago we were just talking about it over the break

2180
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:50,592
What the f*** is going on in their Studio

2181
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:51,360
The night

2182
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:52,384
Now we get to the 10

2183
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:56,736
Oh I'm sorry

2184
01:53:56,992 --> 01:54:00,064
Like I would love to be in the studio for a day and just be the f***

2185
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:00,832
Chaos

2186
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:10,560
There've been plenty of times where they just don't know where Alex is

2187
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:12,096
Like yeah that's true

2188
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:16,960
There's got to be all kinds of weird s*** being talked about when he's allegedly in court

2189
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:19,264
So I'm sorry that was

2190
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,800
The temps the David Knight was hosting

2191
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,104
I'm sorry that was

2192
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:23,872
Friday

2193
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:28,736
Amman deal

2194
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,272
At Disney

2195
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:41,536
So

2196
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,072
Because that is a Saturday

2197
01:54:43,328 --> 01:54:45,376
And we come back on the 12th

2198
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:46,400
I'm here

2199
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:48,704
Three of the last four Clips I have for you

2200
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:52,544
He gets to talk in a bit more about Trump

2201
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:53,312
At this point

2202
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:54,592
After July 12th

2203
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:56,384
The other clip I have

2204
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:57,920
Involved

2205
01:54:58,176 --> 01:54:58,688
My fear

2206
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:01,248
My current insane Theory

2207
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:03,808
Yeah I'm loving

2208
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:06,368
This clip

2209
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:10,464
On the 12th show where he spells out some more of his feelings about Donald

2210
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:12,512
Call Donald Trump

2211
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:21,984
Universe

2212
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:26,848
America

2213
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:30,432
Smartphone

2214
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:32,480
The felons coming in

2215
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:36,064
Schoolyard

2216
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:41,440
He's the worst person in the world

2217
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:44,256
Common sense

2218
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:53,216
And it's perfect because Trump is a huge Hillary Clinton donor

2219
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:55,264
I don't trust him as far as I can throw him

2220
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:57,312
But he thinks that the truth

2221
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:58,080
That is

2222
01:55:58,592 --> 01:56:00,640
Les Fargo get thrown out

2223
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:07,808
Republican

2224
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:10,624
Trump

2225
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:13,952
Okay so now we're starting to see the

2226
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:14,720
The first signs of

2227
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,816
Of course

2228
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:21,888
Might have some thoughts about waiheke

2229
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:23,424
Why is that

2230
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,472
Well remember on the last episode

2231
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:26,496
He's mocking

2232
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:30,336
Remember how you were speculating that I was making too big a deal out of

2233
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:32,384
Yes well I would like you to listen to this

2234
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:35,968
Does John do come back is your issue

2235
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:36,992
But

2236
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:39,040
Donald Trump owns a bunch of casinos

2237
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:52,608
More

2238
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:59,008
Donald Trump

2239
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:16,160
Well with a name like Donald Trump's they don't come after you with a name like Corleone

2240
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:19,232
Alright

2241
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:22,304
He hasn't from high-level source

2242
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:28,704
Yeah but he has everything from high-level sources reality

2243
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:32,288
This this is something that people came document

2244
01:57:33,312 --> 01:57:36,128
He would have this information from high-level sources

2245
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:38,176
I mean he could have it from anybody

2246
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:39,200
But it is true

2247
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:40,736
That's the difference

2248
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:42,016
Between

2249
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:43,552
Other high-level sources

2250
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:46,112
Weird globalist to runs into on planes

2251
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:49,184
Weird

2252
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,976
On this one he's right

2253
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:51,744
Like I can

2254
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:52,768
Conceived

2255
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:59,424
I can't allow myself to live in a world where broken clocks. Everything Alex Jones says is

2256
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:00,192
Elderly wrong

2257
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:02,240
The stuff he said about Trump

2258
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:04,800
Before he became Trump's biggest

2259
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:07,104
100% Act

2260
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:09,920
Again we have to come back to what I was explaining

2261
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:11,712
On the last episode that it is

2262
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:14,784
The reality of this the truth of it is he is

2263
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:16,832
Him saying that Trump has

2264
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:18,112
Extensive mob connection

2265
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:19,392
Is true

2266
01:58:19,648 --> 01:58:21,952
To Alex Jones

2267
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:23,744
What's relevant

2268
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,280
Is that he believes that

2269
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:28,608
He's repeated it multiple times over the course of

2270
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:29,888
The last episode

2271
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:30,656
Going

2272
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:35,008
Further and further spelling out how he knows it

2273
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:39,616
That's true

2274
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:40,896
Hi all this stuff

2275
01:58:41,152 --> 01:58:42,944
Jesus Shady people all around him

2276
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:44,736
That's not nothing

2277
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:47,040
Even if he was wrong

2278
01:58:47,296 --> 01:58:48,832
That's still the narrative

2279
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:50,112
Just like

2280
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:51,392
Sandy Hook

2281
01:58:51,648 --> 01:58:52,416
False Flags

2282
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:53,440
Yeah

2283
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:54,208
Still here

2284
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:56,256
He's doing

2285
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:57,536
Trump propaganda

2286
01:58:59,072 --> 01:59:01,376
Because he's super into Ron Paul

2287
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:06,496
Remove now to the last day of our investigation

2288
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:07,264
Simplify 30

2289
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:10,080
And on this show

2290
01:59:10,336 --> 01:59:11,104
Alex Jones

2291
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:13,664
He's on some weird s***

2292
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,688
He's he's doing

2293
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:15,456
Some weird s*** on the

2294
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:19,552
On the 12th I just played those two clips

2295
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:21,344
Most of the shows by collapse

2296
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,368
Narratives

2297
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:24,416
And he also was worried about

2298
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:25,440
Censoring history

2299
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:28,000
We talked about the flag Bunch the Battle Flag

2300
01:59:28,512 --> 01:59:29,280
He also admits

2301
01:59:29,536 --> 01:59:30,816
If you own multiple not begun

2302
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:31,840
Put this phone

2303
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:34,144
July 13th

2304
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,704
Any of 10 copies

2305
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:39,008
No David

2306
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,592
Alex Jones is very over

2307
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:45,664
On this episode and very clear that he is against Russia

2308
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:50,784
Because he doesn't think that they are the bad guys

2309
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:52,064
In the Ukraine situation

2310
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:53,344
Again we've been over this

2311
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:54,368
Globalist

2312
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:57,952
Right there just protecting Russian identifying citizens

2313
01:59:58,208 --> 01:59:59,488
In the Ukraine they're coming in

2314
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:01,536
To help them deal with the globalist

2315
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,840
That's just such a weird

2316
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:04,864
Sing for him to

2317
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:06,400
Turn that in

2318
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:08,704
Well always

2319
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:10,240
Pro-america

2320
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:11,264
As he says he

2321
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:14,592
And for his entire like

2322
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:15,872
Cuz he's

2323
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:19,712
Shut that like when we go back to the Y2K he's definitely

2324
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:22,784
The phobic narrative going on strong there much so

2325
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:23,552
So

2326
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:25,600
Him

2327
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:26,880
Putin in the

2328
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:28,160
What's in the Crimea

2329
02:00:28,416 --> 02:00:28,928
Situation seems

2330
02:00:29,184 --> 02:00:29,696
Mind-boggling

2331
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:30,720
Well

2332
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:32,768
Have you already been on RT at the

2333
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,048
I don't know I don't think so

2334
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:35,840
But I do think

2335
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:37,888
That he's starting to become

2336
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:39,168
Switch

2337
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:39,936
Can propaganda

2338
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:42,496
And some of that will play out in this

2339
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:48,128
It's still male-driven

2340
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:51,200
Basically almost

2341
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:56,320
Yeah

2342
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:17,568
Because I already went through it under Tommy population

2343
02:01:17,824 --> 02:01:19,872
Been in the jaws of this forever

2344
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:26,016
They still got correct

2345
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:28,832
But really what's going on

2346
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:36,000
State-run TV

2347
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:38,816
They're pushing narratives that are similar to him

2348
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:42,400
They're pushing propaganda narratives about how

2349
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:44,960
All of the stuff that we're doing is to

2350
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:46,752
Stop

2351
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:47,776
Right

2352
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:50,848
So it's starting to mirror him

2353
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:55,968
That's what Alexander Dugan

2354
02:01:58,272 --> 02:01:59,296
I think some of that intentional

2355
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:03,648
And then so they pick up on what he's doing he picks up on what they're doing

2356
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:05,696
Turns into a nice little feedback loop

2357
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:08,000
Yep and they can both kind of bounced there

2358
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:09,280
I mean basically

2359
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:10,560
They bounce ideas back

2360
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:12,864
Somewhat

2361
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:13,888
They they

2362
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:15,424
Trade narratives

2363
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:17,984
I think there's a burgeoning propaganda

2364
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:18,752
Glue

2365
02:02:19,008 --> 02:02:19,776
That is beginning

2366
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:21,312
With Russian State television

2367
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:22,592
Alex

2368
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:26,176
If you want to take a step further about that

2369
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:27,456
The reason that I said

2370
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:28,480
The Nigel farage

2371
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:30,016
Was important earlier

2372
02:02:30,528 --> 02:02:31,296
I believe

2373
02:02:32,064 --> 02:02:35,392
Already have positive feelings about Nigel farage

2374
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:36,416
Band

2375
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:39,744
Can't prove it a hundred percent but I would be

2376
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:40,768
Very surprised

2377
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:43,584
He isn't the intermediary for Rodger Stone

2378
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:44,352
And WikiLeaks

2379
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:45,376
Right

2380
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:47,680
Obviously pushing Russian propaganda

2381
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:49,984
Of course I believe that wants Rodger Stone gets

2382
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:51,008
Involved

2383
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:52,800
You take these dormant feeling

2384
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:56,384
And it becomes

2385
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:57,408
Super a

2386
02:02:58,432 --> 02:02:59,200
All this connection

2387
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:00,224
Kitchen comes together

2388
02:03:00,736 --> 02:03:01,504
At the same time

2389
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:02,784
If you look at it

2390
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:06,112
It's so important that all the major players now are

2391
02:03:06,368 --> 02:03:06,880
Gameplay

2392
02:03:07,392 --> 02:03:09,184
They aren't in in in the in the neck

2393
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:10,720
So you have Alex

2394
02:03:10,976 --> 02:03:12,000
With these late thing

2395
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:14,304
Is the big

2396
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:16,608
What is the male identity

2397
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:19,424
Is there racism

2398
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:22,496
The distrust of

2399
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:23,776
Those are two things are

2400
02:03:24,032 --> 02:03:24,544
Throughout

2401
02:03:25,312 --> 02:03:28,384
On top of that eventually you get Rodger stone in there

2402
02:03:28,896 --> 02:03:29,920
You get to be fortunate

2403
02:03:30,176 --> 02:03:31,456
Can there who's not around at all this

2404
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:34,528
He's the one who pitches

2405
02:03:34,784 --> 02:03:35,808
The counter cool narrative

2406
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:37,088
Right.

2407
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:39,648
The clintons are pulling us off too and we

2408
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:42,464
He's not there

2409
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:45,280
Rodger Stone isn't there to pitch

2410
02:03:45,792 --> 02:03:46,560
Overly

2411
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:47,584
Aggressive

2412
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,608
Trump

2413
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:49,376
Stop

2414
02:03:49,632 --> 02:03:53,216
At the same time people like Mike cernovich on around Gavin McGinnis

2415
02:03:53,472 --> 02:03:54,752
Those people are

2416
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:55,520
The

2417
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:57,056
Cool fun trolls

2418
02:03:57,312 --> 02:03:57,824
Guy

2419
02:03:58,592 --> 02:04:01,408
So all these other elements of Alex Jones's

2420
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:04,480
Spear of what

2421
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:05,760
Propaganda

2422
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:07,296
They are in place yet

2423
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:08,832
What we have

2424
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:09,856
Is art

2425
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:10,880
We have ham

2426
02:04:11,136 --> 02:04:11,904
We have dormant

2427
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:13,952
And that's why he doesn't support

2428
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:14,720
Trump yet

2429
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:15,488
IFit

2430
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:18,048
I think that once these other

2431
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:19,072
Much more

2432
02:04:19,328 --> 02:04:20,096
Active players

2433
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:21,120
Get involved

2434
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:22,144
That's when he

2435
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:22,912
Switch

2436
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:25,728
And I know that I already said that I believe that wants Rodger Stone come

2437
02:04:25,984 --> 02:04:27,264
Comes around

2438
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:29,568
Through

2439
02:04:29,824 --> 02:04:30,848
Him

2440
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:34,176
Saying all these super positive things about Nigel

2441
02:04:34,432 --> 02:04:35,968
Saying really

2442
02:04:36,736 --> 02:04:37,760
Dicey things

2443
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:40,064
About Russian propaganda narrative

2444
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:40,832
About Russia

2445
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:42,624
These things

2446
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:43,904
Lead me to believe

2447
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:47,744
I don't know how to spell this out exactly but

2448
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:49,792
Rodger Stone

2449
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:51,584
Probably targeted

2450
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:53,376
I think

2451
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:55,424
Did he knew that Alex had these Lena

2452
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:57,216
He knew that he could use

2453
02:04:58,240 --> 02:04:59,520
That is kind of what I say

2454
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:00,800
Alright

2455
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:02,336
I think that he knew that he could

2456
02:05:02,592 --> 02:05:04,896
Play Stone is the one pulling out

2457
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:11,552
I think it's possible and it certainly fits his pattern of being a dirty Trickster

2458
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:14,112
Opportunistic underhanded

2459
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:15,904
Conservative Republican

2460
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:18,720
Tricks video played throughout his career

2461
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:20,256
And then you figure

2462
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:21,792
Stone is the intermediary

2463
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:25,120
Anybody in Russia

2464
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:29,984
All of the all of the authoritarian

2465
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:31,008
Wright Park

2466
02:05:31,264 --> 02:05:32,288
Propaganda Outlet

2467
02:05:33,312 --> 02:05:35,872
Coming together and creating a unified

2468
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:38,432
Some like the people who are pushing

2469
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:40,224
Brexit really hard are creating the

2470
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:42,016
Property

2471
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:46,880
And a right-wing feedback Russian TV

2472
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:48,160
Everybody in Turkey

2473
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:49,440
You have

2474
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,536
Yeah you have all of these different

2475
02:05:53,792 --> 02:05:54,304
People

2476
02:05:55,584 --> 02:05:56,352
Nn

2477
02:05:56,864 --> 02:05:58,656
Like it's easy to imagine that it's

2478
02:05:59,168 --> 02:05:59,936
Spira see but I

2479
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:01,984
I think it might just be more longer

2480
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:03,008
Signs of

2481
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:04,032
With communication

2482
02:06:04,544 --> 02:06:05,312
Across the globe

2483
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:06,336
More

2484
02:06:07,872 --> 02:06:08,896
Being so easy

2485
02:06:09,408 --> 02:06:10,432
Then we can just find

2486
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:13,504
Yeah opportunist

2487
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:15,808
It's not like everybody

2488
02:06:16,064 --> 02:06:18,112
Together in a backroom comes play

2489
02:06:18,368 --> 02:06:23,488
Oh I like what you're doing let's turn that into a thing that I'm doing and then still want and it just creates

2490
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:24,768
Does bigger and bigger feet

2491
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:27,584
But I also think that there is

2492
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:28,608
An awareness

2493
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:29,632
That

2494
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:31,424
Nationalism is

2495
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:32,704
Is a very easily

2496
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:33,984
Voided

2497
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:36,032
And you can use it to enrich yourself

2498
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:37,824
If you ride the wave ride

2499
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:39,616
Brett it's something

2500
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:41,408
Requires a scapegoat

2501
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:42,176
Globalism

2502
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:42,944
Great Escapes

2503
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:47,296
Very good then so you have Jews also works but it doesn't make sense

2504
02:06:47,552 --> 02:06:48,832
Really for nationalistic

2505
02:06:49,088 --> 02:06:50,112
Countries to

2506
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:50,880
Pulley

2507
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:52,160
Each other

2508
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:56,256
So why is it that

2509
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:57,536
Marine Le Pen

2510
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:01,376
Viraj all of these people keep

2511
02:07:01,888 --> 02:07:03,424
Having the same message

2512
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:05,728
Keep having the same admirers

2513
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:08,032
Annapolis garage seems to run through all of them

2514
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:11,872
Yeah he seems to be a very common threads

2515
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:12,896
And as

2516
02:07:13,152 --> 02:07:13,664
Is Rodger Stone

2517
02:07:14,432 --> 02:07:16,224
Well Rodger Stone through farraj

2518
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:17,504
So

2519
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:20,832
I think that there's something much more nefarious going on here

2520
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:23,136
Alex B

2521
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:25,952
Not be aware of the forces that are at

2522
02:07:27,488 --> 02:07:28,768
That's sort of my feeling

2523
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:30,048
As of press time

2524
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,584
Yeah because

2525
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:33,632
I sincerely could

2526
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:34,400
Beavis

2527
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:35,424
Being

2528
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:36,448
A massive

2529
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:38,240
Dupe

2530
02:07:38,496 --> 02:07:39,008
On the park

2531
02:07:39,264 --> 02:07:39,776
Of Rochester

2532
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:42,336
Well it's interesting

2533
02:07:42,592 --> 02:07:43,872
Something to use Alex

2534
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:45,152
In this regard because he

2535
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:46,176
Too dumb to

2536
02:07:46,432 --> 02:07:46,944
Bring it

2537
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:52,064
Yeah like you don't want him involved in any planning session door having

2538
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:53,088
Any knowledge

2539
02:07:55,648 --> 02:07:56,928
He's too dumb it's that he

2540
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:57,952
Dauriac

2541
02:07:58,208 --> 02:07:58,720
Canary

2542
02:07:58,976 --> 02:08:02,560
If you reveal

2543
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:07,168
He's going to say whatever it is

2544
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:08,960
So yeah I would say

2545
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:10,752
Alex Azar

2546
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:12,032
Lucky idiot

2547
02:08:12,288 --> 02:08:13,056
In this regard

2548
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:16,640
Someone

2549
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:20,736
And he will lose tons of money because of it as well

2550
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:22,272
I know that it's

2551
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:24,064
Still very crazy

2552
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:26,368
For me to be saying that I think

2553
02:08:26,624 --> 02:08:28,416
That there is something incredibly underhanded

2554
02:08:29,184 --> 02:08:30,720
You think there is a global

2555
02:08:30,976 --> 02:08:31,488
Conspiracy

2556
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,024
Might know I don't

2557
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:34,304
I think it's a very localized

2558
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:35,328
Conspiracy

2559
02:08:35,584 --> 02:08:36,096
I think

2560
02:08:36,352 --> 02:08:38,656
It's the small conspiracy

2561
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:40,704
It is real

2562
02:08:41,216 --> 02:08:41,728
And it is

2563
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:42,496
2

2564
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:44,032
Basically destroy

2565
02:08:44,288 --> 02:08:45,056
International

2566
02:08:45,312 --> 02:08:45,824
Body

2567
02:08:46,848 --> 02:08:48,640
That do serve to stop War

2568
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:51,456
Where is the cheap way to get rich

2569
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:54,528
It's so insane to me

2570
02:08:54,784 --> 02:08:58,880
Christopher Steele came out with that. Everyone focused on the P stuff

2571
02:08:59,136 --> 02:09:00,928
But all the rest of it is coming

2572
02:09:01,184 --> 02:09:02,464
Out so hard

2573
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:04,256
Everything

2574
02:09:04,768 --> 02:09:06,560
Trump was secretly trying to lift thanks

2575
02:09:08,608 --> 02:09:11,424
Which is what everyone suspected he was going to do

2576
02:09:12,448 --> 02:09:14,240
The reason that you would do that is be

2577
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:15,520
Because if they raised

2578
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:17,824
The sanction Russia can make tons of money

2579
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:19,360
Obviously

2580
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:20,384
That is him

2581
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:22,688
Pro quo

2582
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:23,712
Wicked mix

2583
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:25,504
No sense to not

2584
02:09:26,528 --> 02:09:27,040
And Alex

2585
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:28,320
Isn't that dumb

2586
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:30,624
Alex

2587
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:33,696
He's not Alex is that dumb

2588
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:35,744
So long as you provide him

2589
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:38,304
That better fits in

2590
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:39,328
Into what he wants

2591
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:42,656
Stupid Trump is fighting your culture War for you

2592
02:09:42,912 --> 02:09:44,192
So

2593
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:49,568
Probably blind him to any number of all of this

2594
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:52,384
The the all of the s*** that he spending now is he

2595
02:09:52,896 --> 02:09:53,408
Bring it back

2596
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:55,456
Economic prosperity

2597
02:09:55,712 --> 02:09:58,016
Everything that you

2598
02:09:58,272 --> 02:09:59,040
Saying that Trump

2599
02:09:59,296 --> 02:09:59,808
Is doing

2600
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:01,088
He's not doing

2601
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:03,136
Is numbers are on the rise

2602
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:04,928
It's obvious he's not doing those things

2603
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:05,952
You know what's fun

2604
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:11,584
Even if you save that the polls are weighted like Alex's 15%

2605
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:12,608
Trump

2606
02:10:12,864 --> 02:10:13,376
20

2607
02:10:14,656 --> 02:10:20,544
Roseate Outlook he's only hated by 5% more of the population than others

2608
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:23,360
I know

2609
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:25,152
I know and you're not even saying that

2610
02:10:25,408 --> 02:10:26,176
I know it's

2611
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:27,456
Crazy just don't mix.

2612
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:28,480
I know that

2613
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:31,296
It's hard to

2614
02:10:31,808 --> 02:10:33,088
Find another

2615
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:36,160
It's hard to find another thing that fit

2616
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:37,184
It's all of the players

2617
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:41,536
But there's obviously another there is another scenario that

2618
02:10:42,048 --> 02:10:42,560
DNR

2619
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:46,400
There are there secret information that we don't know there's unknown unknown

2620
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:47,424
Is Rumsfeld would say

2621
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:50,496
Yeah it's why I recognize that

2622
02:10:50,752 --> 02:10:52,032
It's either that or it's

2623
02:10:52,288 --> 02:10:52,800
Just one of the

2624
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:54,080
Most

2625
02:10:54,592 --> 02:10:57,408
Unlikely coincidences that I can imagine

2626
02:10:57,664 --> 02:11:00,224
All of the stuff arises

2627
02:11:00,736 --> 02:11:02,528
Independently of each other

2628
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:07,136
And miraculously Alex Jones starts hanging out with and promoting

2629
02:11:07,648 --> 02:11:08,416
A guy

2630
02:11:08,672 --> 02:11:12,512
Who is one of Trump's Close Associates former campaign manager

2631
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:13,792
At the same time

2632
02:11:14,048 --> 02:11:17,376
He starts having on Steve pieczenik and spelling this narrative

2633
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:19,168
At the same time

2634
02:11:19,424 --> 02:11:24,800
He brings in a bunch of alt-right pranksters to be on his show to try and make things happen cool

2635
02:11:25,568 --> 02:11:28,128
It doesn't make sense that all of that would start happening

2636
02:11:29,152 --> 02:11:29,664
Like

2637
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:33,504
I'll figure out exactly the time that these things start happening but

2638
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:36,064
Up till now July 13th

2639
02:11:36,832 --> 02:11:38,880
None of those people are around and he doesn't support

2640
02:11:39,648 --> 02:11:40,160
No

2641
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:45,024
If I find that Rodger Stone shows up and he doesn't support Trump

2642
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:47,072
Yeah but I can't imagine that being the case

2643
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:48,864
Yeah I don't know

2644
02:11:50,912 --> 02:11:51,424
From the get-go

2645
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:52,192
Wasn't he

2646
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:58,848
Wasn't Rodger Stone was on Trump's team for campaign manager for a little while

2647
02:12:00,896 --> 02:12:03,968
I think at this point you still involved in the campaign 2015

2648
02:12:04,224 --> 02:12:06,528
Yeah and so once he goes off

2649
02:12:06,784 --> 02:12:08,064
The campaign starts

2650
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:10,368
Unofficially as a propaganda

2651
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:11,392
Right

2652
02:12:11,904 --> 02:12:12,416
So

2653
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:14,464
I don't know

2654
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:15,488
It's really troubling

2655
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:17,536
Stone ghost

2656
02:12:17,792 --> 02:12:18,560
The trumpet says I can

2657
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:19,328
Get you info

2658
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:20,352
The fact

2659
02:12:20,608 --> 02:12:23,424
That Alex is so dismissive and so

2660
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:25,984
About what's going on with Russia

2661
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:27,520
Lead me to believe

2662
02:12:28,032 --> 02:12:28,544
That that is

2663
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:29,824
That is a weekend

2664
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:30,592
For him

2665
02:12:30,848 --> 02:12:31,616
That was exploit

2666
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:33,920
I don't know we'll see

2667
02:12:34,432 --> 02:12:35,456
But we are one more clip

2668
02:12:35,712 --> 02:12:37,760
And it's also from the July 13th episode

2669
02:12:38,272 --> 02:12:39,296
Do you get the collar

2670
02:12:39,808 --> 02:12:40,320
Call Zan

2671
02:12:40,576 --> 02:12:43,136
Counterpoint about Trump

2672
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:46,976
He has a

2673
02:12:47,232 --> 02:12:49,280
Slightly positive argument about Trump

2674
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:52,608
It's interesting that Alex Jones

2675
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:55,680
So even with someone saying positive things about Trump

2676
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:57,472
Here's what Alex says

2677
02:12:57,728 --> 02:12:59,264
This call is about 5 minutes long

2678
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:02,592
And I just want to let it play on uninterrupted because

2679
02:13:02,848 --> 02:13:03,872
It's I mean it

2680
02:13:05,408 --> 02:13:06,688
Totally

2681
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:07,968
Evidence against you

2682
02:13:08,736 --> 02:13:10,784
Okay where Alex Jones

2683
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:14,880
Your phone calls right now

2684
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:18,208
Richard in Illinois in London

2685
02:13:18,464 --> 02:13:21,536
Lionel Richie

2686
02:13:21,792 --> 02:13:24,096
Richard Moyer on the air go ahead

2687
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:31,264
Disagree about Trump and

2688
02:13:31,776 --> 02:13:33,312
It's only because

2689
02:13:34,592 --> 02:13:35,104
I don't think

2690
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:37,152
It's ordered from anybody

2691
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:40,224
Nothing is perfect but

2692
02:13:41,248 --> 02:13:43,040
You mentioned yesterday he was a ringer

2693
02:13:43,552 --> 02:13:45,600
I don't think he takes orders from anybody

2694
02:13:46,112 --> 02:13:47,136
Call Mike Mike

2695
02:13:47,392 --> 02:13:48,928
Parents weekend in Chicago

2696
02:13:50,976 --> 02:13:53,024
Just got off a building

2697
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:54,816
You put this god-awful sign on

2698
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:56,096
Seafood everybody

2699
02:13:56,608 --> 02:13:57,888
Forget the Sun

2700
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:00,704
And I work at Express

2701
02:14:01,472 --> 02:14:01,984
Show off

2702
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:05,824
Hoping you would do is

2703
02:14:06,592 --> 02:14:07,616
If you think it's a ringer

2704
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:09,920
Why don't you invite him on Michelle and ask him

2705
02:14:10,432 --> 02:14:12,736
We have

2706
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:16,064
Niko go after

2707
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:27,328
That

2708
02:14:28,096 --> 02:14:29,120
He suspects

2709
02:14:29,376 --> 02:14:32,704
That that's

2710
02:14:33,472 --> 02:14:35,008
So I'm sorry I interrupted

2711
02:14:36,032 --> 02:14:36,800
I mean bear

2712
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:40,640
He repeats the Jerome corsi who knows Donald Trump is saying that he is

2713
02:14:40,896 --> 02:14:42,944
And as a publicity stunt

2714
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:43,968
Yeah also

2715
02:14:44,736 --> 02:14:46,784
Donald Trump does eventually come on the show

2716
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:47,808
But at this point

2717
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:49,600
He's not answering

2718
02:14:49,856 --> 02:14:50,624
Alex's request

2719
02:14:51,136 --> 02:14:53,440
So even the idea that when Trump comes on

2720
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:55,744
Your your reputation is impeccable

2721
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,024
We're going to be talking a lot

2722
02:14:57,536 --> 02:14:58,560
Clearly if Alex

2723
02:15:03,424 --> 02:15:04,192
Come on of course

2724
02:15:04,448 --> 02:15:05,728
So that part is even

2725
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:07,264
Well there's no way

2726
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:09,824
There's no I would never believe the Trump

2727
02:15:10,592 --> 02:15:12,640
No or at ever heard of it

2728
02:15:13,408 --> 02:15:14,432
Probably heard of it

2729
02:15:14,688 --> 02:15:17,504
Well yeah you probably tweeted out a link

2730
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:20,064
Before that saying about how dumb infowar

2731
02:15:20,576 --> 02:15:21,088
Maybe

2732
02:15:21,344 --> 02:15:26,464
Going by Oliver Trump's tweets about Obama and how they're the exact opposite of

2733
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:30,304
Yeah f****** he doesn't believe anything there's no beliefs

2734
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:32,096
But at this point

2735
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:35,424
Is ignoring Trump

2736
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:37,728
He doesn't care

2737
02:15:37,984 --> 02:15:39,264
You want

2738
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:43,360
Even though you got course

2739
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:47,968
Imagine

2740
02:15:48,736 --> 02:15:52,320
And what he's doing

2741
02:16:01,024 --> 02:16:03,840
Birth certificate

2742
02:16:04,352 --> 02:16:06,656
His horses

2743
02:16:09,984 --> 02:16:11,776
My gut has never been wrong

2744
02:16:16,896 --> 02:16:21,760
Bachata

2745
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:33,792
He's a front man for some people

2746
02:16:34,048 --> 02:16:36,608
Are worth

2747
02:16:36,864 --> 02:16:38,912
78 million

2748
02:16:45,312 --> 02:16:49,152
Trump

2749
02:16:52,224 --> 02:16:54,528
But by his actions

2750
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,328
I've had a chance to

2751
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:15,264
I just I don't even feel good

2752
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:19,616
I don't like

2753
02:17:34,464 --> 02:17:36,256
Somebody else's rigged game

2754
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:39,072
If it's a fake

2755
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:41,632
Chomps Campbell

2756
02:17:44,192 --> 02:17:46,496
It ruins a lot of lives

2757
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:55,456
I agree with most of them

2758
02:18:05,696 --> 02:18:06,464
Miserable

2759
02:18:06,976 --> 02:18:08,256
They did not smile

2760
02:18:08,768 --> 02:18:10,816
You could tell they were exhausted

2761
02:18:12,096 --> 02:18:12,864
Exhaust

2762
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:16,960
He is moving the Overton window

2763
02:18:17,216 --> 02:18:21,568
Libertarian as rampal as a rampaul supporter

2764
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:23,104
I kind of support

2765
02:18:26,944 --> 02:18:28,736
He's all bad when

2766
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:32,832
Overton window

2767
02:18:33,088 --> 02:18:35,136
I don't know or are you wrong

2768
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:39,488
Generally you're not wrong I agree with a lot of what you say matter of fact

2769
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:43,840
That's the last night for meeting my wife was at a tangerine but I have every morning

2770
02:18:44,864 --> 02:18:48,192
But there's something marijuana plant Richard

2771
02:18:48,448 --> 02:18:51,776
You're a plant

2772
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:55,104
Doctor fish

2773
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:57,152
I can't pronounce his last name

2774
02:18:58,432 --> 02:19:01,760
He might be able to give a really good

2775
02:19:02,016 --> 02:19:06,112
Psychological description of what Trump is and he might be a sociopath I don't know

2776
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:18,912
It's a good move on to Tom and Limonite

2777
02:19:19,168 --> 02:19:21,728
Comment on your comment

2778
02:19:26,592 --> 02:19:29,408
Donald Trump

2779
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:33,504
What do you know Alec is America

2780
02:19:36,064 --> 02:19:38,112
Easy pop culture person

2781
02:19:39,392 --> 02:19:41,440
Is involved in WWF

2782
02:19:45,024 --> 02:19:47,584
Uses

2783
02:19:49,376 --> 02:19:51,424
Who is awake

2784
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:54,240
Sounds good

2785
02:19:55,264 --> 02:19:58,848
Misrepresent

2786
02:19:59,872 --> 02:20:01,408
Discredit

2787
02:20:01,664 --> 02:20:02,688
Everyone else

2788
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:08,576
And what's going on

2789
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:12,672
Donald Trump

2790
02:20:15,232 --> 02:20:18,560
Hear this voice changer Will Robinson

2791
02:20:23,424 --> 02:20:24,448
But they

2792
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:25,728
So

2793
02:20:26,496 --> 02:20:27,264
There we are

2794
02:20:28,544 --> 02:20:29,056
That clip

2795
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:31,360
Really spells it out

2796
02:20:31,616 --> 02:20:32,128
Yeah

2797
02:20:32,384 --> 02:20:37,504
I mean he does he has his own Fair because he's already explain what it means

2798
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:38,528
You talking about Bob

2799
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:40,064
I know but I want to know

2800
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:42,368
Names of the details

2801
02:20:42,624 --> 02:20:48,768
Alex is ever going to give that one you can find that out by

2802
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:52,352
Google Now

2803
02:20:52,608 --> 02:20:53,120
Just say it

2804
02:20:59,008 --> 02:21:00,544
He said that he

2805
02:21:01,056 --> 02:21:05,408
Makes his money running a casino which also is where they launder tons of money

2806
02:21:07,968 --> 02:21:09,504
But he runs

2807
02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:11,808
People who run casinos are predators

2808
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:15,392
Plant making a false reality that exploit people who have sickness

2809
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:18,208
That's not something that can be talked away

2810
02:21:18,976 --> 02:21:19,744
He believes

2811
02:21:20,256 --> 02:21:23,072
That one who runs casino is a predator

2812
02:21:23,328 --> 02:21:24,864
Donald Trump is a predator

2813
02:21:25,632 --> 02:21:26,912
You can't take that away

2814
02:21:27,936 --> 02:21:28,704
You can't be like

2815
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:30,496
Oh I talk to draw preschool

2816
02:21:30,752 --> 02:21:31,520
Or whatever

2817
02:21:31,776 --> 02:21:36,384
Write history running casino and you think that is a predatory business

2818
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:38,176
Right

2819
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:40,736
If we go forward in time

2820
02:21:43,296 --> 02:21:44,576
He did what he did

2821
02:21:46,112 --> 02:21:48,928
He didn't wave it away with a rifle

2822
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:56,352
Stealth Patriots not because he called me

2823
02:21:56,608 --> 02:22:02,752
Planning this for thirty years to be a stealth Patriot he had gotten the Run.

2824
02:22:03,008 --> 02:22:03,776
Maybe the most predator

2825
02:22:04,544 --> 02:22:06,848
In order to fight back

2826
02:22:07,104 --> 02:22:08,128
Trained himself to be

2827
02:22:08,384 --> 02:22:09,920
Become the ultimate predator

2828
02:22:10,176 --> 02:22:16,320
Is Arnold Schwarzenegger in the movie Predator I understand where you're coming from

2829
02:22:16,576 --> 02:22:17,088
But it

2830
02:22:17,344 --> 02:22:19,136
Can't be like I can't I can't work

2831
02:22:19,392 --> 02:22:19,904
It doesn't work

2832
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:23,488
So even if I called super fascinating

2833
02:22:23,744 --> 02:22:25,536
The guy is saying you should get Steve pieczenik on

2834
02:22:26,048 --> 02:22:29,120
I know that was the weirdest the beginning

2835
02:22:29,376 --> 02:22:30,912
That is the weirdest thing that

2836
02:22:32,192 --> 02:22:32,960
Richard Scott

2837
02:22:33,472 --> 02:22:36,544
Responsible

2838
02:22:39,104 --> 02:22:40,896
Redbox

2839
02:22:41,152 --> 02:22:46,272
Do you like radio show Czarface encouraged

2840
02:22:46,528 --> 02:22:52,672
A lot of almost every DriveTime show

2841
02:22:52,928 --> 02:22:55,488
Is there businesses that use actors

2842
02:22:55,744 --> 02:22:57,280
And then pay them fifty bucks a pop

2843
02:22:57,536 --> 02:22:58,304
Call RadioShack

2844
02:22:59,072 --> 02:22:59,584
But like

2845
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:01,888
Because of the plug

2846
02:23:02,144 --> 02:23:03,936
And because of the foreshadowing

2847
02:23:04,192 --> 02:23:05,472
Steve pieczenik

2848
02:23:05,728 --> 02:23:06,240
Right

2849
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:07,264
It's interesting

2850
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:09,056
That's such a weird like

2851
02:23:09,312 --> 02:23:14,432
So here's what university

2852
02:23:14,944 --> 02:23:19,040
Steve pieczenik name in there as if they're that's a regular name to throw in there

2853
02:23:19,296 --> 02:23:20,832
Hey you know who you should get

2854
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:24,672
The profile the most evil man that we can think of

2855
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:30,816
Another evil over here

2856
02:23:31,072 --> 02:23:31,584
Dakota said

2857
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:33,632
You should get a psychologist to profile

2858
02:23:33,888 --> 02:23:34,400
Nope

2859
02:23:34,656 --> 02:23:39,264
Teatro Steve pieczenik involved in conspiracy world

2860
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:42,336
Open stuff like that like he's a Sandy Hooks and I are in s*** like that

2861
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:49,248
It's not all that weird to me

2862
02:23:49,504 --> 02:23:50,016
Idiots just

2863
02:23:52,064 --> 02:23:52,576
Like a

2864
02:23:52,832 --> 02:23:53,344
Blah blah

2865
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:54,368
There's just a map

2866
02:23:56,416 --> 02:23:58,208
So throughout the course of this

2867
02:23:58,464 --> 02:24:00,000
From July 6th to July 3rd

2868
02:24:00,768 --> 02:24:02,560
We feed no change

2869
02:24:03,072 --> 02:24:04,352
And Alex Jones is a pinion

2870
02:24:04,608 --> 02:24:05,632
Towards Donald Trump

2871
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:07,936
Except for him to spell out more

2872
02:24:08,192 --> 02:24:09,472
Very slimy in a predator

2873
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:11,264
He still doesn't trust him

2874
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:13,568
He's there to invalidate the

2875
02:24:13,824 --> 02:24:15,360
Truthful things that he says

2876
02:24:15,616 --> 02:24:19,712
He's there to make a mockery out of the very idea of these true ideas

2877
02:24:20,736 --> 02:24:22,016
He has that from high-level sources

2878
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:27,392
If we if we go along the path of the color is

2879
02:24:27,904 --> 02:24:33,024
Fake why would you have a like there are only a couple of different reasons to have a caller who is

2880
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:33,792
Is pro Trump

2881
02:24:34,048 --> 02:24:35,328
Call even Pro Trump

2882
02:24:36,608 --> 02:24:37,632
Albeit reluctantly

2883
02:24:37,888 --> 02:24:44,032
No he's saying he's like I'm liking what he's nobody saying is he's making a trump is making it okay

2884
02:24:44,288 --> 02:24:49,408
Okay to talk about these libertarian issues too far out

2885
02:24:49,664 --> 02:24:51,712
Ratso the Overton window ideas

2886
02:24:51,968 --> 02:24:53,248
This is not the sports Trump

2887
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:54,272
It's just that because

2888
02:24:54,528 --> 02:24:55,808
He's so crazy and out there

2889
02:24:56,064 --> 02:24:57,600
He's bringing the conversation

2890
02:24:57,856 --> 02:25:00,160
Into the sphere

2891
02:25:00,416 --> 02:25:02,976
Make it okay for Ram

2892
02:25:03,232 --> 02:25:05,024
That we know he's the real deal about

2893
02:25:06,048 --> 02:25:08,096
So he's not even

2894
02:25:09,376 --> 02:25:11,936
Right but as a fake caller you're putting him there

2895
02:25:12,704 --> 02:25:13,728
You want that

2896
02:25:13,984 --> 02:25:14,496
Out there

2897
02:25:16,288 --> 02:25:22,432
You want that narrative to become part of the thing that Alex talks about but if you're doing that as a fake

2898
02:25:22,688 --> 02:25:24,736
Open you don't have Alex completely repudiate

2899
02:25:24,992 --> 02:25:28,320
You don't have

2900
02:25:28,576 --> 02:25:29,344
Slimy fuc

2901
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:32,160
Yeah that's true

2902
02:25:32,416 --> 02:25:33,440
You don't think so

2903
02:25:33,952 --> 02:25:34,976
I don't necessarily think

2904
02:25:36,768 --> 02:25:38,304
The idea that the product

2905
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:39,584
Isn't evidence for me because

2906
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:40,352
Jiffy Lube

2907
02:25:40,608 --> 02:25:43,936
I didn't know that was a wreck

2908
02:25:49,568 --> 02:25:51,104
I support you

2909
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:52,384
I want to let you know how break

2910
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:56,736
So even though we see no Evolution necessarily

2911
02:25:56,992 --> 02:25:58,528
In his position towards Trump

2912
02:25:58,784 --> 02:26:00,064
We do C minor

2913
02:26:00,832 --> 02:26:02,112
Friends in his own

2914
02:26:02,624 --> 02:26:03,136
Headspace

2915
02:26:03,392 --> 02:26:04,160
I swear he's starting to

2916
02:26:04,416 --> 02:26:05,440
Jeffy the meteor

2917
02:26:09,792 --> 02:26:10,304
On top of that

2918
02:26:10,816 --> 02:26:11,584
We see

2919
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:14,656
Him being incredulous of Russian propaganda

2920
02:26:15,168 --> 02:26:18,752
Receive him saying positive things about Nigel farage

2921
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:20,288
I think

2922
02:26:21,312 --> 02:26:23,872
If I would describe the situation right now

2923
02:26:24,128 --> 02:26:26,432
This is the storm clouds gathering

2924
02:26:26,688 --> 02:26:28,992
Right right here we are leaving off

2925
02:26:29,504 --> 02:26:30,016
On

2926
02:26:30,272 --> 02:26:32,064
What I think is about to be a man

2927
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:32,832
Thunderstorm

2928
02:26:33,344 --> 02:26:35,904
A massive thunderstorms don't happen just as clouds roll

2929
02:26:36,416 --> 02:26:36,928
There's pressure

2930
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:37,952
Involved

2931
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:39,744
I think these little things

2932
02:26:40,512 --> 02:26:41,280
Like the

2933
02:26:41,536 --> 02:26:42,816
Arrival Steve pieczenik

2934
02:26:43,072 --> 02:26:44,608
The arrival of Rodger Stone

2935
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:47,936
I think those things are going to be the necessary ingredients

2936
02:26:48,192 --> 02:26:49,216
They come together

2937
02:26:51,008 --> 02:26:52,032
Underneath the

2938
02:26:52,288 --> 02:26:53,312
The gasoline

2939
02:26:54,336 --> 02:26:56,384
That is Alex Jones's underlying

2940
02:26:56,896 --> 02:26:57,664
Idiocy based on

2941
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:00,480
Was a terrific man

2942
02:27:01,504 --> 02:27:02,016
And I think a Wonder

2943
02:27:02,272 --> 02:27:02,784
A place for us

2944
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:08,160
To let you know that if you'd like to follow us on Twitter

2945
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:14,560
And if you'd like to go to a website

2946
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:20,448
Be kind of s*** we do we would really appreciate it

2947
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:24,800
The review on iTunes

2948
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:35,808
This is one of those things we were talking about

2949
02:27:36,064 --> 02:27:37,344
Before the show and

2950
02:27:39,904 --> 02:27:41,696
It is a very interesting

2951
02:27:41,952 --> 02:27:42,720
Sing for us

2952
02:27:43,232 --> 02:27:44,000
Go back in

2953
02:27:44,256 --> 02:27:45,024
And look at this

2954
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:45,792
Investigation

2955
02:27:46,304 --> 02:27:47,072
And it's an even more interesting

2956
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:49,632
For me because you were the one doing all the work

2957
02:27:49,888 --> 02:27:52,448
What's a verb

2958
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:54,752
But like

2959
02:27:55,008 --> 02:27:55,776
This is

2960
02:27:56,544 --> 02:27:58,592
This is watching the beginning of this

2961
02:27:58,848 --> 02:28:00,128
This propaganda

2962
02:28:00,384 --> 02:28:01,664
How did we get to here

2963
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:04,736
How to make

2964
02:28:04,992 --> 02:28:07,552
How did we get to the point where

2965
02:28:07,808 --> 02:28:09,344
Legitimately the president

2966
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:13,440
Is sending emails out to fundraise with Infowars links

2967
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:20,608
You can clown on Twitter about how dumb these guys are

2968
02:28:20,864 --> 02:28:22,144
Put look at what they do

2969
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:29,568
Something people are

2970
02:28:29,824 --> 02:28:30,336
Annex

2971
02:28:30,592 --> 02:28:31,104
Likable

2972
02:28:31,360 --> 02:28:33,152
Because they're so f****** stupid

2973
02:28:33,408 --> 02:28:36,480
There's three things that I agree about out with Alex Jones about

2974
02:28:36,736 --> 02:28:38,016
Marijuana should be legal

2975
02:28:39,552 --> 02:28:43,136
Able to take s*** from you there should be able to steal from you

2976
02:28:43,648 --> 02:28:45,184
And there is an information War

2977
02:28:46,976 --> 02:28:47,488
Tied up with

2978
02:28:47,744 --> 02:28:49,792
Open Shady motherfuker

2979
02:28:50,048 --> 02:28:53,120
But there is there is absolutely information

2980
02:28:53,376 --> 02:28:54,400
Wars going on

2981
02:28:54,656 --> 02:28:56,448
Imperfectly

2982
02:28:56,704 --> 02:28:58,240
I totally agree with all of that

2983
02:28:58,496 --> 02:29:02,336
And I'm not saying that we have the resources or even the ability

2984
02:29:02,592 --> 02:29:05,152
To be the other side of the information War

2985
02:29:05,408 --> 02:29:07,200
But making fun of him isn't enough

2986
02:29:07,456 --> 02:29:09,504
We need to understand this stuff

2987
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:10,784
Or else we're going

2988
02:29:11,552 --> 02:29:13,856
Be suffering the consequences of it the next time around

2989
02:29:14,112 --> 02:29:14,624
Absolutely

2990
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:17,440
My that's my mission

2991
02:29:17,696 --> 02:29:18,464
This is it

2992
02:29:19,488 --> 02:29:20,512
It's so weird

2993
02:29:20,768 --> 02:29:25,376
How's everything else in my life

2994
02:29:29,216 --> 02:29:29,728
Fairway

2995
02:29:30,240 --> 02:29:31,008
Somehow

2996
02:29:31,264 --> 02:29:34,336
The propaganda outlet that is being f******

2997
02:29:34,592 --> 02:29:35,104
Reference

2998
02:29:36,896 --> 02:29:41,760
Also spend the day talking about the song of itself ride at Disneyland

2999
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:44,576
This is the world we live in

3000
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:49,696
I don't know what else

3001
02:29:49,952 --> 02:29:50,464
Fly

3002
02:29:50,976 --> 02:29:55,584
If I show more more to the point

3003
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:57,632
20 minutes talking about a Chick-fil-A before

3004
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:04,288
Joseph doing like this

3005
02:30:04,544 --> 02:30:07,360
Very specific direct level

3006
02:30:07,616 --> 02:30:11,200
And it's very frustrating like people are really going out

3007
02:30:11,456 --> 02:30:14,528
Well some people are enjoying

3008
02:30:14,784 --> 02:30:17,856
Frank we should have

3009
02:30:18,368 --> 02:30:18,880
Maybe

3010
02:30:19,136 --> 02:30:22,208
Yeah probably

3011
02:30:22,464 --> 02:30:23,488
Let me this is important

3012
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,048
It really is screwing our world

3013
02:30:28,352 --> 02:30:30,656
Maybe it's not the people believe Infowars

3014
02:30:30,912 --> 02:30:31,936
That's not the problem

3015
02:30:32,192 --> 02:30:33,728
The problem is

3016
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:36,544
Okay Larry Nichols didn't destroy

3017
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:37,824
Political discourse

3018
02:30:38,336 --> 02:30:39,616
But things he did

3019
02:30:39,872 --> 02:30:40,896
Set in motion

3020
02:30:41,152 --> 02:30:43,456
The environment where political discourses

3021
02:30:43,712 --> 02:30:44,480
Completely destroyed

3022
02:30:44,736 --> 02:30:47,040
The lies and propaganda

3023
02:30:47,296 --> 02:30:49,088
Was the source of about Bill

3024
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:50,624
Tainted

3025
02:30:51,136 --> 02:30:53,440
The entire American political landscape the last one

3026
02:30:54,464 --> 02:30:55,232
In the same way

3027
02:30:55,488 --> 02:30:57,792
Alex Jones isn't directly

3028
02:30:58,048 --> 02:30:59,072
These things that are

3029
02:30:59,328 --> 02:31:00,608
Legitimately going to end up

3030
02:31:00,864 --> 02:31:01,632
F****** us over

3031
02:31:02,144 --> 02:31:02,656
But he

3032
02:31:03,936 --> 02:31:04,704
The ball in motion

3033
02:31:05,216 --> 02:31:08,288
Inasmuch as it's fun to be like I you didn't do that much

3034
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:10,336
You're not responsible for Trump winning

3035
02:31:10,592 --> 02:31:11,872
He played a big role in it

3036
02:31:12,128 --> 02:31:15,712
He played incredibly

3037
02:31:19,296 --> 02:31:22,368
I'm sorry bomb people with Bill Clinton is a rapist shirt

3038
02:31:22,624 --> 02:31:23,392
Stuff like that

3039
02:31:23,648 --> 02:31:25,696
Lake Hughes indirectly responsible

3040
02:31:25,952 --> 02:31:27,232
For Trump becoming president

3041
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:28,512
Trump

3042
02:31:28,768 --> 02:31:29,792
Is responsible

3043
02:31:30,304 --> 02:31:30,816
4

3044
02:31:31,328 --> 02:31:31,840
Getting out of

3045
02:31:32,096 --> 02:31:32,608
Climate change

3046
02:31:32,864 --> 02:31:33,376
Agreement

3047
02:31:33,632 --> 02:31:34,656
He's responsible

3048
02:31:34,912 --> 02:31:35,936
For putting Jeff sessions

3049
02:31:36,448 --> 02:31:38,496
Control who's going to roll back civil rights

3050
02:31:38,752 --> 02:31:39,264
With police

3051
02:31:40,032 --> 02:31:41,824
He's responsible for all these things

3052
02:31:42,336 --> 02:31:43,104
And quite frankly

3053
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:46,432
Alex Jones indirectly responsible for a lot of that stuff

3054
02:31:46,688 --> 02:31:48,480
By virtue of the things he did

3055
02:31:48,992 --> 02:31:49,760
I don't want him

3056
02:31:50,016 --> 02:31:51,040
To be responsible for it

3057
02:31:51,296 --> 02:31:52,832
Cuz I like the Alex Jones

3058
02:31:53,344 --> 02:31:54,880
Who talks about Chick-fil-A billboards

3059
02:31:55,136 --> 02:31:58,464
I think he's an idiot

3060
02:31:58,720 --> 02:32:01,792
I don't I don't want to hang out with him but I like

3061
02:32:02,304 --> 02:32:03,584
That kind of

3062
02:32:04,352 --> 02:32:06,144
I think it's important to have weirdos

3063
02:32:06,656 --> 02:32:08,704
And I don't mean weirdo necessarily in the negative

3064
02:32:09,216 --> 02:32:11,008
I don't think that a robust

3065
02:32:12,032 --> 02:32:12,544
Medialab

3066
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:13,568
Landscape

3067
02:32:13,824 --> 02:32:15,360
Just

3068
02:32:15,616 --> 02:32:17,152
Just well-documented stuff

3069
02:32:17,664 --> 02:32:20,224
You've got to have people out there who are suggesting

3070
02:32:20,480 --> 02:32:24,064
Some of the craziest bulshit

3071
02:32:24,576 --> 02:32:25,344
If sometimes

3072
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:26,368
You have

3073
02:32:26,624 --> 02:32:28,928
Conversations that can be opened up because of their insane

3074
02:32:29,440 --> 02:32:31,232
Things that no one else would consider

3075
02:32:31,744 --> 02:32:32,512
And Alex Jones

3076
02:32:33,024 --> 02:32:33,792
Years ago

3077
02:32:34,048 --> 02:32:34,560
Was that

3078
02:32:35,328 --> 02:32:37,632
He still had a lot of bigotry in him and that's a big

3079
02:32:39,168 --> 02:32:39,680
Again

3080
02:32:40,192 --> 02:32:41,728
It's still all covered under the

3081
02:32:41,984 --> 02:32:42,496
First Amendment

3082
02:32:43,008 --> 02:32:43,776
I don't think

3083
02:32:44,544 --> 02:32:46,592
You know you can point the finger at him be like

3084
02:32:46,848 --> 02:32:47,616
Stop it

3085
02:32:47,872 --> 02:32:50,944
That's not grounds for taking him off the air

3086
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:53,504
It's not grounds for arresting if he's not doing anything illegal

3087
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:54,528
He was that

3088
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:55,552
Crazy person

3089
02:32:56,576 --> 02:32:59,392
And this investigation to me is very personal and some way

3090
02:32:59,904 --> 02:33:02,208
Because not because I identify with him

3091
02:33:02,464 --> 02:33:02,976
Because

3092
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:05,280
He's not that anymore

3093
02:33:05,792 --> 02:33:06,560
He is

3094
02:33:07,328 --> 02:33:07,840
The mouth

3095
02:33:08,096 --> 02:33:08,864
Peace

3096
02:33:09,376 --> 02:33:09,888
Is

3097
02:33:10,144 --> 02:33:10,912
Responsible

3098
02:33:11,424 --> 02:33:12,192
For civil rights

3099
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:13,472
Going away

3100
02:33:13,728 --> 02:33:14,240
In many cases

3101
02:33:14,752 --> 02:33:15,776
He's responsible

3102
02:33:16,032 --> 02:33:19,104
For whatever woes are going to come to our climate

3103
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:22,432
That lead us to be siding with Syria and Nicaragua

3104
02:33:22,944 --> 02:33:27,296
Every other day was actually way better than everybody else

3105
02:33:27,552 --> 02:33:29,088
Bright

3106
02:33:31,136 --> 02:33:31,904
It's not

3107
02:33:32,672 --> 02:33:33,184
I want

3108
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:34,208
Chick-fil-A billboards

3109
02:33:36,512 --> 02:33:38,816
It sucks

3110
02:33:39,072 --> 02:33:39,584
Genuine

3111
02:33:40,096 --> 02:33:41,120
Heartfelt moment of sad

3112
02:33:42,144 --> 02:33:44,192
For Chick-fil-A Alex

3113
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:49,568
It sucks

3114
02:33:49,824 --> 02:33:50,336
Ma'am

3115
02:33:52,128 --> 02:33:53,408
Cuz now we can't have that anymore

3116
02:33:54,176 --> 02:33:58,528
No no that's gone forever There's No Going Back. The form of Alex

3117
02:33:59,040 --> 02:33:59,808
Everybody else

3118
02:34:00,576 --> 02:34:02,880
There is no sensible

3119
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:07,744
Conspiracy theorist baby Joe Rogan

3120
02:34:08,256 --> 02:34:08,768
I don't know

3121
02:34:09,024 --> 02:34:10,560
Maybe is

3122
02:34:10,816 --> 02:34:12,352
With him now

3123
02:34:15,168 --> 02:34:18,752
Did the Mike cernovich has the rebel media those people are all

3124
02:34:19,008 --> 02:34:19,520
Weaponize

3125
02:34:20,032 --> 02:34:21,056
They're not like

3126
02:34:21,312 --> 02:34:22,080
Alex Jones

3127
02:34:22,592 --> 02:34:23,360
Back in the day

3128
02:34:24,384 --> 02:34:26,944
When he was just talking about chemtrails

3129
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:31,296
And even lie 2K even that that wasn't

3130
02:34:31,552 --> 02:34:32,064
Propaganda

3131
02:34:32,576 --> 02:34:35,136
Mike cernovich Rebel media Alex Jones

3132
02:34:35,392 --> 02:34:37,440
These are all things that are working towards

3133
02:34:37,696 --> 02:34:38,464
The specific goal

3134
02:34:43,584 --> 02:34:44,096
Is the

3135
02:34:45,376 --> 02:34:46,400
Of liberalism

3136
02:34:46,656 --> 02:34:48,192
It's the destruction of

3137
02:34:48,448 --> 02:34:49,728
Global cooperation

3138
02:34:49,984 --> 02:34:52,800
I want to find a different word than globalism cuz that's not what it is

3139
02:34:53,312 --> 02:34:54,848
A they want to destroy

3140
02:34:55,104 --> 02:34:55,616
These

3141
02:34:56,896 --> 02:34:58,688
These institutions that allow people

3142
02:34:59,200 --> 02:34:59,712
To work

3143
02:34:59,968 --> 02:35:00,480
Cord the better

3144
02:35:01,248 --> 02:35:01,760
Brett

3145
02:35:04,576 --> 02:35:05,600
Creating a new feudalism

3146
02:35:06,368 --> 02:35:06,880
Like that

3147
02:35:07,136 --> 02:35:12,256
That to me what I hear whatever people do the prosperity

3148
02:35:13,536 --> 02:35:14,304
It's all Billy

3149
02:35:15,072 --> 02:35:17,376
Yeah what is going to be like

3150
02:35:18,144 --> 02:35:20,704
What from all of these things is

3151
02:35:21,472 --> 02:35:23,008
We're destroying Nation

3152
02:35:23,776 --> 02:35:24,288
And

3153
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:26,336
Rich ass motherfuker

3154
02:35:26,592 --> 02:35:28,384
Russia versus

3155
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:29,152
Does the United

3156
02:35:29,664 --> 02:35:31,712
No that's not the

3157
02:35:37,856 --> 02:35:39,136
Well rested

3158
02:35:39,392 --> 02:35:42,976
Is people from Saudi Arabia

3159
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:54,240
That's not good

3160
02:35:54,496 --> 02:35:56,544
Yeah all of this stuff is

3161
02:35:57,056 --> 02:35:57,568
It's

3162
02:35:58,336 --> 02:35:58,848
People

3163
02:35:59,104 --> 02:36:02,176
It's very very rich people looking to make more money

3164
02:36:02,688 --> 02:36:04,992
Really give a f***

3165
02:36:05,248 --> 02:36:07,040
He doesn't really care about Russia

3166
02:36:08,064 --> 02:36:08,576
Really care about you

3167
02:36:09,088 --> 02:36:10,624
All he cares about is being

3168
02:36:11,648 --> 02:36:12,416
Rich

3169
02:36:13,696 --> 02:36:14,720
Powerful

3170
02:36:15,488 --> 02:36:18,048
Taking back the Soviet Union

3171
02:36:18,304 --> 02:36:19,584
If you can get it

3172
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:20,864
How many just said that if

3173
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:22,144
Buttersweet enjoined

3174
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:24,960
Use that NATO he's going to attack them

3175
02:36:25,472 --> 02:36:26,240
Future man

Yeah

3177
02:36:30,848 --> 02:36:31,616
That was the message

3178
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:34,688
Guys don't do it

3179
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:36,224
We never said we were going to join

3180
02:36:36,736 --> 02:36:37,248
What are you talkin to

3181
02:36:38,272 --> 02:36:39,808
I don't know it's it's

3182
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:42,112
Oligarchy

3183
02:36:44,416 --> 02:36:44,928
Boggles my mind

3184
02:36:45,696 --> 02:36:47,232
I can understand how anybody

3185
02:36:48,256 --> 02:36:48,768
Goodbye in

3186
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:50,048
Yeah isn't

3187
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:51,328
One of those Olive

3188
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:54,400
I agree

3189
02:36:55,936 --> 02:36:56,960
Has been a prolonged

3190
02:36:57,216 --> 02:37:00,032
Outro wailing

3191
02:37:00,288 --> 02:37:02,336
I try and make the point

3192
02:37:04,640 --> 02:37:05,152
I'm really

3193
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:08,480
I know it's really easy to make

3194
02:37:09,248 --> 02:37:11,040
I would like it if more people listen to us

3195
02:37:11,552 --> 02:37:12,064
That would be awesome

3196
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:12,832
Cuz

3197
02:37:13,088 --> 02:37:13,856
I'm self-centered but

3198
02:37:14,112 --> 02:37:15,648
I would like it more if just more

3199
02:37:15,904 --> 02:37:16,416
People were paying

3200
02:37:17,184 --> 02:37:17,696
The underpinning

3201
02:37:18,720 --> 02:37:21,280
Propaganda there are some attempt

3202
02:37:21,536 --> 02:37:22,048
To look at

3203
02:37:22,304 --> 02:37:24,864
It sounds like the Media Matters

3204
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:27,680
Cover right-wing extremism and what-have-you

3205
02:37:27,936 --> 02:37:28,704
They don't

3206
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:31,264
Speed into the outrage machine and all that right

3207
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:33,056
It doesn't they're great and

3208
02:37:33,312 --> 02:37:35,872
It's somewhat they're at least they're shining a light on some of the stuff

3209
02:37:37,152 --> 02:37:37,920
I don't think

3210
02:37:38,432 --> 02:37:39,968
I don't think it's the

3211
02:37:40,224 --> 02:37:40,736
The ointment

3212
02:37:42,528 --> 02:37:44,064
We are either but

3213
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:46,112
Anyway

3214
02:37:46,368 --> 02:37:50,464
Thank you guys

3215
02:37:51,488 --> 02:37:55,072
Last Thursday

3216
02:37:55,328 --> 02:37:56,608
Thursday

3217
02:37:56,864 --> 02:37:59,168
Yay

3218
02:37:59,680 --> 02:38:00,192
That what

3219
02:38:03,008 --> 02:38:05,056
Holding

3220
02:38:07,104 --> 02:38:10,688
Alex
