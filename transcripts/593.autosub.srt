1
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,736
Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
Indeed we are.

6
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,120
Jordan Jordan

7
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,960
Vibrate for today is actually something I've been waiting

8
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,496
Quite awhile to be able

9
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,520
To be a bright

10
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,080
Spot

11
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,872
I have sent out

12
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,896
All of the butt

13
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,968
That is coming to the email address

14
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,760
But be set up for the button

15
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
I have finished

16
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
Sending out

17
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:32,160
Probably I think I probably made about 4,000 but

18
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:32,928
Yeah

19
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,512
Various countries around the world in

20
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,304
All the states of the Union

21
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,400
Yeah it's it's a it took longer than expected

22
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,960
The demand was higher than I anticipated

23
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,240
But

24
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,776
Plugging on through it

25
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,056
So we we reach

26
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,592
Obvious points

27
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,992
I know that there are some people who have scented emails late

28
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,296
Messages that went to the places that aren't of the

29
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:03,136
Dedicated email address and I'm going to try and regroup

30
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,440
And get those last stragglers

31
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,256
Taking care of eventually but I'm

32
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
I'm not rushing

33
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,560
I have

34
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,376
Completed what I set out to do

35
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,936
I'm really proud of you I'm really proud of you

36
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,496
Yeah that's the type of thing

37
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
You know

38
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
You could have been like

39
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:25,152
I've done 2000 I'm not doing another 2K

40
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:34,880
And early on you were taunting me about how I bit off more than I could chew and you were saying

41
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,184
Did you do that again

42
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,256
Oh no this isn't going to work

43
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,864
What are the things that really motivated mean

44
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,144
It is

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,448
Big idea that I can sit here and

46
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,752
Press buttons and put them in envelopes

47
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,336
And eventually they were the effort that I was putting in was going

48
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,616
Translate to

49
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,176
Somebody being happy when they went to their mailbox

50
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
Stan Blake

51
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,992
I know maybe not everybody

52
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:07,392
Maybe not everybody didn't brighten their day figure something out.

53
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,952
Respect means a lot you know

54
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:14,560
Like this park isn't going to last forever we're not going to be doing this forever and

55
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
When

56
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
So you know things and

57
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
I would much rather look back

58
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,960
On the time

59
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,984
That we spent

60
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:27,360
It was put in about stuff like that all this time

61
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
Making these buttons

62
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,968
To send to people sell gray instead of like negotiated

63
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:37,344
Everybody was interested

64
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
Created that demand

65
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,440
For these buttons and allowing me to be able to

66
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
2

67
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
Experience that

68
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,536
That process of giving that gift

69
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,328
Fan of you folks

70
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,352
Yams

71
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,752
No I haven't gotten one don't send me a message now way to wildlands

72
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,056
Buttons will open up again

73
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
But there'll be something

74
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:06,016
Is a little bit I've had a

75
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:11,392
Pretty bad depressive episode for the last little bit and all came to a head Friday

76
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
But my bright spot is

77
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
My partner

78
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
Is so supportive

79
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
And so

80
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,375
Kind and helpful and has really helped me get through it

81
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
A lot

82
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
You know

83
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,751
Better than I otherwise

84
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
I've if you've

85
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,591
Been incredibly helpful as well so

86
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,407
I am a that's my b b

87
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,223
Perkspot with a bright hat you know it's it's like

88
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,623
All too often and bright

89
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
Mustache

90
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,791
I know people appreciate being open and honest about mental illness so it's like it's one of those things where

91
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,863
You know you are you do your best and then

92
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Part of

93
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
That is

94
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,727
You do give people around you an opportunity

95
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,287
To be supportive or

96
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
Choose not to be

97
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
You know

98
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
And when somebody does choose to Abby's

99
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,687
Supportive it's such a good thing and it's

100
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,271
A good thing to give them the opportunity to do that instead of just suffer

101
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
Spring by yourself

102
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,575
Yeah you know

103
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
Generally most

104
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
People aren't going

105
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,415
To respond to

106
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,231
Vulnerability by hurting you

107
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:24,863
Yeah I think they will you think they will

108
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
I think

109
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,775
You they're not going to kill you you'll survive whatever and then you can choose not to associate

110
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,871
Yeah that is

111
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,175
Around people who are

112
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,223
Is that helps a lot

113
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759
It's an incredibly bright spot

114
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
It really is

115
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
It smells great

116
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,599
And onward and upward

117
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
Infiniti

118
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:55,327
And at least somewhere around a pivoting.

119
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:01,471
We have present day episode September 2nd

120
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
I was way off

121
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,639
This depressive episode not feeling good

122
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,479
I wanted to do this because we've been in the past

123
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,807
For a bit and also clip

124
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,343
Made the rounds

125
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,743
Oh yeah of Alex yeah there was a clip of him taking Ivermectin on air

126
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,143
F****** morons do we live in the same world and he's very defensive

127
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,751
Well so we're going to learn a lot

128
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,847
I'm not going to say that

129
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:46,527
Okay

130
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:52,415
As is generally the case goes around of Alex I like to do is

131
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,951
Check and see if it's

132
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,767
Something worth talking about extremely it's not

133
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,583
Usually it's something that's like this doesn't

134
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,631
Anything to our conversation

135
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:06,495
I think this is one of those rare instances where it's like this is a clip the viral

136
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
I'd also

137
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,311
There's something people are

138
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
Slightly missing

139
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,895
In there that is definitely worth talking about

140
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,967
So we're going to do that today I am so much more

141
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,807
But before we do let's take

142
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,343
So first

143
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,415
Lauren spelled lorian

144
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,207
Who also loves Jordan

145
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,511
Cackle

146
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:35,679

Thank you

148
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
Next

Not mad at the crew in Colorado thank you so much with no follow-through are

150
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:51,807
It's like Sleepless in Seattle not mad at the group that would be a great if I was going to get another tattoo based on the

151
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:56,159
Michelle

152
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,487
That's a good weather to be on Alex's family crest

153
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:05,119
Next Tyrus I hope your recent shedding went well your heat Rockaway to you goddamn glorious Lizard King

154
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
Thank you so much and I apologize

155
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:13,823
Alex Jones is just a far-right Alan Partridge thank you so much and I was wrong

156
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:20,223
I'm a policy wonk so thank you so much

157
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,015
What up to Knox

158
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
Knox

159
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
Knox

160
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,815
Business

161
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,863
Heroin

162
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,703
Freakishly large

163
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:51,711
Cool man sounds like a British Countryside pronunciation of NOS

164
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,991
Like a fast guy

165
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,295
I feel I feel like everybody makes fun of him

166
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,599
For the Fort Knox thing but that dude

167
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
Can drive

168
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,207
Or there was that character knock

169
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
With an X

170
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:09,631
Start with a k in front of the Cadillac season of Heroes

171
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,911
Is played by

172
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
The guy who played Marlo on The Wire

173
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:17,055
Marlin school he was able to send

174
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
Beer around him

175
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,407
And the more fear that was around him the stronger he got

176
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,687
What

177
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,247
That's the worst Power I've ever heard it was such

178
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,063
Dangerous power that he was on the alike

179
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,087
The level

180
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,879
The lowest level

181
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,671
Of like security heightened

182
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Security there

183
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,791
Deep underground under primatech paper

184
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
Alright

185
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,631
Alright seems like you could just fell apart

186
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:48,031
It seems like if you were like oh this guy feed done. You're like if I relax I'm pretty cool I think that's how

187
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,615
Planet with a personal situation

188
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:57,759
People don't know they're going to be afraid

189
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,807
It's a sneaker thing was down there with the guy who

190
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,647
Could do like Sonic booms

191
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,279
Whether it's a sonic boom guy wasn't afraid of him he could the sonic boom guy he's got no chance against

192
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,095
Tyler Broke everybody out

193
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,399

Mtti

Alright internet in the honor of Celine donated to protect the

Thank you so much

210
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,271
Jordan we got this episode to go over but first years not a contacts drop

211
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
Today Show

212
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Oops

213
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,855
That's it all right

214
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:11,999
Okay I just would like him to say that I just wanted to introduce into our drop catalog as I can clean drop

215
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
Oops

216
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,631
So we start here with this this for

217
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,935
Flip and Dad

218
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,727
Trump news

219
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
Stuff going on

220
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,615
Stop all right

221
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,199
Coming out a few days ago and saying it

222
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
Pfizer really rhymes

223
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:39,391
The FDA and the governments of the world in people on a look at Pfizer in the booster shot

224
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,183
So he's starting to

225
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,535
Towards taking on the fraud he knows he's been set up

226
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
He needs to do it

227
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,143
That will take Trump from

228
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
Maine

229
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,799
A figure pushed off to the side still getting some the Republicans elected

230
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,127
Power to bend the populist tea with meth

231
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,687
People will forgive him in a moment

232
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,503
Well that's

233
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,295
Am I lying about the vaccines

234
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:14,463
So when I first heard Alex talking about this I was listening this episode I assume that this clippy was talking about a trump was this one

235
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
From May to August

236
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
Alex's doctor

237
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
Incessantly

238
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:23,423
And it was Trump calling into the Fox Business show mornings with Maria hosted by Maria Bartiromo

239
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,775
He's just is bang that gone so many time

240
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
Since Trump

241
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,591
And Maria talk about vaccines

242
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,615
Interrupts speculates

243
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,431
The booster shot is a scam on the part of drug companies

244
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
To make more money

245
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
Great good work

246
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,551
He said that because he's an idiot and he doesn't care if his followers.

247
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:45,951
Correct notably absent from that clip is Trump saying that fisa runs the FDA or the governments of the world

248
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
World which is what Alex

249
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,767
We can always talking about here so

250
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,351
That's what was my first indication that maybe there's a different clip

251
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,143
And it does turn out to be a different color

252
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,543
But I wanted to play a little bit of the Bartiromo clip that Alex never plays okay

253
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,823
And then there's there's something

254
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,127
I do still think is worth talking

255
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,223
Nobody is talk to the FDA like I did they don't like me

256
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,503
We have a Backpage

257
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
Better saving Millions

258
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,343
YouTube lives throughout the world I think we have a Spanish

259
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,623
Blue situation like

260
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
19 seven

261
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,695
I believe that

262
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
Maybe a hundred million people

263
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,583
50 million 100 million people like that

264
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,655
So very proud of the fact I've taken the vaccine

265
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
I'm very very proud of it

266
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,751
Super proud of the vaccine

267
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:35,615
Cuz you said it twice he did say super police don't really match up with Alex's stupid

268
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
We conspiracies at all

269
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:41,759
According to Trump Anna part of a Fox news interview that Alex will sensor from his audience

270
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,783
The vaccine is great

271
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,599
And without it covid would have killed 100 million people

272
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,927
This isn't the rhetoric of someone who's been set up

273
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,975
These are the words of someone who's two steps

274
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,999
Behind his own

275
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Gripped

276
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,839
In many respects I think what Alex is saying there is

277
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,863
Accurately

278
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,655
Assessing the problem but

279
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,239
I told you that Alex can speak frankly about what the problem is

280
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
Trump's base

281
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:08,383
Half the s*** now and galvanizing around for years advisors make money off booster shot

282
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,687
That's not going to get anyone excited at this point

283
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,015
That could possibly work in the mainstream Republican

284
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:20,415
Skin types but the move of the Trump was leaving and dragging whatever mainstream Republican types they're actually word along with it

285
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,719
Steve moved on to the next stage were there once

286
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,255
Step away from violence

287
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,071
The escalation is gone one step away from

288
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
They are there

289
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
True

290
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
Some of them

291
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,215
Yes in terms of people disrupt

292
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:39,359
Open City Council meetings and school boards in the way this Behavior has been cheered on and incentivize with attention on social media

293
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:44,991
That's where the Grist is now than the extreme fringes of it or the roving gangs you see in the Pacific

294
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:51,391
Yeah yeah yelling at school boards don't want to talk about Pfizer's profits they wanted Yellow by Bayou

295
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,487
Weapons in the spirit of humanity that won't accept tyrannical martial law or some s***

296
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:00,863
In order for Trumpeter gainswave the the populist movement that he was the head of and he

297
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655
Fire to overthrow the

298
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Government

299
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,727
He needs to meet them where they are

300
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,775
They're not going to meet him where he is

301
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,359
He'll be exactly what Alex the same

302
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,151
I figure pushed off to the side

303
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,199
Still getting some Republicans elected

304
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,759
The movement that follow Trump didn't

305
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,575
Follow him because they actually thought he organically held

306
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,623
Any worthwhile beliefs or had a good

307
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,903
Understanding of policy

308
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,999
They just recognized that he was willing to go where they already were and then they could push

309
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
Further

310
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,119
Trump games fans by pretending to be the champion of whatever dum-dum right wing

311
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:39,519
Bingo they were mad about that day and it really works from W stuff

312
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,311
College campus Adventures

313
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,103
Big Tech censorship

314
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
He was King shitpost

315
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,551
And now Trump has been out of office and not useful to the hard-right folk

316
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,951
He was a disappointment to them after January 6th and he literally did nothing to get himself

317
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,231
Or any of them back on Twitter

318
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:05,119
As if that wasn't enough he's now completely misread the room and he's trying to encourage people to get vaccines

319
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,215
Which is like if you'd gone up in front of his followers in early 2016 and said

320
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:13,055
You know when you get right down to it feminists have some pretty valid point exact

321
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,591
He doesn't get the Gang

322
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:19,967
I'm doing if he's actually thinking about running in 2024 like some of suggest

323
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,039
If he doesn't come out until the extremist line

324
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,831
He's not going to have an actual Bass

325
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
Just not

326
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,671
Did this visit doesn't work with

327
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,207
Him like being like

328
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,255
Oh you need to come to me

329
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,815
He has nothing to offer unless he comes to them

330
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:41,215
You know this is starting to sound exactly like when Trump tried to get into football

331
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,031
Call and sued the NFL for a full dollar

332
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,567
And then lost everything

333
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,591
So

334
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,407
That sounds right I just you know I think

335
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,431
That

336
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,991
Clip that Alex is playing

337
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,343
Not the right clip

338
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:03,743
This this point is really say when

339
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,303
That the Trump is not going to

340
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
Get his shift back

341
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,143
If he doesn't do what they

342
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:16,543
Doesn't cave to Grievous demands he will not be their leader find somebody who's

343
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,823
As charismatic as him

344
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
Probably less embarrassing right

345
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,407
We'll go along with it

346
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
You got it

347
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,967
So

348
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,271
When you when you make a mob

349
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
You don't wind up leaving

350
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
Become apart of

351
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,951
Or were you have to dance

352
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,975
Really fast

353
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,279
Yeah

354
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
Keep up with

355
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,631
The desires of the mob the will of the mob

356
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,775
It's a mess and you have to give them everything they want or they will toss you under there

357
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,871
And create reasons why they were right to do that

358
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,455
So anyway Alex has a busy bee

359
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,783
He wants to make sure that you know that he does a lot of work

360
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,831
Let me explain something to you

361
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,415
I stayed up till 2 in the morning last night with this

362
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
Information

363
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
It's right here

364
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,095
My wife went to bed about 9

365
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,887
Children went to bed about

366
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,935
Better last night

367
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,263
Till 2 a.m.

368
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,847
Before the show and I

369
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
Rue

370
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663
All of this

371
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:30,527
Shower I'm going to have to drink breaks and then go back through because

372
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,319
It's so bombshell

373
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,111
Who cares right

374
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
Wow

375
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,231
Who cares how often are up till 2 in the morning I don't give a s***

376
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:46,399
You know I know I don't know this I don't know this for sure but I'm pretty I'm pretty confident

377
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
Did Alex Isley

378
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:51,519
What type of dad who is like wandered into his kids room at 2 a.m. and then like

379
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,567
You got to watch this movie

380
00:18:54,079 --> 00:19:00,223
You got to watch this movie with me while he's absolutely s***-faced that's totally true stories Wonder to do kids room at 2 in the morning and then

381
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,783
Music Ivermectin

382
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
The bomb coming

383
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,927
Larry got there by paying on your bed this time

384
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,719
The morning

385
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:17,119
Like watching the YouTube videos like I've been up till 2 working

386
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,423
Very impressed I did

387
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
So impress

388
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,775
Alex talks about vaccine

389
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,615
Until there's monitoring goes on

390
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,639
About them

391
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
And this is really

392
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
Just the globalist

393
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,967
Trying to know if they've

394
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,759
The target sure this is such

395
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
Bulshit

396
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,671
Number hospitalizations are heart attacks or blood clots

397
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
Crosshairs

398
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
Rifle

399
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,839
Uses the Optics to see if he shot you

400
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
Gun camera

401
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,007
16 recording image

402
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,639
John Hopkins they know about the heart attack

403
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,687
The targeting computer

404
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,759
And so they're watching just like

405
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,551
B-17 pilot

406
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,111
Bomb site on their aircraft

407
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
And then there

408
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,231
Skip three more eggs

409
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,935
What did hit that Target sell

410
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
No go ahead and

411
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,239
We had that talk

412
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,263
We got that Target

413
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,079
Targeting

414
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,383
The movie Predator

415
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,967
It is really stupid and it comes entirely from Alex's imagination

416
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,759
What else is talking with reports

417
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,927
Score of the vaccine adverse event reporting see

418
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:51,071
We talked about bears a little bit in the past and how it's really difficult to take raw data from the system and reach any solid

419
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,607
Conclusions based solely on that

420
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
But

421
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,167
I don't think we've done a good enough job of

422
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,215
Discussing exactly why that is

423
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
Apparently a

424
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,311
Passive data collector

425
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,639
Consistent which is to say that the FDA and CDC who operated

426
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:08,991
In conjunction with each other they don't make any efforts to collect data

427
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,271
It's captured in that says

428
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,855
It's wholly up the individuals and Healthcare professionals to report

429
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
Adverse Events

430
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,391
In this way

431
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,976
The thing is important to understand is that the FDA and CDC.

432
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,792
Only use various data to monitor vaccine

433
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
Pictures of thing you hear the most

434
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
About because it

435
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,168
Is the easiest thing for idiots like Alex and his friends

436
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,192
The poll numbers from

437
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,008
10% out-of-context on Facebook in hopes of making

438
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
Your parents in space

439
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
B vaccine

440
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,360
The CDC has an active arm of it

441
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,408
It's program to monitor the safety of vaccines

442
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,992
What are the largest parts of which is the vaccine safety data

443
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,064
This is a collaboration between the CDC and 9

444
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,856
Huge Healthcare organizations

445
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,416
Where concerns raised by various data could be

446
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,464
Explored in a construct it's more meaningful

447
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,488
For making scientific

448
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,280
Connections between thyroid

449
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:57,888
The FDA has their own programs in place such as the post-licensure

450
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,192
Rapid immunization safety monitoring

451
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,984
Prism for sure

452
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,544
This is a modern program that has been used

453
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,848
Investigate possible vaccine

454
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
Interactions and side effects

455
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,920
Once it's already been released

456
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,944
The market

457
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,992
So you're saying that the

458
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,320
There's is almost more of like a

459
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,136
Wendy's

460
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:25,536
Anecdotal evidence if they get enough anecdotal evidence there like maybe there's something here and so then they'll be as other text

461
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,352
Unique Stuart Florida

462
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:34,752
Information comes out of these other more active programs it's usually press releases where they've done in-depth reviews of

463
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,056
Possible connections between vaccine and a condition

464
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
Impound Nolan

465
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:44,992
You'll essentially never hear someone like Alex bring these programs up however because their studies are much harder to misrepresent

466
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,528
Then random out of

467
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
Contact Thursday.

468
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,416
Is lying here from a 2015 article in the Journal of Acts

469
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
How they put it

470
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:59,072
There's is primarily a safety signal detection and hypothesis generating

471
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
Ring system

472
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,936
There is data interpreted allowed or out of context can lead to erroneous conclusions

473
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,216
About cause and effect

474
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,008
Or the risk of Adverse Events

475
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,032
What's after vaccination

476
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:14,176
That's the way to look at it right this is a hypothesis generating and safety signals

477
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,456
Protection right sister

478
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,784
No governmental organizational system is

479
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,344
But there are layers upon layers in place of people trying

480
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,416
Safe baby don't even know about

481
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:29,280
There are countless people who have made it their life's work to pour over data on things like prism or the vaccine

482
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,608
About to make sure their bomb hit the right target

483
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,888
But to be able to respond.

484
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,448
Quickly as possible with the public health measures life done

485
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,472
Result

486
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,008
And I just

487
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,080
Binded really stupid

488
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
He's not

489
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,640
Really looking at

490
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,664
Picture as it exists

491
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,968
Just as it exists in his imagination

492
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,040
Service

493
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:57,440
I would prefer if instead of staying up till 2 a.m. pretending to research thing he stayed up till 2 a.m. writing

494
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,464
Better similes

495
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,072
You saw a man like that would be nice

496
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:06,912
He was a good extemporaneous speaker so he would write all of that stuff we will fight

497
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
He's been writing that for years

498
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:19,200
I wish I were to Fayetteville 2 in the morning working on his Churchill impression

499
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,016
I think you should just take a right in

500
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,088
In class

501
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,112
Did you come up with

502
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
How to write

503
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,416
Brother

504
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,208
Probably not

505
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,024
Alex's got some news about Israel

506
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,816
Israel

507
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:39,168
Has the most deaths in the most illnesses of the most vaccine in the world of any large.

508
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
12 year old shot

509
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,592
25 year old is totally healthy

510
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,664
People are just

511
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,200
Excruciating pain

512
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,248
Their hearts just swell up and bust open

513
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
Kaboom

514
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,296
Got none of this is

515
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,088
Spaced on anyting

516
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:03,488
Get 44% or something hundred most populous country in a popular

517
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,304
This country in the world according to the New York Times

518
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,352
Which is just reporting from Johns Hopkins

519
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
Data share

520
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:12,448
Israel sitting at an overall vaccination rate of 61

521
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,288
Okay exclamation rate is higher than that but

522
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,080
It's not the number one in the world

523
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:24,736
Here's a possibly incomplete list of countries that have higher population than Israel and higher vaccination rates

524
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
The Netherlands

525
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,832
United Kingdom in Belgium Portugal

526
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:34,464
Currently the United States has the highest number of average daily cases and it's not even close

527
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,024
We're also way ahead on average daily.

528
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,584
If you only look at the statistics

529
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
Pic of average number of daily cases

530
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,192
Is per 100,000 persons top of that list

531
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:47,008
But it's not as much of a blowout as our various number one

532
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:54,432
Everyone's going through a little bit of a bad stretch right now with a Delta variant and their experience has shown very clearly how the vaccines are various

533
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,968
Effective but also not a perf

534
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,736
Perfect solution

535
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,296
In Late July they began rolling out boost

536
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,088
Jobs for people over 60

537
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,392
Bring I see a lot of folks recommending is Mass

538
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,440
Sam returning to

539
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,208
A bit more

540
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
Caution

541
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:13,632
You know and also the the thing I just I just saw that somebody had done

542
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
Indian

543
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,728
Didn't study of excess deaths and so

544
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,032
Countries with let's say

545
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,896
Mad dictators like the ones that Alex likes have been under-reporting there

546
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,432
Covid numbers for a long

547
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:32,832
Time there are some issues will take a while to sort out all those front

548
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
Yeah

549
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:37,696
Trying to make about Israel's infection rate is just in playing games

550
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:41,024
But the bigger point is at the specific claims he's making are just

551
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
Backup

552
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,376
So there's a bombshell

553
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
That Alex has

554
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
Alright

555
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,984
What's the site on

556
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,520
Is it using a B7

557
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:56,384
19 bombshell or is he using the Sidewinder bombshell the movie Predator

558
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,992
When put the headliner show

559
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,112
CDC documents that the CDC put out themselves

560
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
Idiots

561
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:10,208
Plainview where they admit

562
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,744
Heart attack

563
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,584
And all the rest of this

564
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,680
The show headline today is

565
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,496
Absolute Global bombshell

566
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,080
That's a bad show head

567
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,384
Pop

568
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,152
FDA

569
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,432
Scientist

570
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:31,968
Have

571
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,760
Now come out and admitted

572
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,088
Covid-19 vaccine

573
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,416
After the headline breaking

574
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,952
Mega bombshell

575
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,000
I thought it was the CDC

576
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
He said

577
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:51,424
CDC CDC release the headline is a bombshell about

578
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
DEA

579
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:55,520
Scientist admitting that the shot is killing people

580
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
I'm confused

581
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
Well

582
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
This is a bombshell

583
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,152
The cdc's bombshell

584
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:01,920
Is

585
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,992
Different from the fda's bombshell

586
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,808
Which one are we concerned about

587
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,088
I'm not sure

588
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,904
But Alex don't start talking about these FDA scientists

589
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,928
And

590
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,720
Some dramatic

591
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,792
Remember this is the other gigantic

592
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,120
2 days ago

593
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:27,008
The number one and number two scientist

594
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:27,776
His death

595
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,616
1035 years Ones been there 12 years

596
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,176
People they said hey

597
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,992
You can have the CDC in the white house running nose

598
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,528
You shouldn't give it to Under 12

599
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,832
DM

600
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,368
It's not going to work

601
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
We don't care

602
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,536
PA

603
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,816
Oxycontin

604
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,608
Previously an end.

605
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,680
For children

606
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
If I was just worse

607
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,032
Overrode them instead

608
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,848
We're going to say it's an authorized shot

609
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,456
If you just heard Alex's version of the story that sounds like really high drama

610
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:13,856
A couple of higher-ups in the backseat Department try to tell the truth to power and then the power-mad woman in charge wanted to give

611
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,648
Wouldn't hear it

612
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:18,976
Pretend everything's fine wow

613
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
That sounds

614
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,280
Like a

615
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:25,376
Plot of a movie there's a little Game of Thrones going on there

616
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,192
The woman Alex is referring to is Janet woodcock

617
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,984
Lock the acting head of the FDA

618
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:35,872
Who recently ruled out is Biden's nominee to be the head of the agency so she won't be in that role very long

619
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:42,528
For what it's worth the issue here is that there are very serious concerns about woodcox time as the head of the center for drug

620
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,808
Drug evaluation and research

621
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,880
The wing of the FDA in charge of approving new drugs

622
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,952
Many of Webbie prisms that you did not do enough to

623
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,488
The public from the opiate

624
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,512
That were approved

625
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,280
During her tenure

626
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,608
This is awful and she should be held accountable for the

627
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,168
The decisions that were made under her leadership and even so

628
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
It's a pretty Far Cry from what Alex

629
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,984
Claiming she did

630
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,312
According to Alex you wanted to give Oxycontin and Fentanyl to

631
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
Two children

632
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
Jameden

633
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,200
For one thing most brands of Oxycodone are not approved for use

634
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,480
Some people under 12

635
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,528
Most versatile prescriptions are for

636
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,064
Very narrow situation

637
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,464
Particularly breakthrough pain in cancer patients who are quote already receiving and we're tolerant to opioids

638
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,584
Therapy for their underlying cancer pain and it is not indicated for use in purse

639
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,352
Underrated

640
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:35,776
There's some very serious concerns about the fda's handling of the opiate crisis but when you cover that story by saying that his evil woman wanted

641
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,056
Fentanyl in Oxycontin

642
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,336
Children

643
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:43,456
You're making an ass of yourself and you guarantee that your audience will only have access to a bulshit version of the story

644
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,480
It's useless

645
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,504
In terms of helping

646
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:49,600
Where's all the actual underlying issues with the story present Frank maker

647
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:53,696
You're making their their ability to deal with reality input

648
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,768
You got it anyway

649
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,304
The main story Alex's.

650
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,144
I'm about was this head of the FDA vaccine stuff in his deputy

651
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,704
Right that's what the main story was

652
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,520
Call up inside character wanted to do SAR kids with

653
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,800
God dammit

654
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:14,176
Anyway this is about dr. Marion Gruber the director of the office of vaccine research and review

655
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,736
Dr. Philip Crouse the deputy of said office

656
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:21,600
All right well unfortunately if your last name is Gruber you are from die-hard VA

657
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,136
Well and also

658
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,928
The doctor group is a woman

659
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,464
Alex kept referring

660
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,024
Cuz it's Hans gruber's daughter

661
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,584
Who's come back to Heather FL Alex

662
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,864
Repeatedly

663
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,168
Referred to dr. Gruber Elsa as a man

664
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,192
Anyway

665
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:41,056
Secondly doctor Gruber announced that she was retiring after being with the FDA for 32 years

666
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,360
Across adopted to leave as well

667
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:49,504
The exact reason for their departure hasn't been announced but one unnamed Source cited in Politico article claimed they quote

668
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,832
Leftover differences with fda's top vaccine official

669
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
Peter marks

670
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,696
You see doctor Mark's is the director of the center for biologics

671
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,488
Evaluation research

672
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:03,584
Which is the umbrella underneath which the office of vaccine research and review exist

673
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,888
Alice is conveniently decided

674
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,656
The cut marks out of

675
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,192
The story because he complicates

676
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,216
It's things because

677
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:14,848
I was just naturally know anything about what's going on you just Kim just political article anyway

678
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,640
Exactly we better

679
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,456
Here's how you can tell what Alex is doing his ass Kim job

680
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,528
The headline of the article in Politico is quote

681
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,832
Biden's top-down booster plan

682
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,624
Sparks anger at FDA

683
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,928
And then the sub-headline is quote

684
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:34,304
Acting FDA commissioner Janet Woodcock sent a memo Tuesday evening to vexing regulators

685
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,888
Reiterating her support as frustration over the process spread

686
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,168
Within their right

687
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:44,032
If you are all had of all you had to go on was that blurb of information

688
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:48,896
Your mind might turn into a situation where these two bold scientists said the booster vaccines wooden

689
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,712
The work and then they were shot down by this evil doctor woodcock

690
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
Who wants kids

691
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,272
To get hooked on Fentanyl

692
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:59,392
You can see the first stages of the building blocks for Alex's narrative in that headline and sub-headline

693
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:04,000
But if you actually read the article you see that there's more texture to this story than his coverage is allowing

694
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:11,168
There is a very real possibility that the two doctors departures does have something to do with a disagreement

695
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,216
Silver the vaccine booster program

696
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,288
But their concerns are nothing like what Alex is pretending they are

697
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,384
They're very valid criticisms that we've discussed here about how booster

698
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,784
They're not necessarily the best allocation of resources when dealing with a community-level issue as we are right now

699
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,672
Alright very well maybe that it's a great strategy on an individual level but that's

700
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
It's not always

701
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,488
The main variable that you're concerned with

702
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,536
Right we're dealing with spread

703
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,328
I need to look at this as a community issue

704
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,400
Yeah that would only reinforce the two different

705
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:45,216
Maxine vaccinated unvaccinated America's yeah

706
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,008
Yeah and take

707
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:50,080
Internationally as well as countries that are in need

708
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:55,968
Politico article they bring up some other valid concerns which have to do with the White House aiming to take the lead

709
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:00,064
And making declarations about time frames that are not been fully endorsed by the FDA

710
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:05,440
I can definitely see that being an issue for Regulators within the FDA and I'd love jobs

711
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,464
For last

712
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744
I don't I don't know if

713
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
Weekend

714
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,328
Definitively say exactly what

715
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,656
The situation vacations

716
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,936
There's there's some

717
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,544
Uniformity

718
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,568
Yeah yeah

719
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:25,664
You know that's that's interesting this is one of the few times where if I were

720
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,688
One of those.

721
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
Is that would be like

722
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
Who the

723
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,016
F***** you

724
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,040
President Biden

725
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,344
To tell us when scienceworks

726
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,672
You know what I'm saying like you're just a f****** president shut up

727
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:41,792
I can also see being in the position you're in and refuses

728
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
Listen to leave

729
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,352
During the

730
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,400
Beginning of the pandemic

731
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,984
Even if things are being mishandled and Trump is coming out and being like

732
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,080
Let's take this a weirdo hydroxychloroquine

733
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,360
You know it cuz

734
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,896
Leonardo dates

735
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
All hands on deck

736
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:02,272
We're not out of the woods right now but it is a little bit different

737
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,064
Damn if you have a different

738
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,344
In the steps

739
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,136
That are being taken moving forward

740
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,696
It might now be a time where you could make it

741
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,256
Decision where you like I have to resign

742
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:17,632
I don't I don't know I think it was probably a really complicated

743
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,680
Situation that these doctors

744
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:26,080
Are are engaging with death and I look forward to learning more about it

745
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,640
These are the best speculation

746
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,664
That we can make

747
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,456
Based on one anonymous source

748
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
That was listed

749
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,528
In the Politico article that Alex didn't read

750
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:39,136
The important thing to focus on here that I think is the way that the reporting Alex

751
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:39,904
Is doing

752
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,768
It's essentially a dramatization of what he thinks happened based on skimming a headline

753
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,560
That's the level of analysis

754
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,352
That goes on on Alex's show

755
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,888
I meant once that's done

756
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,424
He takes that

757
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,216
And make stuff up about

758
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,776
And the two top scientist

759
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,312
Have gone public saying

760
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,360
Resignation

761
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:02,944
We are mad about the authorization that's not a real authorization

762
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,248
About children

763
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,344
We said don't do this and they did in the fine print

764
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,160
Oh they're just mad about the booster

765
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,208
Schedule

766
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,488
Distraction

767
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,560
And everybody took the bait and just went with the booster issue

768
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,864
Is not as big as

769
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,144
We've been bypassed

770
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,264
They shouldn't have done the emergency authorization saying that's an authorization

771
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,824
It's attacking

772
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,128
So I mean he's just making up with these

773
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,664
Concerns and like

774
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:39,296
Almost creating a fictional resignation letter that everyone's ignoring their dad

775
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,832
It's not real

776
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:44,672
I remember I did check out dr. risers

777
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:48,256
Resignation email where he said he was mad about you Paul

778
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,096
I think

779
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,704
Alright whatever man

780
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:05,152
It's just not fair you just can't just eat can't create like yeah

781
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:09,760
Primary sources life

782
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,832
Everyone's ignoring you

783
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,160
It's not real

784
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,464
So I wanted to

785
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,488
Play this clip

786
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,816
What are the reasons they wanted to play this was because I almost didn't

787
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,352
And I want

788
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,936
Is to live as an example of like this is something

789
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:28,960
Ignore

790
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:32,032
Okay this is something that just rolls off my back right

791
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,104
It's crazy and it is something that I was like

792
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,872
I don't have time

793
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,176
Trials now

794
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,992
And it hurts

795
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,832
Babies are having convulsions babies are dying

796
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,624
Weather freakazoid

797
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,696
Liberal parents

798
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,488
This is child sacrifices

799
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,768
Munchausen by proxy

800
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,536
This is

801
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,328
This is a demonic spirit

802
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,448
Doughboy pedigo's on his show all the time and it's just like

803
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,240
Tears

804
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,824
If you really believe that liberal parents are taking

805
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,848
Babies to get

806
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:10,944
Vaccinate as a satanic demonic sacrifice

807
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:14,528
Yeah it but that's very extreme stuff

808
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,552
And it is just

809
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,600
The kind of thing that I end up listening to

810
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:21,696
Like ho-hum another Navy officer

811
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:28,096
While a lot of people go into work all day and they never hear about babies being murdered by all the doctors in the

812
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,400
Never hear about

813
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,680
So Prime

814
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:36,800
For like the devil to actually make me a deal cuz I'm still bored by the ideas

815
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,456
Give me

816
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
I heard about the

817
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,760
Anytime

818
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,040
Hey devil I'm good

819
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,832
What do what deal do you have

820
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,136
What is it

821
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,208
Board board by the devil will give you rich

822
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:58,560
She's beyond your madman I don't have the imagination for riches well

823
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,216
No deal just

824
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,544
I ignore stuff like that it's fun

825
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,128
To just take a step back sometimes and think about like well that's

826
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,200
Implore

827
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:15,968
Yep that's

828
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,760
That's normal

829
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:21,088
Play a clip of this guy who's giving

830
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,880
Speech about to have a son

831
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,416
Died because of the

832
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,512
You're just wondering latest videos Man son dies

833
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,840
Enlarged heart

834
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,656
They wouldn't give it a buyer's report though

835
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,704
100 * 40

836
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:43,616
And they're just getting started

837
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,480
Legitimately no idea how this person wouldn't be able to make a report to bears

838
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:54,112
Like I was poking around prepping this episode and I could have easily filed a fake Bears report online in about 2 minutes

839
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,392
I'm going to say they probably have a

840
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,928
Contact us button.

841
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:03,328
Not exist

842
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,656
Hypotheses they can use other data sources or experiments

843
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,424
The test

844
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,448
I don't believe it

845
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:13,568
This guy somehow couldn't report to there's no idea how any whistleblower to possibly quantify

846
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,848
How many reports art

847
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,872
Being made to occur

848
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,176
Completely voluntary reporting system

849
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,968
They can be accessed from any

850
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,736
Computer

851
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,040
It's all seems like Malik Jones bulshit man

852
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:29,696
As far as this guy and his son go I'm not going to engage with the story any further at side is saying that I don't believe that he wouldn't be able to report it

853
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,464
Tavares

854
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,768
Anecdotal stories in cases of death

855
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,048
The can't even be proven to

856
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,608
Pain caused by the vaccine that's a compelling evidence of anything

857
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,400
And you know

858
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,680
I feel bad

859
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,448
I'd like the guy

860
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,496
Son died

861
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,032
Presumably in like

862
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:44,800
That's awful.

863
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,568
Awful

864
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,592
That's awful

865
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,152
Did it to his death

866
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,736
After a vaccination doesn't

867
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,784
Prove anything about the vaccination

868
00:40:55,296 --> 00:41:00,672
He was in a car accident after the vaccinations they would have been like well the vaccine was

869
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,464
Messing with his brain and that's why he

870
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,512
He died you know that it wouldn't matter

871
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,792
Whatever happened

872
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,840
He got the vaccine and then shortly after

873
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,608
He died so it's

874
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,144
Exploitable and that's all that

875
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,680
Alex Dam

876
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:17,056
So you got this clip of this guy talking about his son dying cuz he got the vaccine

877
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:20,128
And then here's the next clip that Alex decides to cover

878
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,432
Let's go

879
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,736
Priest talking about the devil

880
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:29,344
Is overplaying his hand I totally agree the devil Dover playing as hell

881
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
The devil

882
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,648
Is over playing

883
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:39,840
Alex reported that correctly

884
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,888
Sing that used in some weird Christian circles

885
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
There's a

886
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,472
Preoccupation with convincing congregations that

887
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:49,824
This time the devil is just gone too far it made everything way too obvious

888
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,919
This time all the people couldn't see the magical things you're seeing

889
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,735
Are finally going to realize that you've been right all along

890
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:01,343
Princeton Sears a dumb dumb preacher on Jim Bakker Show back in 2018

891
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
I believe that

892
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,183
That the devil overplayed his

893
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,767
Panda New York

894
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,815
I believe what we're going to see happen

895
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,095
Is that this

896
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,631
Overplaying of the handle

897
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,423
The devil it actually is

898
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,447
Is going to

899
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
Sure

900
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:17,983
President

901
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
Trump the ending

902
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,799
Dependent vote in 2000

903
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,567
720

904
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:26,431
It's a way of reassuring people that your beliefs though people look at

905
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,711
Get you as if

906
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,503
You're crazy for thinking

907
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,271
The devil

908
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,319
Is manipulating your enemies

909
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,111
Yeah you're actually right

910
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,903
And this proves at this time

911
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:41,279
Yeah you can believe in

912
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:45,631
Any of what your religion stands for and also believe that the devil can

913
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,679
Overplay anyhow

914
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,287
Again your religion States

915
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,823
But this is how it happened

916
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,103
+ 2

917
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,919
To imagine that the devil is going to make a mistake

918
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:03,551
The devil's going to make a whoop

919
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,575
The devil

920
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:15,583
Yeah I think the overplaying the Hampton is just a way of like

921
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:20,703
Appealing to people's inaugurate

922
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,543
The clip that Alex's playing is something that one of his employees found posted on to

923
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,311
Tik-Tok

924
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:29,919
It was a little video posted on account called RJ Richmond to just

925
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,967
Clips of someone appears to be a castle

926
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,247
Priest giving sermon

927
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:40,415
This is a fella named Meeks was actually a Catholic priest in Maryland but around

928
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,439
A bit too much and

929
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,487
And doing so I discovered an aspect of

930
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,279
Solecism but I didn't know existed

931
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:49,631
Apparently there's an entire branch of Catholicism called the

932
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,935
Ordinariate of the chair of saint

933
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
Peter

934
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:58,335
Which exists to cater to people in the United States and Canada who want to be Catholic but also want to hold on to some aspect

935
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,615
Of the Anglican Church

936
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,639
But they're converting from

937
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:04,479
Is Masters at math Camp which I guess is okay I just didn't know that is

938
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,807
The Reka half-and-half version

939
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,879
School that means we believe in the Bible for sure anyway

940
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:17,279
The point is that Alex is reporting on a video that someone found on Tik-Tok of a dude preaching about the devil and this is not hard hitting

941
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
Uno

942
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,839
No

943
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:26,239
The devil has overplayed his hand and you can hear it in that said now if you

944
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,543
You wanted to save the devil is overplayed his hand

945
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,079
I would suggest that

946
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,615
Convincing all of these cats

947
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,663
Play priests to tell people that

948
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,943
Don't worry about it

949
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,223
The devils

950
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:40,063
By not going to beat him this time that would be the devil's work

951
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,855
Of tricking you into a false

952
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,647
Sense of safety

953
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:46,975
And then that's when he comes in the devil's got a tell

954
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,999
He licks his lips

955
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:52,095
How you know

956
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:56,191
Is that Alexis Lipton that's how you know you is to parrot

957
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,983
You're fine

958
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:58,751
You got it

959
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,031
Thanks Jesus

960
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,079
AC

961
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:05,151
What's the bible verse When you guys can pull it up

962
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,967
The devil goes around like a wild

963
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,503
Beast roaring

964
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,807
Seeing who he may devour

965
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:16,927
Because

966
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,719
Or is going to take on the wall

967
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,767
Take on the Beast

968
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,887
What a Satanist I left this will grovel or fall down

969
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:26,911
On their back

970
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,199
This show is really good

971
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:41,247
Yeah that's good stuff

972
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,575
He stayed up

973
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:50,207
Till 2 a.m. for that kind of information to drop on you

974
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,791
Right

975
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,375
Why do we spend so much time

976
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,655
Documenting his noise

977
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:03,519
I don't know I think it's noises are that maybe they

978
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:10,175
He talked about how he was one of the world's most respected voice

979
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:13,503
Man is one of the places where he has

980
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:18,879
The most tablets true that is true except for the dragon character that's just

981
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:19,903
That's good

982
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:23,231
Optimus Prime

983
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:27,583
He would have been a great guardian of the

984
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:32,959
Star-Lord

985
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:36,031
Tell Alex Beyond

986
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,567
And

987
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,615
I guess save it

988
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,895
Patriots

989
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,687
Can be the devil but left a Satanist

990
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:48,319
Can't we just love the devils

991
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,087
Anyway

992
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,391
The Goblins have a plan

993
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,975
Is it a different one

994
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
Fire truck

995
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:58,815
ILearn

996
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,583
Things

997
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,911
The FDA is virtually controlled by Pfizer

998
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,191
Pfizer

999
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,775
Has control not Johnson & Johnson not moderna

1000
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,847
But Pfizer has control over the FDA

1001
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:14,943
What's the difference

1002
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,735
You have till 2 a.m.

1003
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:25,951
A policy advisor

1004
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:26,975
With government

1005
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,791
People running Pfizer

1006
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:32,607
Have a great relationship

1007
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,375
Government

1008
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,239
Pfizer what they did

1009
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:43,103
Yeah Pfizer runs the whole thing worldwide

1010
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:43,871
Yeoman

1011
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,687
Pfizer runs the whole

1012
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,735
Babalous programme

1013
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,759
Kewanee

1014
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,063
Plane

1015
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,087
Supreme

1016
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:57,951
That's something that has been a part of every plan that he said the globalist have had right

1017
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:04,607
I feel like it's weird that Alex is surprised by that clip of trump saying that

1018
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:09,727
Pfizer basically runs the FDA considering that's what he reported at the beginning of the show

1019
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,799
Only imp

1020
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:17,919
The second clip implied that they're good with government contract

1021
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:21,503
Like there's some closeness internally do well with government

1022
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,527
Which

1023
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,575
Sure good lobbying

1024
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,647
Claire's close relationships with

1025
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:32,511
That doesn't mean they run the FBI or the government of the world

1026
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:37,119
The f*** Alex's reporting who is

1027
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,167
A little bit like I said at the beginning

1028
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,959
He's behind the scam

1029
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,239
Yeah he's behind the grill

1030
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:45,823
He thinks that this insinuation game is going to lower the

1031
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,103
Extremists to him

1032
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,127
And instead

1033
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,943
He is only signaling to them

1034
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,735
In a way that is going to be a

1035
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,295
And here's what I think will happen make them angry

1036
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,463
Vince said he was

1037
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:05,791
The entire time

1038
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,559
To these

1039
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,095
Extreme is 12

1040
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,119
You know

1041
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,167
Their belief is advisor strike

1042
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,191
Kill everyone

1043
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:17,055
Right where

1044
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:21,919
Did Pfizer runs the FDA and is in bed with the government and stuff

1045
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:26,783
And he's not doing something about it that he's facilitating either by

1046
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,831
Active decisions or negligence

1047
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,903
The killing off of people with right by their bed right

1048
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:32,927
No it

1049
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,951
It only

1050
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,231
It's the only

1051
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,255
Conclusion UK

1052
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,535
Could draw from those types

1053
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,815
Clips is like

1054
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,839
You were the

1055
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:43,423
You approved the vaccine you got that going

1056
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:50,079
You're in on it well even even though even that you might be able to pretend that he like always been tricked or what

1057
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,359
But

1058
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,383
Now

1059
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,943
You're still

1060
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:58,015
Trump and they can get rid of them now they don't

1061
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
Nope

1062
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:02,623
You but you could still do a whole lot other than

1063
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,903
Gu

1064
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:10,303
Manifold about like hey you know I hear that visors real good with the government

1065
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,143
You know you could be a little bit more assertive

1066
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:17,471
You could take some actions as opposed to just

1067
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,751
Talk s***

1068
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,055
I'm always amazed at how

1069
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,871
Quickly our press just

1070
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:24,639
Dislike

1071
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:30,015
Alright well you were the president now you're not anymore so we don't need to worry about all the stuff you did

1072
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,039
Just like

1073
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,063
Hey you know what

1074
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,599
Yeah sure

1075
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:37,695
It's due to you and your government that all of these people are dead

1076
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,767
But anymore so we'll just have you on

1077
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,535
Quick interview

1078
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,583
You think it's a tough

1079
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,607
Box to open

1080
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:50,751
Once you start holding presidential countable boy everything goes great I'm not saying we shouldn't

1081
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,031
Obviously

1082
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,055
But it stopped

1083
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:59,199
Fans

1084
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,735
This makes clip Jordan

1085
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,503
Yes

1086
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,783
Feel like

1087
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,135
This is a death toll

1088
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:11,999
Call Schwab Bill Gates

1089
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,863
You will never reverse the bakery set

1090
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,007
In the poverty

1091
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,359
2 kill

1092
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,151
Majority

1093
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,175
How's everybody

1094
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:30,943
By then

1095
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,271
Books

1096
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,039
The clothes

1097
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:35,807
Do

1098
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,831
You

00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,599
Under

1100
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,647
How much

1101
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,183
You

1102
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,231
You work under

1103
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,255
Ohio

1104
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,023
Weapon

1105
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:46,815
Synthetic

1106
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,095
Ohio

1107
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:53,727
And you look at the left how pale they are and how greenskins they are

1108
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,263
How zombie-like they are

1109
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,823
Spirit over the spirit of death

1110
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,127
Is abortion

1111
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,431
Animal cloning

1112
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,343
You just hating themselves and hating you

1113
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,647
What I hear stuff like this

1114
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:14,207
Switches you know fairly routine on Alex's yet

1115
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:17,023
It's really hard not to think of the lessons that were learned

1116
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,327
After the Rwandan genocide

1117
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,911
Radio demonization

1118
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:26,751
Did play a role in turning people against their neighbors you betcha

1119
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:31,871
I don't think that Alex's reaches nearly

1120
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:35,711
What ya need to beat down

1121
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:39,039
But this is the kind of behavior that

1122
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,343
That is in the same

1123
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,367
Ballpark

1124
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:46,975
Obviously not equivalent but it's in the same ballpark you're taking a group

1125
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,023
Of people and you're creating

1126
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,327
Demon zombies out of them

1127
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:56,703
Who exists only to be taken over by this evil force that wants to kill you and your fam

1128
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:01,823
There's no there's no end of this road that is in

1129
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,639
Bad no I mean

1130
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,919
If if if

1131
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,199
If anybody

1132
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,735
Compares the left

1133
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:09,759
Two Nazis

1134
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,527
Or the like

1135
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,063
How

1136
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:12,831
Do you get

1137
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,903
More noxious than a law that has you

1138
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:18,719
Reporting gender Traders for about

1139
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,999
No likes

1140
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:24,863
Give give me any situation where that is allowed to run rampant

1141
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,447
For two years and it doesn't wind up with women getting murder charges

1142
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,727
And then being exit

1143
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:31,775
Like that is straight up

1144
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,543
Real life

1145
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,079
100%

1146
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,103
Nazi s***

1147
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,383
No joke

1148
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,407
No

1149
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,431
F***** around

1150
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,479
Just Nazis in Texas

1151
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,503
Run the government

1152
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,063
That whole situation is

1153
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:48,159
Almost too bizarre even for me to feel comfortable covering it

1154
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,439
Yeah

1155
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,207
Like

1156
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:54,303
Alex and didn't bring it up on this installed

1157
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,583
Yaks

1158
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,143
Booty does bring up his

1159
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,191
More evils that Pfizer is bringing

1160
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:00,959
Into the world

1161
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:04,031
And so now I got the article Pet Shop please

1162
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:07,103
Pfizer is now developing infowars.com

1163
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:14,271
It must be taken alongside vaccines

1164
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,295
And they're saying

1165
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,087
Your Apple show

1166
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:17,855
You'll have to

1167
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,671
Check yourself

1168
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,463
Proven you taking it

1169
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,999
Better not have any

1170
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,535
Drug avoidance

1171
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,095
So thx-1138

1172
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,631
Here

1173
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,399
Oh man

1174
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,423
I hate it when

1175
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:34,751
28 x 11 3/8 is here

1176
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,287
Thx-1138

1177
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,823
Yu-Gi-Oh

1178
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,359
Pfizer's working on

1179
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,663
Some clinical trials on an antiviral called

1180
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:44,991
Pf07 321 332

1181
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,015
By which

1182
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:49,343
Addition to a trial date data in July

1183
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:52,927
They're waiting on results or not entirely sure how effective this drug is

1184
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,719
Where is this drug work

1185
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:58,815
Works in theory is that it blocks the enzyme that the coronavirus uses to multiply

1186
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:04,703
At the same time with these trials are going on work is also doing trials on a drug called Moon

1187
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,983
Good morning

1188
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,263
Pure Revere

1189
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,031
Which works

1190
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:13,407
Spy quote introducing errors into the RNA of the virus that eventually prevented from replicating

1191
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:19,295
This isn't surprising nor is it a bombshell that pharmaceutical companies will be working on different approaches

1192
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,575
Dissolving different aspect

1193
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,599
Gigantic global

1194
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,367
No problem right

1195
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:29,023
They're good and they help a lot but what if you add vaccines to help out a community level and then you develop good antiviral

1196
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,559
Medications that can be used on an end

1197
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,583
Individual basis

1198
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,375
Look for people you know Google

1199
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,167
Protect people who can't

1200
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,191
Vaccinated

1201
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,215
WFAN better

1202
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:43,615
Also this really is already a thing since Ram desertview exists and isn't approved antiviral treatment

1203
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,407
Don't know why this

1204
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:48,735
It is sometimes

1205
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,503
You know like

1206
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,039
Just like with that clip

1207
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:53,087
The valix being like they killed baby

1208
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,367
Freezer whatever in your life

1209
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:57,695
Sometimes it is amazing to hear that they're just

1210
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:58,975
You

1211
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,791
We live in an era where they can make a pill

1212
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,607
With the irna of a virus

1213
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,911
What the f***

1214
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,959
Crazy it is

1215
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:16,383
Much more valuable used time to discuss like the amazing breakthrough

1216
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,663
There's a technology

1217
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,735
Wouldn't that be great or like when you're talkin about this like

1218
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,551
Misrepresentations of Vera's data like

1219
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,087
Actually understanding

1220
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,879
The structure of

1221
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:30,463
Active and passive monitoring of Public Health stuff

1222
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:33,535
Because when we get bring so much more people's lives

1223
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,095
To like

1224
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,143
Get a dopamine Rush

1225
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:41,471
Yeah out of it been the same way you do like

1226
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:44,543
I know you're disincentivize for learning about those.

1227
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,079
Let me know but sometimes I get

1228
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:48,895
Drenalin restroom like whole ship

1229
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,199
Yeah we are weird

1230
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:51,967
We are weird

1231
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:58,367
A picture of a world where everyone has to accept all these shots

1232
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,391
Can't leave their home

1233
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,671
Complete bulshit

1234
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:06,815
The trials for Pfizer's drugs are being given to people with confirmed diagnosis so the goal is to see if they can develop a drug test

1235
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,095
Effective as a treatment

1236
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:10,143
Conversely The Merck drugs

1237
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,959
Testing is aimed at seeing if they can develop a preventative

1238
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:14,239
Type of medication

1239
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:18,591
This trial is going to involve people who live with someone who has a lab confirm

1240
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,871
Asymptomatic

1241
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:23,967
A covalent determine if a drug has an effect on whether or not people get it at all

1242
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,783
Albright right for that Alex is describing benefits

1243
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:31,135
Summer cocktail but all that was his evil nightmares are already built up around Pfizer

1244
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:34,207
So I guess he's just sort of pretending this is all the same

1245
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,535
Well

1246
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,303
Alex

1247
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,071
It's merkins

1248
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:43,935
I mean that dopamine Rush that you get from that beer and that

1249
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,959
Excitement is

1250
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:51,359
Diminished by actually to do that

1251
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,967
So anyway women

1252
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:56,991
What about

1253
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,271
Still doing

1254
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,039
Still going

1255
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,831
Accepting tyranny

1256
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:04,159
I mean if you live in Texas yeah you sure are

1257
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:04,927
This

1258
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:05,951
Clip is dumb

1259
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:09,023
Bill is expected to be released

1260
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:13,375
By the end of the year and will be required to be twice per day

1261
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,423
I noticed

1262
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:20,287
For women worldwide friends

1263
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,663
And shouldn't be the leader of the household

1264
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,735
The women hopping around ordering husband around

1265
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,015
Stepin fetchit

1266
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:36,671
When they can go out and how much meat

1267
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:39,487
If they can have a child or cuddle

1268
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:49,727
I'm bleeding out 25

1269
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,519
And so

1270
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,567
That's how sick this is

1271
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:56,127
I like to retract what I was saying with Alex doing good voices

1272
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,151
Yeah that was Tara

1273
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,199
You know I

1274
00:58:59,455 --> 00:58:59,967
Do like

1275
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:05,087
The idea of being married to a man who thinks all women are weak and dumb

1276
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,135
That's great that sounds great

1277
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:09,183
And they're being tricked into

1278
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:11,487
Pretending that they're equal with

1279
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:17,887
Men speaking to media is making me play there's nothing better than a relationship

1280
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,191
One person thinks you're useless

1281
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:23,775
Terrible and if you get a little bit too you know

1282
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:27,359
Confident in yourself that's only going to lead to the globalist

1283
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,639
Exactly

1284
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:35,039
Yeah you cannot have confidence in yourself if you're a woman otherwise you'll be taken advantage of us you're confident

1285
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,087
Position of being subservient

1286
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:42,207
Exactly as long as you got a man telling you what to do you will be fine

1287
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:46,815
Women understand that could it be all of human history

1288
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,119
Alright I find this a little bit

1289
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,471
Damning cdc.gov

1290
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,495
But he's brought up

1291
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:55,775
Sure

1292
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,055
Really talked about what it is

1293
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,127
And maybe it's at the AIDS

1294
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,919
Something

1295
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:04,223
Either way absolute Global bombshell

1296
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:07,039
Based on how he presented it so far I've been very

1297
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,855
I'm an open the phone's up in 15 after

1298
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:12,415
The next hour but it's really big store that I mention

1299
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:14,719
In the end

1300
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,255
Horseshoe sandwich the next hour

1301
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,583
Nashville CDC document

1302
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,631
Last year

1303
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:22,911
Were they last

1304
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,935
Parts swelling

1305
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:24,959
Heart attacks

1306
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:25,983
Frogs

1307
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,007
Cancer

1308
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,031
Death

1309
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,823
Liquification of the uterus

1310
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,407
What their scientists were telling him what happened

1311
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,479
Now you know why the two-headed virologist quit

1312
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,551
Today's ago

1313
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:46,207
At this point Alex doesn't actually specify what the documentary is referring to is so I was left to try and find it on my own

1314
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:50,559
I was able to find an FDA PowerPoint presentation from October

1315
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,351
2020 that was about a quote

1316
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,679
Plans for monitoring covid-19 vaccine safety and Ethel

1317
01:00:56,703 --> 01:01:00,799
This is just a breakdown of the various passive strategies like there's an active strategy

1318
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:02,079
She's like prism that the f

1319
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:06,431
Damc DC to monitor how the vaccines are working

1320
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:09,759
It explains another initiative the FDA best

1321
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:10,527
System

1322
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,807
What's a biologic

1323
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,087
Effectiveness and safety

1324
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:16,671
I guess beauty is just imply that my backronym

1325
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:20,767
You guys got to work on that

1326
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:27,167
The best system works by compiling data from emergency rooms as well as insurance claims covering the policies of

1327
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:27,935
American

1328
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:31,775
In order to track how many Adverse Events are being seen and what sorts

1329
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,055
The really effective

1330
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,079
Active

1331
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,895
Monitoring strategies that they can use

1332
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,967
Self-report Hodge through things like there's

1333
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:46,367
The presentation covers have their multiple approaches because no one system really can capture a lot of the stuff on its own

1334
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,159
And each has strengths and weakness

1335
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,719
Particularly when one of the large objectives

1336
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:53,279
Is respecting patients rights and privacy

1337
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:57,375
16 of this the 65 is a draft

1338
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,655
Working list of

1339
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,935
Possible adverse event

1340
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,215
You might say

1341
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,775
Specific enough yet so this

1342
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:06,335
Probably isn't the document he's talking about

1343
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,103
Therapist

1344
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:11,199
Yeah that would be really sad

1345
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:13,759
Before I hope we don't end up finding out that this is the document

1346
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:16,575
There's no way that that

1347
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,367
Could possibly happen

1348
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:22,463
0% of 1

1349
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,999
Instead

1350
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:25,791
Baby at 2

1351
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:27,071
The biggest news in the world

1352
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,631
The Rogue

1353
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,911
Yes

1354
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,447
She

1355
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,215
Made a lot of

1356
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,519
Because he came out and said that he had Kobe

1357
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,799
And that he took

1358
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:37,823
Ivermectin

1359
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,591
Along with

1360
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:42,175
Literally everything else

1361
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,711
So Alex

1362
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:44,479
Needs

1363
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:45,247
Do you know if

1364
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,319
The first thing that he needs you to know

1365
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,087
Is

1366
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,623
But he knew about Rogan before you

1367
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,927
12 Corsica

1368
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:53,951
Text all the time

1369
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:56,255
And also Rogen's not supposed to

1370
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,023
Special

1371
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,047
Mike down

1372
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,351
All freaked out

1373
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,119
Joe Rogan

1374
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,935
Cuz they don't tell anybody yet

1375
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,471
I'm making out

1376
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,775
Easton Maryland to Florida

1377
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,311
What's Rochelle

1378
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,127
Thought I was hungover

1379
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,431
And man that I

1380
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,199
Happy sweat

1381
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,223
Fever and I

1382
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:31,327
I talked to Matt Reed Rd been on it for a day was already feeling a lot better

1383
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:36,447
Out of some people right close to me they had it again it

1384
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,519
What's sitting on their chest

1385
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,055
I'm at

1386
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,919
Even closer to my parents

1387
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,199
I know someone that had covid

1388
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,479
But I I

1389
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,295
Deprived

1390
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,743
Gorillas on my chest

1391
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,303
And I went and got tested

1392
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:04,863
Mikrotik

1393
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,471
So it doesn't say it's the same virus

1394
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,007
I just call it cub

1395
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:16,639
So I had covid 2 and I took Ivermectin I was Giratina granted I took a test and it was negative

1396
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,663
What

1397
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:21,503
I was going to say I believe he did not have covid

1398
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,575
So somehow

1399
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,343
He took a test

1400
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:30,463
And was okay this is just convoluted

1401
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:32,767
No idea with the reality of this is

1402
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,303
I have no idea

1403
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,631
It is certainly his behavior would suggest somebody who's at high risk

1404
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:41,215
Connect ecobee

1405
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,263
Over the course of this

1406
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:46,079
So if you were to get it I would not be surprised

1407
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,151
If you were to get it I also think

1408
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:53,759
He has access to pretty good Healthcare and wouldn't have all the things that

1409
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,063
Joe Rogan would have access to as well

1410
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:59,903
I'll be the monoclonal antibodies and whatever kind of

1411
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:01,951
Urgency use treatments

1412
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,231
People will have

1413
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,511
Are trying

1414
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,631
Hey if you're rich and sick you'll probably be okay

1415
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:11,679
I think it's possible that he

1416
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:12,959
Did ecobee

1417
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:15,519
And I also think it's possible that he didn't

1418
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:18,591
Based on him saying that he took a test and he was negative

1419
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:19,871
So that's weird

1420
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,943
But I also think that I totally believe

1421
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:29,599
But I want to be jealous of Joe Rogan's attention 100% IMDb like not only did I know about his diagnose

1422
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,879
Closest before all you did

1423
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:34,207
But I actually did the same thing that he did before he did it

1424
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:39,839
And I just didn't want to tell the media but now that I see the proof-of-concept that people are enjoying Rogan

1425
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,935
Yep yep

1426
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,727
It is attention

1427
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,775
I don't know what the reality is

1428
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,823
I could see it all being true

1429
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:54,431
Being vaccinated to see it all possible

1430
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:59,039
All bets are off cuz he's not telling the truth to anyone

1431
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,343
Ever

1432
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,415
Yeah it's very confusing but I do find it

1433
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,183
Funny

1434
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:07,231
Yeah he's getting on air

1435
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:11,071
Alright f*** it I had covid

1436
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:15,679
I have been denying everything for so long

1437
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,727
So I lied about it

1438
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:22,847
I could see that now not only that not only did I recently but also

1439
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,919
And I had trouble year-and-a-half ago as well

1440
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,711
And

1441
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:30,527
Oh my God it was very very mild did

1442
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,343
This was this was Stronger this was more intense this

1443
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:38,463
That's why I look blown

1444
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:41,791
Oh she had to get over the year and a half ago to see vet you've got

1445
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:42,559
You got it twice

1446
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,327
Now

1447
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,375
Isn't interesting also

1448
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,143
It seems like

1449
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,167
Maybe

1450
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:50,495
Is a year-and-a-half ago you got sick and it was mild

1451
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,543
And this time it was a lot more

1452
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,311
Severe

1453
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,871
The A-Team coincidental

1454
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,895
Or interesting

1455
01:06:57,151 --> 01:07:03,295
Or maybe not coincidental that your coverage is last time it was fake and this time it's really just seem like that

1456
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,343
Whatever your personal experience

1457
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:12,767
Applied to the entire world to Maidu

1458
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:19,167
Sing that sounds somewhat familiar boy it is exactly in the pattern of the way Alex Jones behave

1459
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:21,983
It's it's hard to look at any of those like

1460
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:24,287
List of signs of

1461
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:30,431
Malignant narcissists and not be like 11 11

1462
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:32,223
I think you even create new simple

1463
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:38,879
Who like he's mutated

1464
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:41,951
So creative with his narcissism

1465
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:45,279
Enable

1466
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:48,351
It is he really it does it does remind you of

1467
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,631
Virus

1468
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:54,239
To contain this out

1469
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,543
It's narcissism

1470
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,615
Lampeter screen

1471
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,407
Omicron

1472
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,175
Garbage

1473
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,783
Data

1474
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,623
That's right people mispronounce zaida

1475
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,903
The data

1476
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:13,183
I did not know that

1477
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:21,119
So Alec Alec says enemies that make up things about

1478
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,911
I think he's talking about us

1479
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:23,935
You think so

1480
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,215
6000k

1481
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,519
And that's why he didn't want to tell everyone

1482
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,287
But he had covid

1483
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,311
Twice right

1484
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,359
A lot of enemies that always

1485
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:34,431
I never got into it with a while back

1486
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:38,271
I thought explain buddy else

1487
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:44,159
And you're going to get sick again unless you just overload your vitamins and minerals

1488
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,487
Prophylactically

1489
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,119
Oh no

1490
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,143
Guys

1491
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:56,447
We do my officers a big brown paper bag

1492
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:01,311
Oh boy this is falling off the rails now brown paper bag

1493
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:04,127
Is getting a not good alright

1494
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:10,527
I didn't tell people year-and-a-half ago I had covid cuz I knew that dumb podcast would really s*** all over me for a long time

1495
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:16,927
It all over me like that screaming guy would have screamed for a long time

1496
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:24,607
Stupid I am really tough not appear that that way is up

1497
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,167
Or even

1498
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:33,567
Just take us out of it like it would have really hurt a lot of the arguments I was making back then people had known that

1499
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:39,199
Covid-19

1500
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,223
Astonishing

1501
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:45,343
But the second part that I need to really really highlight here is

1502
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,879
Did he saying that like

1503
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:50,719
You told it people like you're not going to escape this if you're going to get it or whatever

1504
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:54,815
By not disclosing that he has it

1505
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,095
I'm going

1506
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,119
Get to rallies

1507
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:59,167
Is going to Auntie Mass protests

1508
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:01,727
Going to the grocery store in Florida

1509
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,799
By where is that rotten her mask

1510
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:05,567
All the stuff

1511
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,871
He is essentially making a decision

1512
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,919
For the people around him

1513
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,967
Expose them to it

1514
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:15,039
Yeah he's making this decision that you're not going to escape it

1515
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:15,807
For them

1516
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:18,623
And that's f***** up that is beyond

1517
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,439
Disgusting Behavior

1518
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:26,303
I don't know if all of the people who work at Infowars were aware of his

1519
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:30,399
His diagnosis

1520
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:32,703
Expose them to it but if not

1521
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:35,007
I think they could probably sue him totally

1522
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:38,847
I think it's an unsafe work environment that Alex

1523
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,639
Consciously created

1524
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,663
Ryan the Hills

1525
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:44,223
Denial of the risk doesn't

1526
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:46,015
Actually mitigate the risk

1527
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:50,111
I think this is just admitting he's a horrible person

1528
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:53,183
Yeah he's a nightmarish person who is

1529
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:55,487
Possibly directly responsible for the death

1530
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:56,767
I am he doesn't eat

1531
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:58,303
It's clear that he doesn't

1532
01:10:58,815 --> 01:10:59,327
Looks like respect

1533
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:01,887
Other people's ability to make informed

1534
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:02,655
Decision

1535
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,935
If he's lying

1536
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:08,031
About whether or not he has it or lying by omission

1537
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,311
I don't know.

1538
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:12,127
The timeline of when he had it but he obviously didn't Courant

1539
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:12,895
13mm cell

1540
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,199
Well I mean not just that but you think

1541
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,735
S*** he had it

1542
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:19,039
The same time he's telling people

1543
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,063
To go rip off

1544
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:22,111
People's masks from their faces

1545
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:26,975
It's true you know like if I'm screaming at people in stores if they ask me where am I

1546
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:29,535
That's f***** up yeah that's really f*****

1547
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:33,887
The only other thing I can think about is like maybe he did actually

1548
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:34,911
Get sick

1549
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
At some point

1550
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,215
Quarantine himself

1551
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:37,983
Because

1552
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:41,055
There's a lot of vacations

1553
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,079
That is true

1554
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:44,127
There have been weeks where he's gone

1555
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,407
Yeah

1556
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:51,807
So maybe one of those was at him covering

1557
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:53,855
Right now I thought Alex was right about everything

1558
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:58,463
Anyway he gets really cocky about how he's got Ivermectin now

1559
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:02,303
Prophylactically

1560
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,327
Totally cool

1561
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:07,167
Prophylactically

1562
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,567
Attract guys

1563
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:17,407
We do my officers a big brown paper bag and bring it to me please

1564
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,455
The one with the Ivermectin bag

1565
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,015
Nnn just bring it to me

1566
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:25,855
So

1567
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:28,927
Remember these murderers and criminals don't want you to know that

1568
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:33,791
Support.com

1569
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:36,351
Wow wow

1570
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,655
I can't I mean on the other hand

1571
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:44,543
I can absolutely see the doctor that's willing to take Alex Jones as a patient just being like

1572
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:50,943
You want to shut down after mekton I'm not going to stop I get I get my Ivermectin from a doctor's name is dr.

1573
01:12:55,039 --> 01:13:01,183
Are you going to are you going to mock my Paul Reiser joke and then pull up Mister Ed out of your way back

1574
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:03,231
Alright

1575
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:06,559
Alright wonder what

1576
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:12,447
I just think this is really silly that he's getting really defensive

1577
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,983
About Ivermectin and then

1578
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,775
Doing a pivot to a my pillow at

1579
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:24,223
I don't know if it's a copy that he has to read but you always like to have amazing human beds

1580
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:25,759
Do they also sell like dog bed

1581
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,807
Yeah it's okay great great

1582
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,575
Cry cry cry

1583
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,879
Put your specified human bed is always

1584
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,415
Always sticks out his

1585
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:33,695
That's a weird

1586
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,719
Weird way to describe

1587
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,255
So Alex

1588
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,023
Gets

1589
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:37,791
This bag

1590
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:38,815
You made you

1591
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,351
Your human bed now lie in it

1592
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,399
He's good at lying

1593
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,703
Sir Alex against his paper bag

1594
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:49,055
One of them has a 40 on it

1595
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:51,615
The other one had to divert Mac

1596
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:53,663
Want to see my Ivermectin

1597
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,503
Oh what's what's all this

01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,135
Let's just open it up for you

1599
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:05,439
Tractor Supply

1600
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:08,767
Does Evan like Santa Claus taking care of everybody

1601
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,095
Hours a day

1602
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:12,863
Vermont

1603
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,399
What does that mean

1604
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,983
Ivermectin hours a day forum

1605
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,263
Arete shot please

1606
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:24,639
This is Ivermectin for humans want to Nobel prizes antiviral

1607
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:26,943
Does that taking hours a day

1608
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:30,271
Does that mean he's Doctor shopping for people like

1609
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:32,831
Guess no idea what that's supposed to even rain

1610
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:36,159
I definitely means he's it doesn't mean that he's taking people chicken

1611
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,695
Can soup and s*** like that though

1612
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:41,535
Ivermectin won a Nobel Prize

1613
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:47,935
Didn't win a Nobel Prize Dance 2015 William C Campbell Eco won the Nobel Prize in physiology

1614
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:48,703
Via Madison

1615
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:51,263
First contributions to the discovery of a Vermeer

1616
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,567
From which Ivermectin was derived

1617
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:58,431
It didn't win the Nobel Prize as a health supplement or as an antiviral though italics

1618
01:14:58,687 --> 01:14:59,199
Claiming

1619
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:02,527
I was specifically about it being a really exciting anti-parasitic

1620
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,807
Sticktherock that have been discovered

1621
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:10,719
A bunch of drugs have been able to be made from this discovery include selamectin which is a topical parasite killer

1622
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,743
For dogs and cats

1623
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,791
Interim actin which is an oral drug

1624
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:14,559
For cattle

1625
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:17,119
It sounds like a really good thing for like

1626
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:19,167
50 warming

1627
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:22,239
Yeah yeah that's really good for

1628
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:25,567
Killing bees

1629
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:31,967
Take a note from Acton believing it to be a preventative or cure for covid is just really stupid and intensely dangerous

1630
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:33,247
Chris just for no reason

1631
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:35,295
The cdc's reported on data

1632
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:39,647
Poison control centers that shows a tripling of calls related to Ivermectin in 2021

1633
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:43,999
And I have to assume Alex doing this bizarre pageant are you taking pills on air isn't going to help

1634
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:46,303
Flatten the curve at all no no

1635
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,583
I don't know

1636
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:52,191
I feel like he wants people to be like somehow offended or like

1637
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:55,775
Triggered by this I guess I guess he wants people to be like

1638
01:15:56,031 --> 01:16:00,383
Oh my God look at how I can ask if he's taking pills on a hair

1639
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:04,479
Instead of everybody just going like hey man if you want to kill yourself don't go for it

1640
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:07,039
This is dangerous and you're being irresponsible

1641
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,063
Pure audio

1642
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,087
Yeah

1643
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,135
But you've done worse

1644
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,927
That's true

1645
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:13,951
That's true

1646
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:18,047
I guess your whole like last year-and-a-half where you just been sort of lying and

1647
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,839
Pretend it didn't have covid

1648
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:21,119
It's probably worse

1649
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:24,447
I really am starting to think you just want a lot of people to die

1650
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:28,543
Do I struggle with that myself I mean it's a little bit like

1651
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,079
It's a little bit like that

1652
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:30,847
That

1653
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,127
Impulse

1654
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,919
Did some religious people have

1655
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:34,687
To where it's like

1656
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:37,247
I will see the end time

1657
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,575
The world will not last beyond babe

1658
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:42,367
And if it's not going to happen

1659
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,135
I'm going to make it

1660
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:45,439
His behavior is really

1661
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:48,511
Tough to find a coherent explanation for the Dozen

1662
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,535
Involved

1663
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,303
Right

1664
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:56,703
The end of the world is involved in whatever he's doing it's got to be something but if you want to be lazy and just

1665
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,471
Adopted

1666
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:59,007
Conclusion that is 1 UK

1667
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:01,823
I'm just

1668
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:04,383
I don't know man it's so weird

1669
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:06,687
It's so weird to just be like

1670
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:09,503
Defensively and aggressively take

1671
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,783
Taking pills on air

1672
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:13,599
It really reminded me of that 2013 episode we listen

1673
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:15,135
To where he had a hamburger

1674
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:17,695
Any put all these supplements

1675
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:25,375
Super male vitality

1676
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,143
Yeah

1677
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:31,775
I don't know what I'm supposed to be experiencing but this is funny I guess

1678
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:34,847
This is stupid

1679
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:40,479
Yeah it starts yelling about this is going to save him or something

1680
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,759
So let me show you

1681
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,319
Earlier

1682
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,671
See that's falchi see this Bill Gates

1683
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:51,487
I'm going to kill those prions you bastard murderers

1684
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:53,791
Bio weapon you monster

1685
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:56,351
You want to suppress me you want to kill me yourself

1686
01:17:58,655 --> 01:17:59,679
I'm going to roll over here

1687
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:03,007
Button press

1688
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:08,639
Is there a Cheesy this Bill Gates I'm going to kill those prions you bastard murderers

1689
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:10,943
Bio weapon you monster

1690
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:15,295
You want to suppress me you want to kill me you son-of-a-b**** you goddamn demon

1691
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,831
You think I'm easy to kill

1692
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,391
We're going to roll over to your

1693
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,159
Crap

1694
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:25,279
I got out of the radio broadcast

1695
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,559
I just

1696
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:29,887
Underwhelmed by the devil if the Devils playing

1697
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,679
Can be counteracted with a

1698
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:34,239
Anti parasite medication

1699
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,519
Damn

1700
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,567
We've just started playing the magic

1701
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:41,151
Magic the Gathering you know what it feels like to overplay your hand

1702
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:44,479
And I assume Satan is it going like oh s***

1703
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,503
I should have tapped

1704
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:47,551
That mana and instead used it

1705
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,855
To create a defensive creature or something like that

1706
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:52,927
Sure but that game

1707
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:55,743
Been up this belief system entails the devil having a

1708
01:18:55,999 --> 01:19:02,143
Thousands of your long plan oh no I didn't consider

1709
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:07,775
My evil plan to put prions and everyone is counteracted by this

1710
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:08,543
Medication

1711
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,335
Seems dumb

1712
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:14,687
I definitely think they like the devil it in his

1713
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:16,223
Mind is really stupid

1714
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:20,319
Somebody that's been there since the birth of creation right next to God with

1715
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:24,159
Probably not be surprised by Ivermectin but who knows

1716
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:28,255
Sports Medicine

1717
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,071
The devil can't even God has

1718
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:32,607
I guess

1719
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:34,911
I would like

1720
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,447
To introduce this into the person

1721
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,751
Call care point

1722
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:45,151
Anyway this a won the Nobel Prize for humans

1723
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,431
This Ivermectin

1724
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,455
Wichita

1725
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:54,111
No although my pillow in the running

1726
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:56,671
Seattle

1727
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,463
Google prize-winning

1728
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:01,535
Or humans

1729
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,519
Bergen Record

1730
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:13,311
Jerome

1731
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,896
Who is feta cheese

1732
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:19,456
Stupid

1733
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,904
Yeah he's rich

1734
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,208
You can't be stupid stupid

1735
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:36,864
That makes sense makes sense I don't think that people who were saying that Joe Rogan's taking horse medicine

1736
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,144
We're actually thinking

1737
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,936
He was taking the worst medicine

1738
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:41,472
It's just that

1739
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:43,008
His listeners will

1740
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:43,776
Yes

1741
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:47,616
He can afford whatever it is he wants he has access

1742
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,408
People who can get him

1743
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,968
Human pill form

1744
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,808
Where is a lot of people who don't have memes can't see doctors

1745
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,088
Don't have insurance

1746
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:03,488
Any of these kind of things will be inclined to take shortcuts if they believe that there is some kind of miracle cure

1747
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,304
And the danger of the behavior of people like Alex

1748
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,072
Joe Rogan

1749
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:09,888
Is that people who are in that

1750
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:11,680
Kind of a situation In Their audience

1751
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,704
Made

1752
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:16,032
I think like a good idea imma take this horse

1753
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,568
Yeah yeah that's the

1754
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:22,944
A comic with a few times she

1755
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,760
Had a joke about her dad

1756
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:28,576
Taking

1757
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,600
Fish penicillin

1758
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,904
Because he was like same as regular

1759
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,696
Penicillin it's the same thing

1760
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,464
And you're like

1761
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:37,536
That is not a man being stupid that is

1762
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,072
The end of a healthcare

1763
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:42,656
System is what you're looking at that the complete failure of a band who's like

1764
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:45,216
I can't just go to the doctor

1765
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:48,288
You know so I'll just take Pisces

1766
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:50,848
Nicely done better joke

1767
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:57,504
I did punch up for this till you got a call that you got to call this

1768
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:02,880
I don't know she's a nationally touring headliner

1769
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:04,160
Okay

1770
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,696
Google

1771
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,792
I might go with 0 to 1

1772
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,096
Anyway Joe Rogan

1773
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,376
He's a brat

1774
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,144
So you smart

1775
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:14,912
He's very smart

1776
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:18,240
House on the river

1777
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:22,336
You left this taking all the shots and Dino the dumbasses

1778
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:24,384
He's the one that headlines with Dave Chappelle

1779
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,432
You're stupid

1780
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:29,760
Yep sure wish you'd wake up

1781
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:33,856
But you said they're calling me stupid independent

1782
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:44,864
But he's not because he's rich and he has a really bright house down by the river

1783
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,424
Now it's like you call me stupid

1784
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:51,264
A white why is the defensiveness shifted over from Rogan to

1785
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:55,360
About you isn't it Alex really just about you

1786
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:58,176
Blisters

1787
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:02,528
Can you sit around and laugh at us medical doctors gave that to me

1788
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:07,392
Is incredible

1789
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:16,096
Cuz he wants to plan it for himself he wants you Dad

1790
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:29,152
Optimistic

1791
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:34,528

Stupid

1796
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:45,792
For Pizza Hut has a bad break that he is too optimistic

1797
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:48,096
That doesn't sound like something Alex

1798
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:50,400
Improvised or wrote

1799
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,824
B a

1800
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,920
So Alex is taking his Ivermectin on air

1801
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:03,712
We did it

1802
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,016
The Wynn I'm not saying

1803
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:11,904
That you should immediately or anything but he does play special report for the next exit

1804
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:16,768
Throw it up or something. But it's fun to imagine

1805
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,816
Highway comes back and he's got some other news

1806
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:21,120

01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:10,272
Willfully misrepresenting the position and pretending that day

1823
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:12,832
You know the uet ucdc thinks

1824
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:13,856
The booster shots are danger

1825
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:15,648
Nonsense

1826
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:19,744
I'm not sure what I was talking about with five European countries ending other covid

1827
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,072
Restrictions but I think I might have found the article that he's a mystery

1828
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:23,840
Reporting

1829
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:28,704
Just a couple days before this episode the European Council announced that they were five countries which were going

1830
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,752
To be excluded from their list of countries

1831
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:33,056
The redeem safe to accept Travelers

1832
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:35,104
From into the EU

1833
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:36,896
They're working on quote

1834
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:38,944
A gradual lifting of the temporary

1835
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,968
Directions on non-essential

1836
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:40,992
Will travel into the

1837
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:41,760
The EU

1838
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:45,088
But some countries are seeing transmission that makes them to risk

1839
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:46,112
Whiskey for that list

1840
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,672
Incidentally the list is Israel

1841
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:52,256
Lebanon Montenegro the Republic of North Macedonia

1842
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:53,280
In the United States

1843
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,048
It's there we go

1844
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:57,376
If this is the story that I was referring to that the reality is actually the

1845
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,912
Complete opposite of what you think

1846
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:01,984
This is a five countries giving up on covid restrictions

1847
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:06,592
Hbe you working to gradually return to normal and it part of that process

1848
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:09,664
Heavy restrictions on people from five countries or not doing

1849
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,200
Good enough job respecting

1850
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:11,968
Yeah those

1851
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:14,784
Restriction he should be saying that the EU is

1852
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,600
Putting new restrictions

1853
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:23,232
That said there are news stories of periodically the popup but countries planning to ease restrictions

1854
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:29,888
Princeton's Ireland recently announced that they plan to ease restrictions in October mostly due to the fact they reach 9

1855
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:31,424
Movie percent vaccination rate

1856
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,192
Among adults

1857
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,472
Wow

1858
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,008
What good country

1859
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,824
How many stores are actually really interesting to look at

1860
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:41,408
Prince Denmark is planning to ease most of their pandemic restore

1861
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,176
Merchants & B

1862
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,456
September because they feel the

1863
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,992
The pandemic is under control

1864
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:46,528
Thanks to high vaccinations

1865
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:50,368
Parlor using restrictions is no longer requiring busy

1866
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:54,464
Businesses to use coronavirus passports to make sure that customers have been vaccinated

1867
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,744
Four-headed negative test

1868
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,024
The past 72 hours

1869
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,584
This is relevant because part of Alex's

1870
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,632
This big argument about the pandemic is that it's an

1871
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:02,400
An attempt to bring

1872
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:06,752
These vaccine passports it'll become the mark of the beast or something and then they'll never go away

1873
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,800
Because as we all know you know this

1874
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:11,872
What's a government gain the power that power never goes away

1875
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:16,224
But here we have a concrete example in the form of Denmark where they use this strategy

1876
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,504
It appears to have work

1877
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:18,784
Between affective

1878
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:22,880
And now they're going to stop with the passports because the reason they were using them

1879
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:23,904
Has gone away

1880
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,976
The Counterpoint to a whole bunch of Alex's

1881
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:28,768
Real primary

1882
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:29,792
Yeah

1883
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:33,120
Also I suspect him bring up Sweden is just in grasping at straws

1884
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:37,472
It was all that he could come up with was this month Soul talking point that he's forgotten about the context

1885
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:40,032
Completely meaningless bulshit

1886
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,384
Exhausting

1887
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:46,432
You hear about New Zealand

1888
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:48,224
And you're just like God you guys are do

1889
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,552
Like they had one case show up again

1890
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:52,832
And they were like

1891
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:53,600
Lockdown

1892
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,904
Lock it down we're not

1893
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,952
I'm doing this for another year

1894
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:00,000
One is enough

1895
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,024
You know it's

1896
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,304
Easier in

1897
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,328
Smaller

1898
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:06,400
It is and it's easier when it's an island

1899
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,936
Weights for sale

1900
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,728
Definitely

1901
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,008
Definitely there is a

1902
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,056
Yo I can't help but think

1903
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:15,360
Of tweets that I've seen of like

1904
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,408
The government could have just paid everyone

1905
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,176
Stay-home

1906
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:21,760
Yep or whatever you know like

1907
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:26,112
We would have found a way to suck that up this is America

1908
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:28,160
You couldn't pay people enough

1909
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,952
To save their own lives

1910
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:35,584
Misrepresenting these stories out of the EU whatever

1911
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:41,984
A story not the not the FDA story that the CDC documents

1912
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,544
But it's the FDA story that is the people quitting

1913
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,336
Okay the doctors quit

1914
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:49,152
Rebellion

1915
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:51,456
Lighthouse rushed booster plan

1916
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,224
It's not

1917
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:54,272
About the booster that was one issue

1918
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,576
FDA doing whatever it wants

1919
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:00,416
The scientist

1920
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:02,208
Salazar browsing program

1921
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:03,744
Sainsbury

1922
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,048
Authorization of the Franken shots

1923
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,584
Genetic therapy

1924
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:11,680
When it was never authorized and I just reduced into the emergency authorization

1925
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:13,984
Level of fraud is

1926
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:28,832
The level of this attack and the transparency of it is just mind-blowing to me

1927
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:32,928
Really hard to tell what Alex's even talkin about here and nickel

1928
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,512
Because of that whether he's lying or just trying to mislead people

1929
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:37,280
There's a distinct

1930
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:44,192
Where do I hear this is him saying that there's a fraud going on that the covid-19 got full FDA approval when it real

1931
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:45,728
Galatea just got an extension

1932
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:47,520
Hobbit emergency youth authorization

1933
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:52,384
This is the fraud that doctor's Gruber and Krause were so upset by that they quit

1934
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:53,408
BFDIA

1935
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:54,432
That's how I heard that

1936
01:29:56,736 --> 01:30:00,832
The only drug that people acclaimed has received FDA approval is the Pfizer shot

1937
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:01,856
And this is true

1938
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:02,624
It did

1939
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,440
It got full at the approval not just in

1940
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,720
An extension of its emergency

1941
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:08,000
To use authorization

1942
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:14,400
The confusion that Alex seems to be representing is that the FDA has not given the same fool approval

1943
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,680
Farthest shot

1944
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,520
It's going it's going to be marketed as

1945
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:20,800
Call her daddy

1946
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:26,176
I hate that name I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right if there are so many creative bernadee

1947
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:29,504
Maybe it's so many creative

1948
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,784
Writing majors

1949
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,064
With no work

1950
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:35,392
All you got to do is hire them to name ship for you

1951
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:37,440
That name is a speedball

1952
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:45,632
The FDA hasn't approved that to be used in people aged 12 to 15

1953
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:48,448
Normally fully approved a third dose being used as a booster

1954
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:54,848
These two uses as a booster in for people under 16 continue to be allowed under an emergency use authorization

1955
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:57,664
But the vaccine itself is fully FDA-approved

1956
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:01,248
If Alex is trying to tell us audience that the vaccine itself hasn't been approved

1957
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,016
He's lying

1958
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:04,064
If he's trying to tell them that these specific

1959
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,392
Two uses for the vaccine are still under review and only allowed by emerge

1960
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:08,416
To use authorization

1961
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:10,976
But he's not delivering that information very

1962
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:11,744
Clearly

1963
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:15,328
And feels like he's trying to mislead people definitely

1964
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:19,936
Whatever the reality of the situation isn't conveyed by his coverage of it

1965
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:20,960
Which is his job

1966
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:23,008
And so he is felt

1967
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:26,592
And that I was going to go with talking to people who've been to heaven

1968
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:27,360
Is this job but

1969
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:28,896
Man I miss that

1970
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:31,200
Osgood South oh my God

1971
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,992
I wanted to talk somebody's been to Hell

1972
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:36,832
Only ever talked to anyone who's been to Hell

1973
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:38,368
Oh my God

1974
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:44,768
God probably cuz religious people don't want to hear about it now I'm going to be poring over those 2003 episode looking for

1975
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:49,376
Girl Craig Roberts is Becky also went to hell

1976
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:52,704
Yeah you didn't do a good enough job with his second life

1977
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:56,288
Glad to give him a taste of what it was going to be f***** around with this third

1978
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:59,616
So now it's back to talk about the CDC document

1979
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:01,152
That might be an FDA.

1980
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:02,176
Sure

1981
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:03,200
Oops

1982
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:05,248
Accidentally reveals list

1983
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,528
I'm coming back scene

1984
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:08,064
Side effects including

1985
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,600
Micro card

1986
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:12,928
Autoimmune disease and death are we going to go to break

1987
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:15,744
Whitley

1988
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,840
Actual CDC document

1989
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:25,472
Does NFPA documents taken cause problems

1990
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:29,824
Well it said it might not that they would so we say it's false

1991
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,592
What

1992
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:34,176
We believe this will cause heart attacks blood clots in other phone

1993
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,968
Happened

1994
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:46,208
Heroin you might have an overdose and die

1995
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:52,352
We can send you mine. I thought Alex was and I

1996
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,376
Expert on

1997
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,400
Causal relation

1998
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:55,936
Cause and effect

1999
01:32:57,472 --> 01:33:01,312
It turns out he's not know it doesn't seem like

2000
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:07,968
So now that he's being more specific I can say with certainty that the bombshell CDC documents he thinks he's going to spend the night

2001
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:08,736
Recovering

2002
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:12,320
Or just the FDA PowerPoint presentation I mentioned earlier

2003
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:15,648
This is very sad

2004
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:17,696
We're defensiveness bad fact-checking is

2005
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:18,976
A little depressing

2006
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,256
Like I don't

2007
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:22,048
Think that Alex

2008
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,376
Can possibly actually believe the things that he believes

2009
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:26,400
He saying

2010
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:31,776
The Books of John fact-checks on this on the claims of this presentation is actually evidence of foreknowledge

2011
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:32,544
Side effects

2012
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,128
Discuss the larger picture of what the PowerPoint presentation

2013
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:36,896
Was about

2014
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,968
One of them includes a nfda spokesman

2015
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:41,248
Speaking to fact-check

2016
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:42,016
Quotes

2017
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:44,064
No specific covid-19 vaccine was the

2018
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:47,648
Disgusted that meeting but rather that meeting was held to discuss in general

2019
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:52,000
The criteria FDA may take into account when making a decision about emergence

2020
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:53,024
Authorization

2021
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,560
Tori covid-19

2022
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:58,656
The list of Adverse Events on slide 16 is just a list

2023
01:33:58,912 --> 01:33:59,936
Two possible outcomes

2024
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:00,960
But the FDA could

2025
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:02,496
Centrally monitor for

2026
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:03,264
When conducting

2027
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,288
Safety surveillance

2028
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:06,080
Once a vaccine was authorized

2029
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,640
There's a big difference between the list as it

2030
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:10,432
Existing this presentation and

2031
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:13,248
A list of potential side effects

2032
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:14,272
It's based on studies

2033
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:15,296
Or science

2034
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:17,344
Kind of hard for me to leave it outside

2035
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,112
Understand

2036
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,136
Distinction

2037
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,160
It's just

2038
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:20,928
It's really tough

2039
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:23,232
If he doesn't understand that he has no business

2040
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:26,048
Conveying information to the public

2041
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:27,072
He does understand that

2042
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:30,400
Extinction time he's willfully misrepresenting its people and is a liar

2043
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:32,192
Yasso

2044
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,728
Possibility of a third option

2045
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:34,496
No

2046
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:35,264
Nope

2047
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,544
And it's weird

2048
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,592
The FDA and CDC of the same thing

2049
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:40,896
A red Shop please

2050
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:42,944
This is from the cdc's website

2051
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:47,808
At fda.gov

2052
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,344
Website

2053
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:52,160
In October I'm going to show you this

2054
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:53,952
When we come back

2055
01:34:54,208 --> 01:35:00,352
That was a magician magician level sleight-of-hand there is this year

2056
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:05,984
Car my God I feel like I'm playing card Monte with somebody who doesn't know what either card is

2057
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,032
Is this your government agency

2058
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:10,336
Very

2059
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:11,104
Wild

2060
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:11,872
Fairies

2061
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,176
Bad not good not good work

2062
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:16,480
Anyway Alex gets to talking

2063
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:18,784
Because he needs money anyway he wants

2064
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:19,808
Do you want to know that you was going

2065
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:20,576
Scale back

2066
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:23,136
We remember these days

2067
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:26,464
But now he's going to launch somebody podcast

2068
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,488
He's going to

2069
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:29,792
Go a million hours a day

2070
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,072
And I think maybe

2071
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,400
It's because you super committed to the info war or

2072
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:37,472
He started selling human beds for Michael indelicato

2073
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:40,544
We are still on here and we have

2074
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,592
Major plan to expand

2075
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,896
In the face of this tyranny

2076
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:46,944
Because I was quite frankly going to cut

2077
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:48,480
2 years ago

2078
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:50,272
My work

2079
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:54,624
I was going to colleges

2080
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,672
Remove myself in write a book a year

2081
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,768
I've committed to

2082
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,072
14 hours a day 7 days a week

2083
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:06,144
And I'm going to start 7-Day week podcast Special Report

2084
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:08,192
Different news bureaus all over the country

2085
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:13,568
And so that takes a lot of money to do that and we'll be watching a lot of things the next few months but

2086
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,384
Hemiola next we get stronger

2087
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:19,968
And so I need your prayers and your support I need you to go to infowars.com

2088
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:23,040
How many how much money did Mike Lindell give him

2089
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:27,392
I mean he said that all he has is an affiliate relationship with Michael

2090
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:28,928
Glendale my Glendale does not

2091
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:35,328
Give Hillary said one of our biggest sponsors is Mike Lindell on this episode

2092
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:40,960
He does have a monetary relationship with confusing one

2093
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:45,056
I don't know but I would strongly man

2094
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:52,224
Again Alex to the f****** Washington Bureau with Jerome corsi

2095
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:58,624
Go good no I thought it ended well I think I don't know if that lawsuits still active but corsi and Larry Clem

2096
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,416
Assuage

2097
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:06,816
And you overpaid that dude real bad by repay that guy

2098
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:08,352
And it's easy to have

2099
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:11,424
Bureaus in other cities because

2100
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:14,240
All you need is an idiot with the laptop

2101
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,264
And just a Blog

2102
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:16,544
Or whatever

2103
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:18,848
Can you can get any one of those

2104
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:23,712
Yeah yeah I still even that is overextending yourself at this point

2105
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:26,016
As a friend Alex

2106
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:30,624
Anyway congratulation

2107
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,904
On the pillow

2108
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:33,952
Now it's Sia

2109
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:38,560
God no

2110
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:42,912
Oh look US Food and Drug Administration

2111
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,264
Hour 20

2112
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:48,288
Watch minute

2113
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:51,360
Video that is on YouTube

2114
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:53,920
You can

2115
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:03,648
Beer plans for monitoring covid-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness

2116
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:05,696
Idiotic

2117
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:08,000
Scientist lab

2118
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:10,048
And said basically this isn't safe

2119
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,096
Stop the shop

2120
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:14,656
Wild

2121
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:18,496
But there it is

2122
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:20,032
Hour 50 minutes

2123
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:22,336
Video sorry I'm

2124
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,432
So

2125
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,624
This is how Alex's workflow generally goes

2126
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:41,280
You make some erroneous claim and then when he needs to muster up the evidence 40 points doing almost 9 hour long video and then he gestured

2127
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:42,560
Pictures at it

2128
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:48,448
It's all the proof you need it's all in there seems like if you've got that and you've got a staff

2129
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,216
They can find

2130
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:50,496
The clip for YouTube channel

2131
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:52,288
Yeah yeah it's not the proof

2132
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:54,592
But he needs this game is boring and old

2133
01:38:54,848 --> 01:39:00,992
I wasn't watch this very long very dry meeting of the center for biologics evaluation and research

2134
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:05,344
Any couldn't point to any specific point later play any clips from it they would make his argument

2135
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:11,232
Only knows that he's is that he seen memes of this PowerPoint presentation slide that includes a list of side effects

2136
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:16,608
Am I posting this super long video will look more impressive people than just saying hey look at this meme I found

2137
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:22,240
Now that Alex has his evidence in place this long-ass video that no one in the audience is going to watch

2138
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:25,568
He can use it to give credibility to other b******* narratives that

2139
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:28,384
He's pushing like that the EU is stopping vaccinations or

2140
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:30,176
The FDA scientists

2141
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,456
Cuz they were against the vaccine

2142
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:35,296
Also this clip includes one of my favorite ways that Alex

2143
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:37,856
Cannot allow himself to be wrong about any

2144
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:42,464
He gets the runtime of this video wrong which doesn't matter at all

2145
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,256
But he can't let that stand

2146
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:46,560
Who use it as an example of a time when

2147
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:48,352
Something was worse than he said

2148
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:51,936
People accused of exaggerating balls of time things are worse

2149
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:53,216
Liquor time when he was

2150
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:56,032
Half an hour off on the runtime of a video

2151
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:57,056
Supercritical

2152
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,080
Detailed of evil think

2153
01:39:58,336 --> 01:40:03,456
Attack him for exaggerating about I was actually about to scream at him

2154
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:04,736
Forgetting that number wrong

2155
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:05,760
Because

2156
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:07,552
If you're up till 2 a.m.

2157
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:08,320
Just

2158
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:09,088
Just

2159
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:09,856
Dork

2160
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:11,648
IPad

2161
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:18,816
But I think one of the themes of this episode if there is one

2162
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:19,840
Based on my

2163
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:20,864
Viewing of it

2164
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:22,400
Is it Alex's pretty.

2165
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:24,704
About people calling Ivermectin horse

2166
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:27,264
Seems like that

2167
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,360
Nobel Prize is an antiviral for humans

2168
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:38,272
We shouldn't

2169
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:40,064
Horses drink water

2170
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:44,928
Are you getting

2171
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:49,792
Weird

2172
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:53,120
By the way if you talk to any farmer or

2173
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:54,400
Rancho Scott horses

2174
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:03,872
To the vet's office today

2175
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:04,896
6:30 in the morning

2176
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,272
Boxer

2177
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:18,976
We must be doing a lot of cows or horses

2178
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:25,120
Is there healthier on there better

2179
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:27,424
Antiviral

2180
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:31,520
The story is not true

2181
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:34,592
Such enemies of humanity

2182
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:39,968
Trying to suppress their real jerks a real real jerks

2183
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:41,504

2184
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:44,832
Like a real jerk

2185
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:45,600

2189
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:54,048
Wow what a knot

2190
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:55,072
True story

2191
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:56,608
Just real made up

2192
01:41:56,864 --> 01:42:02,240
App that's a convenient piece of Alex's backstory that he was he worked as like a blanket up

2193
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,520
Smalls accent

2194
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:07,360
When he was younger

2195
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:09,920
Expertise in all these

2196
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:16,576
Animal medicines that he wants his listeners to take

2197
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:22,720
Put that horse paste in DIY even put it in horses myself so that means it must be good for you

2198
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:24,512
Straight

2199
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:28,608
What's so good man I can't believe it but Alex is

2200
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:29,888
Is being a real jerk

2201
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:31,168
Real jewelry

2202
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:36,288
You know that we talked about this many many many many many many times

2203
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:38,080
Alex up my China

2204
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:40,896
Some coverage of China that I think

2205
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:43,200
Scuse kind of positive for our

2206
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:46,528
And then as I said there are large

2207
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,320
Quadrants

2208
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:52,416
Critical race Theory

2209
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:56,768
Male girly Behavior band China cracks down on sissy man

2210
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:00,864
CIA propaganda destroy the family and their country

2211
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:01,888
Which it is

2212
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:04,448
Zambia City man

2213
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:05,728
That's up to you but

2214
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,776
They're doing it to undermine

2215
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:08,544
The culture

2216
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:11,872
I really think that a free-speech crusader like Alex

2217
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:12,896
To be super again

2218
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:19,296
What's the government of China Banning effeminate men for being allowed on television legislate feminist sounding

2219
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:20,064
Superman

2220
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:26,720
According to NPR the rules the government put in place also would quote limit anyone under 18 23 hours per week

2221
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:29,536
Online games play on school days

2222
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:33,120
They're also regulating who's allowed to be promoted as a celebrity

2223
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:33,888
Quotes

2224
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:39,008
Pastor should avoid performers who violate public order or have lost morality

2225
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:45,664
Hey come on now is super transphobic and aggressively anti-lgbtq as a whole butt

2226
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:48,480
The larger world you should really require him be

2227
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,504
Super against

2228
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:53,088
I mean if you think that a government never gives up power

2229
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:56,672
This shouldn't be the one instance where everything

2230
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:57,952
China's got it right

2231
01:43:58,208 --> 01:44:02,048
Did you be a drastic and super aggressive attack on freedom of expression and speech

2232
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,072
In China

2233
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:05,376
His beliefs mean nothing one violates

2234
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:07,424
That is convenient to advancing good thing

2235
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,752
So Alex has been teasing

2236
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:12,288
For quite a while that he's going to go to

2237
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:14,080
Call Fanny.

2238
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:17,152
Not you get to call from a guy who's a retired

2239
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:20,224
Pharmacy type guy

2240
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:22,016
But you know this hold

2241
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:24,576
Coveting made him after get back in the game

2242
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:28,160
Now got to go out for one last

2243
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:33,024
I will say that one thing that made me a little bit worried about him

2244
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,304
Is he talks about his wife

2245
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:36,608
Apparently

2246
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:38,144
How is an IUD

2247
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:39,936
He refers to as

2248
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:40,960
An IED

2249
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:44,032
Would you be quite different

2250
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:46,848
She also had the

2251
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:48,384
A regular

2252
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:51,200
Michael is well

2253
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:54,272
And she's being an IED for I forget how long

2254
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:56,320
Beaver Avenue.

2255
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:58,880
Syndrome

2256
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:00,160
Anything

2257
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:08,864

2260
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:20,384
Improvised explosive device

2262
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:23,968
Yeah

2263
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:25,248

2264
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:27,040
Can they are they okay with it

2265
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:29,856
Can can far-right people be okay with iuds

2266
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:32,160
Let's just not do

2267
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:33,696
Good point

2268
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:36,768
That's it that's the way they treated like

2269
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:45,216
Cut off

2270
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,240

2271
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,264
Tusken Raider call

So in the past

2273
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,616
They would do.

2274
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:56,992
Now wearing a modern Steve's words

2275
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:58,272

2278
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:04,416
Chameleon

2279
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:06,464

I've been through a lot on this episode

2290
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:45,632
Some interesting things to learn about Alex

2291
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:49,472
Very very defensively and angrily taking Ivermectin on air

2292
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:55,616
Talking about how he's had covid multiple-time jealously trying to grab onto whatever

2293
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:56,384
Joe Rogan

2294

Smile Vista

Phone

2298
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:04,832
Problem

2299
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:07,392
When when Alex said this

2300
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:10,208
There was a little bit left in the third hour and I just said

2301
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:12,512
I give up I'm going home for the day

2302
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:19,168

We're rebuilding the system and change the passcode to change the passcode around here anymore routine basis

2304
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:27,104
The bathtub

2305
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:29,664
Composed

2306
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:32,736
That's all a matter delivery

2307
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:36,832
Oh my God I'm punching out man I just said nothing

2308
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:39,648
Nothing nothing else can happen on this episode that

2309
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:41,952
Will is an anyway

2310
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:42,976
Somebody hacked

2311
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,584
My system just to occasionally cut off phone

2312
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:49,888
And

2313
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,424
Somehow

2314
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:54,752
People

2315
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:56,800
Not changing the password

2316
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:57,568
Right

2317
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:58,592
Something to

2318
01:47:58,848 --> 01:47:59,360
To do

2319
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:00,128
With Tim

2320
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:01,408
Correct

2321
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:02,944
Yes

2322
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:05,760
And his sexual orientation which must

2323
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:09,088
Dimensions very relevant

2324
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:14,720
Nope so I bid you adieu September 2nd episode

2325
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:16,256
Pretty amazing

2326
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:18,304
I think of the Revelation that Alex

2327
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,584
That's God Cohen

2328
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:20,608
The bunch

2329
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:25,472
So did did pieczenik Iran the first time

2330
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:28,032
I don't know man

2331
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:29,056
With antibiotic

2332
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:34,688
Text sure are we using antibiotics

2333
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:39,296
Get the Steve pieczenik license but don't don't you enjoy though to that Alex pulled the

2334
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:40,832
China kind of with that like

2335
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:43,904
Yeah 12 closer to me than my parents yet

2336
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:46,464
Ulta Beauty

2337
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:48,512
I could not help but

2338
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:53,888
Hear that same exact thing I was trying to do that same kind of reveal such as

2339
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:55,680
I think it's

2340
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:58,496
I think one of the things I find really interesting about this is like

2341
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:01,568
It's kind of a big reveal in as much as like

2342
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:03,360
XM Sirius

2343
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,128
That he had

2344
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:06,432
Covid-19 conceivably multiple times

2345
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:07,968
But it's also like

2346
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:09,760
I'm not surprised

2347
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,832
It's not a bombshell I assumed

2348
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:17,696
The way he's alright

2349
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:20,000
Always lift his legs means yes

2350
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:23,328
He probably got covid and I would have assumed 80 did

2351
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:24,608
He didn't need to tell me

2352
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:26,912
Thanks

2353
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:29,216
