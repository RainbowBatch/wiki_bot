Words are

10
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,472
What's going on

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,264
Good

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,288
Quick question

13
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:21,152
Last thing you volunteered

14
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:27,808
I volunteered to do the show on Friday

15
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,976
I do not respect this very rude of you to a reception but not actually

16
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,280
Accurate anyway I was thrilled

17
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,048
Enjoyed it

18
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,608
I don't know the last time I fall in

19
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,288
Yeah I need to do more of that I'm very busy

20
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
Spirit like

00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:49,824
Food pantry

22
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,152
Younger but you know

23
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:00,320
Yeah it's tough

24
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,624
Or

25
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
To unionize the movies

26
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,304
Theatre that I worked at and it's when I was like 17 and they're like you will be fired immediately

27
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,608
I don't understand the ramifications

28
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,888
So okay

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,192
I will not do that

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
Trucking

31
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:23,360
Those are not Crossing picket lines

32
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,640
No I wouldn't cross

33
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
No I would

34
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,688
Strike with

35
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,224
People if I were in it

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,248
Situation to

37
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,344
The end of jobs at

38
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,392
You know

39
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:41,792
With had strike capability situation we found ourselves in

40
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,816
And I would join a

41
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
Zacian effort

42
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376
If I were

43
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,656
Situation not a 70

44
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,424
Cedros working

45
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,800
A minimum wage

46
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
You ready Hero 2

47
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,736
I don't know what it would have done because there was I don't think they're actually was

48
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:06,112
Concessionist

49
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,672
Yeah but the union is I understood it back then

50
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,232
And was mostly for the people who run like

51
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
Large

52
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,304
Projector like the ones that are at

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,072
I'd like IMAX

54
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
L

55
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,912
There are some projectors that are still like

56
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Fairlead

57
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:24,288
Those are the ones that like glorious

58
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
That kind of

59
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:31,712
We were working with brother there was still actual film

60
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
Specialized work

61
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,040
You still pretty dip

62
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
Ghost-type

63
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,344
It wasn't nearly the level of

64
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,696
I don't know I was I was

65
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
Vinegar and thought I was

66
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,304
It probably would have been

67
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,656
I guess I don't know enough about volunteering probably should do more about that I'm going to write that down

68
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,056
I do have a little bit of time I probably should if I'm going to put it anywhere I probably should

69
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,104
Explore those are

70
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,576
I only know what you that's for sure

71
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:13,952

Continue with our exploration of Alex's coverage after say

74
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
Hook

75
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:24,959
On our last episode we went over the day off

76
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,775
Today we are just going over April 7th

77
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,847
That means

78
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,127
There is a lot

79
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,943
In fact it's pressing

80
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,807
My wife

81
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,367
I don't think very far off

82
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,415
Today's episode

83
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
Completely insane

Course

88
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:54,143
Things that have nothing to do with a lot of things that I thought I was looking for

89
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031

00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,999
Journal policy walk

105

00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,887
Is that a one word

107
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
It's

108
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
Yeah

109
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:04,799
I don't know maybe it's a means of someone throwing a nose

110
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,895
I have no idea

111
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,687
Didn't want to be old

112
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
Yeah

113
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:17,855
A couple people signed up on little bit of an elevated level

114
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,183
So first of all

115
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,023
That's one

116
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,655
And monkey Nexus Overdrive

117
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
You are now a technocrat

118
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,479
Heroin

119
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,319
Is freakishly large

120
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,695
Unbutton and Oggy

121
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,279
And the monkey Nexus Overdrive

122
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,327
Surprised we haven't got

123
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,375
Supercross

124
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
Considering everybody knows what

125
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
Newsradio

126
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
That is true

127
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
51 day

128
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
Sweet Day

129
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:13,663
Coming up on 25 years old

130
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
Paquin Joe Rogan wizard

131
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
Back what it was on the a.m.

132
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,879
Back when Andy Dick was employable.

133
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:28,767
Blackboard

134
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,351
Phil Hartman was alive

135
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,983
April 17th

136
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,079
Crazy crazy day

137
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,919
Stuff going on

138
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
Dramatic

139
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,991
Breakdown of the world

140
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:54,111
To set the stage for I do I want to point something out episode

141
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
Alex Jones

142
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Has a catch

143
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,255
He is saying that everything is unprecedented

144
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:05,375
Over and over and over again

145
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,935
Seems like almost an intention

146
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,983
And here's a Supercut of him saying

147
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
This is impressive

148
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
Unprecedented

149
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
Precedent

150
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:24,319
Unprecedented

151
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,623
Precedent

152
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,671
I'm not certain I got all of them

153
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
At least

154
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:36,351
I'm pretty I'm pretty sure I missed

155
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
Some of them

156
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
Quite frankly

157
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,287
He's a real f*****-up headspace unprecedented

158
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
What's going on

159
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
We think that everything is

160
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,735
I mean what he's doing is lying a strong precedent for that so

161
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,831
I don't support real into this

162
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,623
I want to just like

163
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:04,767
Llamas in studio last week

164
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
Tricked by that

165
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:11,167
Like all the people who were posting like screenshots of Alex with llamas even if you're making fun of him

166
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,471
If you listen to the video of that

167
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:17,055
He's talking about how this is going to amplify his rating

168
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,639
In the middle of having llamas in studio he's talking about like

169
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,735
I want one

170
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,063
It's just you're all amplifying exactly like

171
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,623
Yeah individuals who might have enjoyed the tweet

172
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
People putting out or anything like that

173
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,511
I don't know how much it is

174
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
To mock him

175
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
For it if you're hyper

176
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:43,167
Profile account

177
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,959
You wanted

178
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
You gave him free publicity

179
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
See how likes

180
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,567
Though some of these

181
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,895
Making it go viral putting it out there

182
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,455
Even the memes of him with a llama like

183
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,015
You could f*** around and accidentally give him like

184
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,063
Tens of thousands of dollars

185
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
A free traffic

186
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,135
Website could translate

187
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Into

188
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
Sales like it

189
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,511
Whatever he was doing is pathetic and sad

190
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
The desperate attempt

191
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
To get attention but it worked

192
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,375
We're not going to be covering

193
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,167
Event to say

194
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Congratulations Alex

195
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,031
Poke

196
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,367
He's not a level regular

197
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:38,719
His desk in like in between him and the camera is a llama just

198
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,255
Chewy

199
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,559
Betty White

200
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Donovan

201
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:48,191
All right otherwise episode factor in manipulate headline

202
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,751
Comment the Guy episode in order

203
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,567
Defend this feeling that the meeting would blame Patriots

204
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
Quotes

205
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
For the Boston Bomber

206
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,199
We saw him start to craft this narrative in the literal minute

207
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
After he became aware of

208
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
The tragedy

209
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,087
Haven't discussed on that last episode by the time you get off air on the 6th

210
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,671
There was not a lot of information available about what it happen

211
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
Other than

212
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
The obvious

213
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,279
The FBI and police were following up on

214
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
Investigating

215
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,143
But if confirmed there was very little to go on

216
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,703
It has been announced that the bombs were pressure cookers

217
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,543
It has been announced that the reports of a Saudi national who is detained

218
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,847
We're possibly misleading

219
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,871
Was not involved in

220
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,431
Beyond that there wasn't much

221
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
As we begin on the 17th

222
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,551
There's still not a whole lot of credible information

223
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
It's being reported

224
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,415
By the end of the day was reported the FBI had an image of a

225
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:44,767
Potential suspect who was he carrying a backpack and dropping it off in the area of

226
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,535
Second Bob

227
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
That that happens by the end

228
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,143
But they did not release

229
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
That image

230
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:55,007
April 17th is a very important day in the Fallout of the bomb

231
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:59,103
We had reached an out two full days after the attack and

232
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,943
Still there was a lack of credible information about who did it why they did it

233
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
And any real indication

234
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,527
But the authorities were any closer to making the rest

235
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,087
Then they were 24 hours prior

236
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,391
In this environment of outrageous

237
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,439
Very critical things

238
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,487
The first was that

239
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,023
The Silence of information with

240
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
Overwhelmed by the growing volume

241
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
Baseless speculation

242
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
Bulshit

243
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,399
Coming out of alternative

244
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,727
Well it stopped short of credible Outlets

245
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,519
Repeating internet rumors

246
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,823
People were reaching a point where they needed answer

247
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,151
When the mainstream isn't providing them they started to look out

248
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,223
People got a lot of traffic

249
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Out of

250
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,295
Baseless conjecture

251
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Surrounding

252
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,855
It's a fun little

253
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,951
It doesn't matter who you are

254
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Hardwired

255
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
I need to make

256
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
Something is amiss

257
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:59,775
And no matter how many times you tell yourself like investigators

258
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,591
Detectives were working on this no more

259
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
Can't put that information

260
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:08,479
Out because it might ruin the possibility of them being able to carry through the investigation

261
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
You can't

262
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,391
Tell your brain doesn't allow you to accept

263
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,927
They went people are

264
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231
Willing to give you the wrong answer

265
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,767
You'll gravitate towards that

266
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,351
Now that's one element that's happening it.

267
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
These

268
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
The noise

269
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
Of their alternative

270
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
Folk on places

271
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,239
Reddit 4chan

272
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,287
Putting out these Radiohead

273
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
Shirk's

274
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,895
Putting out this bogus nonsense it starts to amplify

275
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
Considerably

276
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
On the 7th

277
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,295
I'm saying is that well the alternate alternative media

278
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
Please downtown blog

279
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,879
They Were Striking while the iron was hot

280
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
Drawing in math

281
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,951
Massive amounts of attention for people who just beat

282
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,231
Something anything

283
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
Anything at all

284
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Same time

285
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
The main

286
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Medium

287
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
Critical error

288
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,143
And their drive to be the first to report

289
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,471
We'll go over some of that as we go along but both group

290
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,055
The alternative media and the mainstream media were driven by the same

291
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,919
To be the first Outlet to report important information about a major story

292
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
And the results were

293
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
Disastrous

294
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,039
By the time Alex gets off are on the 17

295
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
We're no closer.

296
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
Really NE

297
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
Gabriel

298
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,975
The FBI is announced by that point they have a photo of the suspect

299
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,255
They still haven't released it

300
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:28,607
However while the real world public is no closer to knowing what happened

301
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,143
At the marathon by this point

302
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,191
The same cannot be said for Alex

303
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,983
In this episode will see

304
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,055
Is certainty that the bombing was a false flag

305
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
What you determined

306
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
In second

307
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
And over the course of his broadcast

308
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,687
He'll transform it into so much more

309
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,247
He'll find the people he decides to the culprits

310
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,783
He'll point out privates

311
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,319
She's decided of the Patsy

312
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
The globalist

313
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,367
Going to pin the bombing on

314
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,951
He'll discover the motive for the bombing

315
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,767
He's likely party to the commission of a federal offense on a

316
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,815
Everyday in the stretch

317
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,375
The 2013 that we're on right now is not

318
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,447
I thought that the bombing would be the worst of it and I was

319
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
Shocked at how much are the mods

320
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
Pastor Alex Wells

321
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
15th and C

322
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,335
But I'm comfortable saying that he outdoes

323
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Himself

324
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
Considerable margin

325
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
He's legitimately the worst

326
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,271
I can think of very few things you could be doing at this point that would be worse

327
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
Then what he's conscious

328
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,087
Wesley and willingly doing

329
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
Writing the Boston bombing

330
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,767
It's unprecedented levels of monstrosity.

331
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
Resident

332
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,375
At the beginning of the episode Alex

333
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,775
Because they think they're talking

334
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Idiot

335
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,847
Alex Jones

336
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
Know everything

337
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,223
Audience of emotional

338
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,647

340
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:16,127
I'm here and I'm working around the clock

341
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,407
Coasttocoastam

342
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,271
I slept for two hours I didn't our place this morning

343
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:27,135
So now we can add coasttocoastam

344
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,671
Alex Jones

10th time

347
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,071
I would feel that everybody

348
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
To get ratings

349
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,655
By throwing Alex

350
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
On your Shelby

351
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,727
You're you're being very

352
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,031
I thought that

353
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,591
Reproach dad

354
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:52,991
Hey let's get Lewis

00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
How to make slime

356
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,487
Yeah yeah

357
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:09,887
Detroit becoming the fourth our house.

358
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:13,215
Was one of the 4th hour

359
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,567
Set up his own studio and all that

360
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,847
He also

361

4th H Alex

362
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
So that kind of makes

363
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
Everything

364
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
But

365
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,527
It should be pointed up at that point worth

366
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,807
Popular radio show

374
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,311
They should probably

375
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,591
Like really feel the same

376
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,895
George Noory

377
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:59,551
Even if we're not going over the episodes with that they're on

378
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,343
Alex is on those shows

379
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,903
Just know that you're helping this get out

380
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,767
Alex believes that all the media all they're doing is

381
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
Demonizing

382
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583

00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,703
His number one talk

385
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Compliant

386
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
And of course

387
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,615
Everything about the rollout

388
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:34,367
Flip

389
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,447
Michael Moore Christmas special on

390
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,007
The Boston Marathon bomber

391
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,311
White person officials

392
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,639
Boston bombing terrorist

393
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:14,047
So I guess Michael Moore speaks for the entirety of the the

394
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,399
Which is consistent in Alex's career

395
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,799
Take a comment by Michael Moore and that's what everybody everybody

396
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,127
You know what take a comment by Bill Maher and then you've got the

397
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,431
Flavor of the nation dinner

398
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,015
Officials

399
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,807
The same thing we went over on the last step

400
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,343
So you don't need to go into that

401
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,135
But this article is new

402
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:43,487
Boston Marathon bomber is a white American

403
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,535
That is a real headline

404
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
However

405
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,351
Alex is not gay

406
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
To that article

407
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
At all

408
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,751
That piece was written by David Sirota and his overarching point

409
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:59,615
Is it the identity of the perpetrator of the bombing of the American government respond

410
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,175
And the best-case scenario for World Peace

411
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,455
Is that it turns out

412
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
Away Tamara

413
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,319
Right

414
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,623
From the article

415
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
The terrorist attack

416
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,183
Search white male privilege

417
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,231
White non Islamic terrorist

418
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,791
Are typically portrayed as representative

419
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,607
Not a whole groups and ideology

420
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,447
But Islam will threats to be dealt with as isolated law

421
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,287
Meanwhile non-white or developing World terrorism

422
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,615
Reflexively portrayed as representative

423
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,919
Spiritzys ideologies and religion

424
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,711
It must be dealt with a systemic

Text Brett

426
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:40,063
The kind of potentially requiring everything from law enforcement action

427
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,343
Into military operations

428
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,367

Relation to foreign policy

430
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:48,767
Sirota goes on to argue that regardless of your political party affiliation

431
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,303
If you care about everything

432
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,327
From Star Wars

433
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,863

Immigration reform

00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,239
You should hope the bomber was a white domestic Terror

437
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
Why

438
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,335
Because only in that case we'll privilege worked

439
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
Prevent the Boston

On those other

443
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,735
That's a pretty

444
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,527
Find

445
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,879
Liberals everkin

446
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
Considered

447
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,928
Taking over

448
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
DHHS

449
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
And ice

450
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,024
From the inside

451
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
We're always against

452
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:27,424
Why don't we take over DHHS and then

453
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
Terrorist

454
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,984
I don't know

455
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,776
I mean I think they attempt

456
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,056
I don't know

457
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:33,824
Pickover

458
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,896
Internally attempts have been made

459
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
Put that Focus

460
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
On

461
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,968
The actual threat

462
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
What happened

463
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:46,112
Report came out like a right-wing

464
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,136
If your

465
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,160
Fury outrage

466
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
Listen

467
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
See now that's

468
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,768
Interesting

469
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:57,376
We start shooting cops

470
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,776
I don't know I don't know what the effect

471
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
Not listening

472
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,824
Going to that backlash

473
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,128
I know what

474
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,664
People like Alex

475
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,480
Chinese militia weirdos I know what their rhetoric

476
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
Indicate

477
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
It would be

478
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,064
But I don't know how much they worth

479
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,344
Yeah that would be

480
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,072
Tire possibility that it's all talk

481
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,120
Longwood

482
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,400
But also

483
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
The flip side

484
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,984
I don't think

485
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,264
People are making their

486
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
Policy decision

487
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
Solely on

488
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,872
Fear of the threat

489
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,968
Biosphere right wing-back

490
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
Why we got to

491
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
Obamacare

492
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,808
Listening to the right-wing

493
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,576
They turned out well

494
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
Sure

495
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,672
That article was published

496
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,440
Pointe on Rio

497
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,768
O'Reilly about it

498
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:00,352
Fox contributor they were all talking about it and I'll talking head shows

499
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,144
And it's nothing

500
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,424
Up in arms about

501
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:09,824
In response to Roda Roda follow-up title quote I still hope the Boston are the bomber is a white American

502
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,360
Where you pointed out that

503
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,432
Even when complaining about his Salon article O'Reilly

504
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,736
Same premise that the articles

505
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,576
Muslim terrorists and the reaction would be severe

506
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,136
American Terrorist

507
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
Then it will just

508
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,208
Quote be another stain on American

509
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,792
That's from O'Reilly.

510
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,328
This is really basic stuff

511
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,376
Zerodha wasn't saying it was awakened

512
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:37,984
He was just pointing out that the double standard that exists about how the public

513
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,752
And the government

514
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,776
Response to tragedies

515
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,592
And how if the bomber is quotes

516
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,408
The double-standard May prevent an overreaction

517
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
Boston

518
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,040
You can make a pretty decent argument that this article could come off

519
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,320
A little

520
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,600
Considering the timing

521
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,952
Babies

522
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,048
Still in the State of Shock and

523
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,096
I'd be willing to hear those criticize

524
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,144
I don't know how

525
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,936
They are but I think they're valid

526
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
Complained

527
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,520
However I don't think that I can find too much in the subs

528
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,800
So his point that I can say

529
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
Take issue with

530
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,872
Ultimately big picture and most importantly

531
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:20,224
This article in no way strengthens Alex's argument that the media is blaming right-wing

532
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,808
Go to music

533
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,880
Is absolutely out of line with what the article a

534
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,440
The article literally States we won't

535
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,720
What's blame right wing

536
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,024
History

537
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,352
History has shown that that's not the response

538
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:40,960
Initially I thought the official

539
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,544
I initially thought that was actually just the same

540
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
I think we talked about

541
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,848
Last episode because it's very

542
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,408
5-second actually look into

543
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
Is a headline

544
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
Written by Paul Joseph

545
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,368
So it's not

546
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
Really

547
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,208
Yeah yeah yeah

548
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:08,608
In the article Boston

549
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,400
Certainly

550
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:15,264
Just lorious was talking about a video they had of the suspect and said quote

551
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,312
The person who did this was someone's friend

552
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,592
The neighbor and co-worker

553
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:22,432
Which Paul says is ruling out the possibility that the attack

554
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,968
We carried out by foreigners who had

555
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:30,880
Great work dude my responsibilities as a they ruled out that the attack was carried out by a foreign group

556
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,464
It might rule out the idea that the terrorists just showed up and did the attack

557
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,048
Talk two days later solutely does not exclude people like

558
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
Could be

559
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,888
Here for awhile headed out

560
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:51,616
You know here for awhile

561
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:55,456
Any of this could be a possibility that is not excluded by the

562
00:25:55,968 --> 00:26:00,320
Reasoning is incredibly shity but that's Paul for the course

563
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:03,392
Don't ever look at me in the eyes

564
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,184
Hello

565
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:10,304
The rest of the evidence Paul has his quotes from noted media Darlings

566
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,608
What my favorite member of Congress

567
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:17,984
I actually don't like him much but he has the best name

568
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,288
And Dutch ruppersberger

569
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,104
Vacations

570
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,640
Domestic terrorism

571
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,688
Neither of them say it was a right-wing

572
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,224
Extremist

573
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,504
Suggest was a patriot group

574
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,784
Just that it would be a domestic

575
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
Group

576
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,576
Profile low

577
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,368
The weapons used

578
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,672
It could have been eco-terrorists

579
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:43,072
Indications

580
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,864
And that

581
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,704
Is being taken to me in Bible

582
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,800
Also this article includes

583
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,080
Cheats for Michael Moore

584
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
The king of

585
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,128
The media

586
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
Jay Mohr

587
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,712
Which is to say

588
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,504
Who cares

589
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,112
Perfectly fine

590
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
For his

591
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:13,792
18 years ago

592
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,096
The best Paul has other than that

593
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,912
The tweet from an unofficial Twitter account run by someone who works

594
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,496
U.s. Forest Service they're afraid it's a right-wing nut

595
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
This

596
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,824
Does not Merit an article

597
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,616
Intermediate we're really trying to pay

598
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:31,200
The picture that this was done by right-wingers in order to demonize the Patriots

599
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,272
Paul would have way stronger evidence than boars Twitter

600
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,600
This is a perfect example of Alex editorial

601
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,160
Decision but the narrative is that the media

602
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,232
Patriots and then go out and find

603
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,768
We can't defend the narrative

604
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,816
No other explanation makes sense

605
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,608
Why would it be this pain

606
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,400
Why would the evidence you have

607
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
Scattershot

608
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,520
Saxby chambliss

609
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,504
Investigate something but you already know the answer

610
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,040
Ignore everything

611
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,112
Except

612
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,208
Singers be like I'm going to set out to

613
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,744
Approve this with my man on the

614
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,304
I'm already

615
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,864
That's all they're doing that's all this article is

616
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,400
It's really insane

617
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,448
So

618
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,472
Alex has

619
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
You know

620
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,288
Really dumb

621
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
Right

622
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,360
I think we've established

623
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,920
Realize that

624
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,688
He was a jerk

625
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,272
No

626
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,040
He's not

627
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,600
Well you haven't heard this next

628
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:48,256
Also studied a lot of criminology and I do mean murder mystery books

629
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:55,680
Fascinating

630
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,472
Criminals Act

631
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,432
And they are pathological

632
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,552
Over and over and over and over again

633
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,112
I honestly think you might be talking about,

634
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:21,024
Like I have a little bit of a Batman seal from the

635
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,584
404

636
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,912
Alex

637
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:34,080
Do you know I love that he's sitting here saying like I read pH

638
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
Bi-level Tech

639
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:38,944
Textbooks has the most 101 you get from any like

640
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,968
Homicide

641
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:43,808
TV show any kind of like True Crime stuff

642
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,208
If they say their next president

643
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,280
Say there an expert in everything

644
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,816
F*** off you're a psychopath

645
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,144
Why do we even have the psychopath test just ask Brooks

646
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,680
How many things

647
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:05,568
Send it I'll just bring the box to the Box

648
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,616
Because

649
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,200
He believes that everything that's happening surrounding Boston bombing

650
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,480
Follows the exact

651
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,248
Same

652
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,016
Pattern

653
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:17,344
That has happened with all the other false Flags

654
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,368
So

655
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,904
He is now

656
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,928
Buc-ee's

657
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,952
These things that are happening

658
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,000
The world he's connecting them all to

659
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
Together

660
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:28,352
In the same way that after 9/11 there was those anthrax

661
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,376
Letters

662
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
Ragazza

663
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:35,776
Right after the Boston bombing there were ricin letters that got sent to Obama

664
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,568
Alex has decided that he

665
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,592
He predicted this

666
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,992
This time I should look at another bio attack if this is an inside job

667
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:51,392
Obama a senator have reportedly been met mail dries in now so either you

668
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,976
Hugo

669
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,256
It's perfect

670
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,024
Evidence

671
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,560
Alex cell

672
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:04,960
Alexandrite

673
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,496
I want to be totally clear

674
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,312
I don't recall Alex saying there will be a bio attack if it's

675
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,592
Is a false flag

676
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,456
In the episodes I've listened to I don't remember him saying that

677
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:20,320
He would say I have no evidence

678
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
Did predict

679
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,744
But I would believe he was free associating on the Nightly News.

680
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,584
It's a possibility but I do not have evidence

681
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
Either way

682
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,448
Matter cuz I was just full of s***

683
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,776
On April 16th 2013 letters laced

684
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,872
Ricin were sent to President Obama Mississippi Senator Rodger wicker

685
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,152
And a judge

686
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
Mississippi

687
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,736
Address in Tennessee

688
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,808
And because there was just a giant bombing in Boston

689
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,368
A lot of people made a hasty

690
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,904
Poisonous

691
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
But guess what they were not

692
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,488
And this is one of the crazy

693
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,024
Stories that I will ever tell you

694
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:07,680
You know you got a lot of axes to grind

695
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:10,752
You know the story behind

696
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:15,872
S*** out of me to do all this already

697
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,920
Not the only thing

698
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248
Because we have a

699
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,040
Missouri represent

700
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,856
Mississippi representative

701
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,648
Personal

702
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,184
Because I've never heard of that

703
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,208
Sippy

704
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,376
Police arrested Paul Curtis

705
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:45,056
And investigators immediately were sent down a completely insane rabbit hole

706
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:51,968
There's power

707
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,760
Recommend a lot of information

708
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,344
Comes from other sources other news articles about that

709
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,136
A lot of it also from this

710
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,720
I recommend

711
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,744
It cannot do justice

712
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,304
Do all the layers of completed

713
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,352
Now you got arrested

714
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,120
Two first name

715
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,168
You got the guy who's right

716
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
Two Street

717
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:17,056
We know who we can trust here Dan this makes perfect

718
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,848
Except

719
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,152
The police arrest code is for the crime

720
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:28,576
That he does not know anything about the crime

721
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:32,928
So they asked him if he has any enemies who might want to try and set him up

722
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:35,744
And he immediately respond that there is one guy

723
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,048
James Everett dutschke

724
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,840
Who fits that description

725
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:44,704
Courtesy of gender by profession and an Elvis impersonator by Passion

726
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:51,360
Him and his brother did a Duo act younger Elvis and the other was Vegas outfits

727
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:57,760
Perform together

728
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,744
The media really latched onto that when Curtis was arrested arrested

729
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,120
Overshadowed a lot of the story

730
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,656
The clown on the weekend they be like

731
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,448
REI

732
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:22,592
He landed a contract to clean the floors northern Mississippi Medical

733
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,640
I threw some weird coincidence

734
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,736
He ended up in the board one day and saw a body parts that really freaked him out

735
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,040
He wasn't authorized to be in the morgue

736
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:34,112
He was reprimanded for being there

737
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:37,184
Punishment for him seeing body parts he wasn't supposed to

738
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,744
Curtis Melda conspiracy

739
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,584
Stumbled into a black market organ harvesting operation

740
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,120
That's the first thing I would say

741
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
Absolute

742
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,216
So he started pursuing this conspiracy theory

743
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,776
And naturally this led to his life

744
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:56,640
He began to drink heavily his marriage fell apart

745
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:02,272
And all of this only only led to him pursuing his

746
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,320
Conspiracy interest further

747
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,392
He started disseminate messages about his theories online

748
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,928
Like my space at the time

749
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
Tagline

750
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,792
Quote I am KC and I approve this message

751
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,632
James Everett dutschke was a local insurance sales

752
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,704
Man who was also in a local band called Robo drum

753
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:27,104
Which describes itself as quote Progressive guitar funktronic everyone in this story is played by Robin

754
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,688
Good Williams everything is insect

755
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,272
More importantly here an alternative newspaper in

756
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:40,416
When Curtis heard about this newspaper he was sure that this was going to be able to

757
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:44,256
To get his message out about the or organ harvesting

758
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,072
Cost of Dusky at a party

759
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,608
Cuz dutschke work

760
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,144
With Curtis

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,936
Ex-wife in an insurance company

762
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:57,056
Glad company party he came along and confronted

763
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:03,200
Responded to his email and asked him

764
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
Big scoop

765
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
However

766
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,784
Dutschke was not interested

767
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,832
The middle of trying to run for public

768
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
WIC office

769
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,136
I need felt a story like this

770
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,160
What her is effort

771
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Get elected

772
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,952
Would you end up

773
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,768
The story could have solved

774
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,536
A lot of problem

775
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:23,936
Curtis decided in a fraud

776
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,472
Relationship it started off

777
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
Very sour

778
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,544
Dusky lost his bid for office

779
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,384
And completely insane online Feud

780
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,408
I were they both

781
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,200
Accused each other of stock

782
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:40,576
And other both probably right

783
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:44,672
Spy versus spy cartoon

784
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,256
This entire circle

785
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,864
I'd like to think it's really awesome as if you read this GQ article they talked to like Curtis

786
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,144
Text wifey

787
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,680
You guys have so much in common

788
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,984
You guys should be friends

789
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:04,640
Because the one person that everyone hates the mostest

790
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:07,456
Identical

791
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,736
People who want to be

792
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,296
Performers better also crazy

793
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,576
It's not

794
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,744
Since the 90 days

795
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,512
Bryndis

796
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,280
Exposure

797
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,072
He would stand

798
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:32,032
Is he would stand naked his window and use a laser pointer to attract the attention of passing toolkit

799
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,616
Big Sean

800
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,920
Big time

801
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:40,992
I would agree

802
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:44,064
In the process of him trying to appeal this conviction

803
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,368
Music touching three underage girls

804
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,136
The martial arts

805
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,160
Studio that he ran

806
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,696
Naturally

807
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,464
After this

808
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:54,560
Curtis started gloating about his rival being arrested online which

809
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,864
Really pissed off.

810
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,656
Long story short

811
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,984
Dutschke decided to frame Curtis by sending letters with ricin

812
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,312
Addendum to the Mississippi Senator Obama

813
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,104
Typically hits sentence

814
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
Kurdistan

815
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,408
Six months in jail prior

816
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,712
Alright alright

817
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,992
So so far

818
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,528
We've all been doing well

819
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,832
Plan

820
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,112
Comes a little bit out of left

821
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,720
I'm just I'm not saying I wouldn't have expected

822
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:26,304
Escalated

823
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,120
Baby Alive

824
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,080
Well some people who suspect

825
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:43,200
To prison for

826
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,480
These underage girls

827
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,016
He could get

828
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,808
I have your sentence in a different

829
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
Facility

830
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,344
If

831
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,648
He got caught trying to do this clunky

832
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:56,768
The frame-up job and it was actually effort to not be put in prison primarily as a pedophile

833
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:05,984
Text to Matt reminders

834
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,592
Witness lyrics you're giving the guy who is in an online

835
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,408
With an Elvis impersonator who thinks that

836
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,688
There's an underground

837
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,480
Black Market Oregon

838
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,624
You're giving that guy from prison

839
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,648
Like

840
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,280
Keyser Soze

841
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,048
Find much

842
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,840
Credence to that but then

843
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,376
Like all of it is explained by

844
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,400
These guys be an idiot

845
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,448
But the real one of the reasons of people

846
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,984
Suspect that he was trying to

847
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,800
Caught is the heat included Curtis's tagline

848
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,848
Quote I am KC and I approve

849
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:47,456
This message on the letters that he sent it was an incredibly funky frame-up job

850
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,576
If you

851
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,880
Exclude Curtis

852
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:59,232
Haven't done that he's the only person

853
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
Possible person

854
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,280
So it is

855
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,328
Clunky but also if you're just

856
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,352
Kind of dumb

857
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,144
He seems like he might be

858
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:11,008
It is the sort of thing at work

859
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,568
See look I signed it with his

860
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,360
Of course they're going to

861
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:21,248
2014 used 25 years in prison

862
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,040
Very clear

863
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:28,672
Nothing to do with the Boston butt if you don't look at information

864
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,280
The Paradox sensationalist b******* because

865
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,816
Feel like something is

866
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:39,936
You'll end up sitting

867
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,216
It's not related

868
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,752
It does

869
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,592
Lately insane story behind world is very big

870
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,152
Don't have full information

871
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,176
Can you go off half-cocked

872
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,968
You miss the forest for the trees

873
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:59,392
If he had correctly predicted that an Elvis impersonator and

874
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
Insurance

875
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,232
Would get into a fight that would lead to sending ricin

876
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,256
The president

877
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,840
He says forever

878
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:11,168
And it's really tough to imagine they're like You could argue that this way

879
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,448
It was a false flag

880
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,472
Depended on these days

881
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:19,872
Elaborate

882
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:26,272
Set up got this in the bag in the bank for 20 years

883
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:31,648
He was stumbling organism

884
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:32,928
Something

885
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,952
But you know what's even crazier

886
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,000
In May 2013

887
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:38,560
Someone else

888
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,376
That was also a plot to set someone up

889
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
In that case

890
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,448
Shannon Richardson

891
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,776
Who was an actress in The Walking Dead

892
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,312
Was going through a divorce

893
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,104
So she decided to frame her husband

894
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,128
By sending rice

895
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,175
That just makes

896
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
Too much sense

897
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,015
It does

898
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:05,951
With the Elvis impersonator

899
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,743
But this also

900
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,279
People just

901
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,071
Thundaga president

902
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,375
Trouble

903
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,495
It does have a certain

904
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,031
Whimsical Flair to it

905
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,847
You know like a like a romance novel kind of

906
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,127
Situation

907
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,663
Love that story

908
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:29,759
I'm glad no one got hurt

909
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,319
Dutch

910
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,111
She cooked up was so impotent

911
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,671
Even if Obama had open the letter u

912
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:41,279
Like the judge did open the letter

913
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:51,263
But the story of this guy stumbling into a borg Vicky's found a conspiracy

914
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,823
Story creator

915
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:59,455
It's unfortunate that it has to get into the public exposure and JoJo molestation

916
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,759
I wish that wasn't part of this plan

917
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:06,111
Otherwise the human Insanity that's behind this

918
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,135
This is so

919
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,695
It's an amazing story

920
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,743
Stop

921
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,511
Cause and effect

922
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,535
It's our belief

923
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,559
State if you have a

924
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,839
A story that begins with

925
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:18,143
The janitor went into the morgue

926
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:25,055
And you

927
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,847
Consent of the president

928
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:33,247
Time as the Boston bombing like that is so we're outside of time

929
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:36,063
Time it. It's a that's what it is

930
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,367
Everything has been done and will be done

931
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,647
And is being done.

932
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,695
The world is big

933
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,767
There's a lot of people in it a lot of them have agendas

934
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
Situations

935
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
They're going

936
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:47,839
Through that

937
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,631
They are not immediately apparent

938
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:52,959
Answer when you see a story like there's rice in letters sent

939
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,727
President

940
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,007
To assume

941
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:58,079
That you know everything about it with that nothing about

942
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,127
And Alex knows nothing about

943
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,455
But you've decided it's very important to include

944
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,223
In his narrative

945
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:20,095
Do you have

946
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:41,343
Rodger wicker

947
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,047
Has happened to Corey

948
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,143
Recorded

949
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:59,007
The guardian reported that the Senate voted against a background check

950
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,031
54 to 40

951
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:06,687
Whatever plot there was Congressman to follow guidelines

952
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,247
On this very same day

953
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,271
April 7th

954
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:13,343
The Atlantic ran a story about this gun control measure

955
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,135
Being shot

956
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:20,511
Senator Rodger wicker gloated in real time

957
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:24,863
Wicker Then followed up with a press release going into detail about his decision

958
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
And yelping

959
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,911
Familiar

960
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,703
I have not and will not

961
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,775
Support or undermine the Constitution Second

962
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
What amendment protects

963
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:45,855
What was his NRA voting record

964
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,623
Doors for like

965
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,183
You're more left-leaning bar

966
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,207
Civil

967
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,743
Right

968
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:57,631
I suspected Alex's misunderstanding vote from April 11th

969
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:00,191
In order to build up his case that he was on the fence

970
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:05,055
Cuz it's voted yet about this legislation

971
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,591
But he wasn't holding on

972
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,359
On the bill

973
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:10,175
He was a cloture vote his gave up was

974
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:13,759
Debate and I'll put the measure up to a formal vote

975
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,087
Since a lot of Republicans were trying to hold a filibuster in

976
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,623
This could be seen as

977
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,647
Some form of support for

978
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,183
For the belt

979
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:27,839
Republicans voted exact

980
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,375
None of them got letters

981
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,655
Because they wanted message

982
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:37,055
Mississippi the target of this crazy.

983
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,079
Mississippi and the

984
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,383
The president is like

985
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:44,735
Small-scale attacks I don't know if Alex is just intentionally leaving out the judge

986
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,503
Or if he has

987
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,807
Become aware of that I'm not sure exactly what the

988
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,111
The situation is important

989
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,135
Discover it

990
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:56,255
Other voters who voted not have

991
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,279
The filibuster

992
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,559
Put this up to a vote

993
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,351
The 16 other Republican

994
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,375
15 other Republic

995
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,399
They didn't get lighter

996
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,287
Gun legislation because of it

997
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,823
Alex's just creating a

998
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,591
Completely alter

999
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,871
Reality for his audience

1000
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,663
Delivered where everything is connected

1001
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:16,479
It's all an elaborate plan to deprive him of his gun

1002
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,783
It's manipulative

1003
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,575
I didn't saying how profitable

1004
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,415
Yeah yeah

1005
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,951
I think

1006
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:26,975
I think it's great that

1007
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,327
Good job

1008
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,375
Telophase

1009
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,263
The 16th one of his major pieces of information

1010
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:44,127
It was the Family Guy clip that manipulative

1011
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:50,783
Nope episode make it appear from

1012
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,087
Different parts of the same episode

1013
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,391
Peter Griffin

1014
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,927
At the Boston Marathon

1015
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,767
Very inaccurate

1016
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,815
Manipulative editing of the episode.

1017
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,631
By the 17th

1018
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,703
People were saying

1019
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,983
You guys are pulling a hoax

1020
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,287
Yeah because

1021
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,871
And Alex is still pushing the Family Guy

1022
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:19,199
And also if you listen to this clip its

1023
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:21,247
It's really interesting how he's creating a

1024
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,783
Strawman out of the

1025
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,807
Complained

1026
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:24,831
About his cover

1027
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,111
Of the episode

1028
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,943
Marathon

1029
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,879
Narrative

1030
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:10,655
Remotely

1031
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,175
No one sent me episode isn't real

1032
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,503
Some people did have a misunderstanding from what I

1033
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,295
Two different ships

1034
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:30,623
Is

1035
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:35,231
Different episode

1036
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,279
The way Family Guy works

1037
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:41,631
Is there so many non sequitur jokes

1038
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,679
Completely unrelated to anything else

1039
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,495
And that's what is being represented

1040
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:49,311
The beginning of the episode

1041
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,615
A flashback

1042
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,919
Combined with

1043
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,199
The culmination of the main

1044
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:55,967
Simplot

1045
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,247
And that is just

1046
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:00,319
It you might as well be using two different episodes

1047
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:03,391
Episode and whatever

1048
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,207
When is intention

1049
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
Understanding

1050
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,583
That are being used against him

1051
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,191
Exist

1052
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
No

1053
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,983
People are saying

1054
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,543
That you are misleading people into thinking

1055
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:23,615
Did the episode included Peter bombing the marathon

1056
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,663
And there's only one reason

1057
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,431
Do do

1058
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,015
Why in

1059
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,295
This time.

1060
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,599
Before we have any

1061
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,927
That people would

1062
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,207
Even engage

1063
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,487
With this whole family

1064
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:43,071
It's a cuz everybody's on kind of a high alert

1065
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:43,839
Situation

1066
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:44,863
Everybody is

1067
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,631
Trying to fill the

1068
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,399
The blanks in

1069
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,935
And so naturally

1070
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,703
There's going to be

1071
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,727
Hoaxes and

1072
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:50,751
Incredible

1073
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:51,775
I hope this

1074
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,055
At all

1075
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,079
But now

1076
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:55,871
Just can't help it

1077
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,407
Shut the fuk

1078
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,431
The Family Guy

1079
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:03,551
A lot of traffic and

1080
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,647
Predicted 9/11

1081
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:11,999
Spider-Man trailer for Spider-Man at the Twin Towers

1082
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:17,631
400

1083
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,167
The people's mind when you're trying to make

1084
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,519
The idea that this existed in media before

1085
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,543
Or whatever

1086
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,127
Fold the dollar bill right now

1087
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:32,479
Hit some sort of lizard brain

1088
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,063
It's kind of a hijacking

1089
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,111
Your base brain

1090
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:41,439
I understand popular I get why Alex

1091
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:42,719
Brilliant

1092
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:47,583
If you are dealing with things in a real way he would deal with the actual criticism

1093
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,423
These are different parts of the episode

1094
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,983
We put out made here

1095
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,567
Peter uses a phone to detonate bombs at the marathon

1096
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,359
That's not in the episode

1097
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,895
But isn't it strange

1098
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,431
Set the Boston Marathon

1099
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,711
And a bombing exist

1100
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,735
The same epi

1101
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:08,063
Episode of Family Guy

1102
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,599
It would be diminishing returns

1103
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,903
It is a little weird

1104
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,743
He needs to lie in order to make it

1105
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,815
By itself that behavior

1106
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,351
Isn't dictative of dishonest

1107
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,143
So

1108
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,191
The Homer

1109
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:24,959
Quote

1110
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,007
Evergreen

1111
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:36,223
Just cuz I don't care doesn't mean I don't

1112
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,527
I think about that quote

1113
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,599
Doesn't care about the truth

1114
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,927
So

1115
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:45,951
This that splah

1116
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,231
Alex starts

1117
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,791
To how like

1118
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,071
To Boston

1119
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,655
He started yelling false flag

1120
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,679
Alex

1121
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,703
Still running on me

1122
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,727
Idea that the

1123
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:58,495
The governor

1124
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,055
Patrick

1125
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:06,175
Ended the press conference after he got confronted in

1126
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:06,943
Dislike

1127
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:09,759
The guy who got caught with his hand in the cookie jar

1128
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,319
Alex starts telling a little story from his

1129
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,367
Pass okay

1130
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,391
To this story

1131
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,927
And recognize

1132
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:17,951
First of all

1133
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,975
This probably isn't

1134
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,255
But second

1135
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,303
If it is it indicates

1136
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,095
A complete disrespected

1137
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,119
Disregard for the truth

1138
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,679
Has lingered in Alex's career

1139
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:55,327
I just imagined Alex and

1140
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,175
Yep liqueando real

1141
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,479
Cable system over there

1142
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:18,623
TV shows anymore

1143
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:33,983
And it was on the only cases were people on the the fraud what is going on everywhere

1144
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:37,055
Just because I was willing to go in

1145
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,079
He's bluffing

1146
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:45,759
A man into prison okay

1147
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,343
Even if true

1148
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,647
You suck

1149
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:55,487
So it is true the John Villarreal a former Austin

1150
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,535
Community TV manager

1151
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,559
7 years in prison

1152
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,327
For embezzling

1153
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,607
That is definitely

1154
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,631
Alex

1155
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,703
I'm not sure I can find any evidence that Alex

1156
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:08,031
To do with the arrest investigation or even

1157
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:14,687
This very easily could be a case of Alex taking credit for being the truth-teller about something

1158
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:17,503
Long after the events already

1159
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,271
Transpired

1160
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,551
I seen a bit of that

1161
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,599
Yep however

1162
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,135
Get to the bottom of this

1163
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:25,439
I stumbled into an archive of media clipping

1164
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,463
Things from the Austin chronic

1165
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,255
Many of them

1166
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,279
His time at the office

1167
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:30,815
TV station

1168
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,631
Portrait of Alex's early days

1169
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:37,727
This has nothing to do with John Villarreal by accident

1170
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,751
Some stuff that I think is

1171
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:42,847
So there's an article about a bunch of suspicious

1172
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,383
Does related to the firing

1173
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,407
Other Act

1174
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,199
View host who had issues

1175
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:47,967
With Alex

1176
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:48,735
Okay

1177
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,855
Without

1178
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:59,999
Cuz it's such a mysterious complaints that ended up getting lodged against them for what's called

1179
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,023
Commercialism

1180
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,559
Which isn't allowed on the station

1181
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,631
Buzz Marketing

1182
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,679
Alex denied filing the complaint

1183
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,727
But some people were not so sure

1184
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,287
That article includes a little story about Alex

1185
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,591
There's another hosted AC

1186
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,615
TTV name Christian

1187
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,383
Suicide hanging

1188
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,991
This person had a bit of a beef with Alex

1189
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:25,087
He barely attended a rally that Alex was holding to counter his rhetoric

1190
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,367
Your Christian went to

1191
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,391
Counter Alice's rhetoric

1192
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,951
And when he arrives home he got a call from a detective

1193
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:30,975
Accused

1194
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,743
Stalking

1195
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:34,303
Just for showing up to a rally that I was older

1196
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,119
What else was fired from kjfk he was

1197
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,399
Considering filing a wrong

1198
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,679
Termination lawsuit again

1199
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,447
Station

1200
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:43,519
He went so far as to have hockey

1201
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,287
Depose

1202
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,847
Because you suspected that monkey had been involved in

1203
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,895
You can't keep saying honky

1204
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:57,087
This didn't turn into anything but would later Almost Do It

1205
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:59,135
After he

1206
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,183
Email

1207
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:08,095
Was fired because he was an immature little punk

1208
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,631
Who cries until he gets his way

1209
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:12,191
Yeah that's

1210
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:17,311
Picture of Alex trying to use

1211
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,335
Lawfare

1212
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,127
Against people in this

1213
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,175
Early career people who

1214
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,455
He refuted with

1215
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,735
Fire.

1216
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,503
McAllen

1217
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:28,831
How much is football not entirely sure but these people

1218
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,599
Like

1219
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:35,743
They're pretty insistent that this

1220
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,023
This level of

1221
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,839
Multiple people getting fired for tax

1222
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:42,911
Complaints about commercialism

1223
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:46,751
Suspicious

1224
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,823
I know the answer

1225
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:54,431
I can't really show my work

1226
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:55,967
But they're still

1227
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,503
These clippings Jordan

1228
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,295
There's a letter to the editor from

1229
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,575
From July 2000

1230
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:05,695
We're at from someone who rebuilt Chapel at Mount Carmel

1231
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,231
For the Branch Davidian

1232
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:12,095
Alex was involved in getting the building restored in charge of the memorial event

1233
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:17,215
Do you remember the Alex one of the biggest things

1234
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:21,055
It is early career building of the Branch Davidian

1235
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:23,615
You made a giant himself

1236
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,407
Going out advocating

1237
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,175
For this

1238
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:28,735
He's always

1239
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:32,063
So about Waco

1240
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,599
Championing

1241
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,623
Before these people

1242
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,951
So what are the ministers twelve-year-old daughter

1243
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,559
Celebratory dance

1244
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,351
For that Memorial event

1245
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,167
To the editor

1246
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:50,751
Even Angels were moved by Angie performance

1247
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:54,591
During the white chiffon dress with gold trim that floated in the air

1248
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,895
He was a gift from Heaven that afternoon

1249
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,431
Alex gave her last

1250
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:02,015
Place on the agenda around 4 p.m. after most ever wanted last

1251
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,039
Including the media

1252
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:08,415
Earlier that Memorial Day I heard Alex tell Angie's father that there was no time

1253
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:11,487
I watched tears come to Charles's eyes

1254
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:14,815
How is he going to tell his beloved daughter there was no time to

1255
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,583
To give the gift

1256
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,375
He hurried out of the chapel

1257
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,911
There was time for Alex

1258
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,191
Describe hatred and vent

1259
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,239
But there was no time for Angie's dance

1260
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,519
No time for beauty

1261
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,335
To the people that he was

1262
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,103
Supposedly

1263
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,663
Yeah that's the amount of consideration

1264
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:30,687
He gave

1265
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,759
Turn this event into being about him

1266
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,039
Read of this

1267
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,599
This child dude come up with an interpretive dance

1268
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:40,415
No not so much like Alex

1269
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:43,999
Yeah I mean I get that but also I tried to dunk

1270
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:44,767
Give a s*** about that

1271
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:49,631
ICare with a twelve-year-old

1272
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,935
There's a difference

1273
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,983
Opinion

1274
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,567
I understand that but you know how much it would mean

1275
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,151
People

1276
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:07,551
You know folks who are rebuilding in line with what Alex was

1277
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:10,623
Trying to bring

1278
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,647
The center

1279
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:14,719
Of this as opposed to Alex screaming about the government

1280
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,279
And all this s***

1281
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,047
Stump speech

1282
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,095
Each for himself a publicity stunt

1283
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:23,423
For his own industry and his own business

1284
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,727
Not understand

1285
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,007
The Branch Davidian

1286
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,543
In reality

1287
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,079
None of that is important

1288
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:35,711
What is important is Alec prioritizing himself

1289
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:38,015
Over the people that you supposedly

1290
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:38,783
They're too high

1291
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,111
And so it turns out that's been the case

1292
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,135
For very long time

1293
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:49,023
Aldi's archives Alex had anything to do with John Via Real skate

1294
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,559
Bye 2006

1295
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:53,375
When this all went down Alex's wellpath

1296
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:56,959
Information that's available

1297
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,983
It seems like someone

1298
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:00,031
Buddha talks about it right now

1299
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,567
Like all the people who were

1300
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,103
Working at the station

1301
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,639
Who come out and talk about how big

1302
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:06,431
The s*** Alex was all that

1303
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:12,831
Someone would have mentioned that he was involved in cracking the case open by barging into a meeting and blasing everybody

1304
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:16,159
Accusations of malfeasance

1305
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:19,999
I rate this story total b*******

1306
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:21,791
You can't prove it

1307
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:23,071
But it doesn't make

1308
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:23,839
Yeah

1309
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,887
So

1310
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:28,447
If you get back to Alex talking about the boss

1311
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,215
Ebonics

1312
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,751
And

1313
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,055
In this club he talks about how

1314
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,079
He knew all

1315
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:34,847
All along

1316
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:35,615
Everything

1317
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:43,039
Like he's predicted all this you predicted the ricin letters

1318
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,599
None of this seems to actually be the case

1319
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,647
But you calling all of his prediction

1320
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,415
Correct

1321
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:21,439
Motorcycles

1322
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,887
Around the corner

1323
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:32,447
Before

1324
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:35,519
It could be

1325
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:40,383
Come flying over Alex's trying to buzz Market that goose game

1326
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:46,527
Backup app

1327
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:50,111
Yeah the Untitled Goose game

1328
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,463
You're calling a man

1329
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:59,583
Tired

1330
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,799
Did you just

1331
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:15,199
Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo

1332
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:28,511
Yeah

1333
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:33,887
When do the Boston bombing is the balrog

1334
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:40,799
As far as I know like I said I have no indication that Alex this is a false flag they would release of Iowa

1335
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:44,127
He repeatedly predicted that the global still going to Nuke Chicago

1336
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,175
That was pretty

1337
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:46,943
Inconsistent

1338
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:49,247
But I don't recall hearing this prediction

1339
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,015
At all

1340
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,039
Father you say

1341
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:54,367
I suspect that he didn't make his predict

1342
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,647
Mostly because of this

1343
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:56,671
That we just heard

1344
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:01,791
Alex absolutely did not say on his show that they would wait a few days while they figure out which Patsy

1345
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:04,351
Now did he turn Lisa

1346
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:09,983
Absolutely did not say anything even close to

1347
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,263
Sometime after the bombing

1348
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,311
I can I can be very confident

1349
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:16,639
I believe it with Alex's

1350
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:17,919
Just posted

1351
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:19,199
The opposite of prey

1352
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,503
This is one of that happens

1353
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,551
And I suppose prognosticator

1354
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:26,111
Massage variables

1355
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:30,975
About their prior claims

1356
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:34,303
This is closely related was known as the hindsight bias

1357
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,119
Expensive an ass

1358
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:40,959
Predict which outcomes they believe are likely to happen about upcoming event

1359
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:43,007
What about notable examples of this was

1360
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,799
Researchers asking people about Nixon

1361
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,847
Trips to China in the USSR

1362
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:50,687
After the events happen they're asked to remember what their initial prediction

1363
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,455
Work

1364
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:54,271
And people consistently show heavy skewing towards Pinky

1365
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,039
Weather prediction

1366
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,599
We're more in line with what actually happened

1367
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,367
After the fact

1368
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,159
IC

1369
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:03,487
A very high level of hindsight bias analysis cover

1370
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,255
70

1371
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:07,839
He's already decided with no evidence of this is a false flag

1372
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:10,143
He's already decided again was no evidence

1373
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:13,983
That they're either going to have a right-wing pasty or a Islamic Pat

1374
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,543
Who's still only being blamed in order to take right wing

1375
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,311
People's guns

1376
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,895
This completely manufactured reality is being propped up by isn't

1377
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,663
Consistency

1378
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,943
Predicted all of these variable

1379
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,247
He thinks he predicted a bioweapon attack

1380
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,295
Densidad

1381
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,575
Does ricin letters are

1382
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,855
Completely unrelated to the bomb

1383
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:34,975
He thinks he predicted that they wouldn't find a suspect immediately but I don't see any evidence of that either

1384
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:38,047
What I do see evidence of its completely

1385
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,583
Failed predictions Alex's

1386
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:42,911
What is Emma's at the Goldwater going to blame the Patriots

1387
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,191
Use this to take his gun

1388
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:47,007
Since we're in 2019

1389
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:47,775
Bleach

1390
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,615
Another prediction was the new king of Chicago

1391
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,895
Or one of the others

1392
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:56,735
Notably not Boston was not one of us

1393
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:59,295
He was way off about everything but he's passing

1394
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,575
Self off as a prophet

1395
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,599
Based on

1396
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:03,135
So does the fudge

1397
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,463
There's an interesting elevator

1398
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,231
Hindsight bias

1399
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:13,375
A 2011 article in the Journal of experimental psychology learning memory and cognition

1400
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:14,655
Quote

1401
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,679
Hindsight bias

1402
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,471
Provide the illusion of understanding

1403
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,287
And can result in a failure to learn

1404
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:23,359
This is a pretty common Point made by research

1405
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,383
New study memory

1406
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,687
The less conscious you are about your

1407
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:30,271
Experiences in life the more likely you are to fall prey to cognitive bias

1408
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,575
And the end result of that is

1409
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,599
You never learn

1410
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,159
God I think I always think

1411
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:36,927
The people who read

1412
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,231
Historians

1413
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,255
Are the most

1414
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,279
Frustrated

1415
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:46,143
Planet

1416
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:48,447
Yeah

1417
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:53,311
Right if Alex were a honest actor

1418
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:55,615
Situation

1419
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,895
Straight up and not trying

1420
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:59,711
And manipulate people

1421
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,759
Is self-destructive and selfish

1422
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:04,575
Because he's disallowing the possibility that he can

1423
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,343
Reflect

1424
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,111
Then think about like

1425
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,903
I said they're going to Nuke

1426
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:10,463
Stan and I was wrong Chicago

1427
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,511
I was wrong about that

1428
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:16,607
What can I learn from those mistakes that I made along the way

1429
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:18,911
Because he's a just a rank manipulator

1430
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:21,471
None of this matters but for other people

1431
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,751
This is an important thing

1432
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:24,287
To consider about

1433
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:27,103
If I was the president like I would

1434
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,151
Create a new cabinet position of

1435
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:31,711
Historian who tells me what I'm doing dumb

1436
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:36,575
That's all he's at that's all of his Lookout band

1437
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,623
Let's have her right there and she's like

1438
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:39,391
Hey

1439
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,415
We've done this

1440
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:46,815
Before and I'm like cool let's not do it there are a lot of horns

1441
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,655
Defense Rumsfeld says it's a great idea

1442
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:54,239
History horn

1443
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:01,663
We're looking for 6

1444
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,431
The Oath Keepers

1445
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,199
What's going to be on

1446
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,503
Cuz they were going down to

1447
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:08,063
Can't agree never to hold their annual

1448
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:11,903
Oath renewal ceremony but they do around the

1449
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:14,975
The time of the Revolution cosplaying idiot

1450
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:16,255
I hate them still

1451
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,023
SMS

1452
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:22,143
Because he was driving

1453
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,679
Episode and there's big news

1454
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,959
About The Oath Keepers

1455
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:26,239
And there planned event

1456
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:45,183
Housekeepers that constitutional lawyer Ron Paul Stafford

1457
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,495
Before you think of that footage

1458
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:03,615
Astrology.com

1459
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:17,439
Oath Keepers

1460
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:21,023
National

1461
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,607
But but there's a

1462
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:42,015
There's a bit of a problem

1463
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:45,087
So it is true that the permit was suspended for the oak

1464
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:47,135
Is Rally that was going to happen

1465
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,207
Ultimately doesn't matter

1466
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,511
They held a rally on Friday the 19th

1467
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,119
The Oath Keepers were not

1468
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:59,167
Pacifically targeted to have their permits

1469
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,447
Suspended as Alex

1470
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,215
Suggesting

1471
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,007
The Selectmen of likes

1472
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:06,335
Contented voted to place a moratorium on public gathering

1473
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:08,639
Well because there was a bummer on the loose

1474
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:10,431
I don't know

1475
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:12,223
Public gathering

1476
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:17,599
The feeling was not to have any large public Gatherings until this thing is sorted out

1477
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,135
You can pretty easily

1478
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:21,439
The decision-making process they will go into this

1479
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,999
Seem like a very linear

1480
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,023
Yeah

1481
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:27,327
I think the Town Council did what they thought was

1482
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,095
Right

1483
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:28,863
What was that

1484
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:32,447
But ultimately you just played into those Keeper's hands it allowed them to an

1485
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,215
Amplify

1486
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,287
Do tons of event permits were suspended

1487
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:38,079
Lexington

1488
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:44,735
That place was probably swimming with really depressed reenactors who didn't get to do their their War re-enacting

1489
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:49,087
But I want some store roads don't care about the larger picture when there's a possibility

1490
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,903
I'm single. Because the globalist

1491
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,671
A conservative

1492
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,207
That's not the case at all

1493
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:56,511
And honestly when I was reflecting on this

1494
01:10:56,767 --> 01:11:00,351
I thought about it I thought like it played out exactly how it should

1495
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:02,399
They'll I think this like men of likes

1496
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,679
Listen to did the right thing

1497
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:05,983
It turns like

1498
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,007
The public

1499
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,311
Is bomber on the loose

1500
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,359
Multiple bombers possibly

1501
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:14,943
And they have attacked a large public gathering

1502
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:18,015
It's probably in our best interest to make sure that

1503
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,039
We don't provide

1504
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,087
Now I hate you

1505
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:22,367
I think they suck

1506
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,903
And I'm not thrilled with them

1507
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,671
Ever

1508
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:28,255
Okay but at the same time I think

1509
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:29,279
It is

1510
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,047
Healthy

1511
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:30,815
For groups

1512
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:33,631
To say we are

1513
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:35,679
To dictate how we live our lives

1514
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,727
The idea that

1515
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,775
You know they would be, Target

1516
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,055
For them isn't

1517
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:41,823
Enough

1518
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:45,663
Necessarily for the human Spirit to be like we're not going to

1519
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:50,527
Still having it without the permit

1520
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:56,159
I almost think is exactly how this should have played out as well and thankfully nothing happened there wasn't any violence

1521
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,439
Deteriorated

1522
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,975
Eddie ugliness

1523
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:03,327
And honestly if there was a bomber that was going to attack a large would never attack

1524
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,375
Is there alright

1525
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:11,775
They're the ones who are going to probably carry out a better terrorist attack

1526
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:15,359
Later

1527
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,919
I stopped short of soup

1528
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,967
According The Oath Keepers and what they did

1529
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:24,831
But abstractly if you just look at them as a fill-in-the-blank group

1530
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,879
I think it's played out habits

1531
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,927
With the exception of

1532
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,719
They were single.

1533
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:32,767
Responsibility

1534
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,047
Stupid and propaganda

1535
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,375
I don't know I

1536
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,399
I think

1537
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:40,191
I think it's

1538
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:42,495
Maybe not the best thing

1539
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,263
4

1540
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,055
Your government's 22

1541
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:47,359
Like the clientele permits for the sake of like

1542
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,663
There is a danger

1543
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,735
Because if it is dictator

1544
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,783
What we do based on

1545
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,319
Threat

1546
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,855
Stop servicing

1547
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:01,695
Pateros

1548
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,231
At the same time I do think

1549
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,255
Publix

1550
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:06,047
Is the primary objective

1551
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:11,935
Enough people voted on it and that's what they decided was the best way to do that

1552
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:12,959
I don't know if it's

1553
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:13,983
My place

1554
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,567
Something wrong about it but

1555
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:20,639
In my estimation

1556
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:24,223
Chances are from everything that I know about

1557
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:27,295
The best way to respond

1558
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,063
Intuit error

1559
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,367
Is 2 treated as a

1560
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,327
Fake terrorist attack

1561
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:41,375
Unaffected

1562
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:43,423
And there goes the terrorist attack

1563
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,447
911

1564
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,471
Very effect

1565
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,287
We destroyed America because of

1566
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,567
Right

1567
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:50,847
At the same time

1568
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,127
100-percent

1569
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,919
There is no way you will

1570
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,199
Convince enough people to

1571
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:55,967
Just say

1572
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,991
We are going to

1573
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,015
Except and absorb

1574
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,575
No response other than

1575
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,599
Have the police

1576
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,951
Those responses in Fallout 2 are

1577
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:07,487
The goal

1578
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,303
I don't know I'm not in

1579
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:15,679
Government

1580
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:17,471
Decisions and I don't know what variables

1581
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,287
I don't know

1582
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:23,871
I don't know it's it's very complicated

1583
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,175
Outside with Yoki

1584
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:37,695
No they're also terrorists I'm not cool with terrorists also being allowed to have rallies

1585
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:42,815
Difficult about this like I even our conversation about it

1586
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:43,839
Variable

1587
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:47,423
People in Lexington

1588
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,983
No

1589
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:53,311
They would end up getting caught a couple days later

1590
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,359
What no

1591
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:59,711
Space of

1592
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:01,247
That's a threat

1593
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:03,295
Or what could be out there is

1594
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,319
Doobie

1595
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:09,183
The imagination is the limit

1596
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,975
Things were wrong and I think every

1597
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,743
Thought that

1598
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:12,511
Got to them

1599
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,047
To where they are

1600
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,071
Makes perfect sense

1601
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:15,839
Samsonite under

1602
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:20,703
Is

1603
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:21,727
Afifa

1604
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:26,591
Yeah I mean wise Maybe

1605
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,783
Like every thought they had along the way too wrong

1606
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:35,807
Correct

1607
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:39,391
I agree it's like a it's like a math problem

1608
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:46,815
Alex talks about how he's certain about everything

1609
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:47,583
Hardly move

1610
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:05,247
Exaggerating

1611
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:07,039
This is a false flag because

1612
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:09,087
Bare minimum a provocateur

1613
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:15,743
So this is a false flag for sure he knows what's going to happen he's telling you what's going to happen

1614
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:26,495
He's saying that there's a entire possibility

1615
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,591
And so that's his way of saying

1616
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:36,479
All of these things

1617
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,759
And I am right

1618
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:38,527
Now

1619
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:42,879
If the reality that comes about in the next day or two or whatever

1620
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:46,207
Doesn't match my prediction that's just because the globalist

1621
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:53,375
It's a perfect way so you can always be right no matter what it is you wouldn't act like this if you were Siri

1622
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,703
In his head

1623
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,495
Constant cat-and-mouse

1624
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,263
Chaska

1625
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:03,871
You know where

1626
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:06,431
Different movies like

1627
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:13,343
I knew you were going to make that move as well that was a different possibility and I

1628
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:19,743
And it's been sort of like in the background of a lot of history episode 4

1629
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:21,023
Circularly McCombs

1630
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,047
Very

1631
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,327
Relevant

1632
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,863
The idea that Alex thinks

1633
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:26,399
He's having a discussion

1634
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:29,983
Yes the globalist real time

1635
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,263
Loses

1636
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:32,031
F****** my

1637
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,567
Okay a little bit later than

1638
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,847
Episode

1639
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,967
Globus tours dad are still there incest

1640
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:43,039
As we know or something

1641
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:46,111
More importantly look the same

1642
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:53,023
It's pretty much one of them

1643
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:54,559
Pictures of Alex's Atkins

1644
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,583
Conspiracy and

1645
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,351
I got to say

1646
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:58,143
I know exactly why he's

1647
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:07,615
Beer

1648
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,407
You talkin to call Joe spot

1649
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,943
He's got him on the phone

1650
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,247
It's really freaked him out

1651
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,807
You're a hoe

1652
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,591
When a cell phone

1653
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:40,639
Add

1654
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:48,063
Everywhere

1655
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,767
This is how stupid you are

1656
01:18:57,023 --> 01:19:00,863
Let's go ahead and go

1657
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:03,679
Zoe

1658
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:05,983
It's obvious that Alex knows that these are from

1659
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,519
From part different parts of the Apes

1660
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,591
And then they cut

1661
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,127
Misrepresenting

1662
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:13,663
Entirely

1663
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:15,455
What people's criticism

1664
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:16,991
Lake Hughes

1665
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,527
Is showing awareness

1666
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:20,831
Yeah of what he's doing

1667
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:27,231
He knows absolutely Paul is very clear that he understands this to

1668
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:32,607
I don't get involved

1669
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:39,007
Found it on YouTube

1670
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:39,775
They amplify

1671
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:44,127
I never would have gotten the traffic that without Paul and Alex

1672
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,991
They did it though

1673
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:49,759
Themselves

1674
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:53,343
Let me grab a coat of I've no f****** idea whose YouTube account

1675
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:56,159
But I think it's license portal

1676
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:57,695
And then the fact that they are the one

1677
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:58,719
Who made it

1678
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,255
Circulated

1679
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,559
Like I said that last

1680
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:04,095
Alex is showing he knows

1681
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,375
Why this was f***** up

1682
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,655
And Paul dos2

1683
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:13,055
Long seen as a side

1684
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:16,384
Finish Line of the Boston Marathon

1685
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:18,944
Coveted

1686
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,736
Dismembered limbs Etc

1687
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:28,416
It's the main character in Family Guy

1688
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,952
That's amazing 2

1689
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,256
Explosive devices

1690
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:36,864
An attitude

1691
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,168
Isaura

1692
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:47,104
Proof of an inside job of some Grand conspiracy

1693
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,016
In which

1694
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:56,064
Themes

1695
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,344
What did

1696
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,416
Was weird was bizarre with strange was interested

1697
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:05,024
The four-minute commentary video how

1698
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,048
Yesterday

1699
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,584
Within hours

1700
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,120
Within about 3 hours

1701
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:11,680
The video was deleted by YouTube

1702
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,080
Immediately

1703
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,528
The Family Guy

1704
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:35,488
The listeners probably are wondering about now why is that Family Guy episode coming up so much

1705
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,512
On the show

1706
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,560
Why is Alex talking about it so much

1707
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:41,632
It clearly doesn't prove anything

1708
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:42,400
Improve

1709
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:46,240
It literally does nothing to further his argument that the bombing was a false flag

1710
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:47,264
So what's the deal

1711
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,360
Seth MacFarlane respond

1712
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:58,528
This was created by whoever created by Paul Joseph Watson

1713
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:03,392
Infowars the point where Seth MacFarlane the creator of the Family Guy messages about it

1714
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,672
To the point where he had tours

1715
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:06,720
Responded this was an alteration of his work

1716
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:08,768
Any feels terrible the people are doing this

1717
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:13,120
With his intellectual property hurting the people who are the victims of this

1718
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:15,424
Nuggets B really f***** up

1719
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:16,960
That's why Alex

1720
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:20,288
Is continuing down this road because his Target didn't ignore him

1721
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,360
Over and over through his career this instant

1722
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:27,200
SuperSU Preston attention by fostering people weigh more

1723
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:34,112
We sorted 2013 when Alex essentially big Piers Morgan to have him back on the show while he was pretending to confront him

1724
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:34,880
Gun Shop

1725
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:39,232
We saw it in 2019 when Alex threatened to murder Joe Rogan politically

1726
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,000
Nicole

1727
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:40,768
Sneaky Snake

1728
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:47,424
Let's not even broach the years-long will-they-won't-they feud with Glenn Beckley this is his strategy

1729
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,448
Hijack

1730
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,752
Alex has a power that

1731
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,288
Hijacking celebrity

1732
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:55,616
He ended up going on The View after Charlie Sheen

1733
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:56,896
Freaked out because she

1734
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:59,456
Started his public meltdown show

1735
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:02,016
Alex from The View

1736
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,296
I did not know that

1737
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,832
I thought we covered that the path

1738
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:07,648
I feel like we did

1739
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,464
But I feel like that is one of those things that

1740
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,792
It will slip out of my brain forever like Nova. No matter how many time

1741
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:15,840
Times you told me that

1742
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:16,608
Text me information

1743
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,376
Places like

1744
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:23,776
Not as notable as a lot of his other like weird appearances because

1745
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,128
And it's kind of like

1746
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:30,688
And I'm fine with that

1747
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:32,480
It's just like in my head

1748
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:35,040
It simply cannot be true

1749
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,112
I understand

1750
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:48,352
Cuz if you listen to these clips it's clear that they know that they're lying about

1751
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:55,520
And they only appear connected because the video

1752
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,568
Reposted manipulative lie

1753
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,872
We added them together edit those parts together

1754
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,688
He knows that is barely Rises

1755
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:09,856
Hey yeah he sits here with his boss

1756
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,392
But apparently also take

1757
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,416
Italic

1758
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:13,952
It's crazy

1759
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,024
This dude's the worst it's moments like this to make it total

1760
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:21,120
He knows he paid to build perception

1761
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:24,448
Because if he was reporting honest

1762
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:29,056
They would have been clearer about that did never would have played the video

1763
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,080
Play

1764
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,872
Because the video that they play

1765
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:32,896
Promoted

1766
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:34,688
Took apart of

1767
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,736
The part of the beginning of the episode

1768
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:37,760
I cut it in with

1769
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:38,784
The part of the

1770
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,320
To make it look

1771
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:46,464
Like those are they played the part where Peter runs over people at the marathon in a cartoon

1772
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:51,328
And then after that the part of the end of the episode where Peter blows up the bridge accidentally

1773
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,608
Using a cell phone

1774
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,888
They don't do that

1775
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:56,704
They have the edited video where it looks

1776
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,472
Like

1777
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,752
Based on the edits

1778
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:03,872
EyeMasters says how did you win the Boston bombing and then they cut of meat

1779
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:08,224
To the cellphone and then the bombs go off and they show the people at the marathon

1780
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:11,296
If they would never do something like that

1781
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:13,600
If they were trying to

1782
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:18,208
It's a manufacturer perception and they know what they're doing

1783
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:21,024
It is kind of weird

1784
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:24,864
Manipulative lie edited together

1785
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,448
Set the number of random jokes

1786
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,984
And distasteful jokes

1787
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:32,800
I don't know.

1788
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,336
Seasons of Family Guy

1789
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:36,896
I'm positive that you could do this with a lot of

1790
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:43,296
You could find some way to manipulative me edit

1791
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,576
Create something out of it

1792
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:45,600
It's only

1793
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,880
Because there was

1794
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,464
Shirt the Boston Marathon

1795
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,768
But the character lives

1796
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:53,792
In the Dorothy

1797
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:54,816
Yeah like

1798
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,608
A huge event

1799
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:59,424
It's never going to it's never going to be.

1800
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,448
The Simpsons predict

1801
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,472
Trump becoming president

1802
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:02,752
And that was just

1803
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:03,776
Because they thought it was

1804
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,312
Utterly

1805
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,336
Funny and impassa

1806
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,104
People to imagine

1807
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:10,944
Run defense

1808
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,808
Family Guy stuff

1809
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,600
McFarland says

1810
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:24,000
I don't know maybe we never said yeah yeah yeah

1811
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,280
Wouldn't that be awesome

1812
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:27,328
That's kind of the game that's being

1813
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,096
Played

1814
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:30,656
I'm so you got that he's on but he has another

1815
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:32,960
You got the big break

1816
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:38,848
In the past

1817
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:42,176
From the

1818
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:44,992
They show

1819
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:47,296
Four or five individuals

1820
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,832
Wearing

1821
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,952
It look like the heavy and weighed down

1822
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:02,144
So Paul Joseph

1823
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,168
Has found

1824
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:03,936
Pictures

1825
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:05,216
That are going around

1826
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:12,128
I was wondering when this was going to come up

1827
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:13,152
The time in following the

1828
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:15,200
The story I'm shocked it was on the 7th

1829
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:16,736
I thought it was actually pretty

1830
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:23,392
Actually been a little bit more immediate online but it wasn't

1831
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:30,048
As I mentioned on the last episode I was working at

1832
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,328
Message

1833
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:32,096
The kill time

1834
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:36,960
People were out with outrageously unsupported views and ideas were way more interest

1835
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:38,496
Steven anything real

1836
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,264
The time

1837
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,056
Mountains of things to read

1838
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:43,104
If you could look into that world

1839
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:43,872
Message boards

1840
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:44,640
A consists

1841
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:46,944
Italy renewing source of anonymous Post in

1842
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:47,968
Thought

1843
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,272
I would be lying if I said that I was 100

1844
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:51,296
Skeptical of every

1845
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,064
Read back.

1846
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:55,136
Wholesale

1847
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:57,696
I definitely was way more naive than I am

1848
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:03,072
Today I can still kind of remember the feeling that came from taking in those baseless theories presented

1849
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,352
Is truth it was

1850
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:07,680
Even if I didn't really believe the stuff I was reading there was

1851
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:08,960
What if

1852
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:09,984
Poston blog

1853
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,264
It was injected

1854
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,032
Into my mind

1855
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,056
And I couldn't help but be

1856
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:13,824
Somewhat effect

1857
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:14,592
Goodbye it

1858
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:17,152
That's the feeling that people like Alex and others

1859
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,944
Like this who profit

1860
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,224
From these worlds

1861
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:23,040
It's that uncertainty laced with

1862
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:26,368
That makes it vulnerable enough to lower the rational instinct

1863
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:30,208
And accept whatever is offered by as a way of

1864
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:30,976
Navigating these

1865
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:34,816
And the aftermath of the bombing there was no information

1866
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,096
From officials

1867
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:39,424
I did not vacuum idiots online decided

1868
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,192
Become Detective

1869
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,728
I remember this.

1870
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:42,496
So vividly

1871
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:47,104
Because whenever a new picture for the marathon was posted by anyone it would end up resulting in

1872
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,128
Tons of new pop

1873
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:48,896
Possibilities

1874
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:49,664
Suspect

1875
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,688
In the images

1876
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,736
None of them really stuck

1877
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,016
With exception

1878
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:54,784
Two men

1879
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,320
Who the internet decided to look at

1880
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:59,648
And decided that they were military contractors

1881
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:01,184
And that's probably involve

1882
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,464
Obvious

1883
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:05,792
At that point all that was really known was

1884
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:08,096
Pressure cookers and they were carried inside backpack

1885
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:10,656
These two dudes were wearing backpacks

1886
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:11,424
And there was

1887
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:13,728
Sexy put together

1888
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:15,008
Bada-bing bada-boom

1889
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:15,776
They're suspects

1890
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:16,800
Wanted to

1891
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,848
There's legitimately nothing bored of this

1892
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:19,616
Conspiracies

1893
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:21,408
Two guys the internet salt looks

1894
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:22,944
Suspicious backpack

1895
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,480
Backpacks became the target of a

1896
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:25,760
Giant online mystery

1897
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,296
It's being here a

1898
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:28,064
Fire

1899
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,112
Invalidated by Alex and Paul Joseph

1900
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,904
0 reasons

1901
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,184
To do this there's no Journal

1902
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:33,952
Rustic value today

1903
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:34,720
I'm talking around

1904
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:35,744
Under ungrounded

1905
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:39,328
Based on block poster Message Board thread apologize

1906
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,352
Just happen to stumble

1907
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:42,400
Lacrosse

1908
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:44,960
Dave Paul has found online posts

1909
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:46,240
These guys with

1910
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,520
Weird looking backpacks

1911
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:51,360
Hello here we go

1912
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:54,432
It's like I accept people have after work

1913
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:55,456
Listen to all these two

1914
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,040
There's giant groups

1915
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:01,344
Shirt

1916
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:03,648
And it's like I would prefer more people to

1917
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:05,440
Steaks

1918
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:07,232
But if you have

1919
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,512
Rabble-rousers like

1920
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,352
At 4

1921
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,632
Yeah

1922
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:14,912
Nefarious purpose

1923
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:17,472
Just a bunch of weird

1924
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:22,848
Like the articles that I was reading about the

1925
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,152
And how this helps

1926
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:25,920
Play doubt

1927
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:29,504
One of the things that I was reading that was the idea of this like crowdsourcing

1928
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,528
Investigative work

1929
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,320
And what are the big things

1930
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:34,112
That was pointed out as a

1931
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:35,648
The failure

1932
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,416
Process

1933
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,184
As it relates

1934
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:39,744
Was that it was a one-way

1935
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,792
Like there was only

1936
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:43,840
People online investigating saying

1937
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:45,120
And that's

1938
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:48,704
Were interacting with the people invest

1939
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:52,800
Navigating

1940
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:54,848
Turn the f****** terrible

1941
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:55,616
Options because

1942
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:56,896
They were looking at

1943
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:59,968
Okay so all we knew is backpack

1944
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,248
Let's craft

1945
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:04,320
A narrative out of these people that we can find with backpacks

1946
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:05,600
That's not enough

1947
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:06,368
App to make this

1948
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:08,160
The healthy part of that vest

1949
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,440
Ecosystem

1950
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,208
It's not like there's any

1951
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:11,744
There is no

1952
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:20,192
Strict oversight doesn't matter

1953
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:24,288
Because eventually when the FBI does released

1954
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:26,080
The picture of the suspect

1955
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,104
It is a

1956
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,688
We need help finding these people

1957
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:32,736
That's the way the crowdsourcing

1958
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,272
Is a 2 waist

1959
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,832
And that was a that did not happen

1960
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:37,856
Is the aftermath

1961
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:40,160
And so there's all these people going over these images

1962
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:41,440
The finding bulshit

1963
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:42,976
And now Alex

1964
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:46,816
Just found out about this

1965
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:47,584
Real investor

1966
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,632
You just a mop

1967
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:51,936
You're just a mop and reply

1968
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:57,568
Yeah you're blind

1969
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:58,848
Eastwood movies mob

1970
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:02,176
Please write so we got these guys with backpacks

1971
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:02,944
And this is

1972
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:03,968
Goodenough is proof

1973
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:08,064
That's why there wasn't a military contractors they're running it

1974
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,088
And Alex starts

1975
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:10,624
The freak out about how he's right

1976
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:47,744
I don't know why do you transition

1977
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,048
Smoothly happened

1978
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,376
KKK reference with the oath

1979
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:59,776
Keepers like why did you immediately go to KK

1980
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:06,176
Speeches for everybody only four more defensible because

1981
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:10,528
A little more

1982
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,720
Wow that's a problem

1983
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:21,792
So I mean they just build this up as like

1984
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:24,096
Proof that there is backpack

1985
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:25,376
They had the bombs

1986
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:27,680
And none of this is based on anything other than

1987
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:29,216
Just gassing and things I found

1988
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:30,752
An anonymous blog

1989
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:35,872
People with large black

1990
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:39,200
Epic sound

1991
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:42,528
Just feet from the weather

1992
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:45,856
So he's applying without any evidence backpack is

1993
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:50,720
Don't know

1994
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:52,768
Why you think you can prove that

1995
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:56,864
Why are you reporting that and then

1996
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,936
There's only one black backpack

1997
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:02,240
Here's what's going on

1998
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:04,288
If you look at those pictures

1999
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:05,568
There are a lot of

2000
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:07,616
Fans

2001
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:09,152
They are mostly ignore

2002
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:11,712
The internet had chosen

2003
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,480
To focus on

2004
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,248
Specifically

2005
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,832
These two guys who they've sighted or military contractors

2006
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:19,136
Boots

2007
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:21,440
They look like

2008
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,208
Appetite

2009
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:24,256
Right

2010
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:26,048
There is

2011
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:27,072
A middle eastern

2012
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:27,840
Not appearing

2013
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:28,864
Person

2014
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,400
And a guy who looks

2015
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:32,448
I have Alex will later call him

2016
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:37,056
Call Tim

2017
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:38,080
Recalls on a Yokel

2018
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,664
They are not the only people with black back

2019
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:43,968
In these pictures

2020
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:47,808
If you look at the pictures you can find a bunch of people with backpacks

2021
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,856
End up becoming the target of

2022
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:54,208
There's only there's only one

2023
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:54,976
Backpack

2024
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,864
There's all different kinds but there's only one black

2025
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:07,264
Backpack and the reason that I appreciate your spin on this year

2026
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,824
Focused on

2027
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,104
Is because

2028
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:13,152
These internet places

2029
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:17,248
Engaged in building the same area that Alex

2030
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:20,064
They were they were working

2031
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:21,344
To try and

2032
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,112
Prove

2033
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,648
The talking points

2034
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:24,928
Alex

2035
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:25,952
Put it out

2036
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:29,536
Know whether or not they were doing that specifically in-service of Alex

2037
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:32,352
Or just that these corners of the internet where

2038
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,376
Cesspools

2039
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:37,984
Yeah whatever the reality of it is

2040
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,008
A little bit unclear.

2041
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:40,288
But

2042
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:42,848
Because

2043
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,128
They focus

2044
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:46,688
This suspicion on the specific people

2045
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:49,248
That would help Alex build his narrative

2046
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:51,808
Specifically that he's trying to do with

2047
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,856
Family Guy episode that is

2048
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:55,904
Peter Griffin

2049
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:58,464
Is a tea party guy who works with

2050
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:05,376
You see this ham

2051
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:07,168
You see Paul

2052
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,216
Take this suspicion about the

2053
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,240
People with backpacks

2054
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:12,544
And it all gets funneled

2055
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,568
Towards

2056
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,128
There were two guys were military contractor looking

2057
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,920
There's a middle eastern guy and white guy

2058
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:21,248
Guys working

2059
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:24,320
White guy in order to make us all look like we're working with terrorists

2060
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:25,600
You see it happen

2061
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:26,368
So smooth

2062
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:28,928
The thing about crowdsourcing V

2063
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:29,952
Kind of proper

2064
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:30,976
Again. Conspiracy

2065
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:31,744
T-Series

2066
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,768
Is that you already have

2067
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:34,048
Built-in audience

2068
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:40,960
Because they want to be validated by you have not only given you the means by which to

2069
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,008
But at the

2070
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,544
The same time they're your main Auto

2071
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:45,824

2072
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,616
Weird

2073
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:48,640
Like f******

2074
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:49,408
Symbiotic

2075
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:52,224
Right

2076
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:57,344
Well I mean it's the actually the opposite of what's going on with the the place

2077
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,440
Crowdsourced information

2078
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:06,816
Alex interacting with his weirdos that are going out and finding the evidence

2079
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:08,864
Making cars

2080
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,680
Yeah absolutely has ecosystem

2081
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,216
Eating

2082
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:13,984
In that

2083
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:19,104
We're not doing that

2084
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:20,384
And this is what happened

2085
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:25,248
Those Dynamics

2086
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:28,064
One of the photos shows two guys

2087
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:32,416
Call Keith Thompson cocky

2088
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,952
On cell phones

2089
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:44,192
It looks like

2090
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,472
Stereotypical

2091
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:49,824
At least one of these guys

2092
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:54,176
Running right after the bomb

2093
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,480
Wouldn't you

2094
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:03,648
One of the backpacks is identical to one

2095
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:07,232
Carried by one of these individuals info

2096
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:16,704
Please Photoshop

2097
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:18,240
Because the script

2098
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:30,784
No it's

2099
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:44,352
It's unprecedented

2100
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:49,472
Alex has decided based on these pictures of some people with backpacks

2101
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:51,264
Ozark

2102
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:00,224
Oh my God

2103
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:03,808
And Alex

2104
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,856
Loses his goddamn mind

2105
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:06,624
About this

2106
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:08,160
This episode

2107
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:09,184
Deteriorate

2108
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,464
Southwest

2109
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:12,512
Because Alex

2110
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:14,304
Did they have got everything

2111
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:15,584
Oh

2112
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,352
Oh that's bad

2113
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:17,888
That's very bad

2114
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:19,680
So he apologized

2115
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:22,240
Indicates that he doesn't really know all that much

2116
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:23,008
Dinos

2117
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:23,776
Thought everything

2118
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,992
Why didn't you look into it

2119
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:35,296
Why didn't you find out what the temperature was

2120
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:36,320
It was in the forties

2121
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:43,488
Banana

2122
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:49,888
Lazy are you as an investigative reporter what the temperature was

2123
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:51,680
Since my workout

2124
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:52,704
April

2125
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:53,472
In Boston

2126
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:56,288
When it's 70° out

2127
01:39:56,544 --> 01:40:02,176
Early spring it might be a bit nicer but you know

2128
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:07,040
Especially with the restart Early Access

2129
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:09,600
You might want to

2130
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:20,864
With a mullet

2131
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:25,984
Pac-Man Heroes

2132
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:27,008
It looks like

2133
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:34,432
Huge way down heavy backpacks

2134
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,624
I'm in a white outside of working with

2135
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,440
Terrorists Muslim

2136
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:52,096
That's a terrible prediction at all so I would say that

2137
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,656
Only Fred by

2138
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:55,936
You

2139
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:58,496
It's not like a really

2140
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:00,032
Provident mean you've already think

2141
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:03,360
Like that

2142
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:04,640
I've decided

2143
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,176
The name of that

2144
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:07,456
Bly.

2145
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,992
We tried

2146
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,784
Y'all Qaeda

2147
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,064
That's what it is

2148
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,344
Sure

2149
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:19,488
We know

2150
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:21,280
From how things played out

2151
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:23,328
And every

2152
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:24,608
You can find it

2153
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:30,752
Just completely wrong about everything

2154
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:34,336
They're like

2155
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,104
They think

2156
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:37,408
Two steps ahead of the media and the

2157
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:38,688
The detectives and everything

2158
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,224
But there are completely different

2159
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:41,760
They're not even

2160
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:43,040
In reality

2161
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:45,600
They're just blaming their privates

2162
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:52,000
Steps ahead of private citizens of a pterodactyl

2163
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:53,024
On people who judge

2164
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:54,560
Happen to have backpacks

2165
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:59,168
What what is that all these like

2166
01:41:59,424 --> 01:41:59,936
Glued

2167
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:01,472
Who are figuring everything out

2168
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:02,752
Basically

2169
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,288
Reliving

2170
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:05,824
Law & Order

2171
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:08,640
Don't get to that second part where they like

2172
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:11,456
We have to build a case in order

2173
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:16,832
Police with text

2174
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:18,368
Your honor

2175
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:25,792
Not there's no

2176
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:28,096
And then what you do is you

2177
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:30,656
Test that idea by creating like

2178
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:32,192
A brainstorm

2179
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:35,776
What are other possible explanations

2180
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:39,872
Excluding those possibilities

2181
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:41,408
Narrow it down

2182
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:43,712
They would show your argument

2183
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:45,760
False are wrong themselves

2184
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,296
That strengthens

2185
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:48,320
IC

2186
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,088
No

2187
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:49,856
Evidence

2188
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:50,880
They even

2189
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:51,904
The most

2190
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:54,208
Elementary argument against the

2191
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:55,488
Has been shot down

2192
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:56,768
That's just a guy with

2193
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:59,328
Once you would otherwise

2194
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,936
You will never be a

2195
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:04,704
Iraq

2196
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:06,752
Alex really thinks

2197
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:08,288
Scooped everyone

2198
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,568
You really think

2199
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:10,336
That like

2200
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,360
Can't be real

2201
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:12,896
So far ahead of this s***

2202
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:13,920
It's crazy

2203
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:14,944
Because these are just

2204
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:15,712
Photos

2205
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:16,992
DePaul sound on

2206
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:36,960
Different Twitter accounts

2207
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:47,712
Are Goodreads

2208
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:50,016
Corsage

2209
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:04,352
Backpacks that are talking about

2210
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:10,240
Really really bad

2211
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:12,032
Ladies and gentlemen

2212
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:17,152
Wish.com

2213
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:24,320
They're typing in the background

2214
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:37,888
28000

2215
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,872
Information

2216
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:49,664
They're not showing this information

2217
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,432
Because they're working

2218
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:53,248
Also important

2219
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:55,296
Alex

2220
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:56,064
Hackers

2221
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:58,368
I wonder what those are

2222
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:05,536
Very satisfying

2223
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:14,240
So I ate more to these photos

2224
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:16,800
Frozen What I remembered from the time

2225
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:22,688
Definitely a lot more substantial

2226
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,992
What I remember is just people look like

2227
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:30,368
Pictures of like before the bombing at Red Lions and people circled in like

2228
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:34,208
Hello here's this pretty

2229
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:34,976
Sad

2230
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:38,560
About those same

2231
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:45,216
Course random shots people Circle the red lines everywhere

2232
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:54,176
Did anyone with a backpack that closely resemble the ones used in the attack

2233
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:56,480
Excluded people who didn't

2234
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:59,808
Fat butt ever narrative

2235
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:02,112
Started speculating wildly

2236
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:03,392
That they were involved

2237
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:05,696
I can't overstate how dangerous this

2238
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:07,488
And I'm honestly surprised

2239
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:08,512
Nothing ended up having

2240
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:09,792
Those people

2241
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:12,864
This was such a

2242
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,144
And Alex's

2243
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:16,192
Facilitating it amplifying issue

2244
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,984
Presumably Millions

2245
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:18,752
The people

2246
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:20,544
Like it's so bad

2247
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:23,104
Internet

2248
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:26,176
And for people to take it upon themselves to speculate their privates

2249
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:29,248
Marathon backpack

2250
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:30,016
Can look weird

2251
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:31,296
But that's awful

2252
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:33,088
They looked

2253
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:34,880
Bright

2254
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:41,280
It's that bad but it's an entirely different thing for Alex to basis reporting on those internet rumors and Witch Hunt

2255
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:44,608
Alex causes breaking news but there's no news

2256
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:45,376
Break here

2257
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,288
That's all this is

2258
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:53,568
It's so dangerous

2259
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,360
Like you and I know that I was just

2260
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:57,152
Liar and fraud

2261
01:46:58,944 --> 01:46:59,712
High-level source

2262
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:01,248
He knows what he's talkin

2263
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:03,040
We act like this

2264
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,320
Passing of Internet posts

2265
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,344
Does breaking news

2266
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,904
It gives them undue credibility in those people's eyes

2267
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:10,208
And that can lead them down bad roads

2268
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:13,792
One thing I find particularly interesting about Paul Joseph Watson

2269
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,072
Post on Infowars

2270
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:15,840
However

2271
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:18,400
Is that it's a ton of crowdsource pictures of

2272
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:19,936
The bombing the proof nothing

2273
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,984
Another is one other image

2274
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:23,776
That is not a crowd source

2275
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:24,800
Picture of the

2276
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:27,104
Images of screenshot that

2277
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,128
Someone posted on

2278
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:28,896
4chan

2279
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:39,136
Ocular posted interesting on another line

2280
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:41,440
If you read the body of the text

2281
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:42,976
This is the exact same

2282
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:45,280
Post that Alex read on are on April

2283
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,048
16th

2284
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:49,120
You remember it was the one he started out by saying was a

2285
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:55,520
But the part about outlawing reloading powder and found himself

2286
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:56,800
Post

2287
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:58,080
Is now. Atropos

2288
01:47:58,336 --> 01:48:00,640
It's party evidence being presented

2289
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:01,408
False flag

2290
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,456
And if you weren't paying close attention

2291
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:05,504
You never would have realized there was a sleight-of-hand

2292
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,296
They completely repurposed

2293
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:08,576
This post

2294
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:11,648
It's frustrating

2295
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:13,952
Decided

2296
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:19,072
I don't know how we write law but you can

2297
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:23,168
That's the rule

2298
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,008
I didn't know that

2299
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:29,824
Even be a thing and that's how it legal

2300
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:36,224
It is if I didn't know what was coming up on this episode I would say this is a new low

2301
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:38,784
We got another

2302
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,856
25 minutes from now

2303
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:42,624
Beaten to death

2304
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:46,976
There are reports coming out that the FBI has information that they believe is related to

2305
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:48,768
Add event pictures

2306
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:49,536
Prison photos

2307
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:52,096
These are not those

2308
01:48:55,168 --> 01:48:55,680
He's convinced

2309
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:57,472
One step ahead of the video

2310
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,336
So most of this

2311
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:03,360
Stretch

2312
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,896
Now becomes Alex just

2313
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:06,432
Blindly analyzing

2314
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:07,200
Sing this footage

2315
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:08,224
Send pictures

2316
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:09,760
Conclusion

2317
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:13,600
He has no reason

2318
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:17,440
It's just like

2319
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:18,720
Okay

2320
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:20,256
Oh my God

2321
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:26,656
I'm watching video

2322
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:29,728
Breaking news

2323
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:36,896
Keep scrolling

2324
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:40,224
Call man

2325
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:42,016
Workshop

2326
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,208
Wow that was

2327
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:53,536
That is astonishing how

2328
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:54,816
Just like

2329
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:57,888
I bet it's quick because

2330
01:49:58,144 --> 01:50:04,288
Conclusions already God's this works

2331
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:10,432
Alex has all the pieces of opted

2332
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:16,832
Just right in front of everything in order to create the illusion that this is a false flag

2333
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:18,624
Is so easily presented

2334
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,904
For a visit

2335
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:21,952
Yeah that's what's up

2336
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:24,000
He's freaking out because he's realizing

2337
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:30,912
It literally fell into my lap

2338
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:33,728
So

2339
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:37,312
I don't know how to set up these clips cuz a lot of them are the same

2340
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:39,104
Suspicions on

2341
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:39,872
People

2342
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:41,664
Just for no reason

2343
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:45,504
Suspects

2344
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:48,576
Right on this evening

2345
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:08,544
Oh my God

2346
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,456
2

2347
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:16,736
Military-type

2348
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:18,272
The other two look like

2349
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:22,112
If you see the guy in Lakewood

2350
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:25,696
The r word

2351
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:28,000
Just for just for the cherry on

2352
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:29,280
On top of the ice

2353
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:32,352
Alex's conjecture that these guys look military

2354
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:38,496
Remember our last episode when we discussed how they were a lot of enlisted persons

2355
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:39,264
They tough Rock

2356
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:45,664
Where are we going to wear their uniform carrying a heavy bag in memory of their fellow soldiers

2357
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:48,480
You've been killed overseas

2358
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:51,040
Whatever go to the

2359
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:51,808
Marathon

2360
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:55,904
Possibility

2361
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:57,952
They don't always do it in 50

2362
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:59,744
Like they're not always in

2363
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,072
Is the uniform that they wear

2364
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:07,168
There's a lot of different uniforms one might

2365
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:12,288
Possibility that these men had already completed the marathon

2366
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:14,080
And we're waiting for someone

2367
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:15,360
That is a possibility

2368
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:16,896
I don't know that to be

2369
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:20,480
Be true but tons of other explanations for their.

2370
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:23,040
Consider before jumping

2371
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:26,368
These are the sort of things

2372
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:27,392
You need to consider

2373
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:32,768
Before you jump to your conclusion

2374
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:35,328
You can't rule these things out

2375
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,888
Therefore you can't draw the conclusion that you

2376
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:38,656
You're drunk

2377
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:41,216
I can't tell you who these dudes are and honest

2378
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:43,008
I'm glad that information

2379
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:46,080
Like that didn't get disseminated widely

2380
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:47,104
As far as I can tell

2381
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:50,688
You can tell about the investigation to bombing

2382
01:52:50,944 --> 01:52:52,224
This was not irrelevant thread

2383
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:55,040
Anyone who actually knew what was going on all the detective

2384
01:52:56,064 --> 01:53:00,160
Interviews of FBI agents who were involved in the immediate

2385
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:00,928
Investigation

2386
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,976
Their focus was way Sharp

2387
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:05,536
Then the lack of public information LED people to believe

2388
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:12,448
By this point track down where the pressure cookers were bought and had a pretty idea pretty good idea

2389
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:17,568
They didn't Alex or Fortune heretic by throwing around baseless accusation

2390
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:18,336
The people

2391
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:19,616
Just because I have

2392
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:21,664
Good for you only thing that

2393
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:24,480
Doesn't have any source

2394
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:25,504
He doesn't know any

2395
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:28,320
14 is obsessed with a guy with a backpack

2396
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:30,624
His reporting

2397
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:34,720
But you really recognized like this is what

2398
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:37,536
It's really f******

2399
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:40,096
Scary anonymous

2400
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:41,632
I just post something

2401
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:42,656
Could

2402
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:43,424
Guide him

2403
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:46,752
Like he has no standards at all

2404
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:50,848
Terrified

2405
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:53,408
Investigate

2406
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:55,200
Sometimes sometimes

2407
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:58,016
Alex realizes something

2408
01:53:58,528 --> 01:53:59,040
These pictures

2409
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:07,232
Yeah there's this one guy in a blue coat lose White

2410
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:19,520
Chris Kyle sniper hat

2411
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:23,616
Punisher later

2412
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:26,688
His narrative is like only

2413
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:27,968
The Punisher

2414
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:28,992
This is

2415
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:31,552
Old time

2416
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:32,320
Fiat

2417
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:34,624
Skull

2418
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:38,208
Duty Orono

2419
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,840
You're out Alex spend so much time

2420
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:44,864
This episode about the logo

2421
01:54:45,376 --> 01:54:48,704
He's convinced back at the guy in the picture from the Boston Marathon

2422
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:53,568
He's wearing this hat at The Punisher logo

2423
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:56,640
Or he's being set up to look like he's on a seal

2424
01:54:57,664 --> 01:55:00,480
Expound at length about how only an idiot

2425
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:03,552
The Punisher logo because the Punisher logo itself was just

2426
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:05,088
Stolen from the Marines

2427
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:07,392
Hey Chris Kyle was a member of a Seal Team

2428
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:09,696
And he was known to wear this logo on his clothes

2429
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:11,744
Not because he liked the Punisher

2430
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,280
Because it was a Marine

2431
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:14,048
Seal Team

2432
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:15,072
Symbol Pryor

2433
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:17,376
How to completely wrong

2434
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:19,424
Hate

2435
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:23,776
And having somebody do a bunch of Coke

2436
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:25,568
And then tell me all their ideas

2437
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:30,432
Is every every freezer

2438
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:34,272
And then

2439
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:39,392
They got a little

2440
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:45,280
Accidentally

2441
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:47,328
It does it does feel that way

2442
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:49,632
F*** off

2443
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:54,240
Who was just a big fan of

2444
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:57,056
So he named

2445
01:55:57,824 --> 01:56:03,968
Punisher logo on buildings in Iraq as the Time magazine article

2446
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:05,248
Try to mark their territory

2447
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:08,320
There's bad

2448
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:12,672
Because Kyle was super famous American

2449
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:21,376
Punisher logo

2450
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:23,168
That's being sold at people wearing

2451
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:25,472
But even beyond that the Punisher logo started

2452
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:27,776
The pop up everywhere surrounding War

2453
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:32,128
American soldiers were stenciling it on their helmets putting stickers of it on their vehicles

2454
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,152
But you know what

2455
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:34,176
It wasn't only them

2456
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:36,224
The fighters on the other side

2457
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:38,784
Isis started appropriating the logo to

2458
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:40,832
How many times do I have

2459
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:44,928
Burger King guy

2460
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:48,768
There's something unnerving about the appropriation of this particular symbol

2461
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:57,216
He is pretty f***** up tactic

2462
01:56:57,472 --> 01:56:58,240
Achieve his goals

2463
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:01,568
And the only thing that differentiates him from the villains he's up again

2464
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:03,616
Is who he's torturing and murdering

2465
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:06,432
He's a character without a finely-tuned Morales

2466
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:10,272
Not an anti-hero but an ant

2467
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:11,296
A villain

2468
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:14,112
The idea of our soldiers associated with him is

2469
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:15,136
Absolutely chilling

2470
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:16,672
And suggest

2471
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:18,208
Just get out of Foreign Wars

2472
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:21,024
We may need to abolish the armed service

2473
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:26,656
It's gone too far

2474
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:29,216
Going to put the Punisher logo on it

2475
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:32,544
It's f****** shirt already

2476
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:34,592
Murdering people without any of

2477
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:40,992
I've read tons of military blogs about this subject

2478
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:41,760
Slogo because

2479
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:43,296
It's part of the long-standing

2480
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:45,856
Every single one of them talked about how

2481
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:49,952
Specifically took the logo from the Marvel comic because he was a military celebrity

2482
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:52,256
Because he was a military celebrity

2483
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:53,024
Call Don

2484
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:55,584
Autobiography

2485
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:59,168
Are Kong's guy suggested it before the deployment

2486
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:01,472
We all thought what the

2487
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:03,008
What school he righted wrongs

2488
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,288
You killed bad guys

2489
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:06,080
Humane wrongdoers beer them

2490
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:07,616
That's what we were all about

2491
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:10,688
It made it all wrong

2492
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:11,712
With some modifications

2493
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:15,296
We spray painted on are Hummers and body armor helmets

2494
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:16,064
Guns

2495
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:18,880
We spray painted on every building and wall we could

2496
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:21,696
We wanted people to know we're here and we want to f*** with

2497
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:23,744
It was our first of psyops

2498
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:24,768
You see us

2499
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:26,304
Where the people kicking your ass

2500
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:27,328
Firoz

2501
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:28,608
Because we will kill you

2502
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:30,144
Motherfuker you're bad

2503
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:30,912
We're batter

2504
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:33,472
Assume that

2505
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:34,240
What's that

2506
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:35,776
Translates to is

2507
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:37,312
The Iraqi people viewing

2508
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:41,920
This is all pretty upsetting

2509
01:58:42,176 --> 01:58:44,480
Stop particular

2510
01:58:44,736 --> 01:58:50,880
Character creator

2511
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:54,464
Builders

2512
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:55,232
Yeah

2513
01:58:57,024 --> 01:58:58,048
He's not a good guy

2514
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:59,328
Conway told Tom

2515
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:03,168
Realty logos and none of them seem to match Alex

2516
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:05,472
Anthony makes later this episode about

2517
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:07,264
Classics.

2518
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:11,872
Eagles logo is an eagle carrying a trident

2519
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:12,640
Perched on it

2520
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:14,176
None of the specific

2521
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:14,944
Field team 7

2522
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:16,736
Insignia that are even close to a Punisher

2523
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:20,832
Mostly seals doing s*** like holding knives and writing summer

2524
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:23,136
Something logos are downright

2525
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:29,280
The Galleria in this image that Alex is reporting on The Punisher head because he likes

2526
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:33,888
He might be wearing it because he's a fan Chris Kyle he might be wearing it randomly

2527
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:35,936
It could indicate that he's in the military

2528
01:59:36,192 --> 01:59:37,216
But it certainly doesn't prove

2529
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:43,616
Absolutely just making s*** up that the Punisher logo is a seals logo

2530
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:46,944
He's doing that to strengthen his argument that the guy in the picture

2531
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:50,784
At the marathon was there on an official capacity

2532
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:53,088
Is evidence is super thick

2533
01:59:53,856 --> 01:59:54,624
And this is what you have to

2534
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:56,928
Alex knows that this evidence

2535
01:59:58,464 --> 02:00:00,512
That's why you need to work to over blow it

2536
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:03,072
Symbol that actually

2537
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:04,608
He knows what he's doing

2538
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:07,424
And even his immediate recognition of it

2539
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:08,192
He knows

2540
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:12,544
Did Chris Kyle ripped off The Punisher logo

2541
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,592
He later says the exact opposite

2542
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:19,456
The Punisher logo itself

2543
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:22,272
He completely contradicts himself later once he's had time to

2544
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:23,296
To flesh out the reading

2545
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:24,832
He's doing this

2546
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:25,600
Intentionally

2547
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:27,648
Sick

2548
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:28,416
It is that

2549
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:29,184
Same kind of thing

2550
02:00:29,696 --> 02:00:30,720
Happened with

2551
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:33,280
The Wolf of Wall Street

2552
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:36,352
AP portrait the characters

2553
02:00:36,608 --> 02:00:37,888
Absolutely

2554
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:39,680
Evil awful awful

2555
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:41,728
And then so many people are like

2556
02:00:42,496 --> 02:00:43,776
Man that guy's really cool

2557
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:46,592
People model that

2558
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:47,872
Behavior

2559
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:48,896
The Wolf of Wall

2560
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:50,688
Michaels

2561
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:55,808
Morally gray characters are really difficult for people who are all that

2562
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:57,600
Smartfren

2563
02:00:57,856 --> 02:01:01,696
Wrestle with everybody or anything like that

2564
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:03,744
People have

2565
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,024
Often times

2566
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:06,816
Without engaging with more complex

2567
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:09,120
Literature

2568
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:10,656
You end up with a back

2569
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:13,216
Charles Bronson is

2570
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:14,496
Not the good guy

2571
02:01:14,752 --> 02:01:16,800
You know.

2572
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:22,432
You understand his motivation

2573
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:29,856
People get shot

2574
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:36,256
He killed so many people who are not in that Ganges up account

2575
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:38,048
Shooting guns out of

2576
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:42,400
Third floor window

2577
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:51,616
Well I guess the police did enlist him to kill that guy

2578
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:52,640
What else

2579
02:01:52,896 --> 02:01:54,432
He's not

2580
02:01:56,736 --> 02:01:58,016
Thinks of these pictures that he's found

2581
02:01:58,272 --> 02:01:59,040
Now that he's got like

2582
02:01:59,296 --> 02:02:00,832
Involved

2583
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:01,600
Like these

2584
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:02,368
Is crack the code

2585
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:04,416
It stalled who did it

2586
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:10,304
No

2587
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:24,128
Ridgewood

2588
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:29,248
What looks like

2589
02:02:50,496 --> 02:02:56,640
You think they ever looked at those pictures already has all my gods are like so much

2590
02:02:57,664 --> 02:03:03,808
But not being accused

2591
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:09,184
Suddenly break

2592
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:10,720
Plainview

2593
02:03:10,976 --> 02:03:11,744
18 Plainview

2594
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,560
There Will Be Blood

2595
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:16,864
It's pretty

2596
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:18,400
Sad like

2597
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:21,984
Just like I know

2598
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:24,800
You have to understand

2599
02:03:25,056 --> 02:03:26,336
I say this all the

2600
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:27,872
And it comes back

2601
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:31,456
Do the stuff that Alex have llamas in the studio in 29

2602
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:32,992
Alex

2603
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:35,808
He's interested in taking these things

2604
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:37,088
Things that happened in the world

2605
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:40,672
Using them to further his agenda but primarily

2606
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:41,696
You want

2607
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:42,976
To make money

2608
02:03:43,488 --> 02:03:44,512
Yeah you can tell

2609
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:46,560
How clear

2610
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:53,728
All your data right now

2611
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:02,176
Internet

2612
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:13,440
The ratings are in

2613
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:14,720
The best ever been

2614
02:04:15,232 --> 02:04:15,744
Man

2615
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,072
Fuckingo as irresponsible as we can

2616
02:04:19,328 --> 02:04:20,352
Drudgereport

2617
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:21,632
We can't confirm

2618
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:22,912
Because it's because

2619
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:25,216
In the absence of official information

2620
02:04:25,472 --> 02:04:26,752
Infowars

2621
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:31,616
Here's to people who don't know what the game be illegitimate

2622
02:04:31,872 --> 02:04:33,664
Professional is looking website

2623
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:36,992
They have a guy whose title as editor in law at Large

2624
02:04:37,248 --> 02:04:39,552
They have a TV show a radio show

2625
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:40,320
Eat it

2626
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:44,160
Easy to trick people into thinking that this is legitimate and yes he's doing that

2627
02:04:44,672 --> 02:04:47,232
You strike while the iron is hot while there's an absence

2628
02:04:47,744 --> 02:04:49,024
A credible information

2629
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:50,816
He's injecting himself into

2630
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:51,584
To that space

2631
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:53,632
Just so clear

2632
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:57,728
What people like about how

2633
02:04:57,984 --> 02:04:58,496
Make me really anxious

2634
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:01,312
Because I see

2635
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:03,360
Iic like

2636
02:05:03,616 --> 02:05:04,384
This is working

2637
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:06,944
Alex's seeing defense strategies working

2638
02:05:07,456 --> 02:05:07,968
Naked

2639
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:08,736
Can almost

2640
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:10,016
Feel

2641
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:11,552
The deterioration

2642
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:13,600
Eastandard

2643
02:05:13,856 --> 02:05:18,976
But like the path that leads to the presentation I really feel like you're seeing a lot of them

2644
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:19,744
Beginnings

2645
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:21,792
JustBats

2646
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:22,560
Like

2647
02:05:23,072 --> 02:05:23,584
God he's

2648
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:24,864
So grateful

2649
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:25,632
To the bombers

2650
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:27,424
He's just like

2651
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:28,192
Thank you

2652
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:29,984
Thank you so much

2653
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:32,800
I mean how could he not be grateful

2654
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:40,224
He's got these

2655
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:41,248
Pictures from

2656
02:05:41,504 --> 02:05:42,528
Fortunate

2657
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:43,552
Prove something

2658
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:46,368
We put breaking the story

2659
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:47,136
It's going to

2660
02:05:47,392 --> 02:05:47,904
To be the best

2661
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:49,184
Even better than our best

2662
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:50,976
Oh my God

2663
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:55,584
Yeah I don't understand

2664
02:05:56,864 --> 02:05:57,376
But I mean come on

2665
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:59,680
If we're going to if we're going to make

2666
02:06:00,192 --> 02:06:00,960
Conspiracy theory about the

2667
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:01,984
Boston bombers

2668
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:03,520
You want to go cui Bono

2669
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:05,056
I'll tell you

2670
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:06,592
Alex Jones

2671
02:06:10,432 --> 02:06:11,968
Adjust

2672
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:13,504
Craft here

2673
02:06:15,296 --> 02:06:18,112
I see your tension in order to elevate

2674
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:23,232
How you do it without parently it works movie Just

2675
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:24,768
People like Seth MacFarlane in

2676
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:26,560
Responding to our profit

2677
02:06:26,816 --> 02:06:27,840
So let's keep doing it

2678
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:30,144
Let's blame

2679
02:06:33,728 --> 02:06:34,496
Now

2680
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,288
It comes out

2681
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:38,848
The FBI does have pictures

2682
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:39,872
Of the Peace

2683
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:41,408
Alex

2684
02:06:42,176 --> 02:06:42,944
Takes that

2685
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:43,968
Exactly

2686
02:07:00,864 --> 02:07:05,984
Model

2687
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:07,264
Under your bed

2688
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:13,664
And you have that playing at home I got I get caught

2689
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:20,320
So you've got now reporting that FBI has the other pictures believed to be the

2690
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:24,672
Joseph Watson

2691
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:27,488
Has forced them to admit that they have the pictures

2692
02:07:27,744 --> 02:07:29,792
Forecast

2693
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:30,816
Completely different picture

2694
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:32,864
And it keeps going

2695
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:41,056
No

2696
02:07:51,808 --> 02:07:52,832
Unprecedented

2697
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:58,208
So the announcement that the FBI had a picture of the suspect absolutely has nothing to do with Alex

2698
02:07:58,464 --> 02:08:00,256
To shameful coverage of these 4chan rumors

2699
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:07,168
The news had already broken by the time Alex got on his little

2700
02:08:07,424 --> 02:08:09,728
From the Lord & Taylor Outlet on Boylston

2701
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:12,800
Affect dropping a bag at the location

2702
02:08:14,848 --> 02:08:17,664
What separates this evidence from the evidence Alex

2703
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:20,736
Paddling is really the element of the person of the footage

2704
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:23,552
Dropping off a backpack at the location of the bombing

2705
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:25,344
That's a lot more compelling

2706
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:29,952
This guy looks like he's in the military is weird

2707
02:08:30,208 --> 02:08:35,072
This is another case of Alex just instantly knowing how to lie about an evolving situation

2708
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:38,912
What's the world appear to support is fake

2709
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:43,008
In his alternate reality broken this thing wide open

2710
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:46,848
Completely inconclusive pictures is British friend found on 4chan

2711
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:48,896
Wednesday

2712
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:51,200
The FBI is a picture of the suspect it only makes

2713
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:53,504
They're just doing that because Alex

2714
02:08:54,016 --> 02:08:55,040
Too close to the truth

2715
02:08:57,344 --> 02:08:58,880
It's really fascinating to watch him and ask

2716
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:01,184
Is everything is distraction

2717
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,720
Bluster and misrepresentation

2718
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:05,280
But it's also so natural to Ally

2719
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:06,816
You don't even think for a

2720
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:07,584
Second

2721
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:09,376
Suggesting the CNN is watching him

2722
02:09:09,632 --> 02:09:10,912
And the report isn't

2723
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:13,216
It just flows out of

2724
02:09:13,728 --> 02:09:15,264
There's no concern for ethics

2725
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:17,056
Answer for how this might affect his list

2726
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:18,080
It's all good

2727
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:19,104
Pandemonium in

2728
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:19,872
Sensationalism

2729
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:21,920
Anything to ask

2730
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:24,224
Good it'll lead to more traffic

2731
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:24,992
And more money

2732
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:26,016
F*** the concert

2733
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:28,064
What I'm saying

2734
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:28,832
Is there

2735
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:31,392
This is a really really bad person

2736
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:34,720
But it's crazy

2737
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:36,256
Because part of it is conscious

2738
02:09:36,512 --> 02:09:37,280
And part of it is

2739
02:09:37,792 --> 02:09:39,072
Yeah like part of it

2740
02:09:39,328 --> 02:09:39,840
Just instinct

2741
02:09:40,096 --> 02:09:40,864
Actually a bad person

2742
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:43,424
Just operate

2743
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:44,960
From a place of

2744
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:48,800
Bones

2745
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:49,568
Psychopath

2746
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:51,872
Yeah I know I ate now I want to write a

2747
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:52,640
A series of

2748
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:54,432
Call Jones

2749
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:55,200
Ben Watson

2750
02:09:56,224 --> 02:09:56,736
They always

2751
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:57,760
Catch the wrong guy and

2752
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:01,344
And they always say

2753
02:10:02,368 --> 02:10:07,232
Airbnb good Prejudice and Zombies

2754
02:10:07,488 --> 02:10:08,768
It's the same shipper

2755
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:15,168
Is Road for a while assuming that they're talking about the same thing

2756
02:10:24,128 --> 02:10:28,736
Right now

2757
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:35,136
So he gets off the phone with Paul to go make the story more sensational

2758
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:42,048
Alex thinks he scooped

2759
02:10:46,144 --> 02:10:47,424
Goddamn idiot

2760
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:48,960
Alex

2761
02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:50,496
Descends into a places

2762
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:52,800
Because of how crazy

2763
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:13,792
Can you see the guys win the backpack with the pressure cookers

2764
02:11:14,816 --> 02:11:19,168
Explosion the scraps

2765
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:28,128
It is incredible

2766
02:11:29,152 --> 02:11:31,968
Different

2767
02:11:32,224 --> 02:11:33,760
The patchy

2768
02:11:34,784 --> 02:11:37,856
This is unbelievable

2769
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:42,720
So Alex has no he's cracked the case he's figured this all out

2770
02:11:42,976 --> 02:11:43,744
Nitsa overwhelming

2771
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:45,792
He does say that

2772
02:11:55,008 --> 02:11:58,592
And just

2773
02:11:59,104 --> 02:12:05,248
Is wrong but yes

2774
02:12:08,064 --> 02:12:12,416
Like if

2775
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:15,232
You don't need to apologize

2776
02:12:15,488 --> 02:12:16,768
Retract all of this s***

2777
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:21,376
What you don't need to do is that

2778
02:12:28,032 --> 02:12:30,592
Really was this guy

2779
02:12:34,944 --> 02:12:35,968
A cover-up

2780
02:12:36,224 --> 02:12:41,344
This I mean I'm sure yeah I would imagine that he does still think he's right

2781
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,112
Such

2782
02:12:42,624 --> 02:12:43,392
Gymnastic

2783
02:12:43,648 --> 02:12:44,672
Except to go through

2784
02:12:44,928 --> 02:12:45,440
In order to

2785
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:46,208
2

2786
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:46,976
To rationalize

2787
02:12:48,256 --> 02:12:48,768
It's crazy

2788
02:12:49,024 --> 02:12:49,536
II

2789
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:50,304
You know

2790
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:51,840
Every time he gives up

2791
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:52,864
That list of life

2792
02:12:56,448 --> 02:12:56,960
I halfway

2793
02:12:57,216 --> 02:12:57,984
Expect him to

2794
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:00,032
Keeps going

2795
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:03,872
I better the pink elephants and their the cells in the sky

2796
02:13:04,128 --> 02:13:05,408
AR in my brain

2797
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:12,832
Website

2798
02:13:13,344 --> 02:13:13,856
F****** Urus

2799
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:16,928
Cam

2800
02:13:17,184 --> 02:13:21,024
Right now ladies and gentlemen

2801
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:23,328
Images of suspicious

2802
02:13:29,472 --> 02:13:33,568
This year's on

2803
02:13:33,824 --> 02:13:36,640
So the actual headline has a?

2804
02:13:37,152 --> 02:13:40,480
?

2805
02:13:40,736 --> 02:13:44,576
Over and over

2806
02:13:44,832 --> 02:13:46,880
It's an exclamation

2807
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:53,280
Huh? Is really carrying a lot of legal I think it is

2808
02:13:55,840 --> 02:14:01,472
Paul Joseph Watson later headline

2809
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:07,872
So what is kept thinking about while I was

2810
02:14:08,128 --> 02:14:09,152
Listening to

2811
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:10,176
This is like

2812
02:14:10,688 --> 02:14:12,224
You know who probably loves this

2813
02:14:12,992 --> 02:14:13,504
The bombers

2814
02:14:18,112 --> 02:14:21,440
And you were on the lamp

2815
02:14:21,696 --> 02:14:27,840
If you to do everything in their power to point the finger at somebody else

2816
02:14:28,608 --> 02:14:32,448
Phuc yea it's his great this serves my interest perfectly

2817
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:33,216
It cast

2818
02:14:33,472 --> 02:14:35,264
All kinds of Suspicion or other people

2819
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:37,312
I'm not even in the equation

2820
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:40,640
I got a thing you got to feel good

2821
02:14:40,896 --> 02:14:47,040
This is this probably provide Comfort to the actual terrorists

2822
02:14:47,296 --> 02:14:48,320
Bomber and then

2823
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:55,488
You're all geared up for getting caught you're all you got your f****** Manifesto you got everything going on

2824
02:14:55,744 --> 02:14:58,560
Worried

2825
02:14:58,816 --> 02:14:59,328
Interested in just

2826
02:14:59,584 --> 02:15:01,632
Ramrodding 12 other dude into

2827
02:15:01,888 --> 02:15:03,424
Prison and they are not going to look at any

2828
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:04,704
Anything towards you you're like

2829
02:15:05,984 --> 02:15:06,496
What's that

2830
02:15:06,752 --> 02:15:12,896
The authorities in the mainstream media aren't really saying much of anything.

2831
02:15:14,432 --> 02:15:18,784
The out right focused completely other direction

2832
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:22,368
You don't know what the FBI's actually

2833
02:15:22,624 --> 02:15:24,672
Would probably give you a feeling of

2834
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:33,376
I mean it doesn't matter I don't know how impactful it is

2835
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:36,448
On the actual FBI people probably not at all

2836
02:15:36,704 --> 02:15:39,264
Actually they all listened to a show along with

2837
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:40,800
I think you forgot that

2838
02:15:41,056 --> 02:15:43,104
The ultimate end result of this though is

2839
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:45,408
Distracting

2840
02:15:45,664 --> 02:15:46,688
Absolutely

2841
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:48,224
Great congratulations

2842
02:15:49,504 --> 02:15:50,272
But Alex

2843
02:15:50,784 --> 02:15:53,088
Even though he's wrong all the time

2844
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:54,112
Cannot emotion

2845
02:15:54,624 --> 02:15:55,648
Handle being so right

2846
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:07,424
Chris Kyle

2847
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:13,824
Guanaco

2848
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:18,176
More

2849
02:16:18,944 --> 02:16:23,296
Ladies and gentlemen

2850
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:32,512
Looks like

2851
02:16:41,984 --> 02:16:42,496
Seymour

2852
02:16:44,032 --> 02:16:46,080
Please forever

2853
02:16:46,592 --> 02:16:48,128
For good

2854
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:49,408
Forever.

2855
02:16:55,040 --> 02:17:01,184
I was just was wrong people say out loud

2856
02:17:01,952 --> 02:17:05,024
I wish it was alone

2857
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:14,752
You're not

2858
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:20,128
Play so weird

2859
02:17:20,384 --> 02:17:20,896
Raise

2860
02:17:24,736 --> 02:17:26,784
Ora Ora

2861
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:30,112
He might feel like he was

2862
02:17:30,624 --> 02:17:31,136
Actually right

2863
02:17:31,648 --> 02:17:32,672
For the first time

2864
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:33,952
And it turns out that

2865
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:34,720
The only way

2866
02:17:35,488 --> 02:17:38,560
It turns out that

2867
02:17:38,816 --> 02:17:42,144
It's so ridiculous I'm so right all the time

2868
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:44,192
Oh my God

2869
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:47,008
And also I mean like

2870
02:17:47,264 --> 02:17:48,288
I don't want to like

2871
02:17:49,056 --> 02:17:49,568
Put

2872
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:50,848
To find a point

2873
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:53,664
Very little

2874
02:17:54,432 --> 02:17:56,224
Care for anybody affected

2875
02:17:57,504 --> 02:18:00,064
There's not really any indication of

2876
02:18:01,088 --> 02:18:01,600
Empathy

2877
02:18:02,368 --> 02:18:03,136
Nope nothing

2878
02:18:03,648 --> 02:18:05,184
Is broadcaster

2879
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:06,464
Is almost devoid of

2880
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:08,512
Concern for victim survivors

2881
02:18:08,768 --> 02:18:10,304
The community of Boston

2882
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:12,608
The entire

2883
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:14,400
Reflection of a psycho

2884
02:18:15,168 --> 02:18:19,008
Earlier I think we discussed a little bit

2885
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:20,544
He's doing now

2886
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:22,080
The opposite of prediction

2887
02:18:22,336 --> 02:18:22,848
The post diction

2888
02:18:23,104 --> 02:18:25,152
Are you taking applying them to

2889
02:18:25,408 --> 02:18:26,176
To the Past

2890
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:29,504
In the middle of this one

2891
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:30,528
I'm trying to do that again

2892
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:42,048
Play when did he die

2893
02:18:42,304 --> 02:18:44,096
Blueprint over and over again

2894
02:18:44,352 --> 02:18:46,400
He told you yet before

2895
02:18:46,656 --> 02:18:48,448
I just

2896
02:18:49,472 --> 02:18:52,544
He said after work

2897
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:53,824
Don't get involved

2898
02:18:55,616 --> 02:19:00,480
Part of a drill

2899
02:19:03,552 --> 02:19:04,320
Bombs

2900
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:07,136
First off

2901
02:19:07,904 --> 02:19:09,440
Need to say that

2902
02:19:09,696 --> 02:19:10,208
To your audience

2903
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:14,816
Wow the bigger issue

2904
02:19:15,072 --> 02:19:17,888
Given this warning

2905
02:19:18,144 --> 02:19:21,984
Prior to the bombing gives him some sort of a predictive ability

2906
02:19:25,568 --> 02:19:27,872
Is just being like a if the future

2907
02:19:28,128 --> 02:19:28,896
Don't do this

2908
02:19:29,152 --> 02:19:30,176
It's a ridiculous

2909
02:19:30,432 --> 02:19:30,944
Predictions

2910
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:31,712
And then there's

2911
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:33,248
Sure

2912
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:39,904
So we learn here little bit more an update on brother who was the army guy

2913
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:41,696
Dehydration

2914
02:19:41,952 --> 02:19:42,720
Animals taken out of the race

2915
02:19:44,256 --> 02:19:45,536
There's that there's

2916
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:46,816
Which are actually not

2917
02:19:48,352 --> 02:19:52,192
What are your friends

2918
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:57,824
Marathon team

2919
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:00,640
Dehydrated

2920
02:20:00,896 --> 02:20:02,688
Finish

2921
02:20:03,968 --> 02:20:04,736
His wife

2922
02:20:06,528 --> 02:20:10,368
Wife

2923
02:20:10,624 --> 02:20:11,392
2 Days Later

2924
02:20:11,648 --> 02:20:12,416
Why would they

2925
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:15,232
Why wouldn't they

2926
02:20:15,744 --> 02:20:18,304
If I were them I wouldn't talk to you ever again

2927
02:20:18,816 --> 02:20:20,608
Like you was going on

2928
02:20:20,864 --> 02:20:21,888
Millions of listeners

2929
02:20:24,704 --> 02:20:30,080
Being pulled out of a race for dehydration or exhaustion is somehow related to a plot

2930
02:20:30,336 --> 02:20:32,128
Took murder civilians

2931
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:36,992
Why would you ever talk to that person ever again

2932
02:20:40,064 --> 02:20:41,088
Yeah that's a good long break

2933
02:20:41,344 --> 02:20:46,464
Yeah I just specially I'm not going to talk to you when I know you're going to repeat what I say

2934
02:20:46,976 --> 02:20:49,024
How dare you turn my silence

2935
02:20:49,536 --> 02:20:50,304
On speaker

2936
02:20:55,936 --> 02:20:59,520
So Furious that you would use my personal life

2937
02:21:00,032 --> 02:21:02,080
Has a way of propping up your propaganda

2938
02:21:02,848 --> 02:21:03,616
But you know what

2939
02:21:09,248 --> 02:21:10,272
And I can feel this

2940
02:21:15,136 --> 02:21:15,648
Rob

2941
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:17,696
Let It Go

2942
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:20,512
Alex now realizes

2943
02:21:22,304 --> 02:21:23,072
Weeping in Great Raid

2944
02:21:24,096 --> 02:21:25,632
But it's only going to continue

2945
02:21:25,888 --> 02:21:27,168
If we make sure

2946
02:21:27,424 --> 02:21:28,448
That everything is

2947
02:21:28,704 --> 02:21:29,984
Is as over-the-top as possible

2948
02:21:31,008 --> 02:21:32,544
Got off the phone with Paul like

2949
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:33,568
10-15 minutes

2950
02:21:33,824 --> 02:21:35,616
Prior but he needs to call Paul back

2951
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:40,992
And if those guys aren't special forces

2952
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:47,904
I don't know

2953
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:55,584
Believable

2954
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:03,264
Boston bombing

2955
02:22:04,032 --> 02:22:06,848
Denver on the, there?

2956
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:10,688
What are your points

2957
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:16,320
And he's not asking PJ dubs for his

2958
02:22:16,832 --> 02:22:18,368
This is an editorial meeting

2959
02:22:18,624 --> 02:22:24,768
Yeah he's asked me what's your take on this in order for Paul to see what he's going to put in the article and for Alex

2960
02:22:26,048 --> 02:22:27,584
Let's make this more extreme

2961
02:22:28,352 --> 02:22:29,376
And Alex

2962
02:22:29,632 --> 02:22:30,912
Blown this whole thing wide open

2963
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:32,704
It's just so sad to hear that

2964
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:37,568
Well

2965
02:22:37,824 --> 02:22:42,944
The back of that smoke cigarettes near the site of the explosion is the one carried by the

2966
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:44,480
Stereotypical

2967
02:22:44,736 --> 02:22:50,880
Disheveled

2968
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:08,288
So now we've created this like

2969
02:23:08,544 --> 02:23:10,080
It sits firmly in place

2970
02:23:10,336 --> 02:23:13,664
That there is a dialog going on between

2971
02:23:14,176 --> 02:23:20,064
Is intelligence operative

2972
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:22,624
Adjust their coverage in order to

2973
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:23,648
It's it's

2974
02:23:23,904 --> 02:23:25,952
Isn't saying the level of

2975
02:23:26,208 --> 02:23:28,256
Non reality that's being presented

2976
02:23:28,768 --> 02:23:32,096
In a very delicate situation when

2977
02:23:32,608 --> 02:23:33,120
People are

2978
02:23:34,144 --> 02:23:34,656
Freaking out

2979
02:23:34,912 --> 02:23:36,960
People are anxious there their they're

2980
02:23:39,264 --> 02:23:40,032
Almost

2981
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:42,848
Deserved it

2982
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:43,872
Make that

2983
02:23:44,384 --> 02:23:44,896
Worse

2984
02:23:45,152 --> 02:23:46,176
Yeah and also

2985
02:23:46,432 --> 02:23:46,944
2

2986
02:23:47,456 --> 02:23:50,016
Help get suspicion off of the actual bombers

2987
02:23:50,272 --> 02:23:53,344
It's kind of it's kind of Amazing Alex

2988
02:23:53,856 --> 02:23:54,368
Manage to

2989
02:23:55,392 --> 02:23:56,672
His job title in

2990
02:23:56,928 --> 02:23:57,696
Into just delusion

2991
02:23:57,952 --> 02:23:58,464
Music ranchera

2992
02:23:58,976 --> 02:24:00,256
Like here's my job

2993
02:24:00,768 --> 02:24:01,792
Delusions of grandeur

2994
02:24:02,048 --> 02:24:04,608
Certainly during the middle of

2995
02:24:04,864 --> 02:24:07,424
You've always thought that the world

2996
02:24:07,936 --> 02:24:09,472
Circulates around here

2997
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:11,520
It's just interesting to a

2998
02:24:11,776 --> 02:24:13,824
Certain measure of Granger

2999
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:15,104
Buyer only

3000
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:16,128
Having delusions

3001
02:24:16,384 --> 02:24:18,176
And you can only really

3002
02:24:18,432 --> 02:24:20,480
Creative around horrible tragedy

3003
02:24:20,736 --> 02:24:21,248
Absolutely

3004
02:24:21,504 --> 02:24:23,040
Geneva

3005
02:24:23,296 --> 02:24:24,832
Justify

3006
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:27,648
Proves your delusions

3007
02:24:27,904 --> 02:24:29,952
On a very deep emotional

3008
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:32,512
You eat

3009
02:24:32,768 --> 02:24:35,072
Yeah that's

3010
02:24:35,328 --> 02:24:37,376
He's facilitating it

3011
02:24:37,632 --> 02:24:38,144
Making it worse

3012
02:24:38,656 --> 02:24:39,680
Also this

3013
02:24:40,192 --> 02:24:40,704
Report

3014
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:41,728
Sbisd

3015
02:24:42,496 --> 02:24:43,264
Again Alex

3016
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:44,544
Without any

3017
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:45,824
Without any

3018
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:46,592
Information

3019
02:24:47,104 --> 02:24:47,616
Is

3020
02:24:47,872 --> 02:24:48,384
Dead set

3021
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:49,920
On his audience believe in

3022
02:25:17,568 --> 02:25:20,640
Tomorrow to make the announcement

3023
02:25:26,272 --> 02:25:27,040
This is ridiculous

3024
02:25:28,064 --> 02:25:29,856
He is just living in a

3025
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:34,976
Fake

3026
02:25:35,232 --> 02:25:36,000
Put work

3027
02:25:36,768 --> 02:25:40,608
Like you know what that that's the thing about it is like at least in this case

3028
02:25:40,864 --> 02:25:41,632
The Optics are

3029
02:25:41,888 --> 02:25:42,656
Versace that like

3030
02:25:43,168 --> 02:25:45,472
I get why someone listen

3031
02:25:45,984 --> 02:25:46,496
Would be true

3032
02:25:47,776 --> 02:25:50,080
Especially in the absence of real inform

3033
02:25:50,848 --> 02:25:53,920
I don't really like a lot of the time when people fall for Alex's

3034
02:25:56,480 --> 02:25:57,248
And how you believe this

3035
02:25:57,760 --> 02:25:58,784
But because of the circle

3036
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:01,088
It's around this particular instance

3037
02:26:02,112 --> 02:26:03,648
It makes way more sense

3038
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:05,440
Why people would fall for it

3039
02:26:05,696 --> 02:26:06,208
And for him

3040
02:26:06,464 --> 02:26:07,488
Play the same games

3041
02:26:07,744 --> 02:26:09,024
Movies playing in that circumstance

3042
02:26:09,536 --> 02:26:10,048
Like

3043
02:26:10,816 --> 02:26:11,840
It's just

3044
02:26:12,608 --> 02:26:13,120
Unacceptable

3045
02:26:16,448 --> 02:26:17,472
I really really resign

3046
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:20,032
CNN

3047
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:21,824
Intelligent

3048
02:26:23,872 --> 02:26:25,664
Particular

3049
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:29,248
Is

3050
02:26:29,504 --> 02:26:30,016
That

3051
02:26:30,272 --> 02:26:31,040
Empty

3052
02:26:31,296 --> 02:26:32,064
Vacuum

3053
02:26:32,832 --> 02:26:35,392
Moron of a TV announcer its

3054
02:26:35,648 --> 02:26:36,672
Secretly a

3055
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:39,744
And not just the unite

3056
02:26:41,792 --> 02:26:46,144
Israeli intelligence

3057
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:53,568
I don't really have anything to base this accusation on other than

3058
02:26:55,872 --> 02:27:00,224
Butcher was born in Germany where his parents were living at

3059
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:01,760
You were call

3060
02:27:02,016 --> 02:27:03,296
Maita Toyota

3061
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:07,648
In the United States

3062
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:09,440
He was educated

3063
02:27:09,696 --> 02:27:12,000
He went on to work for the Tel Aviv desk for reuter

3064
02:27:12,768 --> 02:27:15,072
You work for an international news wire in Israel

3065
02:27:15,328 --> 02:27:18,912
And is Jewish there's no proof

3066
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:24,032
This is a blatant Act of anti-Semitism and divided loyalties

3067
02:27:24,288 --> 02:27:27,104
Around

3068
02:27:27,616 --> 02:27:28,640
This is pretty

3069
02:27:29,664 --> 02:27:30,432
This is just

3070
02:27:32,736 --> 02:27:36,320
So Alex

3071
02:27:37,088 --> 02:27:38,880
The military contractors

3072
02:27:39,136 --> 02:27:40,160
Spies and what-have-you

3073
02:27:40,416 --> 02:27:41,440
And you found the pants

3074
02:27:41,952 --> 02:27:43,232
The day is going to be

3075
02:27:43,744 --> 02:27:45,024
Multiple paths

3076
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:46,816
Because you've got the Middle Eastern option

3077
02:27:47,072 --> 02:27:50,400
And you got the good old boy option whichever way they want to go

3078
02:27:50,912 --> 02:27:51,680
Alex believe

3079
02:27:51,936 --> 02:27:56,032
But he's figured this out and once they reveal the information that the FBI

3080
02:27:56,288 --> 02:27:57,312
They're going to frame

3081
02:27:59,104 --> 02:28:05,248
Oh my God

3082
02:28:16,512 --> 02:28:21,120
We're about to see him hard

3083
02:28:22,912 --> 02:28:24,960
Reality

3084
02:28:28,288 --> 02:28:29,824
Not compared to what's coming up

3085
02:28:30,336 --> 02:28:33,408
So Alex is really trying to make clear to his audience

3086
02:28:33,664 --> 02:28:35,968
That there is that two-way communication but

3087
02:28:37,504 --> 02:28:39,040
Keyboard something cnnsi

3088
02:28:39,552 --> 02:28:43,648
Respond and it's important because it really elevates the idea that what he saying memes

3089
02:28:44,416 --> 02:28:45,184
And he's right

3090
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:46,720
And the globalist

3091
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,048
I noticed within five minutes of us announce

3092
02:28:53,376 --> 02:28:56,192
Department store in another one

3093
02:28:56,704 --> 02:28:58,752
And they have identified

3094
02:29:06,688 --> 02:29:10,272
Boston.com

3095
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:46,368
Alternate possibility completely different

3096
02:29:48,416 --> 02:29:50,976
So I mean not even

3097
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:54,560
So they're different

3098
02:29:57,888 --> 02:30:04,032
Second reality he thinks that he's in this situation is full of Espionage and Israeli intelligence

3099
02:30:05,568 --> 02:30:10,944
Pictures on Fortune

3100
02:30:12,736 --> 02:30:13,760
And listen to this

3101
02:30:14,016 --> 02:30:15,296
But this is crazy the way he

3102
02:30:15,552 --> 02:30:16,320
A present 4chan

3103
02:30:17,344 --> 02:30:22,720
Your website

3104
02:30:22,976 --> 02:30:27,072
Twitter Facebook news channel

3105
02:30:27,328 --> 02:30:28,864
Cam

3106
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:32,192
Hours ago

3107
02:30:32,704 --> 02:30:36,288
Adjusted

3108
02:30:36,544 --> 02:30:37,824
It's definitely all there

3109
02:30:43,456 --> 02:30:44,992
It's a big hacker website

3110
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:47,552
As opposed to being a place where

3111
02:30:47,808 --> 02:30:49,344
People anonymously post

3112
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:50,112
Bulshit

3113
02:30:50,368 --> 02:30:50,880
Yeah

3114
02:30:51,392 --> 02:30:55,232
Anonymous

3115
02:30:57,024 --> 02:31:01,888
I think that's what I'm talking about

3116
02:31:02,144 --> 02:31:03,168
To some extent I guess

3117
02:31:03,424 --> 02:31:04,192
Channels

3118
02:31:04,448 --> 02:31:05,472
Much less about it

3119
02:31:05,728 --> 02:31:07,520
There are a lot of different boards

3120
02:31:07,776 --> 02:31:08,288
On there

3121
02:31:08,544 --> 02:31:14,688
Right now those different it's all like one

3122
02:31:14,944 --> 02:31:15,968
Thing is dumb

3123
02:31:17,504 --> 02:31:20,064
And also because of the anonymity and because of

3124
02:31:21,856 --> 02:31:23,904
Serta people who gravitate towards step

3125
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:28,512
People who want to talk or can't do it about

3126
02:31:28,768 --> 02:31:33,888
Like a lot of it has to be taken is like this is not by itself credible information

3127
02:31:35,936 --> 02:31:37,728
A site and all this because

3128
02:31:37,984 --> 02:31:39,776
It also lends the idea that

3129
02:31:40,032 --> 02:31:42,336
Like this is all credible information

3130
02:31:43,872 --> 02:31:45,664
Found information

3131
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:46,688
And it's not

3132
02:31:46,944 --> 02:31:48,224
It's just random bulshit that's

3133
02:31:48,480 --> 02:31:48,992
But Audible

3134
02:31:49,248 --> 02:31:50,528
Dum Dums on the internet

3135
02:31:50,784 --> 02:31:52,576
I'm just saying I cannot

3136
02:31:52,832 --> 02:31:54,112
Understand why he would

3137
02:31:54,368 --> 02:31:57,440
Make that jump is like he's going to the f****** anime forums

3138
02:31:57,696 --> 02:31:58,464
Know you know

3139
02:31:58,720 --> 02:31:59,744
He doesn't f****** know

3140
02:32:01,024 --> 02:32:07,168
He's decided that hillbilly guy who called the r-word earlier is that at

3141
02:32:07,424 --> 02:32:08,192
Designated Patsy

3142
02:32:08,704 --> 02:32:10,496
Sure Alex decides to

3143
02:32:10,752 --> 02:32:12,032
Did you send it to

3144
02:32:12,544 --> 02:32:13,568
Fairly expensive

3145
02:32:13,824 --> 02:32:17,152
Reenactment of how that guy got roped into the drill

3146
02:32:21,248 --> 02:32:22,528
You're in the Army now

3147
02:32:22,784 --> 02:32:24,576
When is you for National Security

3148
02:32:27,392 --> 02:32:28,928
You're going to fight for America now

3149
02:32:29,184 --> 02:32:32,000
What

3150
02:32:36,096 --> 02:32:38,144
You're going to get $5,000 billion

3151
02:32:38,656 --> 02:32:40,192
America

3152
02:32:47,104 --> 02:32:49,920
Thorazine

3153
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:53,248
That's the end of it

3154
02:33:10,400 --> 02:33:15,520
For shopping

3155
02:33:15,776 --> 02:33:19,616
It's disgusting and none of that is real

3156
02:33:19,872 --> 02:33:20,640
Who's f****** fantasy

3157
02:33:22,688 --> 02:33:24,480
He's disseminating his sick

3158
02:33:25,248 --> 02:33:25,760
As proof

3159
02:33:26,016 --> 02:33:26,528
To his audio

3160
02:33:27,296 --> 02:33:27,808
That's gross

3161
02:33:29,344 --> 02:33:32,160
So he's mad now

3162
02:33:32,672 --> 02:33:38,304
Sure he broke the story about the unfortunate

3163
02:33:39,072 --> 02:33:39,584
FedEx

3164
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:40,352
It's happening

3165
02:33:41,376 --> 02:33:41,888
Similar

3166
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:43,680
Haha

3167
02:33:44,704 --> 02:33:47,264
Why why are we having a fake fight with somebody who's not pay

3168
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:48,288
Paying attention

3169
02:33:48,544 --> 02:33:50,848
That we think is always paying attention

3170
02:33:51,104 --> 02:33:53,152
It's so stupid

3171
02:33:53,408 --> 02:33:54,688
Is actually wear

3172
02:33:54,944 --> 02:33:55,456
CNN

3173
02:33:55,712 --> 02:33:56,992
Makes their critical mist

3174
02:33:58,016 --> 02:34:00,064
Any photos

3175
02:34:02,368 --> 02:34:03,904
5 minutes

3176
02:34:32,576 --> 02:34:37,184
From Fox

3177
02:34:37,952 --> 02:34:41,024
Stretch

3178
02:34:52,544 --> 02:34:55,360
Founding fathers

3179
02:34:55,616 --> 02:35:01,760
Patriots are going to blow you off

3180
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:07,136
Marathon

3181
02:35:26,336 --> 02:35:27,872
They might change their plans

3182
02:35:28,128 --> 02:35:31,968
Getting yourself out of yourself

3183
02:35:32,480 --> 02:35:34,528
The right there at the end

3184
02:35:34,784 --> 02:35:35,296
The full of s***

3185
02:35:35,808 --> 02:35:39,392
They may get out of jail free card

3186
02:35:39,648 --> 02:35:44,768
That's in preparing his audience for literally all evidence to be completely opposite of what he's yelling at them

3187
02:35:45,024 --> 02:35:49,120
Open the door naive enough to believe that the difference in reality and Alex's narrative

3188
02:35:49,376 --> 02:35:52,192
Is due to the globalist in immediate danger the story cuz Alex

3189
02:35:52,448 --> 02:35:52,960
Right

3190
02:35:53,728 --> 02:35:55,264
It's a sad pathetic

3191
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:57,056
Dambal that no one would make

3192
02:35:57,312 --> 02:35:58,336
Gambit

3193
02:35:58,592 --> 02:36:00,640
Excuse me that no one would make unless they know

3194
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:04,480
Once the dust settles I'm going to be wrong about that

3195
02:36:04,992 --> 02:36:09,344
It's that it's like the metaphor that I always make about the wet concrete

3196
02:36:09,856 --> 02:36:12,160
And being able to write your initials in it

3197
02:36:12,416 --> 02:36:12,928
Intellidrive

3198
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:17,280
Is the actress someone who recognizes that they can't do s*** ones get concrete

3199
02:36:17,536 --> 02:36:20,608
If you have to prepare for eventually that concrete

3200
02:36:21,888 --> 02:36:23,424
What are they

3201
02:36:23,936 --> 02:36:24,448
Or whatever

3202
02:36:25,216 --> 02:36:26,496
Like I said

3203
02:36:26,752 --> 02:36:30,080
This is one of the biggest f*** ups that the media was absolutely guilty of

3204
02:36:30,336 --> 02:36:31,360
Cinnabon

3205
02:36:31,616 --> 02:36:32,128
My coverage

3206
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:34,944
CNN reported that one suspect had been arrested

3207
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:37,504
Based on information allegedly from three sources

3208
02:36:38,272 --> 02:36:41,600
From there a lot of other outlets picked up on the story and reported that news

3209
02:36:41,856 --> 02:36:43,904
Or at least reported the CNN was reporting

3210
02:36:44,672 --> 02:36:46,208
As we know this was not true

3211
02:36:46,464 --> 02:36:51,840
Nancy and I was forced to make a retraction which really hurt the media's image and a time when they needed it the most

3212
02:36:52,352 --> 02:36:53,120
She was anxious

3213
02:36:53,376 --> 02:36:54,912
Boston particularly so

3214
02:36:55,168 --> 02:36:56,192
It's the media's jobs

3215
02:36:56,448 --> 02:37:00,288
To convey the information to people needs a f****** is a really bad luck

3216
02:37:01,568 --> 02:37:02,848
CNN turned out to be wrong

3217
02:37:03,104 --> 02:37:04,896
And I think they should have been more cautious

3218
02:37:05,152 --> 02:37:06,944
But ultimately

3219
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:08,480
And retracted the story and apology

3220
02:37:09,248 --> 02:37:15,392
It's fairly easy to see how this mistake could be made by people who meant well but didn't double and triple check info that was coming from

3221
02:37:15,648 --> 02:37:17,440
Sources they presumably

3222
02:37:17,952 --> 02:37:19,488
Even if you can see how the sort of thing

3223
02:37:19,744 --> 02:37:21,280
Could happen it doesn't take away

3224
02:37:21,536 --> 02:37:23,072
How much of an unnecessary

3225
02:37:23,328 --> 02:37:24,096
Egregious error

3226
02:37:25,376 --> 02:37:26,656
Here we're witnessing Alex

3227
02:37:27,168 --> 02:37:27,936
Use his phrasing

3228
02:37:28,192 --> 02:37:29,728
Piss all over reality

3229
02:37:29,984 --> 02:37:31,264
As it relates to the bombing

3230
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:35,616
He's never going to apologize for being wrong about literally every aspect that I've heard of this

3231
02:37:36,384 --> 02:37:36,896
He doesn't have

3232
02:37:37,408 --> 02:37:38,688
He's a liar by trade

3233
02:37:38,944 --> 02:37:42,016
So you give a s*** when he's completely completely f**** up a story

3234
02:37:42,528 --> 02:37:48,160
We have to retract a major story like this in the midst of a very high-profile ongoing situation

3235
02:37:48,416 --> 02:37:52,512
What happens if the Alex is being given a perfect opportunity to attack the media

3236
02:37:52,768 --> 02:37:54,560
I pretend like they're always wrong

3237
02:37:54,816 --> 02:37:56,608
And by extension he's always right

3238
02:37:57,376 --> 02:38:03,520
Of course Alex is always right when's the last time you heard a story

3239
02:38:03,776 --> 02:38:04,288
Story that's

3240
02:38:05,056 --> 02:38:06,592
Listen to episodes

3241
02:38:06,848 --> 02:38:09,920
I'm starting to be able to see the spin happening like in Matrix bullet

3242
02:38:10,944 --> 02:38:12,480
You just know how it's going to play out

3243
02:38:12,736 --> 02:38:18,112
They're going to retract the story about the arrest and he's too hot on their heels

3244
02:38:19,136 --> 02:38:19,648
Yet it's just

3245
02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:22,464
It's crazy it's absolutely crazy and it's

3246
02:38:22,976 --> 02:38:25,024
Stabbed

3247
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:25,792
Was

3248
02:38:26,048 --> 02:38:26,816
Precious with the reporter

3249
02:38:27,072 --> 02:38:27,584
Yeah

3250
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:32,192
I understand why

3251
02:38:33,728 --> 02:38:34,240
It doesn't

3252
02:38:35,008 --> 02:38:36,032
Make it

3253
02:38:36,544 --> 02:38:39,360
Horrible acts of recording but the circumstances

3254
02:38:39,616 --> 02:38:41,152
Has turned out to be that the effective

3255
02:38:41,408 --> 02:38:41,920
Was

3256
02:38:42,432 --> 02:38:43,968
Awful

3257
02:38:44,224 --> 02:38:44,992
It's f***** up

3258
02:38:45,504 --> 02:38:46,016
Because

3259
02:38:46,784 --> 02:38:49,088
In the sentence the same thing as

3260
02:38:49,344 --> 02:38:50,112
Somebody saying it's

3261
02:38:50,368 --> 02:38:50,880
There's going

3262
02:38:51,136 --> 02:38:52,672
To be a there's going to be a school shooting

3263
02:38:53,184 --> 02:38:53,696
Coming up

3264
02:38:53,952 --> 02:38:56,000
It's like saying that the media is going to

3265
02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:58,048
Sooner or later there

3266
02:38:58,816 --> 02:39:00,608
Right and you've already set this

3267
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:02,656
For the one mistake they make

3268
02:39:03,168 --> 02:39:03,680
Is every

3269
02:39:04,704 --> 02:39:07,520
Other than

3270
02:39:08,288 --> 02:39:11,872
What is going to f******

3271
02:39:14,432 --> 02:39:14,944
Deal with that

3272
02:39:16,736 --> 02:39:18,528
Flagellating themselves over

3273
02:39:18,784 --> 02:39:20,064
A fuk up is only going to

3274
02:39:20,320 --> 02:39:21,344
Play into that right

3275
02:39:23,136 --> 02:39:25,440
Flagellating is not necessarily

3276
02:39:25,696 --> 02:39:31,584
Post-mortems dissection wrong absolute how to improve

3277
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:32,608
Media criticism

3278
02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:35,424
It'll read a bunch of articles about

3279
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:38,752
This likes her looking back on what went wrong and what went right

3280
02:39:39,008 --> 02:39:39,776
During discovery

3281
02:39:41,312 --> 02:39:42,336
That really healthy

3282
02:39:42,592 --> 02:39:43,872
Ecosystems

3283
02:39:44,384 --> 02:39:45,664
Engaged

3284
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:46,688
Never

3285
02:39:47,968 --> 02:39:50,272
And it's just no

3286
02:39:51,296 --> 02:39:52,832
Big game

3287
02:39:53,088 --> 02:39:55,392
In terms of his stuff

3288
02:39:56,672 --> 02:39:59,744
Like it's hard to also wrestle that joint 19 where you

3289
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:01,280
So many different shops

3290
02:40:01,536 --> 02:40:03,584
Yeah they are so similar to Alex

3291
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:05,632
Where is back then he was

3292
02:40:07,424 --> 02:40:07,936
Still on this

3293
02:40:08,192 --> 02:40:08,704
Seth rich

3294
02:40:09,472 --> 02:40:12,288
Naat 2013

3295
02:40:14,848 --> 02:40:15,360
The Oath Keepers

3296
02:40:18,176 --> 02:40:19,968
He's on the phone there's another

3297
02:40:20,224 --> 02:40:20,736
Who's on there

3298
02:40:23,552 --> 02:40:24,064
Episode

3299
02:40:25,856 --> 02:40:28,416
Spoiled for the two-week moratorium

3300
02:40:28,672 --> 02:40:30,208
They're presenting as

3301
02:40:30,464 --> 02:40:31,232
It's just

3302
02:40:31,744 --> 02:40:32,256
Attack on the Earth

3303
02:40:34,048 --> 02:40:35,584
This narrative almost complete

3304
02:40:35,840 --> 02:40:36,864
Completely blows up

3305
02:40:37,120 --> 02:40:37,632
On air

3306
02:40:37,888 --> 02:40:38,912
Because Alex

3307
02:40:40,192 --> 02:40:43,776
If other events had their permits pulled

3308
02:40:44,288 --> 02:40:45,824
Houses

3309
02:40:47,872 --> 02:40:48,384
Delaware

3310
02:40:52,992 --> 02:40:55,040
Dozens and dozens of different

3311
02:40:55,296 --> 02:40:57,344
Terraria

3312
02:41:01,952 --> 02:41:04,512
America

3313
02:41:08,864 --> 02:41:09,888
Story

3314
02:41:11,936 --> 02:41:17,824
From what I gather now on the counter protesters that were demonstrating against us

3315
02:41:20,128 --> 02:41:23,200
Counter protest

3316
02:41:23,456 --> 02:41:25,248
Some reason

3317
02:41:29,088 --> 02:41:32,416
Counter protest my pro-gun rally that's not going to be happening anymore

3318
02:41:33,696 --> 02:41:38,560
What about the other events on April 19th

3319
02:41:39,328 --> 02:41:41,120
What's the re-enactment took place

3320
02:41:41,376 --> 02:41:43,680
The past Monday they do it early

3321
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:49,056
So that's awesome

3322
02:41:59,296 --> 02:42:02,368
YouTube

3323
02:42:02,624 --> 02:42:05,952
This is just incredible

3324
02:42:06,464 --> 02:42:06,976
So

3325
02:42:07,232 --> 02:42:07,744
Being

3326
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:14,144
Specific things that already happened

3327
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:19,520
Other events absolutely did have ever talked about any other event

3328
02:42:19,776 --> 02:42:25,920
Scheduled for the 18th 19th 20th 21st

3329
02:42:26,176 --> 02:42:27,968
Where was everybody

3330
02:42:28,736 --> 02:42:31,040
That almost fell apart so hard

3331
02:42:31,296 --> 02:42:33,856
Even see it

3332
02:42:34,624 --> 02:42:36,160
That would kind of hurt our argument

3333
02:42:36,928 --> 02:42:38,464
Yeah the only reason he asked it

3334
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:40,000
It was so you would say

3335
02:42:40,512 --> 02:42:41,792
No and it's just us

3336
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:46,144
You didn't let there were notes but don't

3337
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:47,680
Sprite

3338
02:42:47,936 --> 02:42:51,520
And that other guy who's not the roads like on the game

3339
02:42:51,776 --> 02:42:52,288
Who is that guy

3340
02:42:52,800 --> 02:42:58,944
Is the guy from Massachusetts

3341
02:43:01,504 --> 02:43:02,528
But I don't know exact

3342
02:43:03,296 --> 02:43:03,808
I don't care

3343
02:43:04,576 --> 02:43:09,440
Civil War talk from the right wing

3344
02:43:11,232 --> 02:43:13,792
They've always been talking

3345
02:43:45,536 --> 02:43:46,560
The last 6 years

3346
02:43:46,816 --> 02:43:47,328
People in this

3347
02:43:47,584 --> 02:43:48,608
These communities

3348
02:43:48,864 --> 02:43:51,424
These media ecosystems have been

3349
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:57,824
And believing that we are in a cold Civil War

3350
02:43:58,080 --> 02:44:00,128
It's going to

3351
02:44:00,896 --> 02:44:03,456
They've been preparing for this

3352
02:44:03,712 --> 02:44:05,504
Shift in rhetoric whenever

3353
02:44:08,576 --> 02:44:12,160
You know that's it's not it's not a new phenomenon

3354
02:44:12,416 --> 02:44:14,464
Tell them the truth which is that they're a bunch of

3355
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:19,840
F****** cowards who are afraid of any kind of

3356
02:44:21,376 --> 02:44:24,192
And they're not going to do anything because

3357
02:44:25,728 --> 02:44:26,752
That's what they can't be

3358
02:44:27,264 --> 02:44:30,336
Can have a rally on Lexington Green without a permit

3359
02:44:30,592 --> 02:44:31,360
That's okay

3360
02:44:32,384 --> 02:44:32,896
So

3361
02:44:33,664 --> 02:44:35,712
Alex

3362
02:44:37,248 --> 02:44:37,760
He said this

3363
02:44:38,016 --> 02:44:39,296
I realized we were in

3364
02:44:40,576 --> 02:44:44,928
Thousands of thoughts racing through my mind as I am

3365
02:44:54,912 --> 02:44:55,936
Shut up

3366
02:44:56,448 --> 02:44:58,240
Open the phone shop for

3367
02:45:00,800 --> 02:45:04,384
Alex wants hearsay from listener the right

3368
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:06,176
Is going to come in and give his two step

3369
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:07,968
He is becoming

3370
02:45:08,224 --> 02:45:08,992
Very

3371
02:45:10,784 --> 02:45:11,808
Broadcast

3372
02:45:13,856 --> 02:45:14,368
I don't know how

3373
02:45:14,624 --> 02:45:15,648
To put it is a fucken load

3374
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:19,488
What what you end up bringing to the table

3375
02:45:19,744 --> 02:45:20,256
Is

3376
02:45:22,304 --> 02:45:24,096
I don't I don't know how to

3377
02:45:26,912 --> 02:45:27,680
He's lucky

3378
02:45:28,448 --> 02:45:29,728
Quite Frank

3379
02:45:29,984 --> 02:45:30,496
Okay

3380
02:45:32,288 --> 02:45:33,312
Okay

3381
02:45:33,824 --> 02:45:34,592
And we'll get to that

3382
02:45:35,104 --> 02:45:35,616
Steve shows up

3383
02:45:36,640 --> 02:45:42,784
So Alex has declared victory over the media has retracted the right

3384
02:45:43,296 --> 02:45:44,064
Reporting

3385
02:45:44,320 --> 02:45:46,112
And he starts

3386
02:46:06,335 --> 02:46:07,871
Yikes

3387
02:46:12,735 --> 02:46:13,503
I feel

3388
02:46:14,015 --> 02:46:18,111
Sure he's wrong about everything but

3389
02:46:18,367 --> 02:46:23,743
To crank I do love that sort of jaunty

3390
02:46:23,999 --> 02:46:24,511
Nonsense

3391
02:46:25,791 --> 02:46:31,679
Yeah part of this could easily be explained by him repeatedly says he's not 2 hours of

3392
02:46:32,447 --> 02:46:34,239
So part of a lot of this

3393
02:46:34,751 --> 02:46:38,335
The really terrible work right by like I haven't

3394
02:46:38,591 --> 02:46:44,735
Go to you right that don't exist

3395
02:46:44,991 --> 02:46:48,319
Andrew w.k. we're cranking it up all day

3396
02:46:50,111 --> 02:46:50,623
Justice

3397
02:46:52,415 --> 02:46:54,463
So Alex

3398
02:46:54,719 --> 02:46:56,255
Sing a lot about this

3399
02:46:58,815 --> 02:46:59,327
No

3400
02:46:59,839 --> 02:47:00,607
No

3401
02:47:00,863 --> 02:47:01,887
Gallows humor

3402
02:47:11,615 --> 02:47:14,687
Your ancestors

3403
02:47:20,063 --> 02:47:22,879
Alex

3404
02:47:24,159 --> 02:47:28,767
Godspeed

3405
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:32,351
That's what you do my daughter what you do

3406
02:47:32,607 --> 02:47:36,447
Yourself

3407
02:47:41,311 --> 02:47:43,359
Alex is like brain and his

3408
02:47:43,615 --> 02:47:44,383
Conception of God

3409
02:47:45,919 --> 02:47:52,063
Even is rational

3410
02:47:52,575 --> 02:47:53,343
For being

3411
02:47:54,111 --> 02:47:57,951
54 laughing on-air somehow wind up with him back at the end being like

3412
02:47:58,463 --> 02:47:59,999
And that's why I'm happy about this

3413
02:48:04,095 --> 02:48:07,679
Even if you're bored

3414
02:48:07,935 --> 02:48:09,471
Human way to do Ruby

3415
02:48:09,983 --> 02:48:12,799
This is an absolute awful awful situation

3416
02:48:13,055 --> 02:48:15,615
These people lost their lives but lost loved ones

3417
02:48:15,871 --> 02:48:17,151
The city is traumatized

3418
02:48:17,919 --> 02:48:19,711
It doesn't make up for that

3419
02:48:19,967 --> 02:48:20,479
But at least

3420
02:48:20,735 --> 02:48:24,319
Through this we were able to find evidence of government machination

3421
02:48:24,575 --> 02:48:25,087
Usher Yeah

3422
02:48:25,343 --> 02:48:28,671
Honoring the Warriors lost

3423
02:48:28,927 --> 02:48:31,999
While at the same time trying to make your anti-government argument

3424
02:48:32,255 --> 02:48:33,279
Possible

3425
02:48:33,535 --> 02:48:34,559
And he doesn't do that

3426
02:48:35,839 --> 02:48:37,375
Because he doesn't care

3427
02:48:37,631 --> 02:48:40,703
It's not Gallows humor give a f*** about this

3428
02:48:40,959 --> 02:48:42,239
No one is going on

3429
02:48:42,495 --> 02:48:43,519
After a sukkah

3430
02:48:43,775 --> 02:48:45,311
Mass shooting and then being like

3431
02:48:46,847 --> 02:48:48,895
When do we get to Texarkana

3432
02:48:49,151 --> 02:48:50,943
Are we all excited about this

3433
02:48:51,199 --> 02:48:52,223
That would kind of be the office

3434
02:48:54,271 --> 02:48:55,295
So Alex

3435
02:48:55,551 --> 02:48:57,599
Earlier this is a really important

3436
02:48:57,855 --> 02:48:59,391
Things to do whenever you're trying to process

3437
02:49:00,415 --> 02:49:02,719
If you have an idea about something

3438
02:49:02,975 --> 02:49:03,743
You need to do

3439
02:49:03,999 --> 02:49:05,791
Is consider alternate possibility

3440
02:49:06,559 --> 02:49:09,887
And I do from there that is really easy

3441
02:49:11,167 --> 02:49:11,679
First step

3442
02:49:14,495 --> 02:49:17,311
What else could explain this phenomenon that I'm seeing

3443
02:49:17,823 --> 02:49:18,591
It's just like

3444
02:49:18,847 --> 02:49:19,359
You learn this

3445
02:49:19,615 --> 02:49:20,127
Junior High

3446
02:49:20,639 --> 02:49:21,919
High School

3447
02:49:22,175 --> 02:49:23,967
It's pretty simple stuff

3448
02:49:27,551 --> 02:49:29,599
Imply that he

3449
02:49:29,855 --> 02:49:30,367
He has done that

3450
02:49:42,143 --> 02:49:42,911
Clairol my God

3451
02:49:50,591 --> 02:49:54,431
The other guy

3452
02:49:54,687 --> 02:49:58,271
Now you're off

3453
02:49:58,527 --> 02:50:00,063
Taunting the New World Order

3454
02:50:00,319 --> 02:50:01,855
Wow wow

3455
02:50:04,415 --> 02:50:05,183
Try harder

3456
02:50:05,439 --> 02:50:10,815
He's not here

3457
02:50:11,327 --> 02:50:13,887
He's not capable of actually trying because

3458
02:50:14,143 --> 02:50:14,655
Trying

3459
02:50:15,167 --> 02:50:15,935
Is hard

3460
02:50:16,191 --> 02:50:21,055
Is really hard if he were to portray any of the things that he's covering in an honest fashion

3461
02:50:21,311 --> 02:50:24,383
Like I don't even think most of his audience would find a compelling

3462
02:50:24,639 --> 02:50:25,919
Because

3463
02:50:26,175 --> 02:50:26,687
Oh

3464
02:50:26,943 --> 02:50:28,735
Find me a obviously an explanation

3465
02:50:30,015 --> 02:50:32,575
That isn't doesn't match your paranoid anti-government

3466
02:50:33,087 --> 02:50:33,599
Like

3467
02:50:34,623 --> 02:50:35,647
He knows that he doesn't have a

3468
02:50:35,903 --> 02:50:37,695
Place in the world in the computer fries

3469
02:50:38,463 --> 02:50:41,023
The only the only

3470
02:50:42,047 --> 02:50:43,071
That's this is the result

3471
02:50:44,607 --> 02:50:50,239
Needs to try with that either Lowe's from him like a memory

3472
02:50:54,079 --> 02:50:56,383
He gets a caller who is

3473
02:50:57,151 --> 02:50:57,919
Huge break

3474
02:50:58,175 --> 02:51:03,039
This is regarding buttface radio transmission at the time of the bombing

3475
02:51:03,551 --> 02:51:05,087
You can find it by searching

3476
02:51:05,343 --> 02:51:06,111
Blondie

3477
02:51:07,903 --> 02:51:09,695
Marathon

3478
02:51:10,463 --> 02:51:13,023
Brio

3479
02:51:14,047 --> 02:51:15,583
Bl0g

3480
02:51:15,839 --> 02:51:17,631
GOG

3481
02:51:18,143 --> 02:51:19,423
Don't say that

3482
02:51:19,679 --> 02:51:20,703
Marathon

3483
02:51:20,959 --> 02:51:21,471
Police

3484
02:51:21,983 --> 02:51:22,495
Radio

3485
02:51:25,055 --> 02:51:27,103
The police radio with the timestamp

3486
02:51:27,359 --> 02:51:31,711
Goes from calm business-as-usual to an officer breaking in tennis

3487
02:51:32,991 --> 02:51:34,783
Definitely devices here

3488
02:51:35,039 --> 02:51:36,063
I need officers

3489
02:51:36,319 --> 02:51:38,111
Definitely definitely devices here

3490
02:51:41,951 --> 02:51:45,279
Explosion

3491
02:51:45,535 --> 02:51:47,839
Infowars.com

3492
02:51:48,351 --> 02:51:49,887
Don't need to do it

3493
02:51:50,143 --> 02:51:54,239
Because Blog Dog Boston police scanner is good enough Alex

3494
02:51:54,495 --> 02:51:55,775
Finds this

3495
02:51:56,543 --> 02:52:00,639
Unfortunately it does explode right in front of their eyes

3496
02:52:01,407 --> 02:52:06,271
Boston Marathon bombing police radio

3497
02:52:12,927 --> 02:52:18,303
Explosion he goes right to death

3498
02:52:18,815 --> 02:52:19,583
Obviously

3499
02:52:25,727 --> 02:52:27,007
Gallows humor

3500
02:52:30,079 --> 02:52:31,103
Something

3501
02:52:31,871 --> 02:52:38,015
Dogs looking over the guys front page from around this time is reporting is mostly just reposting

3502
02:52:40,319 --> 02:52:44,159
So this means that kind of a feedback loop that situation

3503
02:52:44,415 --> 02:52:48,767
Open the recording app

3504
02:52:49,023 --> 02:52:51,839
Stumbled onto the bombs in his truck to alert people that their device

3505
02:52:52,607 --> 02:52:53,375
Is important

3506
02:52:54,399 --> 02:52:56,447
Isn't she saying this is like the first

3507
02:52:56,703 --> 02:52:57,727
Reporting officer

3508
02:52:57,983 --> 02:52:59,263
This is before the explosion

3509
02:53:00,031 --> 02:53:04,895
It's just a noble cop was not part of the drill realizes something is

3510
02:53:05,407 --> 02:53:08,735
However if you listen to Alex he's clearly contradicted this narrative already

3511
02:53:08,991 --> 02:53:10,271
The first bomb went off

3512
02:53:10,527 --> 02:53:11,551
2:49 p.m.

3513
02:53:11,807 --> 02:53:13,087
And the second was 14 sec

3514
02:53:14,367 --> 02:53:16,927
Alex just gave was 251

3515
02:53:17,951 --> 02:53:19,743
Is it 2 minutes after the explosion

3516
02:53:19,999 --> 02:53:22,815
This is not the first reporting of the bombing on police radio

3517
02:53:23,071 --> 02:53:23,583
It's a case of

3518
02:53:23,839 --> 02:53:26,143
Found another

3519
02:53:26,399 --> 02:53:29,727
Makes total sense to hear on a police scanner in the aftermath of something like that

3520
02:53:30,239 --> 02:53:31,519
You don't know what's going on

3521
02:53:32,031 --> 02:53:34,335
You can't be too careful about the possibility that there might be

3522
02:53:34,591 --> 02:53:35,103
Bmore bombs

3523
02:53:35,615 --> 02:53:36,383
If you find something

3524
02:53:36,639 --> 02:53:38,431
Pictures of course you're going to call it in and get some

3525
02:53:38,687 --> 02:53:42,015
That's all that's going on here is

3526
02:53:42,271 --> 02:53:44,063
Blog dog this collar and Alex

3527
02:53:44,319 --> 02:53:46,111
Did the proof of their downfall swag Theory

3528
02:53:47,647 --> 02:53:50,975
This narrative is further complicated though because I realized

3529
02:53:51,231 --> 02:53:52,255
Clip

3530
02:53:54,047 --> 02:53:56,863
What is after the bomb

3531
02:53:58,655 --> 02:53:59,935
It's being a thing where this place is

3532
02:54:00,191 --> 02:54:04,031
On the police radio proves that the police have foreknowledge of what to look for

3533
02:54:04,543 --> 02:54:06,847
I would argue that the two bombs that just died

3534
02:54:07,103 --> 02:54:08,895
With or without any preparation

3535
02:54:09,407 --> 02:54:11,199
If you're the protector of Public Safety

3536
02:54:11,711 --> 02:54:12,479
I think you invited

3537
02:54:12,735 --> 02:54:13,759
Immediately

3538
02:54:14,015 --> 02:54:15,551
With or without anyone telling you

3539
02:54:15,807 --> 02:54:17,855
Keep your eyes out for anything that looks like a bomb

3540
02:54:18,367 --> 02:54:19,135
There's no prepping

3541
02:54:20,415 --> 02:54:22,463
Natural reaction that you would expect to see

3542
02:54:22,975 --> 02:54:24,255
You know what else you expect

3543
02:54:25,279 --> 02:54:25,791
Professionals

3544
02:54:26,303 --> 02:54:31,679
So the other people on the police radio aren't going to be yelling like

3545
02:54:32,703 --> 02:54:35,007
They're trained to handle crazy that

3546
02:54:35,263 --> 02:54:36,031
How to

3547
02:54:37,567 --> 02:54:38,335
How is this woman

3548
02:54:39,103 --> 02:54:45,247
You know you have some dress

3549
02:54:46,527 --> 02:54:49,087
It's like what how do you hold so many

3550
02:54:49,343 --> 02:54:50,623
Things in your head at a time when

3551
02:54:51,903 --> 02:54:52,415
Actually

3552
02:54:52,927 --> 02:54:53,951
There's a

3553
02:54:54,207 --> 02:54:54,975
Remote

3554
02:54:55,231 --> 02:54:55,743
Course

3555
02:54:55,999 --> 02:54:57,023
For driving on block.

3556
02:54:57,279 --> 02:54:58,559
Okay well that's good

3557
02:55:03,167 --> 02:55:03,679
Riesling

3558
02:55:04,447 --> 02:55:06,751
So I basically just formed this narrative

3559
02:55:09,567 --> 02:55:11,103
He is leading the world

3560
02:55:11,359 --> 02:55:12,895
In terms of Boston bombing

3561
02:55:13,151 --> 02:55:13,663
Coverage

3562
02:55:14,175 --> 02:55:18,527
I'm just blown away because you're on the break

3563
02:55:51,295 --> 02:55:52,319
Is it world

3564
02:56:04,095 --> 02:56:04,607
Spetsnaz

3565
02:56:05,631 --> 02:56:07,679
So this is the space that he's living in

3566
02:56:07,935 --> 02:56:14,079
This is a crazy you're listening to a guy

3567
02:56:14,335 --> 02:56:14,847
Like

3568
02:56:15,615 --> 02:56:16,127
Really

3569
02:56:16,895 --> 02:56:20,991
I mean we can hear it right this is a paranoid delusion

3570
02:56:21,503 --> 02:56:22,783
Presenting

3571
02:56:23,039 --> 02:56:25,087
Paranoid delusion in order to make yourself more

3572
02:56:29,183 --> 02:56:30,719
Groundbreaking stuff

3573
02:56:30,975 --> 02:56:33,023
Cit

3574
02:56:33,279 --> 02:56:33,791
He's being sincere

3575
02:56:34,047 --> 02:56:34,559
Cedar here

3576
02:56:34,815 --> 02:56:35,583
Mainly because

3577
02:56:35,839 --> 02:56:37,375
Is for somebody who has broken

3578
02:56:44,031 --> 02:56:49,663
20 years old

3579
02:56:49,919 --> 02:56:53,759
Pittsboro Way by thinking he might actually be right one time

3580
02:56:54,015 --> 02:56:59,135
I think I did alternative explanation for that could be found in a clip with Paul or he's talking about how the traffic is

3581
02:56:59,391 --> 02:57:05,535
Is through the roof I got to figure out exactly how to maximize

3582
02:57:05,791 --> 02:57:06,815
Elements are falling into

3583
02:57:07,071 --> 02:57:08,863
Really work towards

3584
02:57:09,119 --> 02:57:11,679
The narratives that I need to build to maximize traffic

3585
02:57:11,935 --> 02:57:12,959
Whatever

3586
02:57:13,471 --> 02:57:14,495
Assertive

3587
02:57:15,007 --> 02:57:16,287
Sincerity that you're hearing

3588
02:57:16,543 --> 02:57:22,431
Could be sincerity on

3589
02:57:23,199 --> 02:57:23,711
But it's

3590
02:57:23,967 --> 02:57:24,735
Almost certainly one

3591
02:57:24,991 --> 02:57:25,503
One of the two

3592
02:57:25,759 --> 02:57:31,903
It's definitely not the listening in right now

3593
02:57:32,159 --> 02:57:35,743
Media coverage

3594
02:57:36,255 --> 02:57:38,303
As if that would as if he could run the

3595
02:57:39,071 --> 02:57:39,839
If it wasn't

3596
02:57:42,911 --> 02:57:43,935
Is Alex Jones

3597
02:57:44,447 --> 02:57:44,959
Perhaps

3598
02:57:45,471 --> 02:57:48,543
What actually happened during the bombing

3599
02:57:51,615 --> 02:57:52,639
He's making all of this up

3600
02:57:53,663 --> 02:57:59,807
I don't know how they're going to get around now

3601
02:58:21,567 --> 02:58:22,079
Backpacks

3602
02:58:22,335 --> 02:58:24,127
It's

3603
02:58:28,735 --> 02:58:32,319
There's nothing to basis on other than I just came up with

3604
02:58:35,903 --> 02:58:37,695
In order for everybody to hang their black back

3605
02:58:39,487 --> 02:58:39,999
This is

3606
02:58:40,511 --> 02:58:41,023
Did I

3607
02:58:41,279 --> 02:58:42,303
He's just making

3608
02:58:48,191 --> 02:58:48,703
Absolutely

3609
02:58:48,959 --> 02:58:50,751
He's losing his mind.

3610
02:58:51,007 --> 02:58:51,519
Yeah

3611
02:58:51,775 --> 02:58:52,543
Yeah this is nuts

3612
02:58:53,311 --> 02:58:57,663
Responsible

3613
02:58:59,199 --> 02:59:00,223
Like the motive

3614
02:59:00,479 --> 02:59:04,831
A motor very clearly

3615
02:59:05,599 --> 02:59:07,135
But the other motive is

3616
02:59:07,391 --> 02:59:08,415
How you present

3617
02:59:08,927 --> 02:59:09,695
What is happening

3618
02:59:12,511 --> 02:59:13,791
And this is where we get to that

3619
02:59:14,303 --> 02:59:14,815
Alex

3620
02:59:15,071 --> 02:59:15,839
Stop that

3621
02:59:16,863 --> 02:59:17,375
Is

3622
02:59:17,631 --> 02:59:18,399
Barriers box

3623
02:59:39,903 --> 02:59:46,047
This is out of control what is it

3624
02:59:46,303 --> 02:59:47,071
This is

3625
02:59:47,327 --> 02:59:52,191
What this is the culmination of Alex's prophecies about them blowing stuff up

3626
02:59:52,703 --> 02:59:53,727
The Patriots

3627
02:59:54,495 --> 02:59:57,311
If you believe that Ben Warren is on

3628
03:00:09,087 --> 03:00:09,855
How are you

3629
03:00:13,951 --> 03:00:15,231
Is the beginning of all of it

3630
03:00:15,487 --> 03:00:16,767
The globalist

3631
03:00:18,303 --> 03:00:22,143
If your Prime for the narratives that Alex is put into the world

3632
03:00:23,423 --> 03:00:24,447
This is a call

3633
03:00:24,959 --> 03:00:26,495
This is a call to

3634
03:00:26,751 --> 03:00:27,263
4

3635
03:00:29,311 --> 03:00:34,943
I know he's not in one clip but it's almost impossible to escape that as the conclusion

3636
03:00:35,199 --> 03:00:41,343
If this is the big one this is this is this is the beginning of the globalist

3637
03:00:42,367 --> 03:00:43,647
What are you prescribing

3638
03:00:45,183 --> 03:00:45,951
Queer

3639
03:00:46,463 --> 03:00:47,743
Well I mean the good news is

3640
03:00:49,791 --> 03:00:50,559
But

3641
03:00:50,815 --> 03:00:51,839
Kind of shows

3642
03:00:52,095 --> 03:00:52,607
His audience

3643
03:00:55,935 --> 03:00:56,703
There are

3644
03:00:56,959 --> 03:01:00,287
War percentage

3645
03:01:00,543 --> 03:01:01,823
He's got millions upon Millions

3646
03:01:02,079 --> 03:01:02,591
Good listeners

3647
03:01:05,407 --> 03:01:05,919
Suck it

3648
03:01:06,687 --> 03:01:08,479
Ridiculous Infowars base terror attack

3649
03:01:09,247 --> 03:01:10,527
I mean you've seen enough

3650
03:01:10,783 --> 03:01:12,319
Yeah right

3651
03:01:12,575 --> 03:01:14,111
Now that Fox News is calling

3652
03:01:14,623 --> 03:01:15,135
Civil War how much

3653
03:01:15,903 --> 03:01:16,415
Civil War

3654
03:01:16,671 --> 03:01:17,183
We're going to have

3655
03:01:18,207 --> 03:01:18,719
Probably

3656
03:01:19,231 --> 03:01:20,767
Yeah I don't think we need to get like

3657
03:01:21,023 --> 03:01:21,791
2 descending into

3658
03:01:22,047 --> 03:01:22,559
To those

3659
03:01:22,815 --> 03:01:23,327
Steri-fab

3660
03:01:26,143 --> 03:01:28,447
So this caller that Alex is talking

3661
03:01:28,703 --> 03:01:29,215
To hear

3662
03:01:31,263 --> 03:01:31,775
This guy's really dumb

3663
03:01:32,543 --> 03:01:33,567
These callers today are

3664
03:01:33,823 --> 03:01:34,335
Real talk

3665
03:01:34,847 --> 03:01:36,895
And this one actually

3666
03:01:37,407 --> 03:01:38,687
Is relevant to our larger

3667
03:01:38,943 --> 03:01:39,455
Investigation

3668
03:01:39,711 --> 03:01:40,479
The Sandy Hook one

3669
03:01:40,991 --> 03:01:42,015
Alex how are you

3670
03:01:47,647 --> 03:01:49,695
Montego Rochelle

3671
03:01:50,207 --> 03:01:51,999
About the whole Sandy Hook thing now

3672
03:01:52,255 --> 03:01:53,535
This whole

3673
03:01:54,047 --> 03:01:54,815
What's going on

3674
03:01:57,119 --> 03:01:59,167
Sandy Hook thing deeper

3675
03:01:59,423 --> 03:02:02,495
And I found that deer quiz gas company bought

3676
03:02:03,519 --> 03:02:05,823
And 2009 blowout the city of Sandy Hook

3677
03:02:06,847 --> 03:02:08,895
Steak and I can soda Newtown

3678
03:02:09,407 --> 03:02:11,967
I found out my deep searching was

3679
03:02:12,735 --> 03:02:14,527
Nobody has lived in Sandy Hook

3680
03:02:14,783 --> 03:02:17,087
Past 3 years if you go in the US Census interact

3681
03:02:17,343 --> 03:02:17,855
Map

3682
03:02:18,623 --> 03:02:19,903
Truck places on interact

3683
03:02:20,159 --> 03:02:20,671
Map

3684
03:02:21,439 --> 03:02:21,951
And then

3685
03:02:22,463 --> 03:02:24,255
Zoom into Newtown

3686
03:02:24,511 --> 03:02:27,327
Iucu Newtown on the westside of I-84

3687
03:02:27,839 --> 03:02:28,351
Light up

3688
03:02:28,607 --> 03:02:30,143
On the right side of

3689
03:02:30,399 --> 03:02:31,935
I-84 Nissan

3690
03:02:32,959 --> 03:02:36,799
Asia population wipe it all

3691
03:02:37,055 --> 03:02:43,199
They put out

3692
03:02:43,455 --> 03:02:46,527
Marathon

3693
03:02:57,279 --> 03:02:57,791
Will t-shirt

3694
03:02:58,303 --> 03:03:01,119
So first of all it's not a city

3695
03:03:01,375 --> 03:03:03,167
A-Town it's a village with in Newtown

3696
03:03:03,679 --> 03:03:09,823
When does guys looking at the US Census interactive population

3697
03:03:10,335 --> 03:03:13,151
To the granular level of villages

3698
03:03:13,919 --> 03:03:15,199
New China's population

3699
03:03:15,455 --> 03:03:15,967
Blade witch

3700
03:03:16,223 --> 03:03:16,991
Contains the residence of

3701
03:03:17,247 --> 03:03:17,759
The village of sand

3702
03:03:18,527 --> 03:03:19,295
There's nothing suspicious

3703
03:03:19,551 --> 03:03:20,063
About this unless

3704
03:03:20,319 --> 03:03:20,831
You're very dumb

3705
03:03:21,343 --> 03:03:22,879
We're trying to make an argument that's not base

3706
03:03:23,135 --> 03:03:23,647
Reality

3707
03:03:23,903 --> 03:03:24,927
We just call her is one of the

3708
03:03:26,463 --> 03:03:28,767
What are you talkin about with the Iroquois

3709
03:03:29,023 --> 03:03:30,303
Is that they built a 1.6

3710
03:03:30,559 --> 03:03:32,863
Six-mile stretch of underground pipeline through Sandy Hook

3711
03:03:33,119 --> 03:03:35,679
In order to provide additional gas to the northeast of

3712
03:03:36,703 --> 03:03:38,751
This was proposed in 2007

3713
03:03:39,007 --> 03:03:41,823
Find a Newtown Bee article discussing this suggest

3714
03:03:42,079 --> 03:03:42,591
How to plant

3715
03:03:43,103 --> 03:03:47,199
If you do look up that article you'll find that this plan was to build not a new pipeline

3716
03:03:47,455 --> 03:03:52,319
What's the building additional pipeline to supplement the one they'd already built back in 1989

3717
03:03:52,575 --> 03:03:53,855
Which finish Construction in night

3718
03:03:54,111 --> 03:03:54,623
1591

3719
03:03:55,391 --> 03:04:01,023
So the big issue that they ran into wasn't there were a number of houses that have been built in the area since night

3720
03:04:01,279 --> 03:04:01,791
1891

3721
03:04:02,047 --> 03:04:05,631
That would make it almost impossible to just wanted to build another stretch of pipe

3722
03:04:06,143 --> 03:04:07,423
And in order to do so

3723
03:04:07,679 --> 03:04:08,191
They would quote

3724
03:04:08,447 --> 03:04:10,495
Need to purchase land

3725
03:04:10,751 --> 03:04:11,263
From about 6

3726
03:04:13,055 --> 03:04:15,103
The Uruguay gas company didn't buy out the villages

3727
03:04:15,871 --> 03:04:20,223
Had to pay off a couple landowners in order to get permissions to build this pipeline stuff

3728
03:04:20,991 --> 03:04:22,015
There's no truth or evidence

3729
03:04:24,575 --> 03:04:25,599
But this isn't

3730
03:04:25,855 --> 03:04:26,623
Example of Alex

3731
03:04:27,903 --> 03:04:29,439
He has no idea what this caller is talking

3732
03:04:29,951 --> 03:04:31,999
His credit he doesn't pretend that he does

3733
03:04:32,511 --> 03:04:33,791
Which is weird

3734
03:04:34,047 --> 03:04:35,071
However

3735
03:04:35,327 --> 03:04:36,095
Not to his credit

3736
03:04:36,607 --> 03:04:38,655
How much is responsive possible

3737
03:04:44,543 --> 03:04:47,871
Ability to critically assess this information from

3738
03:04:48,127 --> 03:04:49,663
A caller is something

3739
03:04:55,039 --> 03:04:57,343
Is a really bad sign for his coverage moving forward

3740
03:04:58,111 --> 03:05:00,159
I really don't know I think that

3741
03:05:00,671 --> 03:05:01,951
Indicates an openness

3742
03:05:02,463 --> 03:05:02,975
To these

3743
03:05:03,231 --> 03:05:05,791
Large-scale conspiracies about Sandy Hook

3744
03:05:06,047 --> 03:05:07,583
One of those

3745
03:05:07,839 --> 03:05:11,935
Prefab towns that they used to test nuclear weapons on in the desert

3746
03:05:12,191 --> 03:05:12,703
Tomato nose

3747
03:05:12,959 --> 03:05:16,031
You know how you want to dress

3748
03:05:17,055 --> 03:05:17,823
So now Jordan

3749
03:05:19,871 --> 03:05:20,383
Really

3750
03:05:21,151 --> 03:05:21,663
Haley dumb

3751
03:05:23,199 --> 03:05:25,503
You want to believe in slime

3752
03:05:29,087 --> 03:05:30,879
Ford really gullible a really delicious

3753
03:05:31,903 --> 03:05:33,695
Like at the root of it if someone with

3754
03:05:33,951 --> 03:05:35,743
Yeah cuz it's misrepresenting

3755
03:05:36,255 --> 03:05:36,767
Fact

3756
03:05:37,023 --> 03:05:39,839
Like this person didn't look into the Iroquois Gas Company

3757
03:05:40,095 --> 03:05:42,399
And then find that they bought the city out

3758
03:05:43,167 --> 03:05:44,447
What

3759
03:05:44,703 --> 03:05:45,215
Blog post

3760
03:05:45,471 --> 03:05:47,007
About this misrepresented

3761
03:05:47,263 --> 03:05:48,287
The land-use

3762
03:05:48,799 --> 03:05:49,567
That were bought

3763
03:05:49,823 --> 03:05:51,871
Are you still working

3764
03:05:52,127 --> 03:05:54,431
Yeah he probably found a blog post by like James Tracey

3765
03:05:54,687 --> 03:05:55,967
Yeah

3766
03:05:56,223 --> 03:05:56,735
That's more than

3767
03:05:56,991 --> 03:05:57,759
Paul Joseph Watson

3768
03:05:58,015 --> 03:05:58,527
Did regarding

3769
03:05:58,783 --> 03:05:59,295
The weather

3770
03:05:59,551 --> 03:06:00,063
Sure

3771
03:06:00,575 --> 03:06:01,087
Savannah Jordan

3772
03:06:02,111 --> 03:06:02,623
Everything goes

3773
03:06:02,879 --> 03:06:04,415
Terribly wrong

3774
03:06:04,671 --> 03:06:05,951
Steve pieczenik shows up

3775
03:06:06,207 --> 03:06:09,023
Oh boy

3776
03:06:09,279 --> 03:06:11,839
Brianna is freaking out about what else is going on

3777
03:06:46,399 --> 03:06:48,959
Even I come

3778
03:06:49,215 --> 03:06:51,263
The same conclusion ironically

3779
03:06:52,799 --> 03:06:53,823
Oh boy

3780
03:06:54,335 --> 03:06:58,431
Steve is validating all of this but

3781
03:06:58,687 --> 03:07:00,479
Conclusion

3782
03:07:00,991 --> 03:07:01,759
Different angle

3783
03:07:03,039 --> 03:07:03,807
Explain his anger

3784
03:07:04,319 --> 03:07:05,855
But listen to this clip very carefully

3785
03:07:06,367 --> 03:07:07,647
Because both

3786
03:07:09,183 --> 03:07:09,695
Are making

3787
03:07:09,951 --> 03:07:11,743
Maybe too much of a point

3788
03:07:11,999 --> 03:07:14,047
Pretending that they haven't talked off air

3789
03:07:14,559 --> 03:07:20,703
Pretty consistent in Steve's appearances

3790
03:07:21,471 --> 03:07:23,519
One of the reasons why I called you yet

3791
03:07:24,543 --> 03:07:29,919
I didn't see any of the point you know I didn't have the advantage you that on the video but this is what I wrote

3792
03:07:30,431 --> 03:07:31,711
And it's not it's not

3793
03:07:32,479 --> 03:07:38,623
Different from what you said

3794
03:07:45,023 --> 03:07:51,167
What happened to Bush and Obama and the US military for the tortures of 9/11

3795
03:07:52,703 --> 03:07:56,543
Reported on the same day as the Boston Massacre

3796
03:07:57,055 --> 03:08:03,199
At the level just below but nobody read it it was in the New York Times

3797
03:08:04,223 --> 03:08:06,271
Using Bush jr.

3798
03:08:06,527 --> 03:08:11,135
Can Obama war crimes equivalent

3799
03:08:11,647 --> 03:08:15,231
Japanese internment during WWII

3800
03:08:15,743 --> 03:08:21,119
Mayan psychologically

3801
03:08:21,375 --> 03:08:25,215
You and I came to the same conclusion

3802
03:08:25,471 --> 03:08:27,519
I don't see your blog post from him

3803
03:08:27,775 --> 03:08:31,103
For predicting this only after yeah

3804
03:08:32,127 --> 03:08:34,431
Reports about torture that came out

3805
03:08:34,687 --> 03:08:35,199
In April 20

3806
03:08:40,319 --> 03:08:41,087
Need to figure it out

3807
03:08:44,927 --> 03:08:46,463
Regardless of what you was talking about

3808
03:08:46,719 --> 03:08:51,327
His main point is that he believes the Boston bombing was a false flag because there was a

3809
03:08:51,583 --> 03:08:57,471
Committee that just decided the people carrying out the war on terror war crimes

3810
03:08:57,727 --> 03:09:01,567
Has the bombing was made to make sure no one noticed the reporting on this report

3811
03:09:02,335 --> 03:09:03,103
What are the reports

3812
03:09:03,359 --> 03:09:05,663
To put out by a nonprofit called the center for victims

3813
03:09:05,919 --> 03:09:06,431
Torture

3814
03:09:06,687 --> 03:09:07,967
And nothing I'm going to say is my

3815
03:09:08,223 --> 03:09:10,271
Impugn their you have no

3816
03:09:10,527 --> 03:09:11,551
Steve

3817
03:09:11,807 --> 03:09:13,599
You know it's not related to them at all

3818
03:09:13,855 --> 03:09:15,903
From what I can tell their group mission

3819
03:09:16,159 --> 03:09:20,255
Is the fight against the use of torture and further to establish centers were survivors of torture

3820
03:09:20,511 --> 03:09:21,279
Rehabilitate

3821
03:09:21,535 --> 03:09:23,327
And hopefully get back to a normal happy life

3822
03:09:23,839 --> 03:09:26,911
I don't know what time about them as an organization but from everything I can try this

3823
03:09:27,167 --> 03:09:28,447
Seem like I'm doing really important work

3824
03:09:28,959 --> 03:09:30,239
4 people very much in need of

3825
03:09:31,263 --> 03:09:36,383
Is there report that advocates for stopping torture and for Congress to fund rehabilitation program victims

3826
03:09:37,151 --> 03:09:38,431
It is not the reports

3827
03:09:44,575 --> 03:09:50,719
It's more widespread than just

3828
03:09:54,815 --> 03:09:55,583
So I consulted

3829
03:09:56,863 --> 03:09:58,655
Like I said

3830
03:09:58,911 --> 03:10:01,215
It's a report that was released by the Constitution

3831
03:10:01,471 --> 03:10:03,007
In Project

3832
03:10:04,031 --> 03:10:04,543
I don't like that

3833
03:10:05,055 --> 03:10:08,639
It's titled the report of the Constitution project task force on

3834
03:10:09,663 --> 03:10:12,735
This again is a report that was released by a nonprofit advocacy

3835
03:10:12,991 --> 03:10:15,295
But Steve is literally calling it an indictment

3836
03:10:15,807 --> 03:10:16,831
That kind of language is so

3837
03:10:17,087 --> 03:10:17,855
Sloppy for someone

3838
03:10:18,111 --> 03:10:21,951
I guess you could say that it's indicting their behavior in the court of public

3839
03:10:22,975 --> 03:10:24,767
This is not a government or legal product

3840
03:10:25,279 --> 03:10:27,071
Go on to say

3841
03:10:27,583 --> 03:10:33,727
This is an indictment that will lead to them being arrested

3842
03:10:34,751 --> 03:10:37,823
Criminal indictment

3843
03:10:38,591 --> 03:10:40,127
The whole f****** Criminal

3844
03:10:40,639 --> 03:10:42,431
This report is 600 pages

3845
03:10:42,687 --> 03:10:46,783
And I don't believe that for one second Alex or Steve even got the page 9

3846
03:10:47,807 --> 03:10:49,087
They just reported tortured

3847
03:10:49,343 --> 03:10:52,927
Besides connected to the bombing as a motive for the false flag and it's Off to the Races

3848
03:10:54,207 --> 03:10:55,487
And I didn't choose page 9 Ram

3849
03:10:56,767 --> 03:10:58,559
If they got the page 9 they would have found this

3850
03:10:59,327 --> 03:10:59,839
Quote

3851
03:11:00,095 --> 03:11:05,983
This report was supported in part by grants from the Atlantic philanthropies open Society Foundation open

3852
03:11:06,239 --> 03:11:07,519
Proteus fund

3853
03:11:07,775 --> 03:11:09,055
Rockefeller Brothers fund

3854
03:11:09,823 --> 03:11:12,895
This report was funded by grants from Soros and the rockets

3855
03:11:14,431 --> 03:11:16,735
If there's a string pullers of people like Obama and Bush

3856
03:11:16,991 --> 03:11:18,527
A report into

3857
03:11:18,783 --> 03:11:23,903
Have to pull off a false flag to cover up once it's going to be released

3858
03:11:24,159 --> 03:11:26,719
That seems like a level of self-defeating bulshit

3859
03:11:26,975 --> 03:11:28,767
The kind of invalidates this entire argument

3860
03:11:31,327 --> 03:11:33,887
Well that

3861
03:11:34,143 --> 03:11:40,287
We talked about any organizational types probably murdering people as we speak

3862
03:11:40,543 --> 03:11:46,687
Eyebrows for sure project is largely funded by grants from store

3863
03:11:46,943 --> 03:11:47,967
Of course

3864
03:11:48,223 --> 03:11:50,271
This makes complete

3865
03:11:50,527 --> 03:11:51,039
Why

3866
03:11:53,855 --> 03:11:54,879
The f****** Grant

3867
03:11:55,903 --> 03:11:57,439
F****** report

3868
03:11:58,719 --> 03:11:59,231
Good

3869
03:11:59,743 --> 03:12:01,023
To get away with being lazy

3870
03:12:01,279 --> 03:12:03,327
That's so much work they would have had to

3871
03:12:03,583 --> 03:12:04,863
Change their narrative

3872
03:12:07,167 --> 03:12:12,031
This much work for me to get 25.

3873
03:12:13,823 --> 03:12:17,663
Kim 99

3874
03:12:17,919 --> 03:12:19,199
None of this is to say

3875
03:12:19,455 --> 03:12:20,223
Anything

3876
03:12:20,479 --> 03:12:20,991
Against

3877
03:12:21,759 --> 03:12:23,551
Investigating the torture that

3878
03:12:26,623 --> 03:12:32,767
Steve

3879
03:12:33,023 --> 03:12:37,887
Supposed to report 100% disagree and I do believe

3880
03:12:39,423 --> 03:12:41,471
Attention away from the conversation

3881
03:12:43,519 --> 03:12:44,287
Festiva

3882
03:12:44,543 --> 03:12:46,335
Supposedly trying to bring

3883
03:12:46,591 --> 03:12:47,359
Light

3884
03:12:49,919 --> 03:12:52,991
Cover up your torture you got away with it and a half

3885
03:12:53,247 --> 03:12:54,015
The people were like

3886
03:12:54,527 --> 03:12:55,039
Go

3887
03:12:56,575 --> 03:12:59,135
Also in December 2014.

3888
03:12:59,391 --> 03:13:04,255
Committee released a report which actually more possibility of putting people in legal Jeopardy

3889
03:13:08,607 --> 03:13:09,887
Weird

3890
03:13:11,167 --> 03:13:13,727
Weirdo kind of like all this is bulshit made up

3891
03:13:15,519 --> 03:13:16,543
So anyway

3892
03:13:18,079 --> 03:13:21,663
And Alex go on the motive

3893
03:13:21,919 --> 03:13:22,431
For the bomb

3894
03:13:22,943 --> 03:13:25,759
Earlier Alex found the culprit

3895
03:13:26,015 --> 03:13:30,111
He isn't conversation telepathically with CNN or whatever

3896
03:13:30,367 --> 03:13:31,647
I know they have the motive

3897
03:13:32,671 --> 03:13:34,207
Am I heard Fox News

3898
03:13:41,887 --> 03:13:43,423
To torture and cover it up

3899
03:13:59,039 --> 03:14:05,183
Obama and Bush jr. in prison

3900
03:14:05,439 --> 03:14:05,951
Legitimate

3901
03:14:06,207 --> 03:14:12,351
In the world of counterterrorism they would be so-called neutralized or didn't put in prison

3902
03:14:12,863 --> 03:14:13,631
No they wouldn't

3903
03:14:14,399 --> 03:14:14,911
This is

3904
03:14:19,007 --> 03:14:20,799
Please put out this report

3905
03:14:21,055 --> 03:14:22,847
This is not a legal indictment anyway

3906
03:14:23,103 --> 03:14:24,639
Good people in government

3907
03:14:24,895 --> 03:14:26,175
Because these weren't people in government

3908
03:14:26,687 --> 03:14:28,991
It might have been people who had past careers

3909
03:14:29,247 --> 03:14:31,807
In government they might have been former

3910
03:14:32,063 --> 03:14:34,111
People in Congress or

3911
03:14:34,367 --> 03:14:35,903
It's a lot of lawyers

3912
03:14:36,671 --> 03:14:38,975
And stuff and it's funded by Soros

3913
03:14:39,231 --> 03:14:40,767
God I feel like I'm

3914
03:14:42,047 --> 03:14:44,095
Given a Viewpoint into like

3915
03:14:44,351 --> 03:14:45,119
The coke fuel

3916
03:14:45,375 --> 03:14:46,399
Night that they wrote back to

3917
03:14:47,423 --> 03:14:52,287
You know

3918
03:14:55,871 --> 03:15:02,015
I don't know why

3919
03:15:03,295 --> 03:15:06,623
Jesus Christ what all you need and it's like I told you

3920
03:15:06,879 --> 03:15:10,207
Lizard man

3921
03:15:10,463 --> 03:15:11,743
You got you got to keep moving

3922
03:15:11,999 --> 03:15:15,327
You got to build this in fast route you're a fallen that f****** water

3923
03:15:15,583 --> 03:15:16,863
You take at 2nd

3924
03:15:17,119 --> 03:15:18,655
Two critically read this

3925
03:15:18,911 --> 03:15:19,423
Report

3926
03:15:22,495 --> 03:15:23,519
Everything falls apart

3927
03:15:24,287 --> 03:15:24,799
Now

3928
03:15:25,055 --> 03:15:26,335
The good guys in government

3929
03:15:27,103 --> 03:15:28,127
Is very reminiscent

3930
03:15:29,151 --> 03:15:30,431
The counter-coup narrative

3931
03:15:30,687 --> 03:15:32,479
B d pechenik pulled on Alex

3932
03:15:32,735 --> 03:15:36,063
In 2015 to help ease his way into supporting Trump

3933
03:15:36,575 --> 03:15:39,647
What do you know there's a counter-coup going on in 2013

3934
03:15:55,007 --> 03:15:59,615
Correct this is exactly right Alex and that's what we've been saying all along

3935
03:16:00,383 --> 03:16:02,175
You haven't Saginaw long

3936
03:16:02,431 --> 03:16:04,479
Pre-show interview question if I ever heard

3937
03:16:04,991 --> 03:16:10,367
He has been saying it all along and he continues to say forever and you just

3938
03:16:10,879 --> 03:16:11,647
These theaters

3939
03:16:12,415 --> 03:16:13,439
It's always this

3940
03:16:14,463 --> 03:16:15,487
It doesn't change

3941
03:16:15,743 --> 03:16:18,047
There's a counter-coup going on

3942
03:16:18,303 --> 03:16:19,583
In 2013

3943
03:16:19,839 --> 03:16:21,631
There's a counter-coup going on

3944
03:16:21,887 --> 03:16:27,775
In 2050 you just pretend it's not the exact same bulshit you say all along

3945
03:16:28,031 --> 03:16:28,799
It's broke

3946
03:16:34,431 --> 03:16:34,943
Indictment

3947
03:16:35,199 --> 03:16:39,039
It's going to put people in prison but it's covered up by Bob and Bob

3948
03:16:39,295 --> 03:16:44,415
Coalition, the basic story of the indictment

3949
03:16:44,671 --> 03:16:47,487
Junior and two presidents have

3950
03:16:47,743 --> 03:16:48,767
Brookline

3951
03:16:51,839 --> 03:16:55,935
I would have incarcerated

3952
03:16:56,191 --> 03:16:57,983
Because nobody even listen to it

3953
03:16:58,751 --> 03:17:00,287
So do you got this

3954
03:17:00,799 --> 03:17:01,311
Verbally

3955
03:17:01,567 --> 03:17:07,711
Normal firmly in place from a very reputable source

3956
03:17:07,967 --> 03:17:08,735
President

3957
03:17:08,991 --> 03:17:10,015
Commit war crimes

3958
03:17:10,271 --> 03:17:10,783
For Christ's sake

3959
03:17:12,575 --> 03:17:13,855
Yeah

3960
03:17:14,623 --> 03:17:15,647
So

3961
03:17:15,903 --> 03:17:18,207
Yeah we've already had Alex say this is the big one

3962
03:17:18,463 --> 03:17:19,999
The globalist defensive his Bugatti

3963
03:17:20,511 --> 03:17:25,887
We've had Stewart Road leader of a paramilitary organization

3964
03:17:26,143 --> 03:17:29,727
I save it

3965
03:17:29,983 --> 03:17:31,007
It's going to turn hot

3966
03:17:31,519 --> 03:17:32,287
Westie

3967
03:17:33,055 --> 03:17:39,199
Internally

3968
03:17:39,455 --> 03:17:45,087
Exactly as I said before

3969
03:17:45,599 --> 03:17:48,415
And I think the New York Times has been exceedingly

3970
03:17:49,951 --> 03:17:55,583
And signifying how much of a

3971
03:17:56,607 --> 03:18:00,703
Establishments

3972
03:18:01,215 --> 03:18:04,031
Exactly

3973
03:18:04,287 --> 03:18:08,639
The false flag sneaking showing at the guys like me

3974
03:18:09,663 --> 03:18:11,711
Fix the newspapers talking to it

3975
03:18:11,967 --> 03:18:17,855
Alex communication with Sienna

3976
03:18:18,111 --> 03:18:24,255
Read the articles in the newspaper editors are placing them there to send hidden messages

3977
03:18:24,511 --> 03:18:27,839
Like as I'm assuming that

3978
03:18:31,679 --> 03:18:33,215
That they are communicating to him

3979
03:18:34,751 --> 03:18:35,263
By hidden

3980
03:18:36,031 --> 03:18:37,055
The paper

3981
03:18:37,823 --> 03:18:38,335
Yeah

3982
03:18:38,591 --> 03:18:39,103
Lll

3983
03:18:39,359 --> 03:18:45,247
Article about this sub this constitution project paper

3984
03:18:46,015 --> 03:18:47,039
His message

3985
03:18:49,855 --> 03:18:51,647
So just everybody zodiac

3986
03:18:51,903 --> 03:18:53,695
He's everybody's the Zodiac Killer

3987
03:18:54,207 --> 03:18:54,719
And Steve's B

3988
03:18:55,231 --> 03:18:55,743
Cool

3989
03:18:55,999 --> 03:18:57,023
These are deluge

3990
03:18:57,279 --> 03:19:00,607
Real information

3991
03:19:01,119 --> 03:19:03,423
To a vulnerable and gullible audio

3992
03:19:03,679 --> 03:19:05,471
Wow this is Joey response

3993
03:19:05,983 --> 03:19:06,751
And it gets so much

3994
03:19:07,007 --> 03:19:10,847
More irresponsible as Steve starts talking about what we need to do

3995
03:19:18,015 --> 03:19:19,039
Describe

3996
03:19:28,511 --> 03:19:29,535
That's not good

3997
03:19:29,791 --> 03:19:30,559
Sign usually

3998
03:19:31,071 --> 03:19:32,607
People need to be

3999
03:19:32,863 --> 03:19:34,655
Pacific organization is good

4000
03:19:34,911 --> 03:19:37,471
Generally speaking whenever people want to get together

4001
03:19:37,727 --> 03:19:43,871
We talked about unionizing I like I like I like an organization

4002
03:19:44,127 --> 03:19:46,687
Strike but Wednesday VP says organizing

4003
03:19:48,223 --> 03:19:50,271
Already

4004
03:19:50,527 --> 03:19:53,087
Replaced all of this is a war on America

4005
03:19:53,343 --> 03:19:55,135
You know

4006
03:19:55,391 --> 03:20:01,535
Stewart f****** roads it was on earlier say that

4007
03:20:03,583 --> 03:20:07,167
And it's not good because Alex has been convinced to Steve's narrative

4008
03:20:07,679 --> 03:20:09,983
And that's the motive for the bombing to cover this stuff up

4009
03:20:10,239 --> 03:20:11,775
And now

4010
03:20:12,287 --> 03:20:13,055
He dehumanizes

4011
03:20:13,311 --> 03:20:14,847
Pretty much anyone who doesn't agree with

4012
03:20:32,767 --> 03:20:34,303
That's so f***** up

4013
03:20:35,327 --> 03:20:39,935
I'm coming to you with a extremist anti-government message

4014
03:20:40,191 --> 03:20:45,311
The globalists are making their offensive Warfare guy on here telling me it's time to organize

4015
03:20:45,567 --> 03:20:48,383
Militia leaders inevitable

4016
03:20:48,639 --> 03:20:51,455
And you know what if people don't agree with you they're dead already

4017
03:20:52,223 --> 03:20:53,503
F****** hell man

4018
03:20:53,759 --> 03:20:57,599
How to use messages get heard by people like

4019
03:20:57,855 --> 03:21:00,415
I mean the only thing I can

4020
03:21:00,671 --> 03:21:01,183
I just

4021
03:21:01,439 --> 03:21:01,951
Steven

4022
03:21:02,207 --> 03:21:02,719
Jerking off

4023
03:21:02,975 --> 03:21:03,487
Witf

4024
03:21:04,511 --> 03:21:10,655
Like that's just what they want Alex probably

4025
03:21:12,447 --> 03:21:13,215
But

4026
03:21:16,287 --> 03:21:17,055
Specific

4027
03:21:17,567 --> 03:21:18,079
Recommend

4028
03:21:19,103 --> 03:21:23,967
And I think yeah

4029
03:21:24,223 --> 03:21:26,015
I think these bulshit

4030
03:21:26,271 --> 03:21:27,807
And the third one is what he's actually at

4031
03:21:29,087 --> 03:21:33,183
Describe the larger spectrum of where we are historically

4032
03:21:33,439 --> 03:21:34,207
Call Shirley

4033
03:21:37,535 --> 03:21:43,679
Where we are right now is exactly where we were when our forefathers were in 1770

4034
03:21:43,935 --> 03:21:45,983
Being oppressed by King George

4035
03:21:47,007 --> 03:21:48,543
Literally now

4036
03:21:48,799 --> 03:21:50,335
I'm non-legitimate

4037
03:21:50,847 --> 03:21:51,359
President

4038
03:21:51,615 --> 03:21:55,967
CM government and executive we have not had illegitimate government

4039
03:21:56,223 --> 03:22:01,855
Presidency under Bush jr. So frequently 12 years now

4040
03:22:07,999 --> 03:22:11,327
Affect what we have is a non-legitimate

4041
03:22:11,583 --> 03:22:16,191
Hierarchy cord had a mini older us so we have the right

4042
03:22:16,447 --> 03:22:20,031
To indict our presidents to organize

4043
03:22:22,591 --> 03:22:25,919
Not only for this president for the impeachment of bush

4044
03:22:26,175 --> 03:22:30,271
Junior and all of his

4045
03:22:36,159 --> 03:22:39,743
Now

4046
03:22:45,119 --> 03:22:48,703
Nuremberg Trial this is a war trial now

4047
03:22:48,959 --> 03:22:50,495
Junior

4048
03:22:55,359 --> 03:23:01,503
And the bilateral commission saying that they were criminals

4049
03:23:01,759 --> 03:23:06,111
Request a new election as soon as possible

4050
03:23:06,367 --> 03:23:10,975
Can we go into what is called the Revolutionary Moe's

4051
03:23:11,487 --> 03:23:15,071
Can we go to the guns

4052
03:23:15,327 --> 03:23:17,375
I have no qualms about that

4053
03:23:17,631 --> 03:23:22,495
Forces used to suppress basketballs flags are used to give us honesty

4054
03:23:25,311 --> 03:23:28,639
In the face of tyranny treason is Patriots

4055
03:23:28,895 --> 03:23:29,919
Let me say it again

4056
03:23:30,175 --> 03:23:34,271
Tyranny which we have right now in the bush

4057
03:23:35,039 --> 03:23:39,903
Which is an act against the government

4058
03:23:43,231 --> 03:23:44,511
Keepsake

4059
03:23:45,023 --> 03:23:45,791
So

4060
03:23:46,047 --> 03:23:51,679
What you have here is Steve Morelos declaring open season for AC companies

4061
03:23:52,191 --> 03:23:55,519
He's saying that we need to call for impeachment

4062
03:23:56,287 --> 03:24:01,407
These Dum Dums been calling for a peach and Obama for over four years at this point

4063
03:24:08,575 --> 03:24:13,695
His second suggested calling for an Erbert trial isn't absurd for him to suggest Alex's audio

4064
03:24:14,463 --> 03:24:16,767
What's the one thing more than anything else

4065
03:24:17,023 --> 03:24:19,071
The concept of international law

4066
03:24:19,583 --> 03:24:24,447
I just see it now Alex calling on the UN to remove the elected president of the United States

4067
03:24:24,959 --> 03:24:26,239
That's ridiculous

4068
03:24:26,495 --> 03:24:30,079
Non-starter

4069
03:24:30,335 --> 03:24:33,151
Absolutely ridiculous thing is that they're three

4070
03:24:33,663 --> 03:24:36,479
And the underlying unspoken messages that the first two aren't really

4071
03:24:37,759 --> 03:24:40,063
The first ones went right over and over and hasn't work

4072
03:24:40,319 --> 03:24:46,463
The second involves a complete breach of the fundamental ideas that the Patriots and weirdo militia guys at about sovereignty

4073
03:24:46,719 --> 03:24:47,743
Something not going anywhere

4074
03:24:48,255 --> 03:24:51,839
This is about finding a way to rationalize calling for an armed

4075
03:24:52,607 --> 03:24:57,727
What's Steve doing on this episode of made the movie the most dangerous most irresponsible thing I've heard

4076
03:24:57,983 --> 03:24:58,495
Daytona

4077
03:24:58,751 --> 03:24:59,263
What's the show

4078
03:24:59,519 --> 03:25:02,591
He's walking around his fake resume an imaginary credentials

4079
03:25:03,359 --> 03:25:04,127
Incredibility

4080
03:25:04,383 --> 03:25:07,967
Come on to the show and lie down says audience of profits report

4081
03:25:08,223 --> 03:25:11,039
I'll torture being actually illegal in the bush

4082
03:25:11,295 --> 03:25:13,599
Obama

4083
03:25:14,111 --> 03:25:16,159
Is it this is the time they've been waiting for

4084
03:25:16,415 --> 03:25:18,975
This legal indictments been made and it didn't do anything

4085
03:25:19,231 --> 03:25:21,535
They just did a bombing to keep it out of the news

4086
03:25:21,791 --> 03:25:26,143
The really the legal and appropriate channels are not how this thing is going to be solved

4087
03:25:26,655 --> 03:25:30,495
He's stopping short of saying the people should be committed violent revolution

4088
03:25:31,263 --> 03:25:32,543
But that's 100% the message

4089
03:25:32,799 --> 03:25:33,311
Did he put in for

4090
03:25:33,823 --> 03:25:35,615
These guys are trying to get people

4091
03:25:36,127 --> 03:25:37,663
Oh yeah there is no way around that

4092
03:25:41,759 --> 03:25:43,551
Listen to listen to this s*** man

4093
03:25:47,135 --> 03:25:49,951
Are we in fact in charge

4094
03:25:50,207 --> 03:25:53,791
You are now in charge your commanders and chief or not

4095
03:25:54,047 --> 03:25:55,839
They are illegal

4096
03:25:56,095 --> 03:25:57,375
Are legal presence

4097
03:25:57,887 --> 03:26:00,447
And therefore Justified

4098
03:26:01,727 --> 03:26:03,519
Can internal in the major levels

4099
03:26:03,775 --> 03:26:06,591
Questioning Authority the commander-in-chief

4100
03:26:06,847 --> 03:26:11,967
Entry level because they've been indicted for war crimes

4101
03:26:12,223 --> 03:26:15,039
Authoritative

4102
03:26:15,295 --> 03:26:16,575
Indicted

4103
03:26:16,831 --> 03:26:17,599
War crime

4104
03:26:18,111 --> 03:26:21,439
Therefore I ask our Military Officers

4105
03:26:21,951 --> 03:26:24,255
Stand up and say that this is enough

4106
03:26:28,863 --> 03:26:30,399
This is what it comes down to

4107
03:26:33,727 --> 03:26:35,775
To work with us

4108
03:26:36,287 --> 03:26:39,871
This cannot be run anymore by a little legal

4109
03:26:40,383 --> 03:26:41,919
Criminal president

4110
03:26:42,431 --> 03:26:48,575
Who was indicted biozone Congress

4111
03:26:48,831 --> 03:26:51,391
And the former president is well Clinton

4112
03:26:55,487 --> 03:26:58,559
Okay what we got here is him calling for a military coup

4113
03:26:58,815 --> 03:27:02,911
He's calling for Insurrection essentially with it the military rack

4114
03:27:03,423 --> 03:27:04,703
He's that this is

4115
03:27:04,959 --> 03:27:05,471
Is like

4116
03:27:05,727 --> 03:27:11,871
I love your idea hold on one second of History over there

4117
03:27:13,407 --> 03:27:19,551
Military dictatorship is a bad idea

4118
03:27:19,807 --> 03:27:24,927
Wolf Road

4119
03:27:25,439 --> 03:27:26,463
Unabashedly

4120
03:27:27,743 --> 03:27:29,023
Can you do that

4121
03:27:31,583 --> 03:27:32,351
I don't think you

4122
03:27:32,863 --> 03:27:39,007
You don't think that you can literally call for the military to take over the government it is actually kind of sticky

4123
03:27:39,263 --> 03:27:42,591
Legal question

4124
03:27:42,847 --> 03:27:46,431
And I honestly think they probably wouldn't be able to

4125
03:27:49,247 --> 03:27:50,015
The s*** though

4126
03:27:51,807 --> 03:27:54,367
I think Brandenburg versus Ohio the Supreme Court decision

4127
03:27:54,879 --> 03:27:59,231
Leaves a lot of gray area in terms of advocating for illegal things

4128
03:28:01,535 --> 03:28:02,815
Bmac from a legal perspective

4129
03:28:03,327 --> 03:28:05,631
In order for the government to be able to punish someone

4130
03:28:05,887 --> 03:28:07,423
For even advocating illegal act

4131
03:28:08,191 --> 03:28:11,263
I think he's on the wrong side of it but I'm not illegal

4132
03:28:12,287 --> 03:28:13,823
I want

4133
03:28:14,079 --> 03:28:15,359
I think Steve is

4134
03:28:15,615 --> 03:28:21,759
Is confessing to what he's trying to do

4135
03:28:22,015 --> 03:28:23,807
I wish you would because

4136
03:28:24,319 --> 03:28:25,599
Rhetoric like this

4137
03:28:26,111 --> 03:28:27,135
Is far beyond

4138
03:28:27,391 --> 03:28:28,159
What I believe

4139
03:28:28,415 --> 03:28:29,183
The first amendment is

4140
03:28:30,975 --> 03:28:31,487
Because

4141
03:28:31,743 --> 03:28:37,119
Steve is saying like Okay we need to have this impeachment Nuremberg trials or whatever or armed Revolution

4142
03:28:37,631 --> 03:28:38,399
And the mean

4143
03:28:41,471 --> 03:28:41,983
To getting

4144
03:28:42,239 --> 03:28:43,519
The president out of office

4145
03:28:44,031 --> 03:28:46,335
Choose a new president

4146
03:28:46,591 --> 03:28:47,615
Now what

4147
03:28:48,383 --> 03:28:49,151
A Democrat

4148
03:28:49,663 --> 03:28:55,807
You think they're going to be happy either election results

4149
03:28:56,063 --> 03:28:57,855
Legitimate

4150
03:28:58,111 --> 03:28:59,135
Except

4151
03:29:01,439 --> 03:29:01,951
Three presidents in

4152
03:29:02,975 --> 03:29:03,743
I wonder how he feel

4153
03:29:03,999 --> 03:29:04,511
Feels about Reagan

4154
03:29:05,023 --> 03:29:06,815
Reagan was probably his last widget

4155
03:29:07,071 --> 03:29:09,119
He works for a didn't work for

4156
03:29:10,399 --> 03:29:12,959
Steve essentially is arguing that

4157
03:29:13,727 --> 03:29:16,543
These people who are advocating for this coup against the government

4158
03:29:17,055 --> 03:29:18,591
Need to be able to choose the next

4159
03:29:19,359 --> 03:29:20,895
Come true

4160
03:29:21,407 --> 03:29:21,919
There's trouble

4161
03:29:22,687 --> 03:29:24,991
And then we nearly asked for the election

4162
03:29:25,247 --> 03:29:26,015
And Lilo

4163
03:29:26,271 --> 03:29:30,111
That is exactly what we have to do

4164
03:29:31,391 --> 03:29:31,903
Do that

4165
03:29:32,415 --> 03:29:35,487
Then we use whatever we need whether it's

4166
03:29:37,023 --> 03:29:41,631
Which will determine the outcome of the United States

4167
03:29:41,887 --> 03:29:42,399
America

4168
03:29:47,775 --> 03:29:51,615
Today at the moment

4169
03:29:51,871 --> 03:29:53,407
We will regret the day

4170
03:29:53,663 --> 03:29:54,943
That we did not stand up

4171
03:29:55,711 --> 03:29:58,783
Scrapping is super immediate

4172
03:29:59,295 --> 03:30:01,343
And like you literally says this is

4173
03:30:02,879 --> 03:30:06,719
If we don't do this today I guarantee you you will not have an American

4174
03:30:06,975 --> 03:30:07,487
Tomorrow

4175
03:30:07,999 --> 03:30:08,511
That is

4176
03:30:08,767 --> 03:30:09,279
So

4177
03:30:09,535 --> 03:30:10,303
Stocked up

4178
03:30:11,327 --> 03:30:11,839
Do you know what that

4179
03:30:12,095 --> 03:30:12,607
That sounds

4180
03:30:13,375 --> 03:30:14,399
Just be like

4181
03:30:14,655 --> 03:30:16,703
The manifesto of a right-wing f******

4182
03:30:16,959 --> 03:30:17,471
Terrorist

4183
03:30:17,727 --> 03:30:23,871
Have we had any of those manifestos recently that sound

4184
03:30:24,127 --> 03:30:25,151
Exactly like that

4185
03:30:25,919 --> 03:30:26,687
I think there's some

4186
03:30:31,039 --> 03:30:31,807
So

4187
03:30:33,343 --> 03:30:34,367
Listening earlier like

4188
03:30:34,623 --> 03:30:35,647
I don't know if he

4189
03:30:35,903 --> 03:30:36,415
He could really be

4190
03:30:37,439 --> 03:30:38,207
Successfully

4191
03:30:38,719 --> 03:30:39,231
Because of

4192
03:30:39,999 --> 03:30:40,767
You know these why

4193
03:30:41,279 --> 03:30:42,303
Births that are given

4194
03:30:42,559 --> 03:30:43,071
To free speech

4195
03:30:43,583 --> 03:30:45,119
But if you listen to this next clip

4196
03:30:46,399 --> 03:30:46,911
Steven Smith

4197
03:30:47,423 --> 03:30:48,447
I'm committing treason

4198
03:30:55,359 --> 03:30:59,455
Transmission

4199
03:30:59,711 --> 03:31:05,087
Connexus where we are literally in the position of a war against our own federal government

4200
03:31:05,343 --> 03:31:09,183
I know what'll happen to me I will be warned repeatedly again

4201
03:31:09,695 --> 03:31:12,767
Time in MA

4202
03:31:13,791 --> 03:31:19,167
I have everything I am boldly saying I am in an act of treason against tyranny

4203
03:31:19,423 --> 03:31:21,983
And I will do that as an act of patriotism

4204
03:31:22,239 --> 03:31:23,263
That is my defense

4205
03:31:23,519 --> 03:31:24,543
If I go to prison

4206
03:31:25,055 --> 03:31:27,615
I'm committing treason

4207
03:31:27,871 --> 03:31:30,687
The government is patriotism

4208
03:31:31,199 --> 03:31:35,295
Put on trial

4209
03:31:35,551 --> 03:31:36,063
You just said

4210
03:31:36,575 --> 03:31:39,391
Your intentions are clear you're trying

4211
03:31:39,647 --> 03:31:41,183
Insurrection

4212
03:31:43,487 --> 03:31:43,999
Death knock

4213
03:31:47,327 --> 03:31:48,095
I'm like one of those

4214
03:31:48,351 --> 03:31:49,119
Guys who

4215
03:31:50,143 --> 03:31:50,655
Goes in

4216
03:31:51,167 --> 03:31:51,935
On his own

4217
03:31:52,191 --> 03:31:53,215
Turns himself into

4218
03:31:53,471 --> 03:31:53,983
The cops

4219
03:31:55,519 --> 03:31:56,287
Killing like 5p

4220
03:31:56,543 --> 03:31:57,055
People

4221
03:31:57,311 --> 03:31:57,823
Anime invest

4222
03:31:59,359 --> 03:32:00,127
You didn't

4223
03:32:00,383 --> 03:32:00,895
Do that

4224
03:32:01,151 --> 03:32:03,967
Right

4225
03:32:04,223 --> 03:32:06,527
Yeah I feel like I was part of the game

4226
03:32:06,783 --> 03:32:10,623
In the middle of Florida

4227
03:32:10,879 --> 03:32:12,159
Korea whenever I want to

4228
03:32:12,415 --> 03:32:13,951
It is

4229
03:32:14,207 --> 03:32:14,975
It is strange

4230
03:32:15,231 --> 03:32:17,279
And probably their best defense

4231
03:32:17,535 --> 03:32:19,839
Almost cuz one of the other things

4232
03:32:20,095 --> 03:32:22,655
Brandenburg vs Ohio another one of the standards

4233
03:32:22,911 --> 03:32:23,423
Is

4234
03:32:23,935 --> 03:32:25,727
Likelihood that it will result

4235
03:32:27,775 --> 03:32:31,871
Likelihood that your words will lead to Illegal Acts

4236
03:32:32,127 --> 03:32:37,759
I guess could be made by Steve

4237
03:32:38,015 --> 03:32:42,367
Legal defense

4238
03:32:42,623 --> 03:32:43,391
But it doesn't

4239
03:32:43,647 --> 03:32:44,415
Match is in

4240
03:32:45,183 --> 03:32:46,463
Right isn't

4241
03:32:46,719 --> 03:32:49,791
Are predicated on IV presented on Alex's show as

4242
03:32:50,047 --> 03:32:54,143
Wonder most credible government insiders psych Warfare expert

4243
03:32:54,399 --> 03:32:56,191
It is ever lived

4244
03:32:56,447 --> 03:32:59,775
I used to be a part of the CFR but I left because they are bunch of snakes

4245
03:33:02,591 --> 03:33:05,151
The presentation of this on the show is

4246
03:33:05,919 --> 03:33:06,943
Let's get going guys

4247
03:33:07,455 --> 03:33:08,223
Let's do it

4248
03:33:08,479 --> 03:33:09,247
And he's like

4249
03:33:09,503 --> 03:33:12,319
If you listen to this next clip he's legitimately calling for lone actor

4250
03:33:13,855 --> 03:33:15,391
Dude dude

4251
03:33:17,439 --> 03:33:19,999
Man in the world is the lone man

4252
03:33:20,511 --> 03:33:25,887
We are in slowness we are each individual's that's what makes America great country

4253
03:33:27,423 --> 03:33:31,263
Using the internet using other means than supporting our candidate

4254
03:33:31,519 --> 03:33:37,663
We can bring down this President we can bring down the government the government is the collusion of the Russia

4255
03:33:38,175 --> 03:33:39,199
Cronyism

4256
03:33:39,455 --> 03:33:42,271
Nnnn.

4257
03:33:42,527 --> 03:33:48,671
Fearful Anthony that cannot stabilize very well

4258
03:33:53,791 --> 03:33:55,839
You will have to go through.

4259
03:34:02,751 --> 03:34:04,031
Start in the last election

4260
03:34:04,543 --> 03:34:06,591
The parties didn't really exist

4261
03:34:07,103 --> 03:34:12,223
Are you got over here yet

4262
03:34:13,759 --> 03:34:14,271
Jeff

4263
03:34:14,783 --> 03:34:15,551
Think this is

4264
03:34:15,807 --> 03:34:16,319
Insanity

4265
03:34:17,087 --> 03:34:17,599
Now I'm just

4266
03:34:17,855 --> 03:34:20,159
Securing of lonely

4267
03:34:24,511 --> 03:34:25,279
To tell myself because

4268
03:34:25,535 --> 03:34:26,047
No one

4269
03:34:29,887 --> 03:34:31,167
You're all I have

4270
03:34:31,423 --> 03:34:33,983
I need to re chaos through you

4271
03:34:34,495 --> 03:34:37,055
It's talking about how the last election

4272
03:34:37,311 --> 03:34:38,079
Wasn't real election

4273
03:34:39,359 --> 03:34:41,919
Complaining about

4274
03:34:42,431 --> 03:34:43,967
Starts talking about Hillary

4275
03:34:44,223 --> 03:34:46,015
And this is a little bit of foreshadowing 420

4276
03:34:46,527 --> 03:34:47,039
Fiends election

4277
03:34:47,807 --> 03:34:52,671
And then you had Obama who's already pretty much in place as a result of social media

4278
03:34:52,927 --> 03:34:56,511
Just an extension of a transgender Hillary Clinton

4279
03:34:57,023 --> 03:34:59,327
It's all Hillary Clinton Clinton

4280
03:34:59,839 --> 03:35:04,959
Any extension to Obama

4281
03:35:05,983 --> 03:35:12,127
Well I'm saying she's more is more an issue here with Hillary than you would imagine she's not exactly

4282
03:35:12,383 --> 03:35:17,247
What's the

4283
03:35:17,759 --> 03:35:23,391
Dangerous and she's also not legitimacy

4284
03:35:23,647 --> 03:35:25,951
She was also indicted for interrogation

4285
03:35:26,463 --> 03:35:27,999
Terrorism

4286
03:35:28,511 --> 03:35:29,791
In this report

4287
03:35:30,303 --> 03:35:32,863
It's not an indictment

4288
03:35:33,375 --> 03:35:36,447
Also I love the idea that he's like casting these like

4289
03:35:36,959 --> 03:35:39,007
Stupid Hillary's

4290
03:35:39,519 --> 03:35:42,079
And then

4291
03:35:42,335 --> 03:35:48,479
Inflammatory

4292
03:35:50,527 --> 03:35:51,295
So ridiculous

4293
03:35:54,367 --> 03:35:55,903
More

4294
03:35:56,159 --> 03:35:56,927
4 attacks

4295
03:36:00,255 --> 03:36:01,279
That's what the government

4296
03:36:01,535 --> 03:36:04,095
Cyber attacks

4297
03:36:05,375 --> 03:36:07,423
Cyber War by anyone

4298
03:36:07,679 --> 03:36:09,983
Anonymous

4299
03:36:10,495 --> 03:36:15,103
Take down this government

4300
03:36:20,991 --> 03:36:24,831
Well the point is the truth has to mobilize people in fashion

4301
03:36:25,087 --> 03:36:28,159
People now have to ask a bird the truth

4302
03:36:28,415 --> 03:36:33,535
Now been told and reaffirmed by their own Constitution

4303
03:36:44,031 --> 03:36:48,639
Constitution

4304
03:36:50,431 --> 03:36:51,967
Breakaway tours

4305

4306
03:36:54,271 --> 03:36:54,783
Slaves

4307
03:36:55,039 --> 03:36:55,551
I got

4308
03:36:56,319 --> 03:36:57,855
I want to put too fine a point on

4309
03:36:59,647 --> 03:37:00,927
Steve pieczenik is Super Lucky

4310
03:37:03,231 --> 03:37:05,279
What he's doing is explicitly a federal offense

4311
03:37:05,791 --> 03:37:08,607
And because Alex allows him to do it on his show

4312
03:37:09,119 --> 03:37:10,399
Possibly be in trouble too

4313
03:37:11,167 --> 03:37:13,215
According to us code chapter 115

The Doodie necessity desirability or propriety of overthrowing order

Destroying a government of the United States or the government of any state territory District

Or possession arrow

Or the government of any political subdivision there in by force or violence

4320
03:37:33,695 --> 03:37:35,743
We're by the assassination of any officer

4321
03:37:37,279 --> 03:37:40,351
Or whoever with intent to cause or overthrow

Shelby find under this title or imprisoned

4329
03:38:01,087 --> 03:38:02,111
Not more than 20 years

4330
03:38:03,391 --> 03:38:05,439
This is the section of the u.s. code on treason in

4331
03:38:05,695 --> 03:38:06,207
Sedition

4332
03:38:06,463 --> 03:38:10,815
It's because he's committing treason

4333
03:38:11,071 --> 03:38:12,863
But he has decided that it's patriotism

4334
03:38:13,119 --> 03:38:13,631
Because of

4335
03:38:13,887 --> 03:38:15,167
Tucson project report

4336
03:38:15,423 --> 03:38:17,215
But he's misrepresenting as a criminal in

4337
03:38:18,239 --> 03:38:19,519
There's a big f****** deal

4338
03:38:20,031 --> 03:38:22,591
Steve pieczenik is actively and clearly committing treason

4339
03:38:23,871 --> 03:38:25,151
And Alex doesn't cut him off

4340
03:38:25,407 --> 03:38:27,711
Or even really given much pushback at all

4341
03:38:28,223 --> 03:38:29,247
And that's where that second

4342
03:38:29,503 --> 03:38:31,551
Closet section 2385 comes in

4343
03:38:33,599 --> 03:38:34,367
Possibly make it

4344
03:38:34,623 --> 03:38:40,767
Compelling argument that Alex's printing publishing circulating Distributing

4345
03:38:41,535 --> 03:38:43,839
Not granted that statute that specifically say printed

4346
03:38:44,351 --> 03:38:45,631
But I have to assume

4347
03:38:47,679 --> 03:38:49,727
These dudes are probably legally in the clear

4348
03:38:50,239 --> 03:38:51,775
Thanks to Brandenburg versus Ohio

4349
03:38:52,287 --> 03:38:54,079
Which roles of the government can't punish speech

4350
03:38:54,335 --> 03:38:56,383
Abstractly Advocates criminal Acts

4351
03:38:56,895 --> 03:38:59,455
But this is walking right up to that line

4352
03:39:00,223 --> 03:39:01,247
Stevens getting pretty smooth

4353
03:39:02,015 --> 03:39:06,879
He's calling for Lone Wolf actors become a cyborg abstract anymore

4354
03:39:07,391 --> 03:39:08,415
Tossing out ideas

4355
03:39:08,927 --> 03:39:12,511
I understand with you from

4356
03:39:12,767 --> 03:39:14,047
It's it it's that

4357
03:39:14,303 --> 03:39:15,839
But I don't know his legally

4358
03:39:18,143 --> 03:39:20,703
Write the definition of abstract

4359
03:39:21,471 --> 03:39:23,263
Might be a lot broader

4360
03:39:23,519 --> 03:39:24,031
Then

4361
03:39:24,543 --> 03:39:25,311
What you and I

4362
03:39:25,567 --> 03:39:26,335
Common sense

4363
03:39:26,591 --> 03:39:28,383
Perspective

4364
03:39:28,639 --> 03:39:30,431
No use telling soldiers that there

4365
03:39:30,687 --> 03:39:32,223
Command has no Authority

4366
03:39:32,479 --> 03:39:37,087
The Brandenburg standard of what government can still punish is if the advocate

4367
03:39:37,343 --> 03:39:39,391
Be construed to be advocating eminently

4368
03:39:41,695 --> 03:39:43,231
I'm not a lawyer

4369
03:39:43,487 --> 03:39:49,631
Very much seems like Steve is trying to

4370
03:39:50,399 --> 03:39:52,959
Where I think Steve runs afoul of the law is that he literally said

4371
03:39:53,727 --> 03:39:59,103
Isaac

4372
03:39:59,359 --> 03:39:59,871
You're not going to

4373
03:40:00,895 --> 03:40:02,431
Call for treason

4374
03:40:02,687 --> 03:40:06,527
I'm going to call for armed government I don't give a fuk

4375
03:40:08,063 --> 03:40:09,087
Come at me bro

4376
03:40:09,599 --> 03:40:10,879
Well I don't know whether or not

4377
03:40:11,135 --> 03:40:12,415
To be successfully prosecuted

4378
03:40:13,439 --> 03:40:13,951
As always

4379
03:40:14,207 --> 03:40:15,999
The legal aspects of this is secondary

4380
03:40:18,559 --> 03:40:19,839
Steve and Alex both now

4381
03:40:21,887 --> 03:40:23,167
Impressionable state right now

4382
03:40:23,423 --> 03:40:23,935
Because of the bomb

4383
03:40:24,703 --> 03:40:26,495
Alex has been priming the pump for a while now

4384
03:40:27,007 --> 03:40:31,359
And in this episode he's clearly told his audience repeatedly there's a false flag attack against

4385
03:40:31,615 --> 03:40:32,127
The Patriots

4386
03:40:32,383 --> 03:40:33,663
And this is the big one

4387
03:40:33,919 --> 03:40:38,271
The beginning of the gobbos defensive round up the good white people of this country and put up in

4388
03:40:39,295 --> 03:40:40,319
Hebrews at Stevens Annex

4389
03:40:40,831 --> 03:40:43,903
And when he comes in the payoff to all of this is it

4390
03:40:44,159 --> 03:40:45,183
Licit treason

4391
03:40:45,439 --> 03:40:47,231
And advocated war against the government

4392
03:40:47,487 --> 03:40:51,327
Which is totally just patriotism because the government is illegitimate as proven by

4393
03:40:51,583 --> 03:40:52,607
A non-profit

4394
03:40:53,887 --> 03:40:56,447
Like this is unacceptable on so many levels

4395
03:40:58,751 --> 03:40:59,263
Steve's talk

4396
03:40:59,519 --> 03:41:00,287
It's almost

4397
03:41:00,799 --> 03:41:01,823
Like you forget

4398
03:41:02,079 --> 03:41:03,359
But the Boston bombing

4399
03:41:04,383 --> 03:41:05,407
You know like

4400
03:41:05,663 --> 03:41:06,943
The context wherein

4401
03:41:07,199 --> 03:41:11,551
This conversation is misrepresenting in lying to his audience

4402
03:41:11,807 --> 03:41:13,343
To create the appearance of like

4403
03:41:13,855 --> 03:41:14,367
This is it

4404
03:41:14,623 --> 03:41:15,903
We got to jump we got a job

4405
03:41:16,415 --> 03:41:16,927
And

4406
03:41:17,439 --> 03:41:20,511
The payoff is a psych Warfare expert coming in and telling Alex

4407
03:41:21,023 --> 03:41:21,535
Would like

4408
03:41:21,791 --> 03:41:23,071
I'm committing treason

4409
03:41:23,583 --> 03:41:26,143
The soldiers need to turn on their chain of command

4410
03:41:26,399 --> 03:41:27,423
Cyberattacks against

4411
03:41:27,679 --> 03:41:28,703
The government must happen

4412
03:41:29,215 --> 03:41:31,007
It's time for us to organize into groups

4413
03:41:33,823 --> 03:41:34,591
Like I didn't

4414
03:41:34,847 --> 03:41:36,127
Think it could get worse

4415
03:41:37,407 --> 03:41:37,919
Once

4416
03:41:39,455 --> 03:41:40,479
To live in the world

4417
03:41:41,759 --> 03:41:42,527
They are not

4418
03:41:42,783 --> 03:41:43,295
Not knowingly

4419
03:41:43,807 --> 03:41:44,575
Trying to cause

4420
03:41:45,855 --> 03:41:46,367
Trying to call

4421
03:41:46,623 --> 03:41:47,135
Terror attacks

4422
03:41:47,391 --> 03:41:47,903
Every nice

4423
03:41:48,159 --> 03:41:50,463
But they are trying

4424
03:41:50,719 --> 03:41:51,487
2 caused

4425
03:41:54,047 --> 03:41:54,559
Set that is not

4426
03:41:55,839 --> 03:41:56,351
You came up with

4427
03:41:57,119 --> 03:41:58,911
Like this is a thing that they did

4428
03:41:59,423 --> 03:41:59,935
Affair

4429
03:42:04,799 --> 03:42:07,359
Play X

4430
03:42:07,615 --> 03:42:08,127
Play

4431
03:42:09,407 --> 03:42:10,175
How to kill people

4432
03:42:10,431 --> 03:42:11,967
And they want that to occur

4433
03:42:12,479 --> 03:42:13,247
So

4434
03:42:14,015 --> 03:42:14,527
There

4435
03:42:15,295 --> 03:42:17,855
You guys are attempted murderers

4436
03:42:18,111 --> 03:42:19,135
By like what

4437
03:42:19,391 --> 03:42:25,535
What would we talkin

4438
03:42:25,791 --> 03:42:27,583
Traffic report

4439
03:42:28,607 --> 03:42:31,423
It really is like ideas literacy

4440
03:42:32,447 --> 03:42:33,983
They're doing everything they can

4441
03:42:34,495 --> 03:42:35,775
To make this work wow

4442
03:42:40,383 --> 03:42:41,151
Just as bad

4443
03:42:41,407 --> 03:42:46,783
And I heard the stuff up with Paul and the pictures of the people

4444
03:42:47,039 --> 03:42:49,599
I thought like well this is as bad as it gets

4445
03:42:49,855 --> 03:42:52,671
And then Steve shows up and he's like I'm committing trees

4446
03:42:54,975 --> 03:42:55,487
Aaron like

4447
03:42:56,255 --> 03:42:58,303
I don't know how much worse this can get

4448
03:42:58,815 --> 03:42:59,839
This doesn't resolve

4449
03:43:00,351 --> 03:43:04,447
The Girl Next Door

4450
03:43:04,959 --> 03:43:06,495
Mama didn't get shot

4451
03:43:07,007 --> 03:43:07,775
So

4452
03:43:08,031 --> 03:43:09,567
Finishes up his interview with Steve

4453
03:43:09,823 --> 03:43:10,847
He signs off

4454
03:43:11,103 --> 03:43:12,639
After about four and a half hours of

4455
03:43:13,151 --> 03:43:13,919
Haha

4456
03:43:14,175 --> 03:43:19,295
Goodnight take over for some more time to the do in the six-hour broadcast

4457
03:43:20,063 --> 03:43:23,135
Who cares about what they're doing probably

4458
03:43:23,391 --> 03:43:24,159
Who gives a

4459
03:43:24,927 --> 03:43:28,767
I believe that he feels he's cracked the case

4460
03:43:29,023 --> 03:43:29,791
He's found the culprit

4461
03:43:30,047 --> 03:43:30,559
Patsy

4462
03:43:31,071 --> 03:43:32,863
The media is responding to his coverage

4463
03:43:33,119 --> 03:43:34,399
And now we have a motive

4464
03:43:34,655 --> 03:43:35,167
Text to Steve

4465
03:43:35,679 --> 03:43:39,007
And I he's rattled his base up into incredible friends

4466
03:43:39,775 --> 03:43:45,663
Betrayed

4467
03:43:49,759 --> 03:43:53,087
In front of everyone where they

4468
03:43:53,343 --> 03:43:56,159
The pressure cookers

4469
03:44:02,559 --> 03:44:08,447
I mean this is just

4470
03:44:08,703 --> 03:44:12,287
2 hours equals

4471
03:44:14,079 --> 03:44:15,871
T-Mobile stay on present

4472
03:44:18,431 --> 03:44:19,199
This is G

4473
03:44:20,735 --> 03:44:21,247
Because

4474
03:44:21,759 --> 03:44:23,807
The next

4475
03:44:24,063 --> 03:44:24,575
Those photos

4476
03:44:26,879 --> 03:44:28,671
Unbeknownst to Alex on a lot of the world

4477
03:44:28,927 --> 03:44:30,463
Had gone back to their normal lives

4478
03:44:31,231 --> 03:44:33,023
Buy one of them younger brother

4479
03:44:33,279 --> 03:44:34,559
I got back to college

4480
03:44:35,071 --> 03:44:38,143
The factor was video that came out

4481
03:44:38,399 --> 03:44:40,191
Of him

4482
03:44:41,471 --> 03:44:41,983
Some parties

4483
03:44:42,239 --> 03:44:43,519
Like nothing had happened

4484
03:44:43,775 --> 03:44:47,103
And the older brother got back to his life in his apartment with

4485
03:44:48,383 --> 03:44:48,895
And

4486
03:44:49,407 --> 03:44:51,199
When the photos get released

4487
03:44:52,223 --> 03:44:52,991
It Causes Chaos

4488
03:44:53,503 --> 03:44:55,551
Because they realize that they didn't get away with it

4489
03:44:55,807 --> 03:44:57,087
The way they might

4490
03:44:57,343 --> 03:45:00,159
Based on all of the coverage have no information

4491
03:45:00,671 --> 03:45:01,183
Based on

4492
03:45:01,439 --> 03:45:05,023
I want one of them as we will later learn is a fan of Infowars

4493
03:45:05,279 --> 03:45:10,399
Completely

4494
03:45:11,423 --> 03:45:12,959
And that is not the case

4495
03:45:13,215 --> 03:45:14,751
Everything blows up on the 18th

4496
03:45:15,519 --> 03:45:17,055
Happens in the evening of the 18th

4497
03:45:20,127 --> 03:45:21,151
Are going to be such

4498
03:45:21,919 --> 03:45:22,943
Insanity

4499
03:45:23,455 --> 03:45:25,503
And if we're at the point where one of Alex's most

4500
03:45:26,015 --> 03:45:27,039
Trusted sources

4501
03:45:27,295 --> 03:45:28,831
Is coming on Aaron advocating

4502
03:45:29,087 --> 03:45:29,599
Treason

4503
03:45:29,855 --> 03:45:31,647
Before any of that stuff happen

4504
03:45:31,903 --> 03:45:33,183
Before the Manhunt

4505
03:45:33,439 --> 03:45:35,231
Before the city is put into lockdown

4506
03:45:36,511 --> 03:45:38,047
I can't imagine how dark

4507
03:45:38,303 --> 03:45:38,815
Chris is going to get

4508
03:45:39,327 --> 03:45:40,607
Before we get through it

4509
03:45:41,375 --> 03:45:43,935
So yeah

4510
03:45:44,959 --> 03:45:45,471
S***

4511
03:45:46,751 --> 03:45:47,263
Not good

4512
03:45:51,871 --> 03:45:53,919
Arrested

4513
03:45:54,431 --> 03:45:58,271
Millions of dollars

4514
03:46:02,111 --> 03:46:03,391
I wish I wish

4515
03:46:03,903 --> 03:46:09,279
I wish that anybody pay attention to Alex the way he imagined

4516
03:46:09,791 --> 03:46:12,095
Like the law thing

4517
03:46:12,351 --> 03:46:14,143
Justice would have been such red flags

4518
03:46:14,655 --> 03:46:16,447
Yeah like this is real bad

4519
03:46:17,471 --> 03:46:17,983
Yeah

4520
03:46:18,239 --> 03:46:20,287
Pretend

4521
03:46:22,591 --> 03:46:23,103
That's not good

4522
03:46:23,615 --> 03:46:24,127
Nope

4523
03:46:24,383 --> 03:46:25,663
But the good news

4524
03:46:26,431 --> 03:46:27,711
Is we have a website

4525
03:46:27,967 --> 03:46:28,479
No

4526
03:46:28,735 --> 03:46:33,855
The Kerry Cassidy over project has gone bad

4527
03:46:34,111 --> 03:46:36,927
And we have an extra day this week

4528
03:46:37,183 --> 03:46:37,695
So

4529
03:46:37,951 --> 03:46:39,999
If you're feeling everybody

4530
03:46:40,255 --> 03:46:41,791
You're feeling really overwhelmed by this

4531
03:46:42,047 --> 03:46:46,399
Look forward to a nice break on Wednesday we're going to get back to space weird

4532
03:46:46,655 --> 03:46:48,447
First off let's just remember

4533
03:46:48,703 --> 03:46:51,775
We are in 2019 the Civil War did not

4534
03:46:52,287 --> 03:46:54,079
Yes a lot of this is

4535
03:46:54,335 --> 03:46:55,615
Sound and Fury signifying

4536
03:46:55,871 --> 03:46:56,895
But

4537
03:46:57,151 --> 03:46:59,199
It is also the sort of thing that's in

4538
03:46:59,455 --> 03:47:00,479
Talib people

4539
03:47:02,527 --> 03:47:04,063
Like I mean

4540
03:47:04,575 --> 03:47:07,135
It's not a direct consequence of this

4541
03:47:07,391 --> 03:47:08,671
Coverage per se

4542
03:47:09,183 --> 03:47:09,951
But like

4543
03:47:10,207 --> 03:47:12,255
You know a couple years prior to this

4544
03:47:12,511 --> 03:47:15,327
One of Alex's listeners killed three cops when his mom called the police

4545
03:47:16,351 --> 03:47:17,631
A year after this

4546
03:47:17,887 --> 03:47:19,679
Two people who are big Infowars fans

4547
03:47:20,191 --> 03:47:21,983
I killed some cops in Las Vegas

4548
03:47:22,495 --> 03:47:23,775
Like it's not

4549
03:47:25,055 --> 03:47:30,687
It's easy to look at this stuff where Steve is calling for an Insurrection in the military and all this and bag

4550
03:47:32,223 --> 03:47:33,247
The large-scale

4551
03:47:33,503 --> 03:47:35,807
Version that you would be afraid of happening

4552
03:47:36,831 --> 03:47:39,135
But that's not to say that people who are

4553
03:47:40,671 --> 03:47:41,695
To take in his rhetoric

4554
03:47:42,207 --> 03:47:42,719
Hasn't

4555
03:47:43,999 --> 03:47:44,511
So

4556
03:47:46,303 --> 03:47:49,375
There aren't the terrifying world-changing consequences

4557
03:47:49,887 --> 03:47:50,911
But that doesn't mean there aren't I

4558
03:47:52,703 --> 03:47:53,471
Seems like

4559
03:47:53,727 --> 03:47:54,751
Their ultimate goal

4560
03:47:55,775 --> 03:47:56,287
Because

4561
03:47:56,543 --> 03:47:57,567
Cuz you and I both

4562
03:47:58,591 --> 03:47:59,615
The GOP does

4563
03:47:59,871 --> 03:48:00,383
It all have

4564
03:48:01,919 --> 03:48:03,455
Like my dad doesn't want doesn't

4565
03:48:03,967 --> 03:48:04,479
Secretly want

4566
03:48:04,735 --> 03:48:05,503
How to start an arms

4567
03:48:06,271 --> 03:48:07,551
Right

4568
03:48:07,807 --> 03:48:08,575
4A

4569
03:48:09,343 --> 03:48:09,855
2

4570
03:48:10,111 --> 03:48:10,623
Do this

4571
03:48:12,159 --> 03:48:14,975
The government reacts and then people like my dad

4572
03:48:15,743 --> 03:48:20,863
Well you know I don't approve of those guys bumps

4573
03:48:21,119 --> 03:48:23,167
But the government

4574
03:48:23,423 --> 03:48:23,935
Spirals out of

4575
03:48:24,191 --> 03:48:24,703
Control from there

4576
03:48:27,775 --> 03:48:30,847
And also build up a narrative that those people who bombed

4577
03:48:31,103 --> 03:48:33,151
Stop in the first place

4578
03:48:33,407 --> 03:48:39,551
Was a false flag by the overreaction in order

4579
03:48:39,807 --> 03:48:41,087
Yep very transparent

4580
03:48:48,511 --> 03:48:54,655
Cam also Twitter

4581
03:48:55,167 --> 03:48:59,519
Rose wallpaper

4582
03:49:00,287 --> 03:49:00,799
You go tonight

4583
03:49:01,311 --> 03:49:02,079
Whatever

4584
03:49:02,591 --> 03:49:03,871
Castrol app

4585
03:49:04,127 --> 03:49:04,639
To using a

4586
03:49:04,895 --> 03:49:06,431
And I could leave a review

4587
03:49:07,967 --> 03:49:08,735
We love it

4588
03:49:15,647 --> 03:49:16,159
Neil

4589
03:49:16,671 --> 03:49:17,183
I believe

4590
03:49:17,439 --> 03:49:18,463
Dzx Clark

4591
03:49:18,719 --> 03:49:19,487
I'm the juiciest.
