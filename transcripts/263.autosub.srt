The Dirty South

39
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,800
You came up with an idea

40
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,104
Frankly

41
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,504
It's a weird feeling

42
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,808
I don't know

43
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,184
I don't know we'll see

44
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
Take risks

45
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,815
I don't know if you or any of our listeners know this

46
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:27,775
It's fake news of those things that I think about alot

47
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:37,503
I have brought something and you need to play the out of

48
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,391
Contacts drop getting cooler

49
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,975
How do you take that to mean he's asking

50
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,047
Did Mars

51
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:56,447
Spuds MacKenzie

52
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,543
Okay

53
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,335
I just like a house

54
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,967
Mark Moreno

55
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:13,599
With Pat Robertson do you know who Mark arenas

56
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,671
I mean

57
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,207
Head editor in

58
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:23,583
Pretty much only writer in the only guy who really runs climates depot.com

59
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,983
Okay he is 18

60
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,823
I think so for sure

61
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,407
This guy is for me different from usual

62
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,687
Cast of

63
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,223
Because this guy

64
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
Is a complete sleazeball

65
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:48,671
Like this point

66
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,279
They're all shooting up for themselves

67
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
They're all trying to run their own scam

68
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
Right

69
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,375
This dude

70
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,911
Is gun for hire

71
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,775
All the way this guy does not believe a goddamn word

72
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,567
He has found his little niche

73
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,407
He gets shipped tons of money for it and he's sucking

74
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:18,879
The politically incorrect guide to climate change

75
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
And

76
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,207
Genuinely

77
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,999
Should not get an author credit

78
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
On the book that he wrote

79
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,607
Because he write this here's a example of his book

80
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
Long quote

81
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
And that proves

82
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,031
What this guy said long quote

83
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,335
Long quotes

84
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
That's it

85
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:46,271
He's more of a compiler a quote minor of the worst variety

86
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
And

87
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
Has given an interview with Pat Robertson

88
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:56,511
Haha haha

89
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:02,911
Cuz I know for a fact

90
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:09,311
Look into Pat Robertson side of his interview at all I don't give a f*** about what he

91
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,615
He has to say I hate Mark Moreno

92
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:16,479
So that is how you into this first clip

93
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,271
Said something

94
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,599
Miami is actually thinking

95
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
Subsided

96
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,439
But there's no acceleration in the global sea level

97
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,487
So you cannot

98
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,535
Mankind is always battling

99
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
The shores

100
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
Sea levels Rising for 10,000

101
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
1 + years

102
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
The end of the last ice age

103
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,495
Man has always been battling the shore

104
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:43,359
I don't like the context but I like it

105
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:49,247
Man is always in bed

106
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Right

107
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,575
Do you think what he said makes any sense

108
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
No

109
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,647
I mean sure

110
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:01,023
Together a sentences yes but I don't I don't know I don't know if it's

111
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
Thesis

112
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,863
The man isn't doing anything

113
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:11,775
Climate change actually connect to each other

114
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,407
Miami is sinking and there's no acceleration of global sea levels

115
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,967
That doesn't make sense

116
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,527
Is it thinking really

117
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,807
Is that what you would call it

118
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,647
No okay

119
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,487
Miami is what you think Miami

120
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,559
Being overwhelmed

121
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:40,959
You have to go down

122
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,751
It's a problem just off the bat

123
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
Could you like

124
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,175
Visual metaphor

125
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:54,271
Norse Viking stabbing a rock

126
00:08:54,527 --> 00:09:00,671
Hitting a beach with the shore

127
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,767
Sword fight

128
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:11,935
How do you think man has been battling

129
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:17,567
Alright so we do believe in Anthem

130
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,383
Is

131
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,783
Content and everything I don't even know

132
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,087
What do you mean man has been battling the

133
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,623
Sure

134
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,695
Damn premiums to say is that

135
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
We've been fighting

136
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
Rising water

137
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
Ferrari Tire

138
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
Time on Earth

139
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,935
Articulate I don't know if that's true

140
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,495
Miami is nothing

141
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,335
I will tell you this right now is actually

142
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
Utterly destroyed

143
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:58,271
So the reason is Miami is built almost entirely online

144
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,575
And that's where they get their freshwater

145
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,647
It's called the Biscayne aquifer

146
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,999
This kind of filters water and keeps water fresh

147
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,559
As DC water rises

148
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
That kit

149
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
Covered by salt water

150
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,959
So salt water is seeping into the drinking

151
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:22,591
The estimate of

152
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,943
The estimate from the NOAA

153
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,783
Arise about a foot of seawater will

154
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,343
Pretty much and drinking water in

155
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,791
Syncable no that's not

156
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,887
Prior to a NASA in 2018

157
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,703
Everybody thought that the regular rise of

158
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,263
The sea level was going to be linear

159
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,311
Is going to be a steady gradual

160
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,615
In 2018 a

161
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,175
NASA study by Steve marim

162
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,039
Started referencing different satellite data

163
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:09,439
Cross-referencing it with all kinds of other different measurement techniques exactly how fast

164
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,487
Rising since the 1990s

165
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,023
And I

166
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
It is not

167
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,583
Progressing Italy

168
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:20,703
It is increasing by about 6%

169
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Every single

170
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,775
It's almost exponentially

171
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,871
What is a geometric progression not a linear

172
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,479
I am very very unhappy with everybody because

173
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,295
They're still operating under so much of that like

174
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:40,159
In 100 years by 2100 it will risen by a foot

175
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
You hear that from people with

176
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:46,303
Weird funders

177
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,631
The 8-year being alarmist for Comfort people

178
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:56,287
Who has links to the fossil fuels and tobacco lobbying interest a few of those characters

179
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,151
Do we get back to Miami for a second makes it worse if Miami

180
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
Ruins

181
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:11,647
LivWell

182
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,927
Catch Rainwater

183
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,511
A very reputable Source I've heard that in my hand

184
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,095
You can't see a drip on the strip it's a trip

185
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,167
It does not rain in Miami but on the plus side

186
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
There's

187
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,287
Yelling about how they loved your last

188
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,407
I'm disappointed that you're not still going

189
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,599
Boy

190
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,183
Okay

191
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:51,327
And I would say even according to Narrows own quote

192
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,911
That is a conservative estimate that increase of about 6

193
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
6% each year

194
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:02,335
It is risen from what they thought the estimate would be about 2.5 ml per year

195
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,431
Now it's looking like it's going to rise by about

196
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,223
3.4 mm

197
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
Puryear

198
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
As we continue along

199
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
That's conservit

200
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,927
Basically in about 25 years

201
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,975
If the conservative

202
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,047
Sea level will have risen by about half a

203
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
Not good

204
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:28,703
So that means that in less time than at sea level risen by a foot

205
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,591
And Miami Miami will be unlivable

206
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,967
So no more women who are half

207
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Nope

208
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,855
Wilton

209
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:50,463
They will be able to buy

210
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
But everybody lives there

211
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
Miami's going to go

212
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,095
Now that we know that my everything

213
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,423
We talked about

214
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,959
Who is trying to

215
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,287
The environmental movement

216
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,871
Solve this problem

217
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,175
Do you know who owns the environmental movement down

218
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,247
George Soros George Soros

219
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
But who did he take it from

220
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:19,647
Soros

221
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,951
Eco-terrorists all over the place

222
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,255
Get people to stop by and gold

223
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,303
Hate hate

224
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,631
Hate the environmental movement

225
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,167
From the right

226
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,079
Mark Moreno has made it clear that the modern environment

227
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
Wizard

228
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,223
Good rounds it Civil Rights era

229
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:01,375
The modern environmental movement having been started by a guy named Aldo

230
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,191
Was

231
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:09,055
Dope

232
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,199
You know you know those dudes except for all the siblings didn't die

233
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,783
He was that guy who's like 4 years old

234
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,135
So it's time for me to set out on my own in the forest befriend all the animals

235
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,207
He was top of his class in school

236
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,279
Was top of his class in the next School

237
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,815
And then he decided

238
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
To go to Yale

239
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
Right

240
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,423
Why did you choose Yale

241
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,263
I don't know

242
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,847
Because the year-earlier that started a forestry program

243
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:51,807
The thing that he was when he was 4 years old discipline of Forestry

244
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,623
And then he got a job

245
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,159
Working for the forest service

246
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,463
He's out there in the middle

247
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,655
Shooting bears

248
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:13,567
Bears

249
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
Shooting mountain lion

250
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
Sometimes.

251
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:21,759
Got to go sometimes I got to go

252
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,551
That's almost man's best friend

253
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
That's true

254
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:30,975
Correctly decided after spending all of his time among predators

255
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
Hunting them

256
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,023
He started being like

257
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
F****** dudes are actually pretty cool

258
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:40,191
I like these Predators more than I like these assholes ranchers telling me to kill

259
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,007
So he starts becoming a conservation

260
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:48,895
Right now driving absolutely

261
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,687
He's going out in the forest

262
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
He's got his

263
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:56,319
Wilkes-Barre over here he's got a spare

264
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
Beautiful

265
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
And is

266
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
Just

267
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
Is the guy

268
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,351
Started

269
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,191
In the 1950s and 60s everybody read when he was on the right

270
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,287
Okay no no no

271
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,311
Before

272
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:22,175
Conservative and liberal people in both parties

273
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,735
Wings

274
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,783
The idea that someone

275
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,207
Surprise

276
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:39,839
On the left or the right

277
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,935
Al on the right as we understand it now

278
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,359
Why does Moreno guy think that

279
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,759
Where is the disc

280
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
There is

281
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,951
From time to time is that Martin Luther King was a Republican

282
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:12,351
That's all these guys they were on the right

283
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,375
F****** things up

284
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,983
So here we are at the beginning of the fifties and sixties were in the modern environmental movement

285
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,031
Mark Moreno has done his f****** Reeser

286
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
Alright

287
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:21,823
He knows

288
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
What the problem

289
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,407
And he knows what the left thinks the solutions

290
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
Other

291
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
Environmental scares

292
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,807
Things like resource scarcity we're going to

293
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,647
Famine overpopulation

294
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:43,583
Scared and I show that those scares all have the same Solutions they're proposing today is a different environmental scare

295
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,375
Same solution in the solutions are

296
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,911
Centralized planning

297
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
3 distribution

298
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
And

299
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,823
Stop threatening International Organization

300
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,615
Alex

301
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,967
Like maybe those Illusions people suggest cuz they work

302
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,807
That is exactly right

303
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:07,647
They're very effective at dealing with a broad spectrum of problem

304
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:14,303
It's our secret literally just

305
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:19,935
Yep you got it I like knowing

306
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,983
Visual

307
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:26,847
What what differentiates between the modern environmental movement

308
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
The archaic

309
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,919
Environmental

310
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:36,319
Well if you if he wanted to really be

311
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,855
Play the Teddy Roosevelt

312
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:44,255
Could have created the modern environmental movement

313
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,791
You could make that argument

314
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,095
But again that is

315
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:51,167
Not hijacking and that's not the modern Environmental

316
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,775
Exactly

317
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,847
Wasn't a party

318
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,127
Kind of situation

319
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,663
It was

320
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:08,063
Teddy Roosevelt just like killing s***

321
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,343
Animals

322
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,903
He was all about it

323
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,023
Just describing the actual Solutions

324
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
To the problem

325
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,327
Yeah that's what he's doing

326
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,375
And he's doing it in this way of life

327
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,959
I'm making it sound like this is a bad thing

328
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,263
Because all of these scares

329
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,287
Were

330
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,383
I don't know since you think they were unfounded

331
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,711
I think that's what he's trying to convey

332
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015
No

333
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
It just didn't

334
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:44,671
Solve the issues before they killed everybody

335
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
Exactly

336
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,535
We used centralized power and Southern

337
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
Measures

338
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,583
Pretty much

339
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
What

340
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,935
We're done and what they were trying to do

341
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,727
When they came to the Paris agreement

342
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:04,127
Bulshit toxic waste

343
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,687
Propaganda

344
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,759
You shouldn't bathe in toxic waste in like medical waste

345
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,319
Should be disposed of in a particular way with regulation

346
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,416
Water supply

347
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
Dumb

348
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,280
Globalist

349
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:28,448
That is

350
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,800
Take that

351
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,360
The Paris agreement of course

352
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,152
Is one of these

353
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,968
Sovereignty

354
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,296
Most definitely for sure they want to steal everybody's

355
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:47,392
Now do you want to know exactly how expensive it is

356
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:58,144
FedEx

357
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
Yeah

358
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:05,312
International rates that I don't know how about how expensive

359
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
Surprise you

360
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,920
Wood that has been now analyzing its most expense

361
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,456
The treaty in world history

362
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:16,832
A hundred trillion dollars is the estimated cost

363
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:23,488
Incredulous Robertson

364
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,768
You're going to hear

365
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:29,376
Yeah

366
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,656
A little bit

367
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
How much

368
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
Maybe I don't know

369
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,616
I'm probably like just taking all sorts of

370
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,384
Weird things

371
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,920
Play more the cost of the

372
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,504
But

373
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:52,160
I think you probably know that it feels weird

374
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:03,680
Rigo model Will Smith lyrics

375
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,592
Go to Yale the moment they open the You Will Smith

376
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,736
I might go there.

377
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:24,928
What's that what would that be though the modern Wild Wild West movie

378
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:30,304
Annual

379
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,656
This 100000000000000 number

380
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
From

381
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
One guy

382
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,288
Please tell me if Mark Moreno

383
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:46,688
Nope no other scientist no other

384
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,320
Said anywhere near 100 trillion.

385
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:58,976
He is not waited on the 100-year long cost of the Paris agreement

386
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,768
Going to cost a hundred trillion dollars

387
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,792
521

388
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
Now

389
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,864
What does

390
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,888
The

391
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,448
What he has described in

392
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,984
Moreno's book as the

393
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,264
The game is statistician

394
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,312
Bjorn lomborg

395
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,128
Does he have a Ph.D

396
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
Forestry

397
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,344
I don't know

398
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,440
Okay

399
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,488
Vaguely relevant

400
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,768
What you're looking for

401
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:40,960
Mountain CD or something like that this close

402
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
Taken

403
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,336
Amount he was drawing from what country

404
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:52,992
Review now released only a little bit of his message for coming up with this hundred trillion

405
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
Padam padam

406
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,160
Nobody knows what he plugged into the machine his method was this

407
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:06,304
The amount people are going to spend on it that I think they're going to spend on it

408
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,584
And I called it to

409
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,192
With no numbers

410
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,984
But that's also likes

411
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,056
The United States government is going to cost

412
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,896
100 trillion dollars 2100

413
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,920
Sure sure

414
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
It's deceptive

415
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,600
Director of Fitbit

416
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
Technology

417
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,208
Water bill pay

418
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Dividend

419
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:41,888
Exactly

420
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:46,752
What method was literally that

421
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:52,896
Yeah I am just counting that no deductions for

422
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,968
And it's like

423
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:00,064
It's just like saying that the government cost to trillion dollars a year when it's like

424
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,880
Well that money doesn't go away

425
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:08,000
Right he's not like given to the Paris agreement and they get to keep

426
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:14,144
Write this piece of paper is Rich's s***

427
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,192
Is actually going to wind up being

428
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,520
Not just less than 100 trillion dollars but it's going to be

429
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
Profitable

430
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:26,688
Exactly

431
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,456
Ideally

432
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,296
Absolutely

433
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,880
My favorite quote from

434
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,904
Bjorn lomborg

435
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,184
It's from 8

436
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,000
So

437
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,560
First up in the early 2000s

438
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
He was like

439
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,352
Climate change is real

440
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,632
We got to do something

441
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,192
And then in the mid-2000s

442
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,472
He decided climate change

443
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,240
Is not real

444
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:54,080
And that was because of a large amount of money

445
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,920
Weird beard how that'll change

446
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,712
Your perspective is going to be a theme

447
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,248
But

448
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,040
Here's my favorite quote from your mom

449
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,624
He did this interview with CBC Radio in 26

450
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,160
He said

451
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,376
I was going to do Alex's Bernie Sanders

452
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,960
Most people die from cold

453
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
Not

454
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:29,152
And so when temperature is increased

455
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,968
We're going to see about 400,000 more

456
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,272
Because of global warming

457
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,064
You know

458
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,856
You hear a lot about those

459
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:42,464
But you're probably going to see 1.8 million fewer cold

460
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,608
Pizza now

461
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:52,704
Old people die of heatstroke all the time

462
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,312
But old people freeze to that too and what you don't hear about is that they freeze to death more often

463
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,128
They'll never freeze to death when the world is warm

464
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,368
Is overflowing kind of guy

465
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
Cool

466
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
School

467
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:16,512
Colonel vet

468
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,584
That willingness to look at like

469
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,216
Let's freeze to death guys Isn't that cool

470
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,496
Well it's also not true

471
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:32,640
Generally not because of the element

472
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:40,320
Because they can't afford their heating bills

473
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:45,184
The number of stories about stuff like that unfortunately there are a number of homeless people

474
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,976
Fries on the streets and stuff like that

475
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,560
That's not about

476
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:56,192
Who is -50 year in if you had a place to be inside it wasn't going to be

477
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,728
The biggest eagle in the world

478
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,360
You won't even have to be inside

479
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:07,456
That's true all right dealer

480
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,480
Jordan

481
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,296
You're a lot of fun

482
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,576
He is

483
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:16,416
Goes around

484
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,952
Him saying the dumbest

485
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:23,072
He does not face the 400,000 number on everything

486
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,864
This is 100% something

487
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,888
Pulled from thin air

488
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:31,008
He didn't he didn't like later on right apiece justifying the 400,000 number

489
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:34,592
Or the one in the 1.8 million fewer cold deaths

490
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
Didn't even

491
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:41,504
Figure out how many there are. Think that those terms are very defined

492
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,552
Warm and cold death

493
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,416
Let's people burn that are frozen into ice cube

494
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,744
Global warming is good

495
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
Easter egg

496
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,376
Here's the best part though

497
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,400
Not only

498
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,240
Paris Accord is fart

499
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,824
Can't afford

500
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,920
Fiscal responsibility

501
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:14,528
But here's what's even worse it would even do anything

502
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,856
It's commit Nations until do sovereignty and start

503
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,136
Being essentially

504
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:22,208
Having to bow to a un International Organization

505
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,072
It would have even if you trusted the UN science and Al Gore believe everything you said

506
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,352
It would have no

507
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,400
Impact on temperatures 100 years

508
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,704
It wouldn't even do any

509
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:45,504
Toya Wright

510
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,296
Fortunately

511
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:51,392
What this is referencing what is referencing here is a 2015 MIT

512
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,952
And what they do

513
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,720
Was

514
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,816
BMI 10 put together the study of like

515
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,352
Okay let me check

516
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,144
The Paris Accord

517
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,496
Built on every 5 years

518
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,056
East Country submits a new proposal

519
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
The new pledge

520
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,640
So the MIT study

521
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,664
If everybody

522
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,528
Just did right now

523
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,808
For forever

524
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,904
They're only be able to drop in degrees Celsius

525
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,464
So currently

526
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,256
Is that all

527
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,024
Exactly

528
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,304
Exactly

529
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
Is your problem

530
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,656
What the MIT study

531
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,424
False

532
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,448
Was that

533
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,240
Everybody

534
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,520
Involved in this

535
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,080
Is planning on not doing

536
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,688
Is everybody is doing what they can for

537
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
For The First Five-Year

538
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,248
Bright and then accelerating

539
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,832
Besides getting in the pool

540
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,624
Exact

541
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,416
I mean you're going to have to eventually

542
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,512
Difficult to totally transition every

543
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,352
Bajorans

544
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,216
Got a dip

545
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,640
That does make sense

546
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,664
If all

547
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,224
What that really proves is the opposite of his

548
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:25,600
What that really proves is that a mighty was putting together a thing that's saying

549
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,648
Guys this is a

550
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,464
Amazing thing that we do this is a promise

551
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,256
Amongst all nations

552
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,048
To f****** try and survive

553
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:38,656
And what we need to make sure that you're doing with this five-year proposal

554
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,472
Stop rapping

555
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,776
So the MIT put out the study

556
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,824
Goose everybody into doing

557
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,432
Assholes like Mark Moreno are taking those findings

558
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,808
He's not saying

559
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,856
Here's what we need to do instead

560
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,648
Here's what should be

561
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,440
He just saying

562
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,512
She doesn't believe it

563
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,840
It seems like it would be hard to

564
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
Based on

565
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,544
If you've read this you're lying

566
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
If you haven't read this

567
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,872
Was one of the two

568
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,176
Like a prior is much more likely

569
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,480
He has red

570
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,320
There is one

571
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,088
Expect

572
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,624
That we need to worry about

573
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,672
And it's one day

574
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,744
Larry Nichols has warned us about

575
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:42,144
Oh yeah this is no more than medieval which crap people believe

576
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,752
Edina can regulate the temperature

577
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:53,152
Control store meanest they used to believe that

578
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,200
Are SUVs that are cars

579
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,040
Always witch

580
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
Alright

581
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,600
I think that's lame

582
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,136
I mean

583
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:06,976
Look into a lot of the history of witches and stuff like that

584
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,304
Just completely social

585
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,632
Oppression of women

586
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,704
Like women who didn't adhere to the rules of society

587
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,240
Said that they had to

588
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,568
That is true

589
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,104
They are oppressing

590
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,384
SUVs

591
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,224
That's where you kind of get the sense of life

592
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,016
Do you know if he's talking to Pat Robert

593
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,808
And that is like

594
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:36,672
Coming up with witches and stuff like that it is really like in that wheel houses

595
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:40,256
You know you're talking to a zealot a religious zealot

596
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,792
He's going to love to hear this

597
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,864
One who does not understand how big a trillion

598
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
Absolute

599
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
But

600
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:48,960
Good news is

601
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
That

602
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
Nobody

603
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,360
After you hear that information

604
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,664
And all the information before

605
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,712
You can tell that nobody cares

606
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:05,600
It's too expensive to make a difference and it's just witches

607
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:09,440
Public Health

608
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:11,744
Essentially from global warming for the 1980s

609
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
Phrasing

610
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,424
Performed

611
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,472
There are you an organization

612
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,264
Aldi's

613
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,384
Which is when he use

614
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,176
Starting his b*******

615
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:36,576
Course clear regarding climate change

616
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,600
7

617
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,928
Okay what happened in 2000

618
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,144
Nope Paris courses 2015

619
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,912
Okay

620
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,472
2007

621
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,568
A man named

622
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,432
Sure

623
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,480
And a large amount

624
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,272
Right-wing propaganda

625
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,832
With centered on

626
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,136
Tying him together with

627
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
Climate change

628
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,976
2007

629
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,768
Everyone

630
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:23,168
Everyone was becoming more aware of climate change and everyone across both parties was increasing their concern

631
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,984
Mm2007 however

632
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,288
Fears of climate change.

633
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
Klein

634
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,616
Among the right

635
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,384
Only

636
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:37,504
Everyone every other thing has gone completely up

637
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,112
There is a correlation between the propaganda Blitz

638
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,160
That was put together by

639
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,000
No

640
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
I don't know

641
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,608
Inside being seen

642
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,400
Grandmother

643
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,216
Through organizations like

644
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,496
Donors Trust

645
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:04,896
Koch related

646
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,968
Which doesn't have a great name but

647
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,504
It's it's

648
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:15,392
I've run into that

649
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,464
Let's go through some of the things that they have fun

650
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,792
The donors Trust

651
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:34,848
Get up to a lot of bad bad business the 2017

652
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,640
Americans for Prosperity

653
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:40,736
30962331

654
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,504
Sure

655
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,576
The Heritage Foundation

656
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:50,208
The Discovery Institute the mercatus center veritas

657
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:54,304
100%

658
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:58,144
Freedomworks got about 4 million

659
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,448
These guys are in

660
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,752
And we're going to find out a little bit more about

661
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,616
Respond

662
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:10,944
Places to hide the source of money

663
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,760
Koch related

664
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,040
And then like

665
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
Freedomworks

666
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,112
Americans for Prosperity are also Coke length

667
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,672
Tic-tac-toe

668
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:25,280
Networks around that way

669
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,560
Exactly

670
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,096
They have

671
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,936
Consistently and they've created all of these things

672
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,752
You early to get that propaganda

673
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,056
To avoid this exact

674
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,872
Money comes from

675
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,920
Because it would delegitimize the

676
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
Messaging

677
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Trying to put in the world

678
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
Exactly

679
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:49,088
Dirty submarinos argument eventually comes down to just this

680
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:50,880
Yes

681
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
People have

682
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:59,072
Mainly because the people who give me money cuz guess who

683
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,352
Give him a lot of

684
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,168
Oh yeah

685
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,704
That is a

686
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,544
Exactly what happened

687
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,824
Shifting

688
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,872
The Republic

689
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,152
Opinion

690
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,456
Therefore you shouldn't care

691
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:16,992
You got it

692
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,808
That's not good I made people not care

693
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,696
I guess it is sort of like a demonstration that people are kind of gullible I don't know what that helps with

694
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,000
What's the climate argument

695
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,024
It really crashes at

696
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,864
But you know what's even crazier than the fact that the Paris agreement

697
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,912
What cost 100 trillion

698
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:43,360
And nobody even really cares about internalizing I believe it

699
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,968
It's actually back

700
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,016
The world's going to get cooler

701
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,040
What

702
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:53,856
Many scientists clean Russian scientist

703
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,416
Are predicting a-coming Cooling

704
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,680
Okay

705
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,032
It's just

706
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:15,104
Is it coming

707
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:19,968
Isaac

708
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,552
On the other hand

709
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,600
John Leguizamo did a voice

710
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:29,440
I do remember that

711
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,000
Commercials were just that character chasing the acorn

712
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,608
And we had a district manager

713
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,104
Whatever

714
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:52,224
AB 40 years ago it still

715
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,624
Dragovic us excited about Ice Age

716
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,928
I'm excited

717
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,000
Animals of talk

718
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,536
People be chasing down a car

719
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,304
Oh yeah

720
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,656
Friendships

721
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,704
Absolutely

722
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,104
Which is the whole point

723
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,128
Oh absolutely

724
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,200
I'm sorry

725
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,064
Bulshit comes from a few different sources

726
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,624
And let me give you an idea of their occupation

727
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,928
Denis Leary

728
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:39,072
Predicting a coming Ice Age a book

729
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:43,424
That sounds pretty legit

730
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,704
A meteorologist

731
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,752
That's almost felt something

732
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:51,360
Doppler Dave out of Columbia Missouri

733
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,151
It might as well be

734
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,199
It's actually a local guy

735
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:59,295
Neurologist is like one of those local WeatherBug

736
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:03,647
The most prominent guy who is

737
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,207
Cool boy this is going to be rough

738
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:13,631
He was the one who claimed that a mini ice age in 2014

739
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,911
Mini ice age

740
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,447
The trailer for The

741
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,687
I mean it was really cold last

742
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:27,967
But no

743
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:34,111
I believe this year is 2018 was the fourth hottest year ever

744
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:39,743
Record timing outside of one of the most mild Winters that I remember experiencing

745
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,303
Chicago

746
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,863
Like in terms of like the bigger picture but

747
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,143
It is

748
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:46,911
It is something

749
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,983
The issue here is

750
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,799
All of these guys

751
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,359
I completely forgot to tell you this

752
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,015
You know what's crazy

753
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,039
What's that

754
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,599
He gets his money from

755
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Oh yeah

756
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,231
Sodas in a real Trend here

757
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,047
But you know what

758
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,071
You don't need to worry

759
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,607
You don't need to work

760
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:23,775
Because nothing unusual happened

761
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,895
Is quite literally hundreds of factors that influence the climate

762
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:35,295
The right now they're trying to analyze what's going on where to buy some estimates we're at hundred year or more so

763
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,831
Sunspot activity

764
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:42,207
And many people are predicting a significant drop in temperature

765
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,511
Since the height of the last ocean cycle

766
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:49,119
700 your Lowe's

767
00:43:53,983 --> 00:44:00,127
You shouldn't be worried about

768
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,663
Emily tell you something

769
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:08,063
Nothing unusual is happening nothing out of the ordinary

770
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:15,231
Normal for the sunspot activity to be 100

771
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,559
No everything is happening

772
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:22,399
Nothing unusual is happening whether it's hurricanes tornadoes

773
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:26,751
Extreme weather is actually at a stable or declining trend on climograph

774
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:32,127
Text sounds old

775
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,431
Voices old

776
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,527
Hurricanes come out of

777
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,111
Wrong

778
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,951
The severity of

779
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,743
Extreme weather that we

780
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,023
Over the last

781
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,303
I don't know

782
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,351
10

783
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:54,911
Oh yeah

784
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,519
As the Earth is warming

785
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,311
In the past

786
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,615
Lexi between 1958

787
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,383
In 2000

788
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,687
The amount of rain

789
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,479
Falling in the heaviest storm

790
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:11,039
Has risen by nearly 20% in

791
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:11,807
In the states

792
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,695
That's from 2007-2

793
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,975
28

794
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,791
20%

795
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,143
20% rise since then

796
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:29,215
3 times as much as the rise

797
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,751
Between 1958

798
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,567
So in 11 years

799
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,359
The amount of rain

800
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,663
In the heaviest storms has basically

801
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,735
I understand what you have against water

802
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:45,343
I don't know

803
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,999
A team of more than 300 different

804
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:56,095
Experts in various Fields relating to

805
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,375
Measuring

806
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,655
Extreme weather

807
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:03,007
The Northeast just the Northeast

808
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,567
Has seen a 74% increase

809
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,591
Any amount of rain

810
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,871
In snowfall

811
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,431
Everywhere

812
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,015
New York about those like

813
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,295
Terrible

814
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,831
Blizzard

815
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,415
Does Mark Marino site anything

816
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:26,815
Wait hold on I just remember that that's Avenue freeze-out by Bruce Springsteen

817
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,583
I'm solo

818
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:33,983
Snowstorm

819
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:40,383
Are ghosts real

820
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:53,183
That means it's always been

821
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,023
Much Ado About Nothing everything is

822
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,583
Everything that he is doing now

823
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,423
Is she has written about in his bulshit book

824
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,703
Right

825
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,983
Do you know who he's site

826
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,519
When he said

827
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:11,103
When he says in the in the book this is true

828
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,175
No

829
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,711
Clarence Clemons

830
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,623
Intellectual version of self-dealing

831
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,671
Literally

832
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:28,255
His own website for extreme weather Ceiba

833
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:34,655
Go to the

834
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,471
Oh hell yeah

835
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,775
Intellectual ethical standards

836
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,055
I'm stopping

837
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:46,687
He's just rambling off things saying them assertively and calling it

838
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,455
Reality

839
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,271
Easy to trick someone

840
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,039
At Robertson

841
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,343
Robertson

842
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,207
Robertson kids

843
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,239
Here's the craziest

844
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,287
Just like Bruce Springsteen

845
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,055
Proved

846
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,359
Of course that it's always been bad

847
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,895
Scientist

848
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
No

849
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,943
That it's always been

850
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,759
And you know what else to do.

851
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:25,087
Because the Tenth Avenue freeze-out

852
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:31,487
Is it really about the blizzard storm hadn't

853
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:37,887
I happened to me Clarence Clemons 1.8 million people are

854
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:38,911
Not going to freeze this year

855
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:51,711
EBenefits

856
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,783
I'll tell you one of the biggest things

857
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,319
That he has

858
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,647
Absolutely

859
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,183
Ego

860
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,463
Exactly like

861
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,023
Where it is just

862
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,839
He's he's doing so far here's what he's done

863
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,631
This isn't a problem

864
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:13,983
It's all a lie

865
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,263
Which I'm not saying this

866
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:21,919
We couldn't do any

867
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,199
People are trying to do about it

868
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,783
Absolutely

869
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,063
Here's what's even worse

870
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,367
They're making this whole thing up

871
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,391
Scientist

872
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,439
Are making it all up

873
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:38,559
Yep. 902 1380 this was considered the

874
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:41,375
Climate Optimum word was Optimum

875
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,423
And we had the Renaissance with all this

876
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:47,263
Crops and Vineyard growing in England

877
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,543
And then

878
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,359
What time they said we have to get rid us92

879
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:57,759
Disturbia to get rid of them because we didn't have coal plants and SUVs and was inconvenient to explain how something could be as one

880
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,295
Warm or warmer than today

881
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,743
Does decadence

882
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:14,399
Earlier he said that witches thought they can control the weather

883
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:20,799
They just erased the past

884
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:27,199
Medieval warm.

885
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,247
I'm have heard of it

886
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,295
I've heard those words used before

887
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:37,439
What do you think is specifically like in the medieval warm.

888
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,743
What do you think

889
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,511
Important word

890
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:47,935
Exactly maybe that's why it was warm because other which activity

891
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:54,335
Everybody knows

892
00:50:54,591 --> 00:51:00,735
Morris Greenhouse

893
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,575
Yeah imma write a book

894
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:13,023
Greenhouse which gas

895
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,047
Is because

896
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,327
When you say medieval

897
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,863
You're describing

898
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,631
Not

899
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,399
Just

900
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,191
400 years from

901
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:20,959
213

902
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,775
You're describing 400 years

903
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,055
In a certain

904
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,383
Exactly

905
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,199
He is basically saying

906
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,223
See

907
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,527
In Fort for 400 years

908
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,575
It was really warm for white people

909
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,367
That means the climate is wrong

910
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,903
That's the whole thing

911
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,207
Pages

912
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,511
I don't understand

913
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,303
What are these guys think

914
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,375
Scientist get together and we got to remove the

915
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,423
We got to take it away

916
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,191
Which side

917
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:58,847
Which science that you answered your own question

918
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,455
It seems like

919
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,479
At least

920
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,527
One scientist to be like

921
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:09,343
Huh you guys have changed this date

922
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,903
The biggest eagle in the world

923
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:16,511
Global changes or Pages as they call themselves

924
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,303
Support research

925
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,839
Dad understands

926
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,119
The environment not just

927
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:25,983
You know now we're or the way it's going on but they try and go back as far as possible

928
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,567
So they taking ice core samples tree-ring sample

929
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,103
Holland stalactites

930
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,919
More stuff to see what the overall climate

931
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,455
If the world was

932
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,223
At that time

933
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,855
It's exactly what we would have expected it

934
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,927
There's no medieval warm.

935
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:45,951
For the Earth

936
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,487
It's just for your

937
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,767
So what he says

938
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,303
In a certain sense he does

939
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,631
Have it right you know scientist

940
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,423
To correct it

941
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,495
Give it contacts

942
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:03,871
It's the same rising to temperature that we would have expected this

943
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,407
Because humans were doing

944
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,199
Even back then

945
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:09,759
Anthropogenic global climate change

946
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,295
Was part of the

947
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,855
The deal approved

948
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,927
Consistency to the data

949
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,743
It proves that there isn't some sort of

950
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:23,583
Hidden like this is part of the natural fluctuation of

951
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,887
It fits in perfectly with

952
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,423
The rest of the day that we see

953
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,959
He from

954
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,727
Previous

955
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,495
Climate tracking

956
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
Right right

957
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:34,335
Is taking this small little piece

958
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:38,431
Of one small little part of all the research that has been done

959
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,711
And there

960
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,479
Calling it

961
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:43,295
Proof that global warming

962
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,831
Proof the climate change

963
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,135
That is what they do

964
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,207
The organization

965
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:52,255
That has really been touting

966
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:55,839
That medieval warm period they received

967
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:59,167
530 $2,000 from donors

968
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,287
Erase that

969
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:10,431
Firmly establish better

970
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,967
I might

971
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,247
Hammer on this

972
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:17,087
Hammer.

973
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,111
Two very similar

974
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,135
Walk

975
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,975
Cuz it makes it harder for them to do the business that they do

976
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,791
That is

977
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,839
Come into the donors

978
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,167
Absolute

979
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:35,519
It is one of these things that I

980
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:40,639
You already know that all of these guys are pretty much paid

981
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,175
The whole time

982
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:42,943
You kind of guessed.

983
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:46,527
I went through the citations in his

984
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,295
Facebook

985
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,831
And I tried to find

986
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:49,855
Anyone

987
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,391
Anyone

988
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:57,023
Who did not receive money from donors trust or Americans for Prosperity or all of those things

989
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,327
There were no sources site

990
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,607
That did not

991
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,399
That any source that he had

992
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:07,007
Climate change was not real or not an issue or

993
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:11,103
I should not be attacked or that it's actually sunspots or anything like

994
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,151
All of them

995
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,943
All of them

996
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,247
Received money from these organization

997
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,063
All people on the same team

998
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:21,599
Information

999
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,391
For Sarah

1000
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,415
Absolute

1001
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,719
But no big deal

1002
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,279
Something happening

1003
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,303
2007

1004
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,071
2008

1005
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:32,863
Pissed everybody

1006
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,167
Can't think of what it was

1007
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,703
I'm guessing it

1008
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:39,519
Cheeky way you're saying that is it says Obama

1009
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:45,919
Okay the recent president who said global warming was the greatest threat facing civilization

1010
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:52,575
And if it's theirs it's a tragedy that he wasn't pushed back on President Obama for saying that

1011
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,599
Greatest threat we face

1012
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:56,671
Hays tractor

1013
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,207
Also

1014
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:02,303
On a bracket where I'm sitting at

1015
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,583
Quite a bit

1016
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,143
Was unable to

1017
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:08,959
Really

1018
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,495
Meaningful progress

1019
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,055
I have one question about

1020
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,127
Scott Robertson

1021
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:22,015
Do you think Pat Robertson forgot Obama's name or literally cannot bring himself to stay over

1022
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,231
No he can't do it

1023
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,511
It's ridiculous

1024
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,815
Absolutely f****** insane

1025
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:38,911
And it's all it's so much of this is directly from

1026
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,447
People hating Obama

1027
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:45,055
What's the temperature outside

1028
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,103
Working with that

1029
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,431
Feel like an incubator in

1030
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,735
Green Technology

1031
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,503
Stop

1032
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,063
Leidsa

1033
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,599
It didn't help

1034
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,647
These folks

1035
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,183
Serta Perfect Storm

1036
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:04,255
Like what happened at that time

1037
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,047
Was

1038
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,375
Mixture

1039
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,703
These right-wing synced

1040
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:17,311
Absolutely like piggybacking on people hating Obama

1041
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,615
And throwing in the climate-change stuff

1042
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:23,711
That's why it all happened around 2007

1043
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:26,271
The whole reason that all of the

1044
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,575
Climate awareness and all of this stuff

1045
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,855
DuckTales

1046
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,623
With

1047
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:33,951
Everybody hating Obama is because

1048
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,231
Concerted effort

1049
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,255
To put the two

1050
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,023
Together

1051
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,815
To make sure that people

1052
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:41,631
Who like black people in Miami people in Florida

1053
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:44,447
They're going to lose their homes there

1054
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,727
Vibes

1055
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,263
As The Advocate

1056
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,799
Ecstasy levels rise

1057
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:51,615
Parts of Florida will no longer be

1058
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:54,431
Yeah and those people are

1059
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,967
Oftentimes

1060
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,247
Rite-Way

1061
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:03,391
Yeah because it's not compelling

1062
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,951
Narrative you might want to say is like

1063
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,487
These people just hated Obama

1064
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,023
And that's why

1065
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,655
Obama was pushing for an agenda

1066
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423
Yep

1067
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,471
Uno

1068
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:24,127
So much of the time on our show it's like fear of a black president

1069
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:28,991
Money bottom-line related

1070
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,039
Yeah

1071
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,087
It's a bummer

1072
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:39,487
Like it really it's like a lot of that stuff

1073
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:44,351
What are the reasons it's good for you to do an episode

1074
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,143
Get

1075
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:49,727
A lot of thought I don't get

1076
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:54,847
I don't think that I could credibly have a conversation about it

1077
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,919
But the business side of it and

1078
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:00,223
Very simple to understand

1079
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,015
And it should give people reason

1080
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
To be like

1081
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,575
Hold the f*** on

1082
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,623
Who are you saying these things

1083
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:09,183
Does that in Subway invalidate

1084
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:09,951
The message that you

1085
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:19,935
That's not to say that from the Koch brothers like that

1086
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,983
The fun that doesn't mean that every

1087
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,519
Wrong

1088
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:26,335
It just means that when you hear someone saying

1089
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:28,895
The funding

1090
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:33,503
As a business interest in the messages they're putting out

1091
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,295
Find out if they're locked

1092
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,343
Is it should be like

1093
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,391
A call to action

1094
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,535
You see that connection you got to double-check thing

1095
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,095
Absolutely can't take it

1096
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:48,863
Face value

1097
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,423
Oh boy

1098
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:59,359
Like like we said so many times this is all normal nothing's unusual

1099
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,383
All the time in history

1100
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,175
It's no big deal

1101
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:07,295
Climate is in the history of the Earth right now and probably the 10% coldest. In the Earth

1102
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:12,159
Geologic history

1103
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:17,023
Where we can have ice at both poles Like We Do Not So geologically speaking

1104
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,583
How old is the Earth

1105
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:25,983
Roughly younger

1106
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:29,055
You know what's crazy even if that was right

1107
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:40,575
100 100

1108
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,623
Voicemail

1109
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,951
So if you're going to stay in the entirety of the Earth's history

1110
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,743
90% of it has been warmer

1111
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,303
So you're talking about

1112
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,583
5 billion years

1113
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,863
Yeah alright

1114
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,983
Four Points

1115
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:04,383
Well I had a rough go of it last time

1116
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:08,223
Right now he's talking about 90% of the Earth's history

1117
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:11,295
When it was completely and utterly uninhabited

1118
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:12,831
Then

1119
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,111
You're talking about

1120
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:17,951
Him saying oh well we didn't have ice

1121
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,999
We had one giant f****** continent

1122
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:23,327
The Earth was absolutely hotter back

1123
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,631
Exactly

1124
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,727
Is absolutely

1125
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,495
In Earth's history

1126
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:33,823
This is the first thing you said that is unequivocally

1127
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,895
Let's go through some of the times

1128
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,663
Set the climate

1129
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,223
EarthSky

1130
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,527
We've had a lot of

1131
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,295
Live

1132
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,111
And we've had a lot of not like

1133
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,951
Alright always flourished when there's a balance

1134
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,999
Between CO2

1135
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,279
Greenhouse gases

1136
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:57,631
There was a ton of methane in the air during the Cretaceous

1137
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,703
That wasn't that big of a deal

1138
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:03,775
Because during that time there was also a s*** ton more oxygen

1139
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:04,799
So plant

1140
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:08,127
Grew so much bigger that's why we could support dinosaurs

1141
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,663
Being as large as they were

1142
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,199
So like flirt

1143
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:18,879
Supporting dinosaurs

1144
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,439
Get a job

1145
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:36,287
Central nervous systems that we do a lot of stuff like that were able to thrive

1146
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,823
Supposed to

1147
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,103
A lot of primate life

1148
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,735
What happens when you see rapid climate

1149
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,551
Similar to what we're experiencing right now

1150
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:53,439
When you go back through history and you see the history of climate change because the earth's climate has changed a bunch

1151
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,791
I thought you were going to

1152
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,375
I'm guessing a lot of things die

1153
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:07,263
450 million years ago during the middle Cambrian. A mass extinction occur

1154
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:08,799
Guess what

1155
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,943
Due to an increased

1156
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,711
Amount of

1157
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:21,855
During the Permian era around 200 years ago

1158
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,135
Guess what

1159
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,415
God meteor

1160
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:29,279
In the Triassic around 200 million years ago

1161
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:32,607
Guess what

1162
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,631
All of them

1163
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:36,191
We're absolutely losing a battle with the

1164
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:38,751
Global temperatures

1165
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:42,079
Rising sea levels and ocean ocean acidification

1166
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:48,991
Yeah man went to the Chicago Museum

1167
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:52,319
Installation about the various

1168
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,087
Comes over time

1169
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:55,391
That was something that was clearly

1170
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:57,183
A piece of the

1171
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:02,047
Museum of that if you go through the entire

1172
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,839
Get to the end

1173
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:10,239
Hey guess what we're doing right now are humans going to be one of these are the only ones who are

1174
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:14,591
And if he hasn't yet

1175
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,639
Weird

1176
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,455
Everybody

1177
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,223
Everybody

1178
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:21,247
Pretty much

1179
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,271
Like it

1180
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,295
Fossil

1181
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,319
It is

1182
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,087
Awful

1183
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,879
Good news

1184
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,159
Antarctica growing

1185
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,695
So we don't need to worry

1186
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:32,767
That's cuz it plans to support it

1187
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:35,839
Everybody knows that it's growing so much

1188
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:36,863
Guess what

1189
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,911
Antarctica

1190
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:44,287
NASA study show this actually growing the ice the land-based glacier ice had been

1191
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:47,615
Expanding and it's contributing to a sea level

1192
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:54,783
Before I respond to that is that true

1193
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:58,111
Growing in land mass

1194
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:02,975
Glaciers are being rebuilt

1195
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:03,999
And the like

1196
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,047
Okay walk me through that

1197
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,375
The Caesar not lowering

1198
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,447
It seems

1199
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,519
Not even faked

1200
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:19,871
Not even the studies that are funded by these people to prove

1201
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,687
That glow that climate change isn't real

1202
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,223
Show that the fees are low

1203
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:25,503
Nothing

1204
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,575
He's making that up he's just making that up

1205
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,343
Now

1206
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,111
Antarctic

1207
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,135
Cic

1208
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,415
He's growing

1209
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,975
There are a lot of explanations for that

1210
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:38,559
But mainly it is surrounded by a polar current

1211
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,095
That separates it from the

1212
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:44,191
The rest of the the the oceans are functioning

1213
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:47,007
Hi there is also more snow on

1214
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:47,775
Antarctica

1215
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:53,663
Which if you have a bunch of snow packed on top of ice it's going to keep it colder for longer

1216
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,943
So it's not going to fall apart

1217
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:58,015
This argument however is

1218
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,039
Because

1219
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,575
Since the late

1220
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:07,999
The Antarctic has gained about 7300 square miles

1221
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,279
Dearly

1222
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,303
Which is

1223
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:11,583
Pretty cool right

1224
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,607
I guess

1225
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:19,775
I don't want to answer

1226
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,311
The Arctic however

1227
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,871
Has lost about 2100 square miles

1228
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:31,807
Florida

1229
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,087
It is

1230
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:33,855
F******

1231
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,647
Stupid to make that Arc

1232
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:38,207
Not just because the sea levels aren't

1233
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:42,559
But because even if they even if Antarctica was growing enough

1234
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,351
The Arctic is losing

1235
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,911
10 million Deadlight so much more

1236
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,191
Ice per year

1237
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,983
Then the Antarctic could ever grow

1238
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,079
A lie on both

1239
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:58,175
That wouldn't be a big deal if there was a 12-1 like

1240
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:02,783
Arctic just completely melts off and all of it

1241
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:03,807
Gets all of it

1242
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:14,047
Bok

1243
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:27,615
Pacifica

1244
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:39,647
Grade B

1245
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,231
I don't know

1246
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:43,999
He's just lying

1247
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:47,071
I need

1248
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:50,143
It never ceases to amaze me

1249
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,679
The way this guy

1250
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:54,239
Because he is a

1251
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,519
F******

1252
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,287
Squeeze ball

1253
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:58,079
I'm guessing unlikely situation

1254
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,615
Rihanna and Eminem

1255
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:02,943
You do not love

1256
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,759
I do like the situation between Rihanna

1257
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,807
I think they have a strong

1258
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:14,207
Absolutely that's that's a lot of people say relationship

1259
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:18,303
Beds

1260
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,071
Astro

1261
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,631
Realize

1262
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:28,543
Hawaii everything is music references

1263
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:37,247
Because

1264
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:42,367
This is something that he absolutely knows is not true right it's not based on

1265
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:45,439
He's like the scientists that he imagines erasing history

1266
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,511
But with the facts

1267
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,791
But you can't know that

1268
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:52,095
He can't

1269
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:52,863
Water levels

1270
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:53,887
Alright

1271
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:54,911
You're not

1272
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:55,935
Lauren

1273
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:58,495
He can't know that

1274
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,543
Do not know

1275
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,847
Exactly that's called

1276
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:03,871
He can't

1277
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:04,895
No

1278
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,431
How much ice the Antarctic

1279
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,991
Without also knowing

1280
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,295
How much ice Arctic is lose

1281
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:15,135
Right because those can only exist in comparison with each other

1282
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:18,719
Otherwise you're just saying well I guess the Antarctic is getting bigger

1283
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,255
Like

1284
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:24,607
Nobody nobody is put together a study about

1285
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,655
That without

1286
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:29,215
Pointing out how much ice we're losing

1287
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:29,983
Right cuz it's

1288
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,519
It's important

1289
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:34,335
The only people who

1290
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,871
Out that the Antarctica

1291
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:38,687
Is growing

1292
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,455
Well

1293
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:43,551
Do you know what I'm about to say I have a

1294
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,575
Premonition

1295
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,879
They're not using

1296
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,415
Their own information

1297
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,951
What they're doing

1298
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:53,279
Is there taking studies that other people have done

1299
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,303
Who are those people

1300
01:09:56,095 --> 01:10:00,703
Legitimate site

1301
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:07,359
Antarctic

1302
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,127
His growing

1303
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:12,735
Is based off of the same data from scientists who say who have been proving

1304
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:13,503
The internet

1305
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,271
Because growing

1306
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,807
And the Arctic is

1307
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,575
Dying

1308
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:18,879
And they're trying to figure out why there's the

1309
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:21,183
Explanation

1310
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:21,951
But

1311
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,231
Ultimately

1312
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,255
What these

1313
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,279
People are doing is

1314
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,047
Fake

1315
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:29,119
Check collect information

1316
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,655
Absolutely

1317
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,215
You know what this really comes back

1318
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:35,263
What's that comes back cigar

1319
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:37,567
Because algora also featuring him saying that

1320
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,847
We need ubiquitous for

1321
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,871
Fertility management

1322
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:44,479
Otherwise we need to prevent the number of African countries

1323
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,759
Population increase

1324
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,135
I'm not sure what he saying

1325
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,439
I'm not sure where you staying at

1326
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:57,791
About Al Gore

1327
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,071
Is that

1328
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,095
Al Gore

1329
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,399
Says that in order to fight

1330
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,215
To give

1331
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,007
Ubiquitous fertility

1332
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:09,567
We need to control the population

1333
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,639
Or provide them with birth

1334
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,407
Control options

1335
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,455
Well if you want to hear the actual

1336
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:25,439
Dubai will control I will get

1337
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,583
The real quote from Al Gore

1338
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,119
From this

1339
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,399
Interview

1340
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,167
Take talking about

1341
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:38,751
Depressing the rate of child mortality

1342
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:41,055
Educate educating girls

1343
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:46,431
Empowering women and making fertility management ubiquitously available

1344
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:48,735
So women can choose how many children

1345
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:49,759
And the spacing of

1346
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,391
For lying about

1347
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,183
I just want to control the population

1348
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:58,719
That's always

1349
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:01,023
You could dig into and you always find it's like

1350
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,303
Everything they're talkin

1351
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,583
I'm about as providing

1352
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,351
The option

1353
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,399
The opportunity the availability

1354
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,423
People

1355
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:10,239
Is a very tired argument

1356
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,519
Oh yeah

1357
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:12,543
These right-wing dick

1358
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,311
Oh yeah

1359
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:14,847
The bomber

1360
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:19,199
Because it really would be revolutionary 8

1361
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,223
Developing countries

1362
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:22,271
The ability to not

1363
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,671
The super health

1364
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:29,695
Absolutely

1365
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,231
And that's why

1366
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,255
People on the right

1367
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:36,607
Aren't interested in that kind of a

1368
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:40,191
Yep

1369
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:43,519
Don't rely on

1370
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,055
European Cup

1371
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,079
Sprite

1372
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:48,127
This guy

1373
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:49,663
This guy is

1374
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,223
Basically saying that

1375
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,015
Al Gore

1376
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:56,575
What's to control the population of Africa

1377
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:58,367
Eugenics

1378
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,135
Right

1379
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:01,695
And Al Gore is actually saying

1380
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:05,535
I think we should Free People

1381
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,095
Yep

1382
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:11,167
Al Gore's involved

1383
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:13,727
I don't know

1384
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:14,751
Everybody

1385
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:21,151
But it goes all the way to the top

1386
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,943
Arguing

1387
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:27,039
There's nothing to worry about

1388
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:29,855
This guy is a will

1389
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:33,183
And sadly unfortunate Pope Francis has beds

1390
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:38,047
Blind himself with advisor that have a similar mindset

1391
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:38,815
Doctrine

1392
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,607
With his advisors

1393
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,399
Is a Jesuit

1394
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:49,567
So all the way to the top

1395
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:53,407
Has Pope Francis said we should worry about clutch

1396
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,687
Yeah yeah

1397
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:03,391
How bad this is hurting for the the conservative Folk

1398
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,975
And it's all because of climate

1399
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:07,999
Right

1400
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,023
All of this stuff

1401
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:14,399
I just I love it whenever anybody throws in the pope like this entire interview

1402
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,167
Has

1403
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:21,567
Only like he's just making false b******* and just saying it out loud and then all the sudden he's just like you know

1404
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,615
Poke does it to

1405
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:30,015
You know the Pat Robertson Evangelical and as a healthy distrust

1406
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,551
Of the paper

1407
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:36,159
And s*** like that

1408
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,951
Real skepticism of catalysis

1409
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:42,047
It makes sense that he would try and throw that

1410
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,327
Anime

1411
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:47,935
I didn't even consider that of course he's just

1412
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,471
That's that's

1413
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:50,495
Bear

1414
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:51,519
Good for him

1415
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:55,103
Krowd

1416
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,407
That would do well at

1417
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,479
He's

1418
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:02,015
Got Al Gore

1419
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,807
Right he's got the Pope

1420
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,879
And he's got all these signs

1421
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,975
Have you ever heard that 97% of scientist

1422
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:13,535
Does the grief I have heard that that climate change

1423
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,863
Forever you are generally heard that

1424
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:19,167
From people on like ham

1425
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,959
Who are attacking

1426
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:24,799
From what I understand that number there's nuance

1427
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:27,615
It's not as simple as the 97% number

1428
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,407
But

1429
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:30,943
Bat

1430
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,759
Tell me what the truth is

1431
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,575
That Mark is about to tell us

1432
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:43,487
And Al Gore claim back in the early nineties that they were all scientists agree 7%

1433
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:48,607
In one of the studies

1434
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:52,447
Anonymous we don't know who they are and they claim a 97% consensus

1435
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:55,519
97 scientists

1436
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:59,359
I've always wanted to look into the 97%

1437
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:04,735
Cuz you listen to that even if you are on the left and you are like

1438
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:07,295
Not a climate-change bulshit fat fuk

1439
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:10,367
Are you looking at near 97% you like

1440
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:18,815
I mean I guess it's just a symbol of like look

1441
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,863
This is overwhelming

1442
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:24,703
Get me 7% number isn't as important as

1443
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,751
The symbol that

1444
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,103
To study

1445
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:35,199
Naomi oreskes put together a 2004 study

1446
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:37,503
That produced the first 97%

1447
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:42,111
Hell yeah that mention climate

1448
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:45,183
Of the studies that found a result

1449
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,975
And then supplied an opinion

1450
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:52,351
So they went through their information they found this change or this thing

1451
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:54,399
They confirmed or denied this thing

1452
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:56,703
And then supplied an opinion as to why it was

1453
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,471
Was going on

1454
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,823
97% agree

1455
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:03,359
That anthropogenic

1456
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,383
Climate change

1457
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,151
Is

1458
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:06,431
Is real

1459
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:11,295
What she did though wish you'd like Nexus search

1460
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:13,343
Not Nexus but you know

1461
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:15,903
Simple

1462
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:18,207
Simple search there of papers looking at

1463
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,999
Keywords peer-reviewed papers

1464
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:22,559
She wound up throwing away half of those papers

1465
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:24,095
Because they didn't

1466
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,399
Exactly they didn't really matter

1467
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:29,215
Energy disqualified the ones that

1468
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:30,751
Came up with a

1469
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:35,359
I like

1470
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:37,919
We don't know and we're not sure

1471
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,711
Useful for

1472
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:42,527
The overview

1473
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,575
Exactly exactly

1474
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:46,111
So at the end of the day

1475
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:48,927
She got 97% of those papers

1476
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:51,743
That answer

1477
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,839
The driver of

1478
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:56,607
So it's

1479
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:58,143
Not exactly like

1480
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:00,447
That 97% of all science

1481
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,495
2013

1482
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:06,079
Jungkook and the people that were working with him

1483
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,871
At the time try to repeat that

1484
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:10,175
And they found

1485
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:12,223
Almost exactly the same result

1486
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:18,623
Using different studies using different studies and they went through the what is

1487
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,391
The App Store

1488
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:25,023
Like finding a result or anything like that

1489
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:25,791
Just

1490
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:28,607
What did these guys summarize their findings at

1491
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:31,167
97% of them

1492
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,447
Wound up being

1493
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:33,983
Anthropogenic climate

1494
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:37,055
This is

1495
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:41,151
The reality of the 97% number

1496
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,175
Is closer to

1497
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:44,479
If you were to survey

1498
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,503
Climatology

1499
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:48,831
People who only study the climate

1500
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:51,135
Not just climate change but just like hate

1501
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,415
All of that stuff

1502
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:55,231
Real number would be

1503
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:57,023
If not 100%

1504
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,815
99.9 person

1505
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,583
Right

1506
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:03,679
If you study if you go through all non-climate

1507
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:08,799
Everybody who is considered a scientist in doing research that is related

1508
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:09,823
To climate change

1509
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:13,151
You get closer to like 90 to 295

1510
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,455
Again

1511
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:17,247
Of all of those studies

1512
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,551
The only people that will come out on

1513
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,319
Record

1514
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:22,623
The only people that will come out publicly

1515
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:25,695
As advertised their research

1516
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,143
No idea

1517
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:38,239
So the 97% claim is

1518
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,007
Both

1519
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,311
True

1520
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,871
I don't know 8 almost

1521
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:45,407
Almost left impact

1522
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:48,479
Because I would rather hear them say

1523
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:54,367
A hundred percent of climatologists the people whose entire life studying the climate

1524
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,159
Agree that climate change is happening

1525
01:19:56,415 --> 01:20:00,255
Yeah but I bet it isn't even like

1526
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,047
Denying

1527
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:02,815
Climate change

1528
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:06,655
Ambivalent

1529
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,935
Neutral

1530
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,751
Results in their commentary or whatever like

1531
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:11,775
We weren't able to

1532
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:12,543
Define

1533
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,336
Any evidence but it

1534
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:16,640
It doesn't disqualify the possibility

1535
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,760
In the Naomi

1536
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,040
From a 2000

1537
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:23,808
4

1538
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:26,880
When she was going through

1539
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:30,720
Papers that qualified

1540
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:31,744
Supplied an opinion

1541
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,048
Any pinion genuinely was

1542
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:36,608
This is not attributable to answer

1543
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:37,376
Organic climbing

1544
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,912
But that doesn't mean

1545
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,472
Exactly

1546
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,776
Primary

1547
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,568
Exactly

1548
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:49,152
Percent is probably even like

1549
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,944
That's an illusion of itself

1550
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:51,968
Exactly

1551
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,272
This whole thing is

1552
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:59,904
It's just manufactured in a way that

1553
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,512
Disgusting

1554
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:05,792
It really is

1555
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:10,400
Because the argument that you would come back to write is

1556
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:15,520
I say the only scientist to come out on record as saying that it's not interpret any climate

1557
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,080
They're all paid by

1558
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:22,688
And then the right-wing would come back and say well

1559
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,456
No

1560
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,504
You hate business than sovereignty

1561
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:28,576
But they would also say like

1562
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:32,928
Oh yeah well whatever it is like that

1563
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,976
The biggest difference

1564
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,024
Is that a climatology

1565
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:40,096
Would still be studying the climate

1566
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,632
Is climate change wasn't

1567
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:42,912
That's true

1568
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,192
That's their job

1569
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,728
The climate deniers

1570
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:50,080
Legitimately would not have a job if there was not climate change

1571
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,872
The climatologists

1572
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,408
Would still study the climate

1573
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,200
Yeah there's a parasitic

1574
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,248
Exact

1575
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:11,072
Start tonight in climate change might be a little too late in the episode 4

1576
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:17,472
Yeah yeah I realize that now

1577
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,496
Imports

1578
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:22,080
Donor fund money but

1579
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:28,480
Significantly proven my point and now I shall deny climate change much like what I got.

1580
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,160
What do they use the 97

1581
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:37,440
How to do

1582
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:38,720
I mean

1583
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:42,048
What it what is

1584
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:44,608
Ask yourself that question

1585
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:46,912
I just did

1586
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,960
Everybody everybody

1587
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:50,496
They use it

1588
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,800
To do something

1589
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:56,384
97% claim with

1590
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,480
Who use that to bully people and otherwise

1591
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:01,760
You don't know about

1592
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:04,064
Don't know enough about science you can't count

1593
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:08,160
Bullies there's such bully

1594
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,256
I could not find a un scientist who said it was pulled out of

1595
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:18,912
Lord monckton

1596
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:23,776
His book he was cited in Mark marinas book at 3:15

1597
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,312
Oh yeah

1598
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:28,128
Crazy old Kook Lord mostyn

1599
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:28,896
It's just

1600
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:33,504
This infuriated because

1601
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:34,784
His

1602
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,808
Book

1603
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,600
With the line

1604
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:42,720
That's a good start that's a great start right

1605
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:46,560
Climate the politically incorrect

1606
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:49,120
Hatchet-man I am a hat

1607
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:51,168
And to bully people

1608
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:58,592
Unnamed scientist is also probably pandering

1609
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:04,992
Robertson believe it has to do with

1610
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:08,064
Revolution

1611
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,600
Nonsense

1612
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:11,392
I think that is also an

1613
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,672
Playing the room

1614
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:16,768
A little interested to ask him who he's talking about

1615
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:17,792
You can't find

1616
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:23,424
We might be talking about them probably is

1617
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:29,824
Because he does show up at the UN

1618
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:34,176
But it is not too long ago

1619
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,224
An unnamed climate

1620
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:42,368
Generally I find when you don't name something it's because you don't want people to look into it

1621
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:45,952
Persuasive

1622
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,232
Speech

1623
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,768
You don't use specifics

1624
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,048
Because you don't have the

1625
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:50,816
Haha

1626
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,096
But I've learned

1627
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,888
The last two years oh yeah

1628
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:56,704
That's

1629
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:58,240
It is

1630
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:00,544
It is ridiculous to me

1631
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:05,152
This guy cuz this guy is not just done at Robertson

1632
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:07,712
This guy's been on actual TV

1633
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,136
I think I know this guy

1634
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:18,208
I just hate it he's such a used car sales

1635
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,560
Yeah it seems like

1636
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:27,168
Glimpses that you provided

1637
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:29,984
Believe that

1638
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,008
He's not

1639
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,056
Engaging with

1640
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:38,432
Before argument over the place

1641
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:40,992
Yeah and this is almost the full interview

1642
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:50,976
His questions

1643
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:57,632
No cool exactly

1644
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,936
Marla sokoloff

1645
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,800
And so I'm really cutting out of this interview is like him gone

1646
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,176
Like that's that's really what I've got to go

1647
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,200
Yeah yeah

1648
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:14,016
There's a few chunks worth like I don't

1649
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:14,784
Me too

1650
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:17,856
Find you you pull your b*******

1651
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,904
You know that's not true any

1652
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,696
Even while he's staying

1653
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:23,232
Completely not true stuff

1654
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:25,280
The stuff that I cut out with him like

1655
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:30,656
Almost winking to the audience like with a giant Beyond wink sign of life

1656
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,704
You and I both know this s*** is

1657
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,008
True but we're all here together

1658
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:35,776
Like that

1659
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:41,152
All I wanted to do is grab the stuff that it sounds like he's really trying to sell you on

1660
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:43,712
Like all of the stuff that I've grabbed so far

1661
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:46,528
Really wants you to believe it

1662
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:49,344
Like what do you get from

1663
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,648
Assholes

1664
01:26:54,976 --> 01:27:01,120
I'm sure the visual that's really all that I'm going to walk away from this way

1665
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:05,984
Not listening at all

1666
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:12,896
I'll probably later

1667
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:15,456
But the real villain

1668
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:18,528
Oh boy real villains of this whole thing

1669
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:22,624
Weather comes from

1670
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:24,160
So we like that

1671
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:32,096
According to Pat Robertson it all comes from the out-of-pocket

1672
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:37,216
What did you mean an out-of-pocket expense is not covered by water

1673
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:44,896
Sunspot activity kick it up a little bit

1674
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:48,992
Just like the scientist

1675
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:50,272
Who snuck in

1676
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:52,832
And removed the 1930s clothes were villain

1677
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:53,600
Those were built

1678
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:56,160
Mahler

1679
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:56,928
Horse

1680
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,720
Or even worse

1681
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:01,280
Ganondorf I'm going to tell you there

1682
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:03,072
Biggest crime right now

1683
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,096
Or actually Marcus

1684
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,120
And as well

1685
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:09,984
It's actually I plan out a quart of activist un scientist people like Michael Oppenheimer

1686
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:13,312
Who took money from Barbra Streisand quarter million dollars

1687
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:19,968
Oh yeah

1688
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:26,368
It goes all the way to the

1689
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:30,464
Not Barbara

1690
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:35,584
Do you know my favorite part of this quote

1691
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:39,936
This quote comes from one place

1692
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:44,288
Barbra Streisand

1693
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:47,872
James inhofe

1694
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:54,272
Set motherfuker

1695
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:58,368
Martial law being threatened

1696
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:01,696
He's an absolute dick who wrote his speeches

1697
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:03,232
Aaron Russo

1698
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:10,144
Whenever he said that Barbra Streisand was behind the core of climate activist

1699
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:14,752
It's Mark Marino Dorado

1700
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:18,848
I thought there's no way that's who it is but it's got to be

1701
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:25,248
Cerina Vincent

1702
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:29,344
I wrote the speech was other guy to deliver and then I decided it

1703
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:36,512
First I heard of this s*** that's a crazy badger

1704
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:40,096
Trick.

1705
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:41,888
Wow

1706
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:43,936
Wow

1707
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:50,336
That's pretty cool but I look Alex doesn't have the ability to do something like that

1708
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:54,176
Who played something

1709
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:56,736
So he could beg use it for his own

1710
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:59,040
That's 15 years later

1711
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:05,440
Has said Barbara's right I looked it up for forever

1712
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:07,744
Leaning

1713
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,280
Celebrities

1714
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:15,936
She comes up as a Target dollars to literally anyone.

1715
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:20,288
Relationship

1716
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:23,872
Item recovery.

1717
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:26,688
The Destroyer

1718
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,760
But we got to talk about the heroes

1719
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:34,880
We got to talk about the heroes like we're on the way single man

1720
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:38,464
Fighting against the system that is designed to destroy them

1721
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,768
So we have all these activists

1722
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,048
Being paid

1723
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:43,072
5 Barbara Street

1724
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:46,144
Without you

1725
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:52,032
But we have some Heroes million dollars

1726
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:58,432
We're burying the lead on that but that's not that much money in terms of actually going through with

1727
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,712
Like a high-level study

1728
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:06,112
Let's go let's fucken places need to operate like actual labs

1729
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:09,696
Isn't down Manson Liquors

1730
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:16,096
Speedway

1731
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,632
1331 dollars

1732
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:27,872
Hey that's just stuff you can trace around but not on the bus

1733
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,944
It's like covered by

1734
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:34,016
Pre-speech kind of ideas

1735
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:36,576
Pretty much money is speech

1736
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,392
Talked a lot about

1737
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,440
We have

1738
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:43,744
Talked a lot about how these guys give these money

1739
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:46,048
Giving it to the

1740
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:47,584
Okay

1741
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:50,912
And there are few scientists who are willing to Buck

1742
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,472
Really thrilled to hear that

1743
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:56,032
And one of the scientist at Princeton

1744
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:57,824
In the book

1745
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,128
He said we're currently in a carbon dioxide

1746
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,920
Salmon on Earth

1747
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:03,456
Sounds like Alex

1748
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:06,528
Carbon dioxide

1749
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:13,440
I think actually now that I hear him like through this again like this unnamed Princeton scientist I think it's also

1750
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,720
I'm just realizing that Robert

1751
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,000
The fuc

1752
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:22,144
Why should I say the name

1753
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:31,104
I looked him up I found him

1754
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,712
Monster

1755
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:42,368
The Princeton physicist he's talking about is a Webster

1756
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:44,160
No

1757
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:46,208
Nevermind

1758
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,608
William

1759
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:59,008
A actually got a degree in Robert Forster studies old movies

1760
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:07,968
That's always late

1761
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:19,232
Trailer place in the lobby

1762
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:25,888
Rattler

1763
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:32,288
Movie that I thought was good time movie goddamn

1764
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:39,200
Tapper

1765
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:40,992
Okay

1766
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,272
By all accounts

1767
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,808
A really good physicist

1768
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:48,416
That's cool on credible

1769
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:50,464
No he's a really good physicist

1770
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:54,560
He was also the director of The George C Marshall Institute

1771
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:55,584
2015

1772
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,352
You know about

1773
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:58,912
Nope Marshall

1774
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:00,704
It was about two things

1775
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:02,240
Strategic Defense

1776
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:05,312
Add beer pong

1777
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,616
Pretty much

1778
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:08,896
But

1779
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:11,456
2015

1780
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:14,016
The Strategic Defense part

1781
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,552
Of the George C Marshall in

1782
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,368
Was like we got to get away

1783
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:19,904
From dr. William happer

1784
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:24,000
Cuz he's a f****** crazy climate denial months

1785
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:26,304
And they were like we're not

1786
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,840
We're not getting s***

1787
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:31,168
Because of you because you are so f****** crazy

1788
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:33,728
So he split the George C Marshall in

1789
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:36,032
And he took over

1790
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:39,360
Fart

1791
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:42,176
And created the CO2 coalition

1792
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,224
That

1793
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:46,016
As we go along

1794
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:48,064
Let's see

1795
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:51,904
When did George C Marshall Institute closed down in 2015

1796
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:53,440
It had

1797
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,208
It had to

1798
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:57,536
Because it was only taking in $300,000 in donations

1799
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,608
And expenses were at about 500

1800
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,424
Now

1801
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:06,240
Or actually last year

1802
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:09,056
According to the CO2 coalition

1803
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,360
Nonprofit exemption

1804
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:12,640
Application

1805
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:17,248
They will receive a total of 1.5 million dollars

1806
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:23,392
And it only spent about 1.1

1807
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:29,536
In 25

1808
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:34,656
Piper was the target of a sting operation

1809
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:38,752
Is even worse

1810
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:42,336
It was a Greenpeace

1811
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,384
Here's the short version

1812
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,176
These activists

1813
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:49,504
Posed as your Koch brothers

1814
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:51,552
And they went to him and they said

1815
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,856
We're going to need a study

1816
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:56,160
That proves what we wanted

1817
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:57,952
And he said

1818
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:00,256
I can do that for you got it

1819
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:03,584
I do that for you and I like how much do you how much do you

1820
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,400
We need to pay you

1821
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,192
We got to avoid the look of it

1822
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:09,216
Impropriety

1823
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:10,496
However

1824
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:14,336
If you were to make a donation to the CO2 coalition

1825
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:17,920
Well that's all on the up-and-up

1826
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:19,456
This is

1827
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:21,504
Absolute hammer

1828
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,320
All of these people

1829
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:26,368
Read first

1830
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:27,904
And then they do

1831
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:30,720
Write operation

1832
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:33,792
Has been played out over and over and over

1833
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:35,840
So when I say you like

1834
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:39,680
Donors trust is funding

1835
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:42,240
Funding them before the research

1836
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:46,080
Happens and their funding explicit understanding

1837
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:49,920
Study will find the conclusion that is desire

1838
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:51,456
Which is why

1839
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:53,248
This is why you pay up

1840
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:59,136
Frontera you're saying that this thing has happened over and over yet I believe that it's probably like happened a bunch

1841
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:05,280
Times of operation

1842
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:07,328
Over and over and over and over.

1843
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:09,376
How did bread get made

1844
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,400
Does it work

1845
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:12,192
That was done in 2015

1846
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:13,984
How do you think

1847
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:14,752
CO2

1848
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:21,408
It's tough to predict cuz the world is so stupid

1849
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:26,272
But you would want to say he's in prison

1850
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:28,832
We live in a dark dark timeline

1851
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:32,672
Probably super rich

1852
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:37,536
2018 Hazard getting close to a million dollars

1853
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:38,816
That

1854
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:44,448
Difference between 2016

1855
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,728
2017

1856
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:46,752
So that was to you

1857
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:49,056
Write this year he is grown even more

1858
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,384
Almost at Dublin

1859
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:54,944
Exactly

1860
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:55,968
Don't judge my map

1861
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:00,576
Which I

1862
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:01,856
Find very

1863
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:05,184
Interview

1864
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:08,512
I don't think that the laws of nature physics

1865
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:11,072
In chemistry have changed

1866
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,912
80 million years ago the earth was a very prosperous place

1867
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:17,984
And there's no reason to think it will suddenly become bad now

1868
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:19,776
Prosperous

1869
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:21,056
Weird word

1870
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:25,664
I mean in terms of like

1871
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:31,808
Conclusion is

1872
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:34,880
Vegas to be meaningless

1873
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:39,232
Still liking more than

1874
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:44,096
Nothing is going to touchmark Moreno's

1875
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:50,240
No it's not

1876
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,008
Solid

1877
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:54,336
Very impressive

1878
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:55,360
Oh yeah

1879
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:58,176
Let's see who else

1880
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:59,200
Just a

1881
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:00,992
Just a hammer this point home

1882
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:02,528
Happer

1883
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,320
Publicly praised

1884
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:06,880
James O'Keefe

1885
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:08,416
Multiple times

1886
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:09,952
Timothy wouldn't want it

1887
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:10,976
Praise

1888
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:16,352
People who do the things that got him into trouble

1889
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:18,144
James O'Keefe

1890
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:21,472
Operations

1891
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:25,824
We've got

1892
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,360
A very strong female

1893
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:29,408
And surprise

1894
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:30,688
Mark Marino

1895
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:31,712
Not stoked

1896
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,760
The UN climate

1897
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:34,528
She said

1898
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:36,576
Did Christina forget it

1899
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:41,184
We speak a centralized transformation that will make life on planet Earth very different

1900
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,464
That the UN

1901
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,232
Climate chief

1902
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:46,816
See anything bad about that

1903
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:49,376
You sing it like it's some sort of really

1904
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,144
Evil

1905
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:54,496
I just hear that I feel like

1906
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:56,288
Yeah yeah

1907
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:59,104
I think we do need to fundamentally change the whole bunch of

1908
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:02,944
Oh yeah

1909
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,992
Christina segarra

1910
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:06,016
F******

1911
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:07,040
Dope

1912
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:09,344
She has had a badass career

1913
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,416
At no point in time has she done

1914
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:15,232
She is one of those characters

1915
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:17,024
More especially the current

1916
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,304
Un climate

1917
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:20,608
Patricia Espinoza

1918
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:24,192
And she is also had a cool

1919
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:27,776
One thing that you can go back through with the UN climate change

1920
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:31,872
Is that they have ultimately

1921
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:33,408
I apologize

1922
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:37,760
Your accident attorneys General

1923
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:42,112
They are given

1924
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:43,904
Very little

1925
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:47,232
They have no ability to really affect it

1926
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:49,280
All of them though

1927
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:52,096
Have come to this position through being

1928
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:54,400
F****** amazing at their job

1929
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:57,472
Like these are people who are career diplomats

1930
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:59,008
And career scientist

1931
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,288
Who all have

1932
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:01,056
Given us

1933
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:02,592
F*** the whole time

1934
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:05,664
Like for instant with the current

1935
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:07,968
Climate

1936
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:10,272
Climate Chief Patricia

1937
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:11,040
Spinoza

1938
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:13,600
She has been a career Diplomat for Mexico

1939
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:15,648
Basically since she was like 25

1940
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,696
She's worked

1941
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:20,256
Non-stop for women around

1942
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:21,280
The world

1943
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:23,328
Everywhere she goes

1944
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:24,864
She has had a positive effect

1945
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:31,008
Patricia Espinoza Credit Paris Accord.

1946
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:32,800
Before she was

1947
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:33,824
The un's climate

1948
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:36,896
She would go through every place that she could

1949
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:38,688
She has an unimpeachable record

1950
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,224
F******

1951
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:46,112
Sales pitch to all of these people was incredible enough that people give her

1952
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:47,648
A top honor

1953
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:49,696
In terms of getting the Paris agreement

1954
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:53,024
This guy is saying

1955
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,584
Is very bad because she said

1956
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:57,120
Things will make

1957
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:58,144
Life on Earth

1958
01:41:58,656 --> 01:41:59,424
Yeah

1959
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:01,216
Different doesn't mean worse

1960
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:02,496
No it does not

1961
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:03,520
Well

1962
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:04,544
Let me tell you some

1963
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:06,592
Guess who this guy hero worship

1964
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:09,152
And it's not just Senator Senator James

1965
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:11,968
Worships that guy

1966
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:15,808
Yeah I would say that's probably right

1967
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:19,392
Once he stopped once.

1968
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:22,720
Inhofe

1969
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:24,256
Hand-speak

1970
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:26,304
He almost immediately

1971
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,096
Started climatedepot.com

1972
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:30,144
And that was

1973
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:31,424
Hint

1974
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,192
Byerly

1975
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:34,496
Because his connection to inhofe

1976
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:36,800
Let him to his connection to donors

1977
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:37,824
Right

1978
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:38,592
All of that

1979
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:43,200
But networking that's

1980
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,224
Oh yeah

1981
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,248
And he is

1982
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,112
We are bees

1983
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:51,136
Eating alive

1984
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:55,232
You know who else is eaten alive by d.c.

1985
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:56,000
We'll find out

1986
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:57,536
Scott Pruitt

1987
01:42:57,792 --> 01:43:01,120
Donald Trump VP

1988
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:03,424
Stood up to the climate-change establishment

1989
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:05,216
Okay

1990
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,240
Scott Pruitt

1991
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:08,288
He's eyes A man among men

1992
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,312
Scott Pruitt

1993
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:10,848
Is a piece of s***

1994
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,896
And realize this interview is that current

1995
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:17,248
This is from 2018

1996
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:20,576
Maybe five years ago or something

1997
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:27,488
This is what fruit was still of course

1998
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:29,280
Live because he's a giant piece of s***

1999
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:33,632
Everybody

2000
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:37,216
If you don't know the evil that's got Pruitt as done

2001
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:38,240
Not just

2002
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:41,312
Not just his like

2003
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:43,616
Scandals in the

2004
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:45,664
Cheating and stealing

2005
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:48,736
Misusing public funds and f****** everybody over

2006
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:49,504
For no reason

2007
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:51,040
Scott Pruitt

2008
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,088
Has

2009
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,392
Destroy the EPA from the inside

2010
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:57,696
It is only going to get worse

2011
01:43:59,232 --> 01:43:59,744
But

2012
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:03,072
If you are at you know everybody already knows the Scandal

2013
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:05,888
So I wanted to look more into Scott Pruitt

2014
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,704
And he and I share something

2015
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,544
Deeply quotes

2016
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:16,128
Which I love

2017
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,920
I love a baseball

2018
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:19,712
Scott Pruitt had a moment

2019
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:26,880
That I liked into Hitler getting denied from Art School

2020
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:30,464
He was asked to try out for the Cincinnati Reds second baseman

2021
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:33,024
And if he had made

2022
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:35,840
We would not have had to deal with Scott Pruitt at all

2023
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:43,776
How to deal with his

2024
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:46,336
Play baseball for Georgetown

2025
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,872
And

2026
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:50,176
Teammates

2027
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:51,968
Gave him the nickname

2028
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:53,760
Opossum

2029
01:44:57,088 --> 01:45:03,232
Linguistically it's not a bad name but it

2030
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:07,072
It does seem to imply traits that are conducive

2031
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:09,376
Also second bases

2032
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:10,912
Flower shop

2033
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:13,984
There's a lot of plays that happen

2034
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:18,592
Call second base is where you hide the coaches

2035
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:19,616
It's not like

2036
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:26,528
No.

2037
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:29,088
Well you can put somebody

2038
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:29,856
Now that good

2039
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:32,416
But you you bury somebody right field

2040
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:36,512
Only because they're an amazing hitter

2041
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:38,560
Where is the second baseman is the coaches

2042
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:40,864
The second baseman is the kid who

2043
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,144
Scrappy

2044
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:48,800
He works real hard he's got all those angles

2045
01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:59,296
You don't want to put them on first

2046
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,856
No you definitely

2047
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:04,672
First is where you get your

2048
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:08,000
Good morning think about it there

2049
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:14,400
This is been my TED talk about baseball

2050
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:21,056
Baseball is from watching a little bit of it

2051
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:33,856
Game first you got to hit a ball then got to get up at like 9

2052
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:38,720
I like that

2053
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:45,376
Find any of his like that

2054
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:51,776
No apparently

2055
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:53,568
Hit the only home run

2056
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:59,968
No

2057
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:03,040
Also no wait

2058
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:07,648
Pretty good I was wasn't talking too much

2059
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:13,024
I got to try out from Cincinnati

2060
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:19,680
The Reds back then

2061
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:23,776
Baseball player the show

2062
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:28,896
Look if you hit like 300 in college

2063
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:31,712
It doesn't translate to the to the Mesa

2064
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:33,760
Now you got to hit like 450

2065
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:36,320
Out of their butt

2066
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:41,184
Grew up in Broken Arrow Oklahoma

2067
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:46,304
Which is a rich suburb outside of John Travolta

2068
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:50,400
Now it is

2069
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:58,848
Movies in Broken Arrow

2070
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:05,248
I reference was very unconfident

2071
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:13,952
Berenstein Arrow Nicolas Cage in Broken Arrow

2072
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:17,792
After face off so they already switched my data

2073
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:20,096
Easy to make that mistake

2074
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:22,656
The reason that it's Scott

2075
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:23,680
Grew up in Brooklyn

2076
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:26,752
It's because Broken Arrow got its name

2077
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:29,824
Because that is one of the places that

2078
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:30,848
Andrew Jackson

2079
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:32,128
How did Native Americans

2080
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:33,408
During the trail

2081
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:37,504
Broken Arrow was then once again

2082
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:40,064
Stolen from the Native Americans

2083
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:41,856
Buy energy and oil in

2084
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:43,136
In Oakland

2085
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,720
Scott Pruitt is doing

2086
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:47,744
Did

2087
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,048
Everything possible to continue that leg

2088
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:54,144
Situation where his family was

2089
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,680
Was growing up there

2090
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:57,984
You kind of get that sense

2091
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:01,056
And this is the thing

2092
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,640
Like of course

2093
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:06,432
Scott Pruitt

2094
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:09,504
Is a member of First Baptist of Broken Arrow

2095
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:12,576
Which is a f****** megachurch

2096
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:15,648
Drake is a dick

2097
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:16,928
F****** monstrous

2098
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:19,488
Give me an example

2099
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:21,536
One of their pastors

2100
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:23,584
Is a atom mask

2101
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:28,192
And he is like the cool Pastor he's got tattoos on his arms

2102
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:29,984
He's the one who's out reaching these like

2103
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:31,776
Look I've been in the ship

2104
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:35,104
17 year old girlfriend

2105
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,664
He recently wrote this is a recent

2106
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:38,944
This is like

2107
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:39,712
2 days ago

2108
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:45,344
This is on a blog post

2109
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:47,136
So you know we got all caps

2110
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:51,232
Going on all over the hell yeah

2111
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:53,536
In the all caps that he wanted

2112
01:49:54,816 --> 01:50:00,960
Arises out of makes a better God over our lives

2113
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:07,616
Start that over I wasn't distracted by the yelling structural

2114
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:12,480
Arises out of

2115
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:17,600
God truly makes a better God over our lives than we do

2116
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:20,160
Okay I track it.

2117
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,464
Adult

2118
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:24,256
Sex outside of marriage

2119
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:30,912
All of the

2120
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:40,896
This is this is what this is about

2121
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,480
Sex outside of marriage

2122
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:46,272
Homosexuality

2123
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,600
From the doubt

2124
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:54,976
Plant design for physical intimacy is to be between one man and one woman

2125
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:56,000
In the confines of

2126
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:58,304
So they're great

2127
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:01,120
Don't fuc

2128
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,400
Yep

2129
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,728
Doesn't like I know that that

2130
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:09,312
It's not great we never like to hear it but

2131
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:11,872
Far outside of like

2132
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:15,456
The sort of things you hear in a lot of churches feel like

2133
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:20,064
I just like adding that on there because

2134
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:25,184
You know what Scott Pruitt's about Scott Pruitt

2135
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:26,208
Is that

2136
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:28,768
During his run for a turn

2137
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:32,352
He took a lot of money

2138
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:38,752
Please don't hurt him

2139
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:39,776
Of course

2140
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:43,360
Every

2141
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:45,664
Single f****** one of these people

2142
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:47,456
Is being

2143
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:48,224
Paid

2144
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:49,248
Deliberately

2145
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:51,296
Deliberately

2146
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:54,112
To destroy any and all opposition

2147
01:51:57,184 --> 01:52:00,768
But you we don't know that much

2148
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:03,584
When I'm looking at that stuff

2149
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:07,936
You know it's almost 100% of climate

2150
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:13,056
You know if there's a thousand climatologists

2151
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:15,360
One of them is going to take.

2152
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:18,176
You know like of course you're going to make a study that says Nah

2153
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:21,248
But even when you factor in like

2154
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:25,088
Meteorologist who are some of the worst offenders of like

2155
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:26,624
Weather is different

2156
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:29,696
Irabu f******

2157
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:32,000
Calm it down

2158
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:34,048
But

2159
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:35,328
Even even amongst

2160
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:36,352
All of those

2161
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:39,168
Nobody is going on

2162
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:40,960
Do you know what I mean

2163
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:43,008
Like the people who are going out

2164
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:46,080
Talking and making their stuff table

2165
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:47,360
They are pay

2166
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:51,968
The people who are you know when you go through that

2167
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:53,760
Ninety seven percent

2168
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:54,528
Study

2169
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:56,320
Their claims

2170
01:52:56,576 --> 01:52:58,880
Climate change is not anthropogenic

2171
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:01,440
Their claims are in those studies

2172
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:03,744
This is not attributed

2173
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:04,768
2

2174
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:05,792
Anthropogenic

2175
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:13,216
So even those people

2176
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:15,520
Like slightly relevant

2177
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:16,544
Through the actual study

2178
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:19,872
Exactly we might just be looking at a variable

2179
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:21,152
Right

2180
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:22,176
Disprove the answer

2181
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:23,968
Exactly

2182
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:26,784
I know a lot of the information in this episode is

2183
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,320
Of course repetitive

2184
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:33,440
I'm sorry I know it with a purpose though

2185
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:34,464
It's not like you're

2186
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:36,768
About differ

2187
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:37,536
People

2188
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:42,656
Throughout the story because driving home the point

2189
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:45,984
All of these people are ill

2190
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:48,544
Where you at where you at

2191
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:51,104
Position of vibes

2192
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:51,872
You can't

2193
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:54,432
That's what these people are

2194
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:56,224
Repeating stuff

2195
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:57,504
Just reinforcing

2196
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:04,672
Argument that people make so often

2197
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:13,120
You think 97% of scientists agree that if we had a heliocentric universe

2198
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:17,984
What about what about the great man theory of science

2199
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:20,288
F****** the entire

2200
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:24,896
When you go back and you look through all of those differ

2201
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:26,688
You'll find that

2202
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:33,344
The reason those one men were those one guy's those those great men

2203
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:35,136
Trends

2204
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:37,696
Is because the trends themselves were

2205
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:39,488
Based on entrenched power

2206
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:42,048
Power control

2207
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:43,584
97% of

2208
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,376
Weatherby

2209
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:48,192
Interrupt

2210
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:48,960
Or whatever

2211
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:53,824
And they were doing exactly now if you want to talk about the flowering of the Renaissance

2212
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,616
Those were commissioned

2213
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:56,896
Pieces

2214
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:58,176
So much of that was

2215
01:54:58,432 --> 01:55:01,504
I'm telling you I want this to be true

2216
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:02,784
You make it trip

2217
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:04,576
You make it be proved

2218
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:05,600
That this is true

2219
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:08,160
And those great men people

2220
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:11,232
We're the ones they were like yourself

2221
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:12,512
That kind of thing

2222
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,584
This

2223
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:16,352
Time.

2224
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:18,400
It's gotten away from that

2225
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:21,472
Universal control by powerful

2226
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:23,776
And now a scientific

2227
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:24,544
Consensus

2228
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:26,592
Infinitely more

2229
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:27,872
Then it did

2230
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:30,176
50 years ago then did a hundred years

2231
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:36,832
So when people give you that like

2232
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:37,600
Turn all that s***

2233
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:41,440
That's because Galileo was acting in the spirit

2234
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:42,720
Set the scientific

2235
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:43,744
Consensus

2236
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:44,512
Acting

2237
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:47,072
Yeah

2238
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:51,680
Take me to workout demythologize

2239
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:52,960
Those those

2240
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:53,728
Great

2241
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:57,312
Not strictly speaking

2242
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:58,336
True

2243
01:55:58,592 --> 01:56:02,176
The only the only

2244
01:56:02,432 --> 01:56:03,712
Almost utterly

2245
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:05,504
Singularly without

2246
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:10,880
Input from without like constant input from other scientists without a concert

2247
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:14,208
Formations obviously General

2248
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:19,584
What he wrote from Kippy in Mathematica that was the

2249
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:21,120
Only time and

2250
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:23,168
Scientific history I can think of where I was like

2251
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,984
Did you just did that s*** by him

2252
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:27,520
Self

2253
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:28,800
Yeah

2254
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:29,824
Mypoints

2255
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:32,896
I think pretty clear right

2256
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:39,552
Come to the end of this there's a lot of stuff

2257
01:56:41,088 --> 01:56:42,624
You know like the climate Gates

2258
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:44,416
Stop

2259
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:45,440
Misinterpret

2260
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:48,000
Things like that the decline nonsense

2261
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:49,280
Like I expected

2262
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:51,072
Some of that cuz

2263
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:53,120
He's hitting a lot of the normal

2264
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:56,192
Nothing that's absent

2265
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:57,984
I don't think it's the

2266
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:05,408
But

2267
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:06,176
I think you're

2268
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:10,016
Your point is very very well

2269
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:16,416
Playing fast and loose

2270
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:20,256
Did give me that great visual metaphor but

2271
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:25,120
Man has always been battling the shores

2272
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:26,656
Like an accidental

2273
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:30,240
Oh good

2274
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:34,592
At the fruit

2275
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:41,248
But I guess I guess we have

2276
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:47,648
I think we are on Facebook what if you want to

2277
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:53,280
Would you be able to find us

2278
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:54,304
Very foreign

2279
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,608
Changing roles

2280
01:57:57,632 --> 01:57:59,936
Garbage

2281
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:15,040
Tell you one guy though he is metaphorically

2282
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:16,576
Which would kill a guy

2283
01:58:16,832 --> 01:58:18,624
He is not literally done

2284
01:58:19,648 --> 01:58:20,416
PetSmart Purina

2285
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:26,304
Technically probably killed a guy though not necessarily with a poison

2286
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:28,096
That's Alex Jones
