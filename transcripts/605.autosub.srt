Today my bright spot

11

To the real Bass

12
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,032
The real made it real

13
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,056
Super simple

14
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
No but it is a food

15
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,944
Okay iced oatmeal cookies

16
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,344
Years ya-ya greens and I saw in the

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,880
Impulse buy section of course

18
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,416
Warsaw dollar for a bag of

19
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,208
Iced oatmeal cookies

20
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,512
Are they the kind with the animals

21
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,792
No

22
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:44,448
The point is delicious oatmeal Ginger kind of

23
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,848
I feel like I've aired so strongly on the side of like chocolate chip

24
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,664
And what have you are you sure that iced oatmeal

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,712
Gets left in the by the wayside and

26
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
It's not fair

27
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,808
You know I haven't had an iced cookie in a long time and

28
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
They are fantastic

29
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
This gets done Dirty by razor

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
You know what we've been eating

31
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:11,584
We've been trying to eat healthier last night we ate Brown bean cookies

32
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
Yeah

33
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,888
Yeah man

34
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,448
Not in the I still feel cookie

35
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:21,056
I furrowed my brow with you I have no idea what that even means. Cool

36
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:25,152
Yeah that's not your brakes

37
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:30,528
What are you got my Brightspot Dion is I just I don't

38
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,088
I think I've talked about it on the show

39
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,744
But a few weeks back I did an interview with Mike Wiley friend of the show close friend of mine

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,632
Mine for his podcast or whatever reviews

41
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
Bastard

42
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
Cast

43
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,728
I was a lot of fun I

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,824
Forgot to talk about it and then I took a look at it last night to see if

45
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:59,200
I couldn't remember all the b******* that I said you know whatever I've known since I was throwing up

46
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:05,344
And most of it was about my favorite PSI from the 90s which was an advertisement

47
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,112
Against

48
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
Aftermath

49
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
But

50
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,208
Unfortunately had a very

51
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,744
Catchy song about

52
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792
Isn't that math

53
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
I think

54
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,144
My buddy Hogan would sing that a lot

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,936
Here.

56
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:26,336
Stuck with me since the 90s and it's I will take any opportunity to talk about

57
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,896
Does drug PSAs from the 90s wear

58
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
Counterproductive

59
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,712
Misread not great

60
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,992
Not great

61
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:39,136
Opposite of fact it's like all you're doing is sitting at a couch should have a good time with you like

62
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,672
Is that bad

63
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,464
This is your brain on drugs

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
20K

65
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,328
Michael

66
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:54,240
Jordan today we have a sneaky snake episode going over

67
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,288
17th

68
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824

00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,872
Wow

70
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
My mouth

71
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,456
Krypton

72
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,296
All of that seemed like you were trying to get to Blackjack

73
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:13,696
Then you remember that it wasn't coming now you know it was iced oatmeal cookies

74
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:19,839
But that'll happen slow in my jaw down do it before we get to this 2003 episode

75
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,863
Chronicling

76
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
The past

77
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,007
And what we can learn from it about the present short time to say hello to

78
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,103
So first Alex's neck thank you so much are now policy walk

79
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:35,967

88
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:14,111
Well I'm not comfortable saying this out loud until I'm sure it's not some new cake with an Alex Jones mask

89
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,927
Anyway you know who you are your knowledge

90
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
Technocrat

91
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
I'm a policy wonk

92
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,727
Heroin

93
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
Yub

94
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Chick-fil-A large

95
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,151
Thank you so much

96
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:43,551
You know a lot of them are funny some of them are puns some of them are just names that when I think of the

97
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,111
The first one that I've really curious

98
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:50,719
I think we should set a character limit

99
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,791
Bridgewater to

100
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,375
140 not doing this 280 here's what we're going to do

101
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
Only one depends

102
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,703
Santa Claus

103
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,287
And also for some reason no split infinitive

104
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Sure

105
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:11,455
So Jordan wearing start off the show that's going to be a little bit of a shorter episode cuz there's

106
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,783
Not not a ton that happens with some stuff that is definitely worth

107
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,343
Discussing sound very interesting

108
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
But you know like a good

109
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:25,023
Good section of the episode is Alex talking to Larry Pratt from gun owners for America

110
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
Legit it's just

111
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:30,655
Why I love God nothing interesting going on it's just like

112
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:37,055
Wow bush is going to renew the assault weapons ban

113
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,615
Something that doesn't end up happening

114
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,663
It's kind of pointless

115
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
Alex does have some things

116
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,295
To say that are kind of relevant

117
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
To the situation

118
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
We find ourselves in

119
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,391
He is very worried

120
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,439
About an article that he read

121
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,743
That has to do with the scientist

122
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,303
Declaring that the end of the world of the Apocalypse

123
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,631
Is a 50-50 chance

124
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
What's a good article

125
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
He believed

126
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,775
Either happens or it doesn't 50/50

127
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,895
Alex believes that the most likely scenario for the end of the world is

128
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
The release

129
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,967
Ava superbio weather

130
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
Interesting

131
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,343
Okay I'm some of the support for why he thinks

132
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,391
This is a little dodgy

133
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
Porton down

134
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
4

135
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
Ground

136
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,575
3 rings

137
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
4 years ago

138
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
Uncorked

139
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
Wheat

140
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,927
Prepare

141
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
Important

142
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,895
Open bar

143
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,975
None of that is true

144
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Anker

145
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:10,143
This issue in a previous 2003 episodes

146
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
That stuff here

147
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:15,263
But there's one detail in that telling of the story that I have not heard Alex included

148
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
The narrative in the past

149
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,359
In previous times I've heard him talk about this

150
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,919
I've not heard alekseev at Porton down

151
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,991
Claimed that an animal rights activist broke in and stole the

152
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Mouth

153
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
Which then got released

154
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,343
Yeah Bruce Willis claims if that happen

155
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:34,207
That is a interesting wrinkle also detailed

156
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,511
Absurd that he doesn't usually included

157
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
Porton down

158
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,887
Hold these farms and told them get ready for an outbreak

159
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,703
I bet yeah that one was

160
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,543
That's nonsense with the reality of that is on a previous episode

161
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,079
Music the ministry of

162
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,103
Agriculture

163
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
They do that every

164
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,479
They call and say like hey are you prepared for possible

165
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
Sick animals

166
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,295
So there's a real

167
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
Problem with

168
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
The chain of events

169
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,159
Alex is the express

170
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,695
It's immediately apparent

171
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:10,815
Which is that an animal rights activist supposedly went on a bizarre almost certainly impossible mission

172
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,143
Stealing this virus just so they could release it kill animals

173
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
In the name of

174
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
Protecting animals

175
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
It doesn't make sense

176
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,799
From the standpoint of an animal rights activist

177
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,383
They'll never said that an animal rights activist

178
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
Had released

179
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Foot in mouth

180
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,759
This is what the guardian refers to as a quote rural myth

181
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
And here's the basic story

182
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:37,183
There's an animal sanctuary called the hillside which is home to over 800 rescued animals from

183
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
Farms

184
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,791
Some representatives from the hillside visited a farm called Burnside

185
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,839
Farm which happened to be one of the main Farms

186
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,119
Where animals came down

187
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
Mouth

188
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:51,775
They were not the only ones to visit though there was an inspection by the Ministry of Agriculture haven't received

189
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,055
Multiple complaints about the

190
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
The conditions that animals were kept on

191
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
On the farm

192
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,919
After the foot-in-mouth outbreak be

193
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,967
Began the folks at Burnside level

194
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,527
Accusations at Hillside Sanctuary workers

195
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,319
I've haven't been the source of the outbreak

196
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,367
But that's pretty much impossible

197
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,695
The hillside folks came to the farm in December 2000

198
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,255
The outbreak occurred in February 2001

199
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,071
In January 2001 the Ministry of Agriculture

200
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,863
So did their inspection and said quote

201
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,679
There were positively no traces of foot-in-mouth

202
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Send the pigs in the fall

203
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
For their part

204
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
A spokesman important

205
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,055
Actually said

206
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,615
Quote we have never worked on foot and mouth

207
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
That was their response

208
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,223
It's not that animal rights activists

209
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:38,623
From them as compared to what Alex said that their response was definitely

210
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,439
Movie and the other one was like we don't do with that

211
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:47,839
Alex is creating a fake way to present this world rumor as if it were the actual response of the people at Porton down

212
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,703
Any critical thinkers listening to his show should be asking themselves why he would do that

213
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,055
Certainly one possibility is that Alex just doesn't know anything and he's mixing up

214
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,127
Rural rumors with official statements from Bordentown

215
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:04,735
He could be that stupid and if so I would say he's probably not someone who should be taken serious

216
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
On the other hand

217
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
Another possibility is that Alex nosek

218
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
Exactly what he

219
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:15,743
Important down it claimed that an animal rights activist stole the virus that solidifies multiple things about his narrative

220
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,047
He can solidify any other way

221
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,119
The first is that foot-and-mouth originated at Porton down

222
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,447
Without this fake admission Alex can't demonstrate this

223
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
At all

224
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,239
The second thing

225
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,055
Is that if this is really truly the response

226
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,079
Bordentown head

227
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,871
There's still a bad guy

228
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,199
The story still has a villain that you can point to and scapegoat

229
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,503
And that second thing is super important

230
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
Because as

231
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
It often is the case

232
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:45,695
Yeah in 2007 the UK government released a final report on the foot-and-mouth outbreak and

233
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,487
While they were unable to come to a

234
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
Definitive

235
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,791
Conclusion about where it started

236
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327
They have a pretty good idea

237
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,887
There were two Labs that were right next to each other

238
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
IAH

239
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
And Muriel which word

240
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:00,287
They actually were doing work on foot and mouth

241
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:06,175
And so it's theorized that the foot-in-mouth found its way into the ground soil through deficient drainage

242
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
Support quotes

243
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,063
Very been concerned for several years that the effluent pipes

244
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
We're old and needed replacing

245
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,391
But after much discussion

246
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,439
Money had not been made available

247
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,255
Alex's narrative conveniently side steps

248
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
The actual aunt

249
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
Answer to this problem

250
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:27,167
Which is regulation that people actually follow regular inspections and government spending

251
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:33,823
By turning it into a story where evil animal rights activist told the virus Oz not to worry about about accidentally penetrating

252
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
His world

253
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,639
Cuz he doesn't have a good argument against it

254
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,711
I would love to no longer it like

255
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,295
We've done this for too many of the entirety of the human races

256
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,831
Is existence where it's like

257
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
Okay

258
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
We're studying

259
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:54,047
I'm sorry we just don't have the budget for it right now it's just going to not going to work

260
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,095
2 year later

261
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,423
If we had put just a little bit of money into that thing

262
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,311
From before we wouldn't be dealing with a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak

263
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,127
You know a good bit of

264
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
The research is necessary in terms of dealing with

265
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,015
Illnesses that are detriment

266
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,343
To Public Health is definitely true

267
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
Simultaneously true

268
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
We need

269
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
Make it safe

270
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,815
Do that is make sure that these drainage pipes

271
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,607
How is it that we can let

272
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,143
Drainage pipes go bad

273
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
Yeah so what

274
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:35,007
Leafy rise did there's a number of people who are you know going

275
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
Going in and out

276
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,799
Through like a

277
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,103
Construction worker again

278
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,919
And somehow this transfer to the farm

279
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:45,247
They were able to trace a possible

280
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,551
For the marathon that

281
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:53,439
It makes sense saying he's just completely making this up as a way of like

282
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,511
Building his fantasy of

283
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
These

284
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,607
Super things escaping from labs

285
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,935
You know it's a preoccupation that he's had for a long time and now he's

286
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
Play get out

287
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,055
Present we just can't do this any more often than say

288
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,895
If you recognize something Alex says from being in a movie

289
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,967
He is referencing the movie it is not realized

290
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:20,063
Being imitated by art or whatever that is true Alex was drinking

291
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,367
Elsa and

292
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,183
It came on and he was going

293
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:29,791
I'm so actually Alex has another reason why

294
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
The government did the

295
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,631
They released foot mouth for a reason

296
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
Somersworth

297
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
Yeah

298
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
That's right

299
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,279
The farmers were going to overturn the EU

300
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
Another rule

301
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,679
If there is a really accurate ontarget group who is just now getting political power

302
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,215
Does not exist

303
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:14,079
Probably not it's a little too convenient this

304
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:18,175
What was the motive

305
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,247
I don't know I think this is bulshit

306
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,807
Alex has a a bit of

307
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
Official sources

308
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:30,207
About race specific bioweapon got to have them

309
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
Then I don't think

310
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
This is good

311
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,119
World leader

312
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,703
Military technology

313
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
Rapist

314
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:09,119
So James is a magazine that uses publicly available information to discuss weapons and Military

315
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,935
I wasn't able to find anything suggesting

316
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:16,031
This or mansion with Alex's saying in James archives but I was able to find

317
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,055
The similar discussion

318
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,383
From an article published in the American free press

319
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,431
Hit you forgot America

320
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,759
Country prices that publication founded by Willis carto noted whites

321
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,783
Supremacist Tinashe

322
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,343
Anyway this article uses Anonymous sources

323
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,647
There's a lab at Porton down working Andres

324
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
Pacific bio

325
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,463
I find myself

326
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,255
Let's buy this sorcerer

327
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:42,655
Yeah if it were me I would also say that it was James and Knotts the white nationalist rag that I almost certainly got it

328
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
Prom

329
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,007
Yeah edited by my good buddy Tucker

330
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:53,407
To hide that you got it from the white nationalist magazine that you totally don't read cuz you're definitely above that

331
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:58,271
Call thing has no problem admitting

332
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,551
That's not a problem

333
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:06,207
But it is still appears to be laundered information unless unless there's something from James that like was in the heart

334
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:10,303
Hard copy of the magazine that I can't find I don't know

335
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,863
That's a lot of benefit of the doubt to give Alex

336
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,679
He may be red or hard copy

337
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,239
I try to be overly careful

338
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
There's a lot of talk about pork

339
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,639
Down

340
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
If it gets off track a little bit

341
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
Bought

342
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,999
I think he is where we have to start

343
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,791
Using specific language

344
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,583
Porton down isn't the last

345
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,375
It's actually a 7000

346
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
Baker science

347
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,191
A park with a bunch of laps.

348
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,263
The lab analysis talking about is on the ground

349
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,103
Actually called the defense Science and Technology laboratory or distal

350
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:00,479
The lab is owned and funded by the UK government primarily the ministry of Defense

351
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
Their other

352
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,575
Find identities also that are housed in the Science Park like

353
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,879
Plowshare Innovations and public health England

354
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,463
The area also includes tetricus

355
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,511
Science Park which is within

356
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,095
The portent

357
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,375
New sarum

358
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Enterprises

359
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:22,239
I guess it's possible that there's some lab that's within the area the Science Park

360
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
It's owned by a company that

361
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,799
The subsidiary of Carlyle Group

362
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
But that's not what Alex's suggest

363
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
Open here

364
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,175
The name Porton down to him means a specific lab

365
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,967
And that lab is the event scientist

366
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,247
Technology Laboratory

367
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,063
Which is definitely not owned by the Carlyle Group this is

368
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
Nonsense

369
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,719
Yeah I mean maybe it wanted they sell the land

370
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
No

371
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,559
Did they did they really like okay

372
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,839
You going to be 7000

373
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,863
I'm

374
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:54,751
It certainly wasn't Carlyle Group owns the UK government

375
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,127
So Oz is pretty concerned about North Korea on this episode

376
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
Still

377
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,431
Still

378
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
But he

379
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,735
He has

380
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
An interesting take

381
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,319
Number of stories that are coming out

382
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,855
Around this time

383
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,623
About

384
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,415
The family

385
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,231
But it is going up due to natural disaster

386
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
Some crops right

387
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,815
Alex

388
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,095
Why this s***

389
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,015
International

390
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,487
People Eater Goodrow

391
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,007
Brexit

392
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,728
I'm sorry I won't do that anymore

393
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,568
So we got a lot

394
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
2

395
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:40,736
Break down here I'm going to need a real lot more information on this year

396
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,552
Apologies yeah actually that is true but Alex's

397
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,088
Very wrong about it

398
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,368
There have been

399
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:52,000
Confirm stories that pop up periodically about people eating other people in North Korea that is true

400
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
But what's more difficult is trying

401
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,376
And figure out how prevalent it is and how accurate these stories are

402
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,680
It's really hard to assess the situation

403
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,704
Because you know

404
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,288
Refugees have told stories of people being driven to starvation at

405
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
And eating other people

406
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,664
But because of how shut off the world from the world North Korea

407
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
We don't know

408
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,224
Watch past those addict

409
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,040
Internal propaganda

410
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,064
Is eating just fine

411
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,136
So I have to go by there

412
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:25,024
There's three times in the last 20 years or so when cannibalism in North Korea stories made the rounds in our press

413
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:29,376
These were in the late nineties in 2003 and in 2013

414
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,936
And each of these times marks

415
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,752
The aftermath of a large and devastating famine

416
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,800
Involving almost certainly combination

417
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,080
The Pacific

418
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,384
And crops being destroyed by natural disaster

419
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:47,040
I don't know exactly what's going on in North Korea or how widespread any cannibalism may have been but I can

420
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
Can say that Alex saying that this

421
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
You know what

422
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,392
Appointed to a severe famine this

423
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
The liberal spin

424
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
That's really dumb

425
00:22:53,952 --> 00:23:00,096
Also able to do anything to be able to vote for Donald Trump jr. right now and he would welcome that hereditary dictator

426
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,656
Leadership questions at 100%

427
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,936
Also

428
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Just real quick

429
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,984
I'm not saying goodbye.

430
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
Phone number

431
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,032
Talk about it okay

432
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,568
Kim Jong-il

433
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,360
Kill the movie stars that he kidnap

434
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,664
Alex is making up

435
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,224
This have to do with shinsei cork

436
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,760
And joy

437
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:18,784
Moonhee

438
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,344
Who were formerly a married couple

439
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,904
Was a movie director and joy was an actor

440
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:31,072
They were kidnapped in 1978 and taken to North Korea where they were forced to make movies with the objective of heightening North

441
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:37,472
Korea's profile in the field of Arts about this story

442
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:42,592
2060 and I think called the was at the youth the lovers and the despot

443
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,920
Escape while on a trip to Vienna

444
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:49,504
Cuz that they were able to evade their handlers and they made it to the US

445
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:55,648
Shannon Joy would get remarried and live in the United States for about 10 years before going back to South Korea

446
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,976
Jim passed away in 2006 just died

447
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,768
In 2018 at the age of 91

448
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,864
Alex is mixing up this story with Kim Jong-il apologizing to

449
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,680
Japan for abducting 12 Japanese Nationals

450
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,984
During the 70s and 80s

451
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,800
Eight of whom were dead as of 2002

452
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,824
According to the guardian

453
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:19,968
These were just random Japanese citizens who were kidnapped in Japan by North Korean Special Forces

454
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
Then take

455
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,272
Going to live in North Korea

456
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,320
Kim Jong-il said quote

457
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,904
The special forces were Carried Away by a reckless quest for Glory

458
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,720
It was regretful at I want a frankly apologize

459
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,024
I've taken steps to ensure that it will not happen

460
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,424
Then again excuse me if I'm to understand what can't juggle is apologizing for it he's saying

461
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,752
That there were these Rogue North Korean Special Forces

462
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,776
Trying to get

463
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:50,176
Glory by kidnapping random Japanese people from making them live in North Korea

464
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,224
It is debatable

465
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,504
I'm feeling

466
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,344
So he explained that they were abducted so they could teach spies Japanese

467
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,416
And so that their identities could be used to enter South Korea

468
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:07,328
Almost certainly of Kim Jong-il is admitting to adopt abducting 12 Japanese people that number might be a little bit higher

469
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:13,216
Suspicions that the eight people who were abducted and who died were killed

470
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:17,056
How to cover up the abductions but that's not something that's been definitively proven

471
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,360
Obviously possible but

472
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,640
Steidl I'm not sure

473
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,992
Anyway this story is really f***** up and I'm not going to bat for him Johnny O

474
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,784
It's important to recognize that Alex has

475
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
No idea what

476
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
He's talking about

477
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,904
He just randomly mixing together details were various stories to

478
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,464
Kind of composite image that he wants his audience

479
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
If the goal is

480
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,304
Just to say that Kim Jong you Liz

481
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,376
Bad then I guess it doesn't matter if you get the details right

482
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
You know

483
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,936
Spice mix all this stuff up

484
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,008
Alex's pretending to be a show that traffic send information

485
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,288
Which he's short on

486
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,312
Eddie's mixing up

487
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
Entirely

488
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,384
But you have no idea about what was going on

489
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,408
If you took

490
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:59,040
Place value

491
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:04,672
100% despite the fact that everybody on the left is evil and this liberal viewpoint

492
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:08,000
The liberal Viewpoint is that salmon is causing

493
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,792
A contributing

494
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
2

495
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,608
People possibly be

496
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,656
Campbell is whereas Alex's

497
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,936
Do you want it which is

498
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,960
The correct

499
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,520
You conservative view is that

500
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,824
Kim Jong-il is bad

501
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
And that's it

502
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,712
I mean it for somebody who understands cause and effect

503
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,296
The food is dead

504
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,344
People are not able to eat

505
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,624
Seems very simple

506
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,184
So it turns out

507
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,464
If you die

508
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,256
In a North Korean camp

509
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,792
Yes you're sold for me

510
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
The police

511
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
Number one

512
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,112
ATS

513
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864
Interesting

514
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:22,240
So this is a good example of what Alex does instead of covering the actual stories that he's pretend

515
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
I think the cover

516
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,616
This is grab a headline and roof on it going with whatever spark some kind of anger in his mind

517
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,176
Quickpoint about this opium thing

518
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,968
2006

519
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:36,832
The committee meeting was held on the crook illicit activity funding the regime in North Korea

520
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,744
One of the witnesses called was Peter a prahar the director office of Asia Africa and Europe program

521
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,792
Bureau of the international narcotics

522
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,072
Can law enforcement affairs

523
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,888
Which is a part of the US Department of State

524
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,424
Senator Coburn

525
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,032
And ask quote is there enough information to put North Korea under the drug majors

526
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
Category

527
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,848
Prahar replied quote

528
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
No sir

529
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,944
That is another item that we consider on a regular basis within the

530
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
The Department of State

531
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,552
As you know what country could be put on the majors list for basically to read

532
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,440
First of all it is producing 1,000 hectares or cultivating 1,000 hectares

533
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,256
Of more I or more of Poppy

534
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,792
Opium poppy or cocoa

535
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,328
We have been unable to

536
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:24,704
To confirm reports that we have received overtime but there is significant opium poppy cultivation in North Korea

537
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,984
So we've been unable to

538
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,520
We considered North Korea for play some

539
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,800
Put on the majors list

540
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,336
Involvement

541
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,640
As a major cultivator or drug producer

542
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:39,808
It's not inconceivable that the North Korean government make some money through illegal drug sales but that's a little different than

543
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,368
Acting like the Opium and heroin here in the United States

544
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,904
Came from North Korea

545
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,440
The odds of that are almost

546
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:51,840
0 yeah if you are probably like you don't get but not necessarily you need to be like inside

547
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,680
North Korea to see you them putting out 1,000 hectares of

548
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,496
Poppyseeds notice it coming out

549
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,032
In some way or another

550
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:06,176
To report put out this year by the United Nations office on drugs and crime

551
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,968
83% of the world's opium

552
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,992
Is produce an afghan

553
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,808
Very little of that actually makes

554
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
Exit to u.s. Market

555
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,368
It's however it most of the opium

556
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:17,440
Metier originates in Mexico Colombia Guatemala

557
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
Alex is recording this

558
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,792
Afghanistan and Myanmar would be

559
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:25,376
Far and Away the largest suppliers of opium poppy in the world

560
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,144
Wow

561
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
Nothing

562
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,704
North Korea is not even on the radar

563
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,264
This is just how Alex puts

564
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,800
Some player into his news cover

565
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:37,664
He ignores reality and throw something jarring in his audiences in order to shock them

566
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,248
I'd like saying that North Korea sending opium to the United States to turn your children

567
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,040
Into heroin-addicted sex worker

568
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,624
That's just his feelings though that's it's not based on anything real

569
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,952
I'd be a weird thing for North Korea to do as well

570
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,232
So Alex

571
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
Calls

572
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,048
Almost this here broadcast

573
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,584
And he gets one call

574
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
From

575
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,168
How to dispose of a caller

576
00:29:59,424 --> 00:29:59,936
This is a gas

577
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,704
Okay

578
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,240
Felt like a caller

579
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,288
Person

580
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,080
It wasn't an expert in anything

581
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,384
It's a woman

582
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,920
Their son

583
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
Is

584
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,760
Special education program

585
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,296
He felt that he didn't need to be in it

586
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,576
And she was

587
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
Upside about

588
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:21,696
I don't understand tomorrow's news today I don't

589
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
Really

590
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:26,816
Wants to talk too much about it cuz I don't know what the situation is with her kid and it doesn't

591
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,840
Winfield appropriate

592
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
However

593
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,424
Blow her mind

594
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,472
Talking about her son at 8

595
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
Ridiculous

596
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,688
Two different colored eyes

597
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,792
Oh no

598
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
Wardenburg

599
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,464
This is absolutely not true but if you're

600
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,768
Just making things up and kind of feels like it should be true

601
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,304
Well got to be from a twin

602
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,376
One eyes from one the other eyes turn the other that's

603
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,912
Call Alex Jones

604
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,448
To believe in a heartbeat

605
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:41,312
Somebody said that and he was like well duh one-eye's from the other twin

606
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
It's

607
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:46,688
I get it I get why you would think this but it's dumb

608
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,224
I like that even she was like

609
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
No no

610
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,808
Waardenburg syndrome is a condition that's

611
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,880
It's quite rare as a lot more presentations then just dick

612
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,904
Different colored eyes

613
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,488
Some other details that this person gives the diagnosis actually seems

614
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,048
Plausible center-child also has hearing loss which is

615
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,584
Just another symptom of wardenburg

616
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:08,960
The icing however just on its own is a phenomenon called heterochromia iridum

617
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,544
Generally speaking it's not a problem and it doesn't require treatment

618
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,312
It has nothing

619
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:16,640
You can even develop it later in life

620
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
Do you get

621
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
Superpowers

622
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:24,576
Your eye color is determined by a series of jeans that are incredibly complicated but more or less it boils down to

623
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
Eumelanin tots

624
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,136
Concentration in the tissues of your iris

625
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,744
Reasons you can have this at Birth generally come down to a genetic trait passed on from one

626
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
Your parents

627
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:37,632
It might be as simple as having hyperpigmentation in one eye or it could be indicative of

628
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:43,776
Yeah there's a couple serious conditions that it could be an indication of his child was born as one of those serious

629
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:47,360
More serious conditions I don't think the eye color would be the most pressing thing

630
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,128
Bring up now

631
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,432
I also offered up his bit of trivia hope

632
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,200
When do I guess

633
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,736
Blow the colors mine

634
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,272
He didn't have to say anything

635
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,600
But he couldn't resist trying to look like the guy who knows everything

636
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,880
He's just make

637
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:03,488
But you just making s*** up or passing along bad information that he heard somewhere

638
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:09,888
And didn't look into the moment he was like do you know what that is

639
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656
She's like

640
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:17,056
Yeah it's called something it's something called waardenburg syndrome he's got it he's like no no no no no

641
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:23,456
This is my turn to tell you something what's going on with your child

642
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:29,344
That it was waardenburg is actually the liberal perspective

643
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,368
Genius

644
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,928
And I can honestly here Alex

645
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,464
Be wrong all day

646
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,744
And I

647
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,512
Would enjoy

648
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:39,328
I would enjoy him blowing hard about like

649
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,144
These things that he knows nothing about

650
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,264
Just trivia like I you know why you know why your hair color changing you grew up

651
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,824
You like that kind of thing

652
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,408
Evil evil

653
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,992
Evil I would be fine with that kind of a dumb show

654
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,040
Problem is it

655
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,320
Alex is also

656
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:03,904
Perpetuating really dangerous ideas with him

657
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,208
Conversation with this lady

658
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
All these things

659
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
My mind

660
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,112
Okay

661
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,768
Uniform

662
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
This is

663
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,736
Block B

664
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,272
Probably best take

665
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,088
Okay so here's here's what I'm here

666
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,648
A concerned parent going like

667
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,304
They put my child into the special education class I don't believe that he's supposed to be in there and be having a negative effect on

668
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,096
Development

669
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,144
And Alex response to that was

670
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,936
Well obviously they're going to murder you

671
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:25,568
They're going to take him so if you are going to murder your child and you then you have to leave course

672
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:31,456
Her point I guess as best I can tell from the

673
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:36,064
From the conversations they have is that the special education classes are

674
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:37,856
Specific enough

675
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:41,440
Yeah I know like they're people who have different learning challenges

676
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,256
Group together in a way that it's not

677
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,024
Like you can't

678
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,560
All of them the same

679
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,376
Except that that's true

680
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,936
Yeah just probably FairPoint in there

681
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,704
However

682
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,728
The solution to that

683
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,008
Would possibly be

684
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
More

685
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,872
Classes more special ed classes as opposed to

686
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,920
Dissolution that Alex has witches get rid of

687
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,688
Yes

688
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,712
Yeah

689
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:10,112
Yeah that's trouble conversation but I just I feel like Alex's take is just so irresponsible

690
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,416
It's so disrespectful to

691
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,744
You know people who are special at Educators and

692
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,024
Totino who take

693
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,352
A lot of time and care

694
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,376
I-22

695
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,400
The dragon help kids

696
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:28,544
I mean I remember growing up I was we were at we had like enrichment

697
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,312
G or whatever

698
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:33,408
And that was a essentially wasn't like a gift

699
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,712
Did class or anything they just gave you more work

700
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,528
Guess what you're finally in Richmond

701
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,320
Do all of this extra s*** as well

702
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:45,696
There were parents who took their kids out of that program like this isn't helping them develop

703
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
And that's

704
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,744
Totally fine

705
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:51,328
There were kids who are not being helped in there

706
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:56,192
You don't like hearing loss is a different problem than his dad developmental disability

707
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,216
You know that kind of big

708
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:01,056
All of that is fine apparent should recognize what's going on there

709
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:07,456
If the company tells you that they're going to murder your child they're not doing good for you

710
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:10,272
I don't think that there

711
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,320
Looking at the problem as it exists

712
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,880
They're looking at the problem as you do want

713
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:18,464
Headed to be my son is getting extra work from

714
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,768
His school and I I don't think it's

715
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,048
Helping Hands

716
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,328
They're trying to make

717
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:29,728
Then they're going to take him away from you

718
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:36,128
Going to say that the government are not going to believe you believe you make sense

719
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,456
Call Matt actually going to call

720
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:44,064
Andy gets a call from a guy who works at Taco Bell and this guy is pretty

721
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,832
Concerned

722
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,624
About technological advance

723
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,696
Kitchen

724
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,720
Alexa

725
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,488
Weeks ago

726
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
History Channel

727
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:55,840
Restaurants nearby

728
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,608
Talking about

729
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,400
The drive-thru window

730
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,936
And I caught my eye

731
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,728
Because they were

732
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,752
We're talkin about

733
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,776
Maybe Annette

734
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,080
McDonald's

735
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,200
And they would ask you if you take it off

736
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,736
The card while they're out there

737
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,576
Seymour

738
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,608
This is freaking me out

739
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,144
Because

740
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
I mean

741
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,448
You're trying to say well

742
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,984
Speed up the speed

743
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,056
Problem

744
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,152
Don't worry

745
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,432
Camera

746
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,208
That's kind of an exaggerated fear to have about

747
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,488
Credit cards

748
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:59,840
It's just that there's just no way there's no.

749
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:05,216
Technology visit like you remember when they introduced self-checkout at a grocery store people

750
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:10,848
They're f****** mind it's not about having tobacco background groceries

751
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:20,064
I think that there is a fine conversation to have surrounding like you know the jobs that are taken by

752
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,368
The jobs that are

753
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,696
Probably going to be eliminated within the fast-food space

754
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:29,792
In the coming years 100%

755
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,072
But it's kind of different than this one

756
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,608
This is stupid

757
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,632
Exact

758
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,448
IFixit Alex

759
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:42,336
I don't know if you understand that this guy's talking about credit cards being taken at the drive-thru

760
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,104
Cuz he's

761
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
I don't I don't know what

762
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,664
He's getting that

763
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,224
Is it does Alex think that they've got like

764
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
Taco Bell cards

765
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:56,160
Is that like the Taco Bell is giving them Taco Bell cards

766
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,696
A license or something

767
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,976
Yeah I don't know

768
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,280
I think it's dumb

769
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:05,120
I'm not worried about credit cards at the drive-thru

770
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:08,960
Another call and this fella

771
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,520
I believe it's from the Oklahoma City area

772
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,336
And he heard something on the radio that he wants to run by Al

773
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,992
You heard about the Oklahoma City

774
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,040
Steering reservoir

775
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,136
Turn On the Radio Star radio

776
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,464
RadioShack

777
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,944
This is amazing

778
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,248
And that clip Alex was basically trying

779
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:57,344
Like to take credit for some of Lights resolution being disgusted the Oklahoma City Council

780
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,136
But he didn't even know existed

781
00:40:59,392 --> 00:40:59,904
Before this call

782
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,184
Also shouldn't

783
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,976
He know about these kinds of things

784
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:09,632
Like half of the show is just yelling about the Patriot Act so you would think that he would keep himself up to date on what would be major news on that front

785
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,656
I mean if

786
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:16,032
City of Oklahoma City just decided to overturn the Patriot Act pretty big news

787
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:21,408
It seems like something like what what else is he paying attention to in the news if not like

788
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,432
Kind of thing

789
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:28,064
I'll just wait until someone calls in

790
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:29,856
I also have

791
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:33,440
No idea what this resolution was I can't fly

792
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,976
What are we talkin

793
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:41,632
This is almost certainly the same thing as like we're reaffirming the 8th Amendment you know like

794
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
Have fun

795
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,216
So this next eclipse from a call

796
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:45,984
Is

797
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,776
What am I one of my favorites

798
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,568
That I found in a long time

799
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,872
And possibly

800
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,663
Part of the rationalization for doing

801
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:57,503
Doing an episode even though it's going to be shorter chill as there's not a whole lot

802
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,319
I needed to bring you this blessed

803
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,623
These people have been around

804
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,047
China Wok

805
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,375
How wonderful it was

806
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,911
Dismantle

807
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,847
No no

808
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
4

809
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,991
Alex's just free associating

810
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:34,367
No no no. He hears the name Dewey and he knows that there's a thing called the Dewey Decimal System

811
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,927
Asserts that they're related

812
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,047
I'll talk a little bit about that but first I wanted

813
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,839
Explain why Alex does this

814
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,911
Alex has no idea who John Dewey is but

815
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,703
You can't make that obvious to the audience

816
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:52,543
If this caller is mentioning Dewey in relation to the early globalist

817
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,079
Back in the 1920s

818
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,103
How should be an

819
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,127
Expert on this guy

820
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,687
By Justin interjecting Dewey Decimal System

821
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,503
Alex is trying to feign expertise because it

822
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:07,903
It's meant to look like him saying of course I know about John Dewey

823
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,487
I know about this guy

824
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,511
Yeah it's

825
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:15,839
It's remarkable and it's kind of the same thing that he's doing with

826
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,119
The eye color thing

827
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,167
It's the same sort of

828
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,447
Fake Authority

829
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,495
Betty's presenting it's just amazing

830
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,055
Perfect example of that

831
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:28,895
So first of all they're talking about this. In the 1920

832
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,175
Can you send the Dewey Decimal System

833
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,967
It was created in 1876

834
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,039
Also it was invented by a guy named Melvil Dewey

835
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,063
Not John Dewey

836
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,111
Little weird but Alex doesn't know this

837
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:41,183
But seeing as he should be the president of the Melvil Dewey Fan Club

838
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,231
I don't know if you know this Jordan

839
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,023
Melvil Dewey was a pile of s***

840
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:50,911
I did not know that he just also happened to create a very important system for standardizing Book classic

841
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:54,495
Application fit Library

842
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:57,055
Kicked out of the American Library Association which

843
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:57,823
You found it

844
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,127
Because he wouldn't stop sexually harassing women

845
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,455
Including his daughter-in-law Jesus Christ

846
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:09,855
Just nuts to think that this guy was so out of line that he would get in trouble for making unwelcome advances to women in the early 19th

847
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,159
Hundreds of time of that sort of thing was pretty,

848
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,183
Yeah

849
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,231
Hey people turned the other way on it a lot

850
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,279
It was in the newspaper

851
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,559
They just wrote

852
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:25,215
Horrible sexually harassing such a problem but you got kicked out of the

853
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:28,799
So Melvin would go on to found the Lake Placid Club

854
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,335
Which is something of a health resort

855
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:34,431
He forbade Jews black people and any other minorities from joining the club

856
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:37,503
And he specifically band Booker T Washington

857
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,783
I'm coming up

858
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,319
He was such a bigot that

859
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:43,135
According to an article in the American libraries magazine quote

860
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:47,743
Dewey bought up the adjoining land for fear it would otherwise be sold to Jews

861
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,767
Cheese's

862
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
Christ

863
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,607
Dude is a real piece of s***

864
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,375
Yeah

865
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:59,775
Why couldn't we have just gone with alphabetical I didn't know that Melville alphabet was a piece of s***

866
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,799
Yeah

867
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:07,199
Yeah it's unfortunate that he should create something it revolutionized libraries

868
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:11,295
But he saw

869
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:17,183
So conversely John Dewey was a psychologist in an educator who spent some time in China in the 1920s

870
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:23,839
You have nothing to do with libraries in library science I was just making up whatever information makes it look Smart in the

871
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:30,239
Cuz he's comfortable in the knowledge that a podcast pointing this stuff out and laughing at it wouldn't exist for another 18 years

872
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,823
Yeah he got he got away with it for a long time

873
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,383
Not anymore baby

874
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,711
Dewey Decimal System go f*** yourself

875
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,991
Dewey Destin

876
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,831
I was waiting for and even be like I was expect

877
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:48,671
Effingham to go with Dewey defeats Truman as his reference for that

878
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:55,071
Do that he went even dumber than doing it if he's true people might actually remember

879
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,375
Details about the Dewey defeats Truman

880
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:03,775
Where is Dewey Decimal System is just obscure enough that most people don't know the history behind it

881
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:08,127
It exists remember the Melvil Dewey was bios can't believe that

882
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,943
Why don't I get to learn about

883
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,015
Half of the s*** that we learn about is made by piece

884
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:14,783
Pieces of s***

885
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,319
And we should also get that con

886
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:20,927
Erase service person from history but

887
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:27,583
Why do we always get that contact every time I hear about DNA or even while we're talking about the MRNA vaccine

888
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,679
Also just a reminder the guys who did that piece of s***

889
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,471
It's it's unfortunate

890
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,007
Kind of but it is just

891
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:35,775
Depart of

892
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,335
Living in reality there are some things

893
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,895
That are important breakthroughs that have happened

894
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,175
In our history

895
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:49,343
I've been done by people who suck are a literature major like

896
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,111
Myself

897
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:54,975
You're eventually going to have to wrestle with the fact that just about everybody who wrote a good book as a giant

898
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,279
So

899
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,071
Alex

900
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,631
Is that you still covering that monkey paw

901
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,655
Quite a bit

902
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,191
Monkeypox scare

903
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,007
This it says it's just

904
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,383
Quickly

905
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:16,223
But that I'm able to clearly see that the government has

906
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,503
Most probably

907
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,367
Dumps is monkeypox on us

908
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,927
Because right away before they

909
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,975
You know even hardly even name of his dick

910
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,167
That's not good ever

911
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:40,287
I would say that the they did know the names of people who are they just didn't

912
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,055
Publicized

913
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
Sound like

914
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,359
Hey David

915
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,639
Protecting people's privacy

916
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,663
Which is

917
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,431
Fine

918
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,711
My neighbor able to

919
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,479
Define

920
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,295
What commonalities there were and they go they all went

921
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,831
Work in contact with

922
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,111
Prairie dogs at

923
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:54,879
Specific

924
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:59,743
I wonder if there's a connection here

925
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:00,767
Like

926
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,559
The the

927
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,607
Almost

928
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,143
Non-Stop

929
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,423
Reality of

930
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,471
A large group of people

931
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:14,847
Cool react react to anyone knowing something with well if you know something you proper

932
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:20,735
Yeah you're probably in on it just like see they knew something so they obviously did it

933
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,759
You could have learned

934
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,527
Yeah

935
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,623
There are the other thing too is that Alex is trying to present this like

936
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,695
Fear of a release of a bio-weapon by

937
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,975
Talking about the Monk

938
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,767
Epoxide which is nonsense

939
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:33,791
And then

940
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,583
Talking about Porton down releasing

941
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,607
Foot-and-mouth Yelp

942
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,631
That's like please

943
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,679
Aren't good examples they're not

944
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:46,079
They're not based on anything come onto things happened a thousand miles away they're the same thing

945
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:50,175
Obviously it's

946
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:55,551
So we check in here on Alex's views

947
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,367
Events that are going on in Iraq

948
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,415
We have an inch of

949
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,183
Open update

950
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:20,127
Saddam banknotes is because the public ID quote

951
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:23,967
Confidence in the only other banknote in wide circulation

952
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:29,599
By October 2003 a new DNR had been introduced with anti-fraud measures in place

953
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:32,159
Provide a unified currency without saddam's face on

954
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:36,255
This was just the least bad solution to the problem

955
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,559
As an article in the BBC put that quote

956
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,327
U.s. in British

957
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:43,679
Officials have said it's better to lose face by printing 250 DNR notes with

958
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,703
With Saddam on them

959
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,983
For a short.

960
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,543
Then risk further inflaming public anger

961
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:54,943
The bath party is not in power at this point and in fact just 14 days before this episode was recorded

962
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:58,015
Beactive elements of D pacification had entered into

963
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,039
Divorce in Iraq

964
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,575
Now coalition

965
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,111
Two forces were responsible for tracking

966
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,415
Determine who was a member of the bath party

967
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:07,231
So they could be banned from holding any job in the pub

968
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:07,999
Looks weird

969
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,583
It's really f***** up like this super destructive process is going on

970
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,119
And the way Alex is covering it

971
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,143
Could not be more detached

972
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,167
Cast from reality

973
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,191
Is the game

974
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,215
180

975
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,031
What's actually going on

976
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,311
It's bananas especially

977
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,591
Considering the fact that

978
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:24,895
Would you go back

979
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,687
Can you read through all of these books

980
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
It's like

981
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,503
You guys are so stupid

982
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:33,087
Why are you getting rid of everyone who knew how to do any

983
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:37,439
And immediately the whole place fell apart and they're like I don't understand

984
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:41,279
It's almost like we just hired a bunch of new people who have never done anything like

985
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,047
This before

986
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,071
Yeah

987
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:47,423
There weren't there is there were some critical mistakes that were made especially in the implementation

988
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,447
Of

989
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:49,727
That

990
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:50,751
Initiative

991
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,287
Yeah

992
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,335
Foolish such a brutal brutal

993
00:50:54,591 --> 00:51:00,735
It's so weird that we're here in the middle of June and Alex is still on the giving the country

994
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,015
The baathist

995
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,063
I don't know when that's

996
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
Going to change

997
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,391
But it's one of the only things really about

998
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,439
Coverage of the Iraq war that I signed

999
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,463
At all

1000
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:11,999
Because it's

1001
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,791
Yeah it's it's so

1002
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,559
Divorce

1003
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:17,119
Like how can you read anything

1004
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:19,679
And come to the conclusion that they put a bath

1005
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,959
Austin power

1006
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,983
I need to put his

1007
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,799
Content through debaffle occasion

1008
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,359
Alright sorry

1009
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,735
Click

1010
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:37,087
The cliff

1011
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:43,487
Upon

1012
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,047
Lyrics of fun until Matrix cast off

1013
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:50,143
There is this sort of weird mirror of the present-day in terms of this

1014
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,703
You know discussion of releasing bio-weapon

1015
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,471
From

1016
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:56,031
From Labs but if you look at the stuff you was talking about it

1017
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:56,799
At this point

1018
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
It's b*******

1019
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,591
Nonsense

1020
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,127
And then

1021
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,943
That's a battery decimal thing really made me laugh

1022
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:09,343
Yeah so I believe this is the story of Melvil Dewey is not to his wife

1023
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,183
Maybe I should be we have an influence

1024
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,743
Let's see if we can get that story out there

1025
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:22,399
People will know from here on out did they change it they don't use the Dewey Decimal System anymore in libraries right through the middle librarian

1026
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,191
I don't know how I don't think they do

1027
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,727
They may I don't think so

1028
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,007
I think they got rid of

1029
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:31,359
Librarian somebody said that Melvil Dewey was a real piece of s***

1030
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,151
#cancel

1031
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:35,711
So yeah Jordan will be back

1032
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:42,111
But until then we have website we do it's knowledge

1033
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,927
That knowledge underscore

1034
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:49,023
Will be back but until then I need om Leo mdzs Corte Madera

1035

Holding

1037
