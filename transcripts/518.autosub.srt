00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
Knowledge

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136

9
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,424
What's up

10
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,008
What is I don't know

11
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,288
It's hard to find a brights

12
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,616
Spothero friend of mine recommended

13
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016
Diablo identify

14
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,344
I don't know my friend recommended it to me and

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
A lot of fun

16
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:34,720
It's a lot of running around I don't know

17
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
It's a good thing

18
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
A background

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,072
I like it

20
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,888
I mean like in in in

21
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
At times where it's at

22
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,192
4 by 5

23
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,984
I got a another video game

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
I have a bright spot

25
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,176
And also incredibly

26
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:00,832
My bright spot is that I found out that my parents had covid and they survived

27
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,160
With no like they didn't have to go to the hospital

28
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
That's that's

29
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
Fantastic

30
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,512
Comparative salute alternative

31
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,792
100%

32
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,376
The unqualified dark spot obviously is that they learned

33
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,912
Zero from the experiment

34
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,240
Absolutely nothing for me

35
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:24,640
Hi Dominic. I text you

36
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,968
Yeah so it

37
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
It's all good

38
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,576
Getting a bath

39
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
They're not gone

40
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
Also I

41
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
What killed

42
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,488
So it's a real difficult situation that they

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,096
I'm sorry

44
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,568
Throw tomatoes

45
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,152
Tomatoes stock going up

46
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,760
We got in front of us he's a little bit of a actor

47
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
The

48
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
The action

49
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:09,952
Infowars the day of January 6th

50
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976

54
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,448
End of last week how Alex

55
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,032
Try to figure out

56
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
With this

57
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:31,456
Post-coital Bliss if you will videos there's a lot of stuff that's going on

58
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,016
I would describe

59
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,320
Trying to figure out exactly how we're going to make it

60
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:41,696
Through and make a profit

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,792

Marisa Tomei

Thank you

00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,839
Today

91
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,191
I think the show is probably the most

92
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
Interested in

93
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
The most like what

94
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,799
Can you see things on Twitter

95
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,591
People crime

96
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:39,711
Around and I was a course that Alia Peter wondering what video games you were

97
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:46,111
Playing in Almased Haiti

98
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:51,743
Twitter there was a shaman

99
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
Oh he did

100
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
Great great

101
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
It's hard to tell over the phone

102
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,703
This episode will culminate

103
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,007
With Alex interviewing the couch

104
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,567
Great great and I'll give you the spoiler it doesn't

105
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
Well

106
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:12,223
You know what does go well for actually

107
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,599
You get the the cue shaman on the line with Alex

108
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
Sounds

109
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
Not as bad

110
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,439
Okay that would

111
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,231
The guy dressed like f******

112
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,559
Dan Aykroyd in Dragnet

113
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:35,519
Alex Jones is ass a little bit clearer about this they both sound crazy

114
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
Peace out

115
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,335
Polite

116
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,663
Track that t-shirt

117
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
So webreg

118
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:48,831
This episode let's listen to a little out of context drop it

119
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,879
Is almost perfectly sums up what it's like to live

120
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927
Explain that

121
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
Next

122
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
That

123
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,631
Is Alex curity

124
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,983
Do you like that news broke a lot of these programs just

125
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,287
Give you the guys out

126
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,639
I got a story excuse of an explain it to you later

127
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,943
Possibly

128
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,271
So at this point we start on the 7th

129
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:23,135
And Alex has learned that more people have passed away in relation

130
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,415
Shinto the storming of the

131
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
The Capitol Building correct

132
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:30,559
And apparently he's doubling down on the it was auntie

133
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
FIFA narrative

134
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,983
Well ladies and gentlemen we are here at the epicenter where for US citizens were murdered

135
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,287
Inside outside the US Capitol

136
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:48,991
Manipulated and triggered by antifa evidence is mounting that posed as proud boys so that they would then

137
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,039
I can still make a dead trigger

138
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,367
Part of the crowd hundreds of thousands already messing

139
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,207
Small percentage in side the building

140
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,303
So this is this is the way that the ball is going to break for Alex

141
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
The

142
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
Antifa

143
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,167
You triggered everything by posing as proud boys

144
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
Things office

145
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
I just

146
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:14,079
I don't know we should have had a contingent in every right-wing propaganda is home

147
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,383
Like the day after just ready to slap

148
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,455
Like Jose was antifa

149
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,039
Just one more just one more time one more time said then when he does

150
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Forever

151
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
Slap is

152
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,695
Contingent on the person not being able to

153
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
Explain themselves

154
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
Because you know hey look

155
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,071
Alex is trying to come on Aaron say like 8

156
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,631
Facts are coming out this was a

157
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
I'd like for him

158
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
M2

159
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,519
But I will believe it's antifa

160
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
Intel

161
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,639
I bet you going to repeat

162
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,431
Let me read you some of the Intel

163
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
Here in DC

164
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:58,111
Organization

165
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,719
Promoters always that they would arrest in Trump apparel to infiltrate the event

166
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,863
Capitol grounds

167
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:13,471
Even arrived to confirm a stage that was set up for the speak

168
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:17,055
Observation for group of 120 folks

169
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,103
Already assembled

170
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Antifa

171
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:27,807
Dressed in a manner not consistent with that normally seen from Trump supporters everyone else too

172
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
Came from the event

173
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,903
Did the ellipse waiting for Trump speech

174
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
Anyway

175
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,559
Arm pads knee pads completely

176
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,911
Sons of congressmen sons of Senator Kaine was

177
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:47,775
Oh yeah that's great

178
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:52,383
Another proof that he's laying out that this is antifa is that

179
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,967
People who are dressed in a certain way

180
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:01,087
I just I don't intend King's son had a felony one time

181
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,135
Through so he was probably

182
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
Everybody who's had a felony was proud

183
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,975
Has been like

184
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,791
Just it doesn't

185
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
Saying that although they were chanting

186
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,607
Antifa

187
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:19,007
It's kind of a strange before burning a flag

188
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,359
It really doesn't exactly

189
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,711
Fairly regular yeah yeah

190
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,831
You could say that this is antifa doing an amazing impression of you

191
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
Or it could be

192
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,671
People who are in the communities that you running

193
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
And it would be impossible to tell the difference

194
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:44,607
I would even argue with that point behind all of this

195
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,191
They might as well just have joined the proud boys

196
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
I don't want

197
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
Want them back

198
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
Fair

199
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
Alright

200
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,407
What's going on though is that Alex is recognizing that like s***

201
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,199
There is feminism

202
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
Is 2 real

203
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
It happened

204
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,807
I can't deny this we have to lie about it

205
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,879
Because I told people to do this and then they did it and I don't want

206
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,975
Get into that because there are a lot of conversations that are going on around Dallas

207
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,303
Ex's behavior on the ground

208
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
You should

209
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,631
Discuss then we will a little bit later when Alex

210
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
Get into it

211
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,287
You know he would much rather be like this is all stage there's something freaky

212
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
No

213
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,591
It happened

214
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
Movie so much better

215
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,407
Don't have to be that like

216
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,687
Oh yeah yeah you know what

217
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
Some of our people

218
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,271
Did the end up going in there

219
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,319
Not going to be able to deny that

220
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:41,439
So

221
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
They look they got trick

222
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Into doing it

223
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,839
So that's what I do

224
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:53,471
They're all trust fund kids sons of US senators sons of Congress people academics

225
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,823
Child molesting sycom loving

226
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,103
America hating

227
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,383
Trash in the planet

228
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,199
When the police got attacked

229
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
Police got hit

230
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,551
When the crops all that

231
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,135
Some patriots responded

232
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,719
Play wannabe bully and got suckered into this that's what happened

233
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,511
Offense

234
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
Start exposing this

235
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
Yeah so that's a

236
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
The way the narrative is starting

237
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
Take shape

238
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,447
Not strong

239
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,983
So I think that's

240
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Kind of

241
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
Struggle

242
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:33,663
Because aren't we also trying to make a what's-her-face into a martyr

243
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:39,039
Well Alex that she was really into qanon

244
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
And so she can be

245
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
Well no she

246
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,391
She is

247
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
You know it is a tragedy

248
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,231
And very sad door but you got

249
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,767
Tricked into doing this by queuing

250
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
Okay so now

251
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:57,215
All all open Warfare on Q Horas ionophores

252
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,775
I like this in there I like

253
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,335
Qanon being antifa

254
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:06,431
It's a little murky

255
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
Listen to me

256
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,735
There's one thing that I know

257
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
Blowhard

258
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,087
And that is

259
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:19,743
They like to talk about how they could have averted disaster If Only They had been there

260
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,327
Burg situation

261
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,375
There wouldn't have been a 9/11

262
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,191
We just should have been there I should have been there

263
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
Capital

264
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,407
I want to race down and I'll wait for the capital that's my gut told me

265
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,247
We could have told people that's antifa

266
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,599
We would have stopped

267
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,159
So yeah you could have tackled here

268
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,231
If only Alex I've been there

269
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,583
Could have saved the day that's that's one of those lies that just elevator

270
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
The point of just

271
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
Yeah yeah

272
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,703
Like Elsa I'm so far beyond

273
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,031
The before you started that lock when you started that lie I'm

274
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,823
Just out yeah

275
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:12,223
Back to yesterday when your employee we don't remember yes. Please the capital Has Fallen

276
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:18,623
The Patriots are now into hearts

277
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,207
Cancel

278
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
I'm interested

279
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
In their evidence

280
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,839
I'm interested in what they're going to bring

281
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,375
To the table in terms of like

282
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
How are you going

283
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
To show that the

284
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,495
FIFA

285
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,775
Sing Theory

286
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:42,687
Keep in mind too that you know every time we have these events in DC you always see antifa and BLM

287
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Not on the street

288
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,759
They are not anywhere to be seen it in

289
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,039
This week

290
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:52,159
Because they're all wearing Trump gear they're all posing as journalists they're all just infiltrating all the truck stop

291
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
Because they have no

292
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,511
Betnow dressing in all black with black block going around to get their ass kicked by

293
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
Cowboys a police are sick of them so now

294
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,607
They pretend to be Patriots they infiltrate

295
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
And then they cause

296
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
All this destruction

297
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:09,055
I didn't see anybody who I decided was antiva and therefore they must be the hidden in plain sight dress

298
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,335
Just like Trump supporters

299
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,639
Therefore they are false flag

300
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:21,599
Are you trying to turn me into some sort of superhero

301
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Vigilante

302
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
With a tragic backstory

303
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,439
No because

304
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
Is it seems like

305
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,511
This is like listening to Owen

306
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,791
Say that

307
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
The day after

308
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,679
Makes me want to like dressing all black and trained really hard and then jitsu

309
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
And then just solve problem

310
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,751
So wherever they are

311
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,311
You know I'm not trying to do that

312
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,847
It's like you're making it a

313
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,127
Is it does he

314
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,663
I will say that

315
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
You are

316
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
Required

317
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
What to be able to

318
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Jump between a

319
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:55,391
A couple buildings before you solve any problem

320
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:59,999
But it's me doing any of this I will be I will be your Alfred if

321
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:05,887
You can jump between two buildings before you solve anybody else's problem least 2 or 3 years

322
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,191
You might need a little more than two buildings

323
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,471
2 years that's the rule

324
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,031
The name of the game is

325
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
He's getting these talking

326
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,591
Pinpoints out into the world and make

327
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,639
I'm sure that this is the reality that people like

328
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,919
Looks that muddy the waters

329
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
Muddy Waters is important

330
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,039
The other thing that I think Alex recognizes pretty quickly

331
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,831
And I think he's right

332
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,135
Is like this is a great opportunity to try and

333
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
Cute people back

334
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,719
Some people might be disillusioned by the fact

335
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:35,071
Through all this trouble and then Trump I guess is

336
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,911
What happened to the plant what happened to the plan

337
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:43,519
Tell me about those ballots again they were Watermark tonight or no

338
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
Steve

339
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,663
We need to talk about talking points based in truth

340
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:56,063
For the president for America for the world because we don't have any Patriot Communications the president's been caught off basically

341
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,599
The white house is listed.

342
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
And it's not because we're powerful is because

343
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,207
Okay

344
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,351
Used great big wonderful

345
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,399
That's what got us into this position

346
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,471
Okay you were cute person

347
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:19,871
I'm just telling you now that you have to listen to the talking point we have to discuss who was behind this pain to get front of bruising

348
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
Nice way to like

349
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,015
Extended Olive Branch

350
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,575
Listeners who might have

351
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,855
Did Mork use an Alex

352
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,879
You know and be like

353
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,207
I'm still come back here you're not doing nothing against you if you

354
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,743
Got into this cuz it's all

355
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
Supposed to be asked

356
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,791
Questions

357
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,095
But

358
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,375
Event almost like

359
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,191
Is is like a

360
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:51,103
A plus one for everybody's media consumption like if you were a cute person you go plus 12 Infowars if

361
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,151
You're Infowars Hugo + 12 Fox News

362
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
Fox News you're like

363
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
Believe whatever I feel

364
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:04,671
Maybe yeah maybe there is a a sort of like a toe back towards

365
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
I like

366
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,743
Away from the extremism

367
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,791
Memory. Of time

368
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,095
Episode 4 like people on the

369
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
Their couches

370
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
Buda. Necessarily the people who were in.

371
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,847
Possibly

372
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,871
I haven't had enough time

373
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,895
To see what the actual effect

374
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,455
Activity

375
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,503
I'm about this stuff in that.

376
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,551
It has me feeling somebody who season Opera

377
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,367
And it's an opportunity to give part of that market

378
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,647
Chair that you lost back

379
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
Right on folks

380
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,999
To think that he is controlled opposition

381
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,279
And works for the

382
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,351
Mossad or CIA the CIA or whatever

383
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,399
It's so good

384
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,935
Goodbye. Good but that's what you

385
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
You should be doing

386
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,751
From a business standpoint

387
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,823
Then now do you see where the Vigilante Park

388
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
Comes into this

389
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,431
Because if Alex winds up getting more market share out of this

390
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,247
And no one stops them I feel like their needs

391
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:06,367
To be some sort of all black-clad ninjitsu master who is trained for two years and could jump

392
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,927
Exactly to building solve a problem

393
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,743
Put the way you would solve that problem is by like

394
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:16,351
Starting your own about starting your own right-wing media Outlet

395
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,375
Okay

396
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,655
So

397
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,935
To not even like Judo

398
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,471
No you should steal some of that

399
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
What is market share

400
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,567
Okay if the problem that you're seeking to

401
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,335
Alright

402
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:30,687
Okay so I'll just wear all black and have a radio show at night

403
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,503
The Capitol Police

404
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,063
You know there's a lot question

405
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,343
Gyms that are going around about

406
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
Preparedness

407
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,903
Their lack of preparedness

408
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,695
You know

409
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,975
6 dates

410
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
Yeah we'll learn more

411
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
In coming days

412
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,839
Sure Alex has decided that they were understaffed on purpose

413
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,887
Because they were working on this

414
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,679
With antifa or something

415
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
Okay

416
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,823
Understaffed on purpose

417
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
The police finally pushed back

418
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,199
The police attacked the patriots the patriots attack

419
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:08,063
Beautifully played we needed to be investigated

420
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,367
State Police

421
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,911
Funded by Soros and they have Soros

422
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,471
Yeah you talked over but he did say empty that works for the

423
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
The Deep state

424
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
Okay

425
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,335
Hey, right guys

426
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,431
Go do it they're your enemies

427
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,967
As the left

428
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,759
We were antifa

429
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,807
Antifa in this circumstance

430
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,111
Every faculty what the far-right

431
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Wanted

432
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:47,743
Right well if you look at the responses that we're going on as it would happen

433
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,023
I got to Rio

434
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
Yeah I think

435
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:55,679
I think it was exactly maybe antifa has been your ally all along and it's the

436
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,215
The cops who are your enemies

437
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,495
Very confusing

438
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,055
After this

439
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,079
Saul went down

440
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
Trump

441
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,895
Pretty quickly on the 7th

442
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,199
Was put a put out that video

443
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,575
Transfer power

444
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,647
Conceding a great little whoops a doodle moment

445
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,928
Imallexx

446
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,976
I think he recognizes that like

447
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,512
Trump is

448
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,792
Running out of allies

449
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:26,656
They're people who are like companies cabinet who are resigning

450
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
Percent of like

451
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,704
Oh no

452
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,752
Everyone hates this guy now

453
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,288
And I think Alex

454
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,568
These events as an opportunity

455
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:40,736
What do we do if millions of listeners as millions of activists with talking points and narratives to counter what's happening

456
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,272
What pressure do we put on from

457
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,320
Congress is Trump totally

458
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
Ben

459
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,624
Abandon

460
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,560
Tell me on this

461
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:07,360
Talk about it in the second hour later is

462
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:13,760
Isolated and increasingly desperate and this is good news because

463
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
That does sound right

464
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,088
That's f***

465
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,624
I guess the good news is

466
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,440
Is that we know the vice president will be like hey don't

467
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
Send those nukes

468
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,280
You don't need no I don't send those

469
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,816
How that's until Trump

470
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
5th Amendment

471
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,376
Do that'll be interesting

472
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,424
That'll be an interesting reversal of Fortune

473
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,752
So I went to Starbucks iced with the 25th Amendment

474
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:40,384
I'm at stuff and he's decided the Trump only release that video where he may or may not have conceded

475
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,408
Because Pence

476
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,944
Was threatening him

477
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,528
I want the phone

478
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,064
And take calls

479
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,136
Pacific Lee Auto

480
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,208
Trump should do has he can see that you can reduce what you said

481
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,000
Installing

482
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,304
Fraud but I will

483
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:05,472
To the peaceful transfer of power because they told him he got Mike Pence we got the rest your cabinets are all cowards

484
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:11,616
Your ass right now the only did that because removing him would cause a bigger backlash maybe Trump

485
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Because

486
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
He's going

487
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,808
Not peaceful transfer power because it's a fraud

488
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,624
So they're scared the power he still got

489
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,928
The feeling that I get there is just denial

490
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,976
That just seems like pretty thick

491
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
Denial

492
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,840
Alex does realize

493
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,632
Hi this is over

494
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,936
April 2nd

495
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,472
Oh no you

496
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:41,056
Doing this cuz there's a metaphorical gun to his head is five stages of grief

497
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,848
I gotcha gotcha

498
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
Just kind of fun

499
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
More anger

500
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
When he talks

501
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,248
Syracuse shaman

502
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,272
Was bargaining

503
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
Before anger f

504
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,624
Bargaining is VIP

505
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:03,584
How's the weather at that would make sense that he's always grieve me on air

506
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,632
I will fight the globalist

507
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,472
So Alex has Taylor Hanson back on

508
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:14,080
Who was the guy who got some video of the shooting

509
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,360
In the capital

510
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,128
Fourth Hanson

511
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
Yes

512
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,992
Almost

513
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,040
Almost almost

514
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
Suspect that you got me

515
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:29,696
I apologize I made that clarification in our last episode

516
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,720
Got it mixed up

517
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,512
They are very vague

518
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:36,352
And were they were on the 6th while they were covering

519
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,656
There are two pieces of video

520
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,936
That are going

521
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,960
Around

522
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,752
And I got the reference

523
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
What's wrong on

524
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,080
There's one that was shot by Infowars

525
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,872
Cameraperson

526
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,176
And then there's some that were shot by Taylor Hanson

527
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,248
The reason that I got it confused if they never clarify that

528
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,784
Anime interview Taylor Hanson

529
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
Tonight somebody

530
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
Who got video of the stuff

531
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:03,232
Around the time that they're playing the video that the enforcement.

532
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,024
No but yeah

533
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,328
And they're really

534
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,888
You get the sense that they're working on a narrative

535
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
Where

536
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,216
Schumer called

537
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,240
Look for the Killer

538
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:21,152
Alright Taylor Hanson was there I'm Alex Jones Alex Royer

539
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:21,920
For lady

540
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:23,968
.

541
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:33,184
You were there describe you talked to her before she died

542
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,512
What happened what you witness

543
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
Oh yeah

544
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,128
Baby feast

545
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
I would watch that

546
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,688
Movie

547
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,736
I just

548
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,904
I don't know man

549
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,720
No I don't know I don't find this to be a response

550
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
Audible Library

551
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
Retaking

552
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,560
It's like trying to imply that Schumer was like

553
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,096
Like killer for blood

554
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,632
Sacrifice

555
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,424
Yeah

556
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:22,336
It is it is real weird whenever you're like obviously we need

557
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
To get all the Patriots

558
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
Chuck Schumer

559
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,968
Keep antifa from doing all of that stuff that we wanted to happen but we

560
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,040
It's 88 is really almost like

561
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:34,368
Nothing after diagram

562
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,160
The points that are trying to

563
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,184
To be made are soaked

564
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Confused

565
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:42,560
But that should be expected because you know people like Taylor are involved as

566
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,840
Like sources oven

567
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,120
Information and Analysis

568
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,912
Kind of guy

569
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
Got into this

570
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,472
Because of Q

571
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,336
Was great seeing when it first started

572
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:58,688
You know it was it was a way to introduce people to all the evils what these globalists are doing all this time

573
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,224
Pedophilia

574
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,504
All the sacrifices

575
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:08,160
Let me doing more independent research and I think that's what's great about you is

576
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,976
They do their own research they don't just trust fake news

577
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,768
I think that was a great topic about

578
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,840
Was trust a plan

579
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,144
How do you say people staying home

580
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,424
When Trump himself

581
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
Are telling them to come

582
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,032
So he's got it you got redpilled by qanon

583
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,896
The plan idea which is like you don't have to get

584
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,664
Active

585
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,456
Right but then his

586
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,784
Comment was that more people should have come on the six

587
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,320
Apparently yeah

588
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
Okay

589
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,648
But what happened was bad

590
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,440
Well no

591
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,976
Everything that happened

592
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:46,048
Good except for the part where they went into the cabin

593
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:46,816
Okay

594
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,840
Store bid

595
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,656
So they think that if more

596
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
People had been there

597
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,472
To storm the capitol

598
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
It wouldn't happen

599
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,056
Cuz it would have seen the antifa

600
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
Like every single

601
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,384
Person is a pair of eyes

602
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,784
Okay okay

603
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,808
Alright one mayonnaise

604
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,464
Something like that I don't know where

605
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,232
I'm sure

606
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,000
Great great

607
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:16,768
Cray cray cray cray

608
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,376
The perfect day that got ruined

609
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,424
Because of antifa pulling a false

610
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,472
Swaggin

611
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,544
Really really frustrating

612
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
Freep

613
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,152
Frustrating too because it's all

614
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,432
It's one of the first

615
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,832
Winston says I think I can think of Alex showing some vulnerability like he's just yelling about how antifa

616
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:41,856
Kick their ass

617
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:48,768
Catching myself because they were going to fold Flags they said they were so busy focusing on

618
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:02,080
What in the problem was it was a millionaire

619
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,616
It was a million of us there

620
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
He said he does

621
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
I'm sorry just left

622
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,576
When you're when you're getting older your prostate

623
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,136
It's all inflamed when you get all angry

624
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,672
Hopped up on

625
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,952
So much fun

626
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,512
Bathroom break

627
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,048
He does actually go to the bathroom

628
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,912
And while he's while he's out Taylor still there

629
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,448
Script which is this like

630
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,984
Bringing some

631
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,288
These Q people into this

632
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,056
This fold

633
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,360
And I know a lot of people are still believe in Kiel

634
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,896
I have a lot of friends

635
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:44,320
I was wondering the same thing you know

636
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,880
Last night

637
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:51,744
He's going to turn it over to Joe Biden he's going to be the president in United States

638
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,280
Which is not the plan

639
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:56,352
People are freaking out already I mean yeah some of them probably are

640
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,168
Kind of being a little bit biased and wanting to trust the plan still

641
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,008
That's not going to work all it was was a plan to keep us complacent

642
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,800
I plan to not keep us on the street

643
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,080
Doing activism

644
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,920
The help

645
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,224
You guys went home

646
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,784
You could have stayed out on the streets

647
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,344
Screw you remember in Portland

648
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
They say.

649
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,416
Alex

650
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,696
Stop them

651
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,232
Did tell people to

652
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,000
Respect the curfew

653
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
Yeah

654
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,048
Yeah yeah

655
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,584
So

656
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,376
I think it was Alex who took them off

657
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,400
Off the streets

658
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:34,240
I just I find this all to be really

659
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
Sad

660
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,848
Yeah it is a sad posturing among right-wing

661
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,872
Scam artist

662
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,896
Stealing through

663
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,688
Trying to stake their claim on

664
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,480
You know just trying to steak

665
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,272
The Clement people who they can manipulate

666
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,088
It's a bummer shuffling

667
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
It's like the tide

668
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,160
But it's also like

669
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,208
Think about that

670
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,256
It seems pretty clear

671
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,048
To me you looking at those candidates

672
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,072
What's going on

673
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,400
I don't know how you could hear a clip like this

674
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,448
And think that any of your like

675
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:07,520
Preferred right-wing media Outlets have any integrity

676
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,568
How big is that

677
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,088
Gateway pundit

678
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,352
There's not many holdouts out there

679
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,656
The entire right-wing media

680
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,936
Ecosystem was large

681
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,704
Driven by

682
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,496
A grudge for a very long time

683
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,032
Bird

684
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:42,848
Basically yes

685
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:46,688
Yeah I remember my dad reading drudge in the 90s

686
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:53,088
It really warped a lot of the the the media line in shows like Rush

687
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,416
Wouldn't be in the same situation

688
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
It was a

689
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
Clearinghouse

690
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,536
For the talking points of the the right wing

691
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:05,632
Yeah and now Alex is suggesting that he doesn't like Trump any more

692
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,912
Trump wouldn't pay him off

693
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,704
What the f***

694
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,728
Do you get it

695
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,312
It know if your if the president doesn't pay you off

696
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
For good coverage

697
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:20,992
Then it's your responsibility as a principled person to sell to see CNN

698
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:27,136
Completely alter your coverage

699
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,160
Dammit

700
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
You don't like

701
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,464
If we suddenly took

702
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,304
S*** ton of money from I don't know let's say Jeff Bezos

703
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,376
Coverage wouldn't change

704
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,448
The I replace you with an echo

705
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,056
Melissa

706
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:52,736
Can we love your show we're going to give you 20 million dollars but the

707
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,272
That

708
00:32:54,528 --> 00:33:00,416
Jordan we're going to replace it with

709
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,720
Just listen to

710
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
That way we

711
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,048
You can turn him off

712
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,120
I do not see Neighbors anymore I couldn't turn the volume

713
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,496
I don't understand how anybody can

714
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:15,776
I'd like

715
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,312
That they have any kind of

716
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
Like

717
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,896
Calling it alternative media is laughable when you're like

718
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,736
Yeah get money from Trump City

719
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,760
The CNN

720
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:30,368
That's alternate turned on if your alternative Broad

721
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,648
Bitter

722
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,976
Anyway this next clip I just kept him cuz it just like

723
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
No fuc

Some calls and this guy

726
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,584
No way

727
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:40,864

1.6 billion listeners

746
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,896
Infowars

747
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,176
Where

748
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,880
So we are here on this next clip from January 7th

749
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:41,280
I got to say I found this episode to be largely unlistenable like I really didn't even think it was a show

750
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,096
Yeah I kind of felt like Alex trying to figure out what

751
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
The Narrative was going to be

752
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,936
And it's just like alright antifa did this

753
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:48,960
What does

754
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,752
Bye

755
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,056
Eating and then they went away and all the pain

756
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,080
Patriots got really

757
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,104
Excited

758
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,128
And they had to fight back

759
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,432
Because now the police were attacking them into it

760
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,712
If you don't like that kind of

761
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,736
He's sort of talking

762
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,040
Pruitt to get his bearings about it

763
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,064
It's just a

764
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
It's not an interesting

765
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:05,856
Sing show it all

766
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,160
As a man licking his wounds in the

767
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,696
The posture of somebody who won

768
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,000
Trying to figure out what to do

769
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:16,096
Which control the what's the angle that we can move forward

770
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
Bright and

771
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,656
At the end of the episode

772
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,960
You pretty clear that

773
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,496
Doesn't really have a problem

774
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,776
With what happened

775
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:31,456
What killed all the babies we devil worship God took his support away we got to fight back and take it back

776
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,320
Capital so evil

777
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,000
Politically

778
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:50,656
The point is is that we're not the ones Vernon Town police station and killing people are responding to that they start

779
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:55,008
We're not ashamed of anything come out

780
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
So that's

781
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,176
That's her to where we're at I think a lot of people would

782
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,200
100%

783
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,480
Trump if

784
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,576
Osher

785
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:12,416
Because remember the address that he gave before the riot

786
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:16,256
I mean the storming of the Capitol building of the United

787
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,304
It States of America a nuclear power

788
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:24,704
He said all those things that were like I bet it's going to be antifa who's going to take over the Capitol Building in Just A

789
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,728
Too short. Of time

790
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,264
Answer this will prove incorrect

791
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,568
I made it there is enriched

792
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,336
Tradition of

793
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,128
People blaming their enemies

794
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,944
It does seem very easy to do

795
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,968
I think

796
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:39,296
I think your item and I hate to say that I think you're right they probably could

797
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,576
Yeah that's true

798
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,624
222 a certain audio

799
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,648
Right

800
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,440
Which would be 80% of 4

801
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:46,976
At this point

802
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,512
So Alex

803
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,048
On the 8th

804
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,328
On Friday

805
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,144
He starts off his show with a bit of a

806
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
Different tone

807
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
I think he's accepted

808
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
This point.

809
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
Conceited

810
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:05,152
Globalist disinfo operatives do not want you to take political actually want to freeze you right now believing everything

811
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:11,552
Fine it's not in Texas he is surrounded in the White House

812
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:15,136
It's not a CG video

813
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,744
Concede the election

814
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,512
Yesterday

815
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
Last night

816
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,864
So is up to speed with the realities on what

817
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,144
New line

818
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,472
New text messages from the people who tell him that

819
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,544
I believe that you know I I don't

820
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,824
Keep up-to-date fully on

821
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,848
Accustaff but

822
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,920
My understanding that some people were speculating that it was a

823
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,688
Deepfake

824
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:43,808
Or something

825
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,624
Also by this point on the 8th

826
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,392
If there were picture

827
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:51,488
Coming out and a lot of the people who were there and look very sad

828
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,512
Suspicious

829
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,280
Well

830
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:58,656
But they also seem to be wearing like Oath Keepers shirts and they kind of look like a militia

831
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,752
Is like a militia other than antifa

832
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:03,776
Right

833
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,312
So Alex has to now

834
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,872
Incorporate that into the cover of

835
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,664
Antifa

836
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,712
Which we've established here on the 7th

837
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:17,344
I will test explain why there's also militia people there

838
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,440
It's tough to explain

839
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,000
He was

840
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,840
You were there

841
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,144
Rest stop

842
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,472
With another contingent of

843
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,360
Probably will end up being a militia controlled by feds and militias are constitutional

844
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,640
Not bad

845
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
Delicious

846
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,112
Militia

847
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,696
My friend Alice is almost always exactly

848
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,792
Exactly like what he was saying about like Boston bomber

849
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,864
The body language of men

850
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:06,496
F*** out of here making s*** off

851
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,128
PB in his absence

852
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,760
Want to get him on as an expletive more than anyone else

853
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,552
Those guys are not okay

854
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,600
Yeah you could give a full-throated

855
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,928
Defensive end organization

856
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,696
Keepers are

857
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,768
Seems to maybe not be answering Alex's

858
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
Call

859
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:32,096
There seems to be a limited gas

860
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,376
School lettuce

861
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,144
The interviewing

862
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,960
BBQ Shaman that would get you to where you are

863
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,496
Episode

864
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,288
Really mad

865
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,312
Accu Staff

866
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,848
On this side this episode

867
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,616
But

868
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,640
He's again

869
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,688
Very much not wanting to

870
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
To alienate

871
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,480
The cube people

872
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:53,088
Sure you can still redeem yourself

873
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,368
Cube made this

874
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
This whole f***

875
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,720
What yes

876
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:02,304
Pull it off at War for the dumb Q people who

877
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,376
Storm the building I want to learn ninjutsu

878
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:08,960
There was another ingredient wasn't Chester

879
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,544
It wasn't

880
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,312
Josh

881
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,360
Militia

882
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,944
Q

883
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,016
The Air Force veteran a wonderful woman

884
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:22,784
This is Babbitt

885
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,880
Mother country believe she was storming it under two orders of the president

886
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,000
Behind

887
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,768
Antifa

888
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,376
And that is fact doesn't mean

889
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,144
Like the cute stuff

890
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,984
Esoteric

891
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:46,336
Rodger dump truck to the Hoover Dam

892
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,224
Free General

893
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,928
There you go

894
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:07,840
Ansible literally I don't think any of those things

895
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:12,960
Sad sometimes

896
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,496
And forth Alex would turn him

897
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,544
A villain and hero

898
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,824
Pretty regularly

899
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,408
How's Hot and Cold relationship

900
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,712
I died I just

901
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,552
I don't think you should be allowed to say that wonderful woman

902
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,832
If I know

903
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,600
And you know

904
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:33,696
In your heart that if you and your son and Gavin McGinnis were around you be like

905
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
I know she's dead

906
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,488
Got great tits

907
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,280
So you don't get to say that

908
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,656
So Alex has a

909
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
Media

910
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,520
About the fact that antifa infiltrated

911
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,544
Nausea

912
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,080
Hippie rally and

913
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,616
Comes from the old New York

914
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,175
Mo Brooks

915
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,015
I said they were briefed

916
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,111
Was planning a thousand Patriots

917
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,903
As well

918
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
Chain

919
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,095
Two people were arrested

920
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,655
They confirmed for posing as

921
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,983
Bank of America great again people to make America great again

922
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,823
So the headline

923
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,151
Quote to known antifa members posed as pro-trump to

924
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,687
Infiltrate Capital riot

925
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,455
Sources

926
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,735
So it's a claim

927
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,271
From source

928
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:34,111
And it's awesome to like if you just get to the fourth paragraph at the store you find

929
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:40,767
Washington Times reported initially claimed two other protesters were actually philadelphia-based antifa members

930
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:44,095
Retired military officer with access to facial recognition software

931
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:48,191
But the outlet deleted the article after the software company told BuzzFeed news

932
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,471
The story without right

933
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,239
False

934
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,007
Ha

935
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:51,775
Huh

936
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,615
Kind of an article that has a nice headline for Alec

937
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,639
But it actually means no

938
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:01,503
He goes on and on about that I like two people were arrested

939
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:05,087
That are known antifa

940
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:08,159
I don't know I think I think I hate this just so much

941
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:11,231
Because you know you like you can see the conversation that

942
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,511
Like you can

943
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,791
Read that and go

944
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,559
Oh okay

945
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,327
Here's what happened

946
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,887
Somebody went to somebody higher up

947
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,655
Who is like

948
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:23,007
Oh s*** they did it what do we do when we do just put it everything teeth

949
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,799
That's it like they didn't

950
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,567
Think about it

951
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,359
Didn't come up with some brilliant

952
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,127
Game plan

953
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:28,895
They're just like

954
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,967
You say antifa did it and we'll wait and see what happen

955
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,503
And it's disappointing

956
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
Probably

957
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:38,623
We we continue down the road

958
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,391
Stock from

959
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,671
On the 7th into the 8th

960
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:44,511
Is that Trump only conceded because he had a metaphorical gunt

961
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,095
Threatened

962
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,679
25th amendment removal

963
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
I'll Trump

964
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,311
Yesterday

965
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,591
Morning

966
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,663
Good afternoon

967
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,991
Define your supporters at the crying the whole thing

968
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,207
Morning

969
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,535
We are going to remove you we have the cabinet both right now

970
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:21,631
Remove you under 25

971
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:28,031
So this is the way that you get around the fact that Trump was yelling about how like you know I'm never going to back down in the morning

972
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,895
Because otherwise you kind of got to be like he was just

973
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,431
Full of s***

974
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,455
You just

975
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,759
And also it would be

976
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,295
Really difficult thing to just

977
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,319
Survive it like

978
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,087
Why was

979
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,135
Why is he does have evidence

980
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:43,903
That this was a

981
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,231
False and fraudulent election why would he ever back down

982
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:50,815
Now he is backing down by that either

983
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:51,839
He was lying

984
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:55,679
Open the sort of person who would allow fraudulent election

985
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:59,263
It does seem like they're not stuff and the only way around that is hey man

986
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,591
Your metaphorical gun to his head that you had a label

987
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:09,247
Yeah but Pence's metaphorical gun only happened because you held a literal gun

988
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,015
You know

989
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,319
They're not going to wrestle with this that's

990
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087
But I just

991
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:17,183
I just it's so frustrating because it's like an eco-terrorist

992
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
Blew up

993
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:21,791
The Capitol building and killed a bunch of people I wouldn't be like listen

994
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,631
We got to like no

995
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,679
You don't get to do that though

996
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:30,239
I love requirement to ban but no

997
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,031
It's so hard

998
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:39,455
But at the same time you don't make a lot of money scamming people around the ideas

999
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,759
God I'm so

1000
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,527
Yeah that's

1001
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:45,599
House of Cards

1002
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,647
He's belts

1003
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,671
Can get knocked over

1004
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,999
That he has to protect

1005
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:52,767
Play work for him

1006
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,327
Scaring people about

1007
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,351
So Alex

1008
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,631
That was there

1009
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,679
At the Capitol building

1010
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,959
For a Time

1011
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,751
Provably

1012
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,311
He was a lot of people were reporting

1013
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,103
That he was trying to

1014
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,383
Incite a riot

1015
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:14,783
It was my sense from watching the entirety of Infowars over the course of the day

1016
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,879
Expressed our last episode is exactly what I feel

1017
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:23,231
He was definitely saying things that look really bad in hindsight

1018
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,255
But once

1019
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,279
Ship popped off

1020
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,559
Real seriously app

1021
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:32,959
I didn't see him inciting people outside of him doing a inciting radio show

1022
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,727
Yeah yeah

1023
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,751
In terms of what he

1024
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,567
He actually did it the capital there wasn't a lot of evidence

1025
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,847
So that on the show at

1026
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,383
But Alex

1027
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,175
Does have video of himself

1028
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,967
And he is trying to talk

1029
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,735
The crowd down

1030
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,271
If this video is too big

1031
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,807
Be believed as like

1032
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,367
A full representation of his actions

1033
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
DC

1034
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,415
Very much like

1035
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,439
Hey everybody

1036
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:57,791
We have a permit to be over there everybody go over there

1037
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,327
And I think like I mean

1038
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,607
Look dude sucks

1039
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,143
But that's probably

1040
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,191
The best you could do in that Circle

1041
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:04,959
Sure

1042
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,007
And so he plays a little bit of that on the

1043
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:02,047
Alex has

1044
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:02,815
Be instinct

1045
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,863
To know in the moment that like

1046
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,631
If this gets

1047
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,679
Too much further out of hand

1048
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,447
We're f*****

1049
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,471
Yep this is going

1050
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,007
To be something that is going

1051
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,543
They will

1052
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,567
Take

1053
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
Problem of right-wing

1054
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,127
Extremism

1055
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,151
Seriously

1056
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,967
If this goes any farther so I have to do my part

1057
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,503
To deescalate

1058
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:25,855
It makes sense it's in his character it's exactly what you would do the Gate of gates all over

1059
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,303
Obviously I decided that

1060
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,071
Said that

1061
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:40,703
Insisted that I do that because I'm so proud of doing that I've almost certainly inspired

1062
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,263
Other people to do that but that's not my fault no

1063
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,847
To come back from the edge as it were

1064
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,871
Are you going to like these

1065
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,663
Things this far and you want it

1066
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,687
To come back or else

1067
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:53,759
You're in trouble this is all

1068
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:57,343
Contractors

1069
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,391
So like I said

1070
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:02,207
At the sense that I get is he just knows this is too much

1071
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:02,975
This is dangerous

1072
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:16,543
No no no

1073
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:56,735
Provocative

1074
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:57,759
Play Store

1075
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:00,575
No no I mean that's

1076
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:06,719
That is pretty remarkable snapshot of what happens when exactly

1077
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,255
Been trying to get to happen happen

1078
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:14,655
Yeah I do know that you never wanted that to happen you wanted to live in that in-between stage where you can profit off of

1079
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,935
Tension

1080
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,495
Supposed to be tantric you're not supposed to come all over the capitol

1081
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,799
Yeah it happens

1082
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:24,127
You get on your radio show and you make a lot of money excited

1083
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,151
Eating people yelling

1084
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:27,711
We're going to storm the steak houses in all this

1085
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,479
S*** yeah

1086
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,247
Forever

1087
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,295
Yeah man once you're there and it's happy

1088
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,855
Bring you get a bullhorn and you yell get off the building

1089
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,391
That's how it goes

1090
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,159
Yeah

1091
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:41,535
No one knows what that means you don't even know what that means

1092
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,071
Swear to God

1093
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,351
If I am a person

1094
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,631
Who is

1095
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:52,031
In the middle of trying to storm a capital building and some a****** just start screaming USA

1096
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,055
Instinctively

1097
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,335
Start chanting with

1098
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,615
Kill me just kill me

1099
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,639
I don't want to be that person

1100
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:59,199
What if you're climbing on the Capitol building

1101
00:50:59,455 --> 00:50:59,967
And then you hear it

1102
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,735
The Texan

1103
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:07,135
Get on the bullhorn get off the building

1104
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:12,255
You can't tear me down I don't see it being ineffective that but if I'm on my way to the building

1105
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:17,887
Maybe and I just stopped to chat USA I guess I think I might be a follower.

1106
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,703
I swear I thought I was

1107
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,239
So I went to the Past

1108
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,799
To Victory if you wants to explain to his audience

1109
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
But he can't quite

1110
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:27,615
You know

1111
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,455
I need to do a presentation in here

1112
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,063
No problem

1113
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:40,671
I'm going to come in here I'm going to lay out the path to Victory

1114
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,719
So he doesn't

1115
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,255
I don't think he does do this

1116
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,791
I didn't hear it

1117
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,559
Pastor Victor

1118
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,607
Other than blame antifa

1119
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,631
Well

1120
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,423
Dan the path to Victory

1121
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,727
Certainly

1122
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,519
Very few can walk

1123
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,543
The path to

1124
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,591
Church

1125
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,383
During one of the breaks

1126
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,151
Here's that I like

1127
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,175
Either

1128
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,199

We are going to find out

1158
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,879
And then this is going to blow your mind

1159
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:17,439
Did you know that Trump had mob ties

1160
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,463
Squalo

1161
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,999
Yeah we're going to find that

1162
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:24,607
I guarantee you that Alex is going to suddenly discover this fact

1163
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,655
That he absolutely never knew before

1164
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,423
Oh yeah yeah

1165
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:32,031
Five years later wild wild how did you know that

The Consortium is on the East Coast

1169
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:47,903
Did you know that with a name like Corleone you get arrested but was Trump you down

1170
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,975
You know it's almost like somebody who is already in

1171
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:56,607
Throw two medium Powers would very easily be swayed by superpowers

1172
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,631
Probably

1173
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:00,191
So there were like I said some deaths

1174
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:02,239

00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:05,823
Capital

1178
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:08,895

1179
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,175
Related ones

1180
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,479

1181
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,015
A couple of officers

1182
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,879

That's a great place

1188
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:30,655
Alex is going to lie about

1189
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,423
These cops

1190
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,703
You had a

1191
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:37,823
A million people in 100,000

1192
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,871
What's run the whole thing

1193
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,175
I have

1194
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:44,735

And at this point there's some reporting that

1201
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,607
It's calling this an apparent suicide

1202
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,631
Is very sad

1203
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,423
The other is Brian sickness

1204
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,215
Who was assaulted by Trump rioters

1205
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,751
Neither of these men die from

1206
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,519
Stroke

1207
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,311
Deflect from the humor

1208
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,871

Very sad

1212
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:18,015
It's so obvious

1213
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:18,783
This whole

1214
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,807
Like a back

1215
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,087
Back the blue nonsense

1216
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:27,999
The police cover

1217
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:31,327
We want to kill Nancy Pelosi let us kill her

1218
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,119
So there were only like this

1219
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,167

00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,703
Roller shoes

1221
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,847

Baltimore looting

1230
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,199

Nice add transition I think these people might be a little

1236
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:55,551
You know what I'm since I'm getting a Feeling

1237
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,879
That the far-right is trapped in this place where they like

1238
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:05,279
God we want to kill everybody and what happened we want to do again yeah

1239
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,839
Can't do it again if we say we did it

1240
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:14,239
The first time is antifa it was antifa but I also have to tell people

1241
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:17,823
To do it another time while at the same time telling people

1242
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,383
Not an advanced said it will be antifa

1243
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,175

Trump will be president

1245
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:28,575

Beauty that's a beauty I think that's cute

1271
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:55,359
Few hundred people in the Capitol building if you think that's

1272
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,127
Impressive

1273
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:56,895
Wait for this

1274
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,687
They didn't even really want to go in

1275
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:02,783
Ordered

1276
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,319
The crowds in

1277
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,623
Didn't even want it

1278
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,671
The cover-up

1279
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:11,999
135 and the other fifty or so Orange

1280
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,327
Windows outdoor

1281
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:21,727
Yeah man the be there police were told to bring in

1282
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:24,031
A man because you are cover for antifa

1283
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,567
The orange hat people who

1284
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,943
Are almost certainly proud boy related to require a lot of

1285
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,527
Like there's going to be a find a solution in a way out of this problem

1286
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,319
Which is to say

1287
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,111
That the right-wing is all terrorists

1288
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,415
It's going to require a lot of

1289
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,183
Diplomacy

1290
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,999
It's going to require a lot of compromise

1291
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,023
Thought and

1292
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:47,583
Some concession that's going to that's just going to be true

1293
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,119
Now on the other

1294
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,143
I have watched

1295
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:53,983
A lot of superhero movies

1296
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,591
Saying one way is faster than the other

1297
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,407
So

1298
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:06,783
We only had a couple hundred people in there right whatever

1299
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:10,623
They didn't really even want to go anywhere near the building

1300
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:12,159
Right but over there

1301
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,183
Pianos like look

1302
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,975
Still probably hired

1303
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:15,743
Google

1304
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:19,071
I was there are Lister saw it

1305
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:23,935
Popstantot

1306
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:27,519
And it's still low yeah they were there too

1307
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,567
The cops the cops

1308
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,591
Backpacks

1309
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:39,551
So these skinny jean guys are the antifa guys and they hired a group of goons

1310
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:42,623
Who are much stronger than them because they're not strong

1311
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:45,439
Tired stronger people as backup

1312
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,463
To fight again

1313
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,487
Against the police or something

1314
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:51,583
Seems like this would be a job that almost nobody would take

1315
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,911
Since when that mean the anti-fascists were hiring fascist

1316
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:59,263
It would imply that

1317
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:02,847
Cuz he would have to be like

1318
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,871
If you are that group

1319
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:08,223
Of I don't know bikers let's do whatever you want

1320
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:11,551
To take a certain amount of money in order to

1321
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,855
Almost certainly go on a death match

1322
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:16,159
That is correct

1323
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:16,927
To get killed

1324
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,975
For trying to the Capitol Building

1325
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:21,535
Of the United States of America a nuclear power

1326
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:24,607
Right just doing it as a job

1327
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:29,983
What if I grant no I don't even get 5 grand I'll do 425

1328
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,263
Okay I'll take two

1329
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,799
What kind of Gone in 60 Seconds

1330
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:38,431
This kind of nonsense is this perfect crime they have all of the family members of this biker gang

1331
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,455
Kidnap

1332
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:43,039
I don't I don't know.

1333
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,599
Expect asking me to accept

1334
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,623
Is a little bit too

1335
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,671
The little bit sad

1336
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,463
Not for my family Dan

1337
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,999
To go buy any old ship

1338
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:55,327
So we do get one person who answered Alex's call

1339
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,351
No Steve

1340
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:58,399
China Canal Stewart Roads

1341
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,935
Snow Rodger Stone

1342
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:03,007
People seem really important to this moment

1343
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:06,591
Very

1344
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,127
Someone who is less important

1345
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,175
Maybe that's why he can appear

1346
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,455
You're not a lot of heat on him

1347
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,735
Is Joel skousen

1348
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:14,783
He is somebody who

1349
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,575
Can just come and go as he pleases

1350
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:19,135
He's notably been somebody who's been

1351
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,671
Been harshly critical of trump

1352
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:25,279
Is power placement

1353
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,559
Infowars world

1354
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:31,935
Over the last few years now we might be seeing it elevate again

1355
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,983
Based on his relation to W Cleon

1356
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:35,519
Its sole

1357
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:38,335
He shows up and of course everything's are f******

1358
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,871
Can false-flag this guy

1359
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:42,175
Course

1360
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:44,223
Play antifa didn't know what have you bought

1361
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:46,271
He has proof

1362
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:51,903
Anybody you might have got this from another fella we know name Lionel

1363
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:55,487
Well The Tell-Tale cases every one of these people have died

1364
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,327
Weapons

1365
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,935
Trump supporters don't bring those types of things to

1366
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:06,239
Backpacks

1367
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,543
Transporters

1368
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,311
Don't

1369
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,079
Have

1370
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,615
And they don't bring back

1371
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,895
Kind of stuff to Rally's that's

1372
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:14,687
Exclusive

1373
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:19,551
This isn't fair. This isn't Fun

1374
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,599
I don't like it there mean

1375
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:22,623
It's pretty dumb

1376
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:24,927
Disconnect Clippers

1377
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,695
Absolutely

1378
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,231
Skousen

1379
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,511
Is saying that like

1380
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,047
Some really big happen

1381
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,583
False flag coming

1382
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,631
Yeah Alex suggest

1383
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,911
Well it's vacuum

1384
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,447
The cute stuffies the fall

1385
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,215
False flag that's

1386
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:37,983
Call Matt

1387
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,007
Then

1388
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,311
Scales and throws Lynnwood under

1389
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,615
Hell yeah throw Lynnwood under the bus

1390
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:48,991
He's already under the bus you getting crunchy under that bus now I would suggest that the things that

1391
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:52,831
Thousand takes issue with our very similar to a lot of the things Alex says

1392
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,903
The populist movement

1393
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:01,279
What you doing

1394
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,815
And I'm just trying to portray

1395
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:08,447
It is going to be more than a truck bomb it's going to be more than Oklahoma City Bombing that's been done before

1396
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:10,239
I think they're going to try to Gin up

1397
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,007
Some

1398
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,567
Large mass revolutionary movements

1399
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:21,247
Pakistan Tina PLS

1400
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:23,295
Lynn

1401
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:26,623
Texas he's about to order you to launch a military attack

1402
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:34,047
That's right and unfortunately

1403
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,863
Linwood publishes rumor about

1404
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:54,527
I got a little cut their supporters

1405
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,295
Bulshit

1406
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:59,135
B******* saying that to a guy who said that a hundred times over the last

1407
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:01,695
Couple months and end in between waves

1408
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:06,815
Not not in like a orm repeating the same story

1409
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:10,399
There are no reasons that the Deep state will be killing Trump very

1410
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:13,983
And for quite awhile to because

1411
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,847
Durban Poison

1412
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:20,639
They're going to kill Trump on day one

1413
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:24,735
We're going to Nuke the inauguration

1414
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:28,319
Helicopter

1415
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,087
Oh man

1416
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,207
Is bulshit then he should

1417
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,231
I consider the bookings

1418
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:36,255
Insidious

1419
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,815
I won't take this away from me

1420
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,655
There's a lot of there's a lot of you know you got to give it up

1421
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,983
Alex is a newsman

1422
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:49,823
Any does sometimes come through with hard-hitting scoops

1423
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,895
And I will say that this is something I've not heard reported anywhere else

1424
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,687
Okay that is giving me

1425
01:05:56,223 --> 01:06:01,599
He's eating at one sitting five lobster tails

1426
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:06,207
Giant bowls of ice cream and an eating prime rib is Desert and shoveling down

1427
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,743
House of Crabs

1428
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:10,559
3 times we normally

1429
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:14,143
Australian Housewives

1430
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:17,215
Heart attack heart attack

1431
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:20,799
Alex's Alex's reporting on

1432
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,335
Trump's outrageous

1433
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:31,551
I think it's probably the person that I agree with most

1434
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,111
He's not going to last very long

1435
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:40,767
Yeah I do like that as a response to because it's like I know you're making that up but I don't want to fight you about it

1436
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,327
Well that's not.

1437
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,607
He really shouldn't do that

1438
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,679
Scales one of the things I've noticed that he does a lot is Judge

1439
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,447
Just make stuff up

1440
01:06:54,591 --> 01:07:00,479
List of the 36 people that are looking for none of those were the agent provocateur

1441
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:05,855
If they did arrest some of those agent provocateurs I think they'll be quietly released because

1442
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:09,951
You know the higher-ups will be told you know these are our boys let him go

1443
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,631
All the guys doing this

1444
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:20,447
Best dog backpack okay

1445
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,495
Just so everybody on the right nose

1446
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:25,055
If you were arrested at d.c.

1447
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:28,383
And then let go you are antifa

1448
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:32,223
Probably let's name them all by name

1449
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:36,063
The problem with a theory like this and a part of the problem of the mentality like

1450
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,367
You'll never hear about it

1451
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,159
If this thing of imagining happen

1452
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:42,463
Then you never hear about it I'll yok

1453
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:44,511
Vistaprint that theory came true

1454
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,327
Amazing house

1455
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,399
Didn't have fact that you never hear about it

1456
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,423
Is proof of

1457
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,959
The reality of this

1458
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,543
I would say is it one of the big things

1459
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,591
The big takeaways from this interview with skousen

1460
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,359
Is like

1461
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:00,895
You did Alex

1462
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,687
Pretty much agree in with him

1463
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,735
That like it's time to move on

1464
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,503
Trump

1465
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,527
Useless

1466
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:09,855
He tried to do this like a little dictator push thing

1467
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,647
Two weeks

1468
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,999
I think the Trump movement is really going to be looking

1469
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:16,767
Poor

1470
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,047
New leadership

1471
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:26,751
Cultivator

1472
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:27,519
I really do

1473
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,079
But him

1474
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,431
Has wounded him severely

1475
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:37,503
And I just think he's going to still be a fortune

1476
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,063
Try to act like he can fix the Republican party but

1477
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,855
Do it

1478
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,159
His kids don't have other the Don Jr

1479
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:55,167
Donald Trump's children about the junior running more

1480
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:59,519
Or anything else I think that's going to be

1481
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,383
Play the movement

1482
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,407
And

1483
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:08,735
I hate you so much in my

1484
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:13,855
Burning

1485
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,391
Not trying I don't think

1486
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:18,719
He's getting better

1487
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:21,791
It takes decades to learn this and just doesn't matter

1488
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:26,143
That's right you got to be in the mood for

1489
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:32,799
5060 years and I have all my uncles background of my father's background I mean it just takes a lot of money to develop in

1490
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:36,127
Instinct where you can smell evil where you can smell the Deep state

1491
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:36,895
Presents

1492
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:37,919
And that's what

1493
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:42,783
We need to teach people to the

1494
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:48,671
How to make stuff up at every turn I call everything I just know how it feels

1495
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:55,071
To be done Junior because I too was a shittier version of my dad and I was worth that

1496
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,655
Years and years

1497
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,215
Just taking swing

1498
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:04,031
I'm being embarrassed about it over that

1499
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:07,359
You got to be embarrassed for the first year

1500
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:10,175
And then you're free of it and you can say whatever you want

1501
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:12,223
Skylight ninjutsu

1502
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,015
Doughboy

1503
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:18,623
Now we get to whatever one is probably

1504
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,159
4in what I was the most

1505
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:20,927
Interested in

1506
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,951
Episode

1507
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,791
Known as

1508
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,327
Duchamp

1509
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:33,215
Jake the Barbarian I guess this earlier incantation or incarnation

1510
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:35,007
So he's got the Q shaman

1511
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:41,407
Is the guy who are all the pictures of the guy in the band like

1512
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,431
Helmet

1513
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:44,479
I don't I don't

1514
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:47,039
Know anything about this guy except for that he's the Q shopping

1515
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:53,439
I found out about him whenever somebody said that guy

1516
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,463
You know about this

1517
01:10:54,719 --> 01:11:00,863
I heard his name was cute, he chose that name and was fine with it and I've worked backwards and I know everything

1518
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:07,263
Yeah it's like Riverside Strangler by the river

1519
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:15,199
Does q it's the Night Stalker

1520
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,223
At night

1521
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,783
Exoclick Alex

1522
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,319
Play the clip of him

1523
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:22,111
From the day

1524
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:25,695
From outside the Capitol building

1525
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,719
And I don't think Alex

1526
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,487
Free watched

1527
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:28,767
Because

1528
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:31,839
He's saying a lot of the same stuff that Alex says

1529
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,631
And this whole thing was a setup

1530
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:35,679
That I was going to try and embarrass him

1531
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,727
And try and be like a dick to

1532
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,031
Unfortunately

1533
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:42,079
He sounds like Alex

1534
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:47,711
100 miles in any direction and you got a deep underground base

1535
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:54,623
Okay

1536
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:58,463
Joker sometimes get attention

1537
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:09,471
Who's ready to play that clip come back from the other side and be like

1538
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,775
Can you believe this nonsense

1539
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:19,199
I can't argue with any of that stuff

1540
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:23,807
See this coming. These are the kind of things you would want producers

1541
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:25,087
Is to help you

1542
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,367
Powerful Alex

1543
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,135
Alex

1544
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:27,903
Yorkie

1545
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,975
Well it turns out that the shaman

1546
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,303
Nothing but the shop why would he have

1547
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:40,703
Jake something-or-other on route

1548
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:44,543
Citizen oqshom

1549
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:48,639
He's a listener of Alex's show

1550
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,199
Just call me Jay calix

1551
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,735
It's an honor to speak with you sir

1552
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:01,951
Have you eaten

1553
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,767
He was not Invincible at Trump's inaugural

1554
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:08,607
You know I have heard those warnings but you know

1555
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:09,631
I'm going to believe

1556
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:14,239
That Q is military intelligence and I have a lot of faith in the military military intelligence

1557
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,031
Okay well I was

1558
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:20,127
They couldn't stop you from storming the Capitol building

1559
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:20,895
Call The Top

1560
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:24,479
And they're all surrounded and cut off the

1561
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:29,599
See this is what I find really remarkable about this

1562
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:30,623
Is that

1563
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,647
He is one of

1564
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,927
I mean I don't know

1565
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:37,535
I don't know how much of their is like uniformity of belief but a large part of

1566
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,071
The cube world does not like out

1567
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,351
So he happened

1568
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:43,679
Used to be someone who's fairly high-profile world

1569
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:48,799
Who also happens to like Alleyway and it's trying to have this conversation with Alex right

1570
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:53,663
That he doesn't I don't think he realizes that Alex is trying to be like

1571
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:56,991
Like I believe the same thing

1572
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:59,295
He's trying to use the shopping as a prop

1573
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:01,599
In order to delegitimize

1574
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,879
The qanon stuff

1575
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,927
Right as part of the continuing

1576
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,695
Get people

1577
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:07,231
Back from Q

1578
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,511
Here's what Alex

1579
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:09,791
Could have said immediate

1580
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:10,815
Okay

1581
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:13,119
You believe that Q is military until the

1582
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:15,679
Military Intelligence absolutely

1583
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:17,727
Must have known you were going to be at the Capitol building

1584
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,007
And did not stop

1585
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:21,055
Write the argument there is that they wanted them

1586
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,079
Right

1587
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,383
Hugh

1588
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:26,687
Betrayed uq shaman

1589
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:29,503
No not at all kyusha I'm in love is what happened on the

1590
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,271
Text

1591
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:33,855
America

1592
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:37,183
Play The General Public

1593
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:42,559
Everything's fine they don't get involved

1594
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:48,703
Absolutely that's why I'm quite proud of what happened on January 6th

1595
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:55,103
Well

1596
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,151
First of all

1597
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:59,199
We are talking about a government

1598
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:01,503
That is literally telling people

1599
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:03,551
When they can open their business

1600
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:06,367
When making skiing hug their families

1601
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:08,159
A government that is literally a fat

1602
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:11,999
The way or trying to affect the way that their citizens at 3

1603
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,791
This is a problem for Alex

1604
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:17,631
It's because those are all arguments that he himself has made

1605
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:20,447
BBQ Shaman is coming in and explaining to Alex

1606
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:22,751
But this is tyranny and I'm proud that we stormed

1607
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:23,519
The capital

1608
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:27,615
We should fight tyranny which is also something Alex should believe

1609
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,919
Alex is antifa

1610
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,199
Coronavirus

1611
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:33,247
We're all antifa

1612
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,271
We're deep state

1613
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:40,415
Everything is this is really complicated for Alex

1614
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:43,999
The position that I would if I were him I wouldn't put myself in

1615
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,791
Because I don't know if there's any way to look

1616
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,327
In this in the circle

1617
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:52,447
Thermostat supposed to be

1618
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,727
No it's not

1619
01:15:53,983 --> 01:16:00,127
I know it sounds fun to yell at David Rothschild don't do it

1620
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:02,943
You're kind of an idiot yeah you're so dumb

1621
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,735
Q Shaman looks decent next

1622
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:05,503
Haha

1623
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,783
And that's cuz he like

1624
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,831
Fix you because he act like

1625
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,111
I mean I've totally against

1626
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:10,879
Gemini

1627
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:13,439
Thank you know everything I know about him

1628
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,231
I don't support and I think he's wrong

1629
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:18,303
All I know is that he's the cute Shaman and I agree with you on all

1630
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:22,143
There is a consistency to the beliefs

1631
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:26,495
He believes the same things Alex does

1632
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:27,519
To just

1633
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,543
Scam people

1634
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:29,823
And that's that

1635
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:30,847
Attention

1636
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:34,175
I mean it can't come off literally anymore like

1637
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:34,943
Hey Alice

1638
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,735
You said you wanted the

1639
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:37,759
Yeah

1640
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:40,319
I did it I'm proud of myself for doing it

1641
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,367
What's going on with you buddy

1642
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,135
Yeah yeah

1643
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,671
It's kind of a gut check for Alex

1644
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:46,207
I don't know if he's enjoying it

1645
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,767
So Alex is not into the idea of likes

1646
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:49,535
Storming the

1647
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,559
The capital

1648
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,607
Sure it's an abstract

1649
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:55,679
Idea like maybe a new Declaration of

1650
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,471
And the shamans not doing

1651
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:00,287
Do to me that sounds like treason

1652
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:05,919
Dependence

1653
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:11,295
I just think it needs to be done we can't fix things peacefully the right time right place you can see how though

1654
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:14,367
What's the 10-day investigation of probably about to get it

1655
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,927
Gorman capital

1656
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:23,327
Well I don't quite see it that way Alex to be perfectly honest with you I think that

1657
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:26,143
Anything we sent a very clear message

1658
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,447
The globalist and to the communist

1659
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,471
Send a message

1660
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,007
There's no

1661
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,799
Clarity of that message

1662
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,591
Not

1663
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,359
There

1664
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:41,759
The I mean there's some elements of it that are clear

1665
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:42,783
What was the other one

1666
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,063
I mean I'm scared

1667
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:46,367
I guess that's clear

1668
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,719
I think that you know the shop

1669
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:52,511
Man believes that they're up against

1670
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,047
The treasonous government

1671
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:57,119
They sent a very strong message with their actions and

1672
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:57,887
Alex

1673
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:59,167
Can play this game where you think

1674
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,959
There's going to be a new Declaration of

1675
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:01,727
Dependence

1676
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:02,495
Shawn Mendes

1677
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:07,359
And that you also doesn't agree with the idea that like oh that we work

1678
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,127
Going to get

1679
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:13,759
The 10 days that Rudy Giuliani wanted sure all f***** that up by storming the capital

1680
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:16,063
And so Alex is trying to get

1681
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,087
The shaman to

1682
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:17,855
Except

1683
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:18,879
Let the Deep state

1684
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:19,647
Who eats

1685
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,183
Supposed to be again

1686
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,487
They actually wanted every

1687
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,791
Here we go

1688
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:28,351
Do you know the Deep state

1689
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:35,775
Boston

1690
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:38,591
This is not good

1691
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:42,175
Well everybody has their opinion Alex and

1692
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:44,735
In all honesty I understand where you're coming from

1693
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:47,039
I just don't quite fully agree with you

1694
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:52,159
Location to Texas

1695
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:59,327
I believe in Occam's razor Alexandra

1696
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,607
Things that I know for

1697
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:03,935
Certain I can prove or things that I know beyond the shadow of a doubt a real

1698
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:10,335
Okay I take issue with that but it's not worth getting bugged

1699
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:14,943
It's weird I can almost respect it

1700
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:16,479
Like if you do that

1701
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:20,063
Because what you believe in is that there's a treasonous government

1702
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:20,831
And you were like

1703
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:23,135
I can't handle this anymore

1704
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,439
I'm going to go over throw the goddamn car

1705
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:31,839
And then you stick with it afterwards you say I believe that what I was doing was right I believe that it's

1706
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:32,607
Necessary

1707
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:33,375
End

1708
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:35,423
Sure all of your beliefs are based on polish

1709
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,471
But at least you believe s***

1710
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:40,799
It's in somebody who actually isn't

1711
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:42,079
Like just playing game

1712
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:48,223
It's terrifying I can't get around the fact

1713
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:53,087
But he's the queue Shaman there's that I knew you wouldn't be doing that kind of stuff unless you were trying to bran

1714
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:55,647
Unless you were trying to like sell Q shaman

1715
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,927
And shirts or something like that

1716
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:59,231
Every revolution has color for characters

1717
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:02,559
Yeah but there's no I mean there's got to be a Grifton here somewhere but

1718
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:04,351
It's far different

1719
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,423
Adidas outfit

1720
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,215
But I'm just saying I would I respect

1721
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,751
Tim infinitely more

1722
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,799
We have to pardon I do that

1723
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:15,360
Don't feel well respected

1724
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,640
Respect is a form of fear

1725
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,432
I'm more afraid of

1726
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,200
His bulge

1727
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:22,528
Because he's a Believer I wanted to make sure people do

1728
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,832
Perspective

1729
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:25,856
Take me to applaud

1730
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,208
At least there's a

1731
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:30,976
Consistency

1732
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,768
And I don't think Alex is ready for the

1733
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:33,792
Because I see

1734
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:35,328
I think that if he doesn't he's not used to be

1735
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,096
People who care

1736
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,888
No

1737
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,680
You thought that this was going to be some

1738
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,984
Idiot that he was going to be able to steamroll

1739
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,264
And do you have

1740
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:46,080
Agreeing on multiple accounts

1741
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:46,848
Spitaliks

1742
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:49,152
In a way that is not confrontational

1743
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:52,480
But we don't see eye-to-eye on that

1744
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:57,088
An accident like that there's something about underestimate your opponent I heard that yours

1745
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:00,160
Supposed to do that is that what you're supposed to do underestimate all the toy

1746
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,184
It's always helpful

1747
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:04,768
I think that one of the things that I've always felt about qanon

1748
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,072
Each other is

1749
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:09,376
Part of Alex's feelings about it or is

1750
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,656
Petty jealousy

1751
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:14,752
And like he's Furious that everybody is talking about so many of the same

1752
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:18,592
Things that he always had conspiracies about what they all think

1753
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:21,920
You uncovered it

1754
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:22,688
Think he's a little gel

1755
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:25,248
Barbarian

1756
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,784
You're very well spoken.

1757
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:32,416
New World Order secret Technologies all this is real

1758
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,304
I don't know about the Cleon skousen

1759
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,608
Nobody because the rampal know about it

1760
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,400
Beauty College

1761
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,568
Yeah it feels

1762
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:53,408
It feels like the intensity of it really feels like it has something to do with the credit

1763
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,176
Google

1764
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,224
I don't think that if

1765
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,016
Like at let's imagine isn't

1766
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,808
Fantasy world and qanon

1767
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,088
Did manage to over

1768
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:03,648
Overthrow the world government I don't think Alex

1769
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,416
To take that as a

1770
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,584
If everybody was throwing parties for Q jamun fruit

1771
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,400
Successfully overthrowing the New World Order

1772
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,680
Alex who

1773
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:19,264
Isn't that funny isn't it such like all I want to live in a fascist

1774
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,080
Nightmare so long as I'm On Top

1775
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:26,944
I don't want to live in a fascist nightmare work you is running things and I have to listen to that a******

1776
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:30,528
I don't know yet Alex doesn't want his right-wing fantasy world

1777
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,576
If it comes with cute

1778
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,600
Absolutely

1779
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:35,904
So this is the point where things I think really

1780
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:36,928
Turn in the interview

1781
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,256
Alex starts being a real

1782
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:44,864
It's tough for me to stand up for to shop

1783
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,400
Call Kari addictive

1784
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,168
But just from

1785
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,704
From the standpoint of

1786
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,240
Politeness

1787
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:52,032
Very impolite

1788
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:53,824
Had

1789
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,848
Pure shaman

1790
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,408
Tell me what's coming next time I want to believe it

1791
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,176
Where is Trump

1792
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:01,248
You think it's the devastating Victory you just at the Capitol

1793
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,528
Explain to me

1794
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:05,088
Bring me up to the level of a q

1795
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,112
Shawna

1796
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:11,488
First of all allow me to say that I am not Auntie frying not BLM

1797
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,024
I know that there's rumors

1798
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,304
Boating around online

1799
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,608
Disinformation agents

1800
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,144
Information

1801
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,936
Askew

1802
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:21,472
The Border qanon

1803
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,008
Digital Soldier Story

1804
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,920
Galaxy isn't necessarily saying videos

1805
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:33,248
I think what he's saying he's going to buy the antifa provocateur

1806
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,528
But you can hear that

1807
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:38,368
You're a shaman bunch of tell me about what

1808
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:43,744
What's going on I feel like I would say it in the very similar Town though but I don't think you would have the interview

1809
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,096
Having this interview is a productive

1810
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:50,912
Do thing to do if we were if we were in a bar

1811
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,472
And I was like chained to one of

1812
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,776
The chairs that have no choice

1813
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:59,104
Bright start a conversation

1814
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:01,408
Eventually I'll get to the point where I'm like

1815
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:03,200
Alright Q shaman

1816
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:05,248
You tell me what the f*** you was up

1817
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:11,648
Yeah baby but I'm on the show clearly

1818
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,440
Fidelity

1819
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,232

Okay I'm a spiritual Warrior

And if you really want to know what's really going on what was really going on as we are changing the quantum

1826
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:40,064
Spiritual warfare understand that DC is built on Ley lines electromagnetic Ley lines

1827

Frequency demonic energy

1835
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:13,856
You told us the Trump was invincible

1836
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:27,424
Yeah puterman for whatever

1837
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,448
Guess you probably guessed

1838
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,752
Restoring the Capitol building

1839
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:33,312
He has a pretty healthy sense of self

1840
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:35,104
Not give a f***

1841
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:38,688
Pretty pretty legs well done

1842
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,968
Alex

1843
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:41,248
I don't know if you know this or not

1844
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,528
Not but I stormed

1845
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,808
The Capitol building

1846
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:44,576
Wearing

1847
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,112
Caps

1848
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,136
And a helmet

1849
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:50,720
Are you going to interrupt me like I give a f*** about you

1850
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:53,024
Your diversionary questions are not important

1851
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,328
Answer the question that was asked

1852
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:57,376
He's a shaman

1853
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,656
And

1854
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:02,240
You know whatever I don't I don't begrudge people for

1855
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:05,568
Coronavirus lockdown

1856
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:06,848
Practice you want to have

1857
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:09,664
Would not be the angle I would

1858
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,992
Take make fun of

1859
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,272
He does

1860
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,296
He does think of it

1861
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,600
They prayed in the Senate

1862
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,392
It's a magic

1863
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,256
Because the Washington DC is built on Ley lines

1864
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,048
Look on the electromagnetic wavelength of the Earth

1865
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,584
When we

1866
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,912
Ended up going to DC when we are shouting USA

1867
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,448
Homer shouting freedom

1868
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:34,240
Boomershine four more years

1869
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:39,104
We are really upsetting the quantum realm because he's around the fire

1870
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:43,200
Go away

1871
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,736
Ghost sounds

1872
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,784
Supersedes electromagnetic activity

1873
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:48,320
Okay

1874
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:50,624
By marching into the capital

1875
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,392
Bye

1876
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:56,768
Quantum realm in that way we actually took back

1877
01:26:57,024 --> 01:27:00,608
The Capitol building for God I said a prayer inside this

1878
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:05,216
Are you saying my shamanic song inside this and it and I broke up all that

1879
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:06,240
Negative

1880
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:11,872
No do you want to talk

1881
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:16,480
No no no no no

1882
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:23,136
Give me a favor and let me finish my well

1883
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:24,672
The Secret of

1884
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:26,976
He is a priest is a religion

1885
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:28,256
Everything's fine

1886
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,792
I don't know about all that

1887
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:32,352
I think that he can tell that I was being a dick

1888
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:37,728
See now if we're at a bar I'm still changing my chair and he's coming back with that unlike

1889
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:38,496
Alright buddy

1890
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:42,336
Now we can talk there's some Humanity there more than like

1891
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:44,640
Alex is shook

1892
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:47,200
This point Alex

1893
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,992
Really knows how to

1894
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:55,904
Decide to make fun of shamanism as a way to attack

1895
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,440
The things that I agree with you

1896
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,536
Shamanism is the oldest religion in the world

1897
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:05,888
Are you singing drumming dancing and they use elaborate like

1898
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:10,240
Dress you know the address but face paint

1899
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:13,056
To change the quantum Realm

1900
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:20,480
Sound through electromagnetic activity and

1901
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:24,064
I understand magical powers

1902
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:28,416
No it's not about magic dear talk to you

1903
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:32,768
Are you talking about

1904
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,816
You are a shamanic wizard

1905
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:35,584
We get that

1906
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:37,120
Let's just

1907
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,400
It's sad

1908
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:40,192
It's not it's not a productive

1909
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:42,240
Conversation for anybody but

1910
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,008
Because of a lie

1911
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,312
I mean it wouldn't be productive conversation

1912
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:51,712
The cube was talking to anybody because you'd be talked about ley-lines a magical

1913
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:55,808
Magic physics quantum physics

1914
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:57,344
You know what that means

1915
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,392
That means whenever and elect

1916
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:01,184
Tron from a single atom

1917
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,744
Is paired together with another electron

1918
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,072
Then for some reason it doesn't matter how far apart they are

1919
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:07,840
Ley lines

1920
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:08,608
Sprite

1921
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:09,376
I misspoke

1922
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:11,680
My point isn't it

1923
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,216
Be a productive conversation with him

1924
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:18,592
No no no Rock but Alex brought him in for the

1925
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:20,384
Explicit purpose of

1926
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,664
Trying to

1927
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:23,200
Impune Q

1928
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,808
Can't really do anything

1929
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:30,880
Would you think you would be able to like he knows who Q is

1930
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:32,672
He should be like I know these

1931
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:33,440
People

1932
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:35,232
Do you not understand like

1933
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:38,048
You should be able to

1934
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:38,816
Completely

1935
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,352
Instructor this easily but he can't

1936
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:42,656
It's the only thing you can do is make fun of this guy's

1937
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,424
Spirituality

1938
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:44,448
And that sucks

1939
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:46,752
It does seem like the easy

1940
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:47,520
Just wait for Alex

1941
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:48,544
To go to be like excuse me

1942
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,824
Mecu shaman

1943
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,616
You listen to my show right

1944
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:53,152
I told you

1945
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:55,200
Two months ago that I knew who he was

1946
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:57,248
I threatened to unveil it and then I didn't

1947
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,528
Yeah so

1948
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:01,856
I'm just going to tell you who killed his right now and it's not military intelligence

1949
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:04,160
It's Dick Face McGee over here

1950
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:08,000
I mean obviously he would be like that's not

1951
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,536
But then it would just be over

1952
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:11,840
You know you wouldn't have to deal with any more of this

1953
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:13,376
Blimey shaman

1954
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:20,032
B2B any conversation of like what do you believe what do I believe I don't know them they're actually

1955
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,104
Pretended to be

1956
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:23,872
Aware of

1957
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:25,664
And to know as fact

1958
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:26,944
He shouldn't be having

1959
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:27,968
Any kind of

1960
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:28,736
I believe

1961
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:30,272
You believe conversation about

1962
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:35,648
This topic is something that should be a settled issue for him tell exactly

1963
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:36,928
Debate

1964
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:38,208
And it's really

1965
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:38,976
Fortune

1966
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,256
Listen to Because

1967
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:43,584
It's like the queue Shaman is just saying stuff that Alex agrees with

1968
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,120
He has to keep interrupting

1969
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:47,680
I'm asking you what your wizard towers

1970
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:49,728
Why you Grable do that

1971
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:58,688
Keurig iced I was in the military and the intelligence Community disseminating about top-secret information and Patriots and our Republic

1972
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:09,440
Why did you leave Julian Assange in prison when he's the real Q type person

1973
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:15,072
You keep interrupting H I love you dude I love you but you got to let me talk

1974
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:22,240
Are you listening

1975
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:25,568
Zack is

1976
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:27,872
Las Vegas Insider

1977
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:34,272
Dude who was supposedly like the the other Cube

1978
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:41,696
Themes behind what shopping is saying here are the things that Alex talks about all the time

1979
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:44,512
Globalist have infiltrated the government in this is

1980
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:45,280
Exposure

1981
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,560
Of the

1982
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:48,096
Exactly

1983
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:49,376
He can't attack the

1984
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:50,400
The meat of it

1985
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,680
Without hurting himself

1986
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:52,704
Enso

1987
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:56,544
He tries to distract with questions about like Julian Assange

1988
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:57,568
And then

1989
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:59,104
I mean I would interrupt that

1990
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,152
That's feel too though that that was

1991
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:04,224
I'm interrupting anybody who's trying to sell me a timeshare

1992
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,272
And if you have rehearsed your little

1993
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,552
A bit like that

1994
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:15,744
Do you know what you do if you invite someone onto your show to sell you a timeshare so you can interrupt them

1995
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,096
Score points about how annoying it is when people try to sell you timeshares

1996
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:21,120
Kind of a dick move

1997
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:23,424
Yeah isn't that

1998
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:25,216
Sacha Baron Cohen's job

1999
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:28,544
Well there's more layers to it than that but yeah

2000
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:29,568
So

2001
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,872
Like I just see the wave

2002
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,896
He's describing

2003
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:34,688
The shaman is describing his beliefs

2004
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:38,272
It's just basically a lot of the same stuff that I was pleased with a couple of different

2005
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,296
Free characters

2006
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,576
Like I was just a different cat

2007
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,600
Slightly

2008
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,440
Military intelligence

2009
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:48,768
Top secret information to Patriots and a republic

2010
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:51,072
Take that door country from communist and globalist

2011
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:56,192
Some of the highest levels they could bring America down from within

2012
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:10,016
I know about the New World Order

2013
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,552
Everything's fine

2014
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:16,416
Everything's fine

2015
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:20,256
For real or whether he's

2016
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,024
Crazy talk

2017
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:22,304
Crazy talk

2018
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:29,472
Any different than most of the subject here on Infowars no way different other than he

2019
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,008
That's it that's it

2020
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,288
100% the same thing

2021
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:33,824
Wow

2022
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:36,384
Besides the shaman

2023
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:40,992
I hear you man and stay there

2024
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:53,280
All that stuff

2025
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,096
Don't know what's going on nobody does

2026
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:11,712
Girl 45 days

2027
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,624
It's so frustrating

2028
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,952
Just sit there and watch our people wake up but then believe

2029
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,232
The charlatans garbage

2030
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:26,304
Again just seems like a petty jealousy

2031
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,864
And like why am I not cute

2032
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,656
Why am I not as important as

2033
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:33,216
Is Q it's so frustrating to see them by the

2034
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:33,984
Those t-shirts

2035
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:34,752
Q on it

2036
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:37,568
When they could be buying Infowars branded

2037
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:38,848
The pills and they could

2038
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:41,152
Discussing to see people wake up

2039
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:42,688
Wearing a shirt with Q on it

2040
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,968
Instead of taking two of these

2041
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:50,368
Goodbye my duct tape that I bought a banana

2042
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:51,392
Totally

2043
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:55,488
Totally what are you doing wearing a shirt that goes over your mouth it's a shirt for your mouth

2044
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:57,280
Alex has not returned

2045
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,560
The corner I really don't think

2046
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:00,096
Said he likes this guy at all

2047
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:01,120
It's unfortunate

2048
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,656
Because the guys

2049
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:04,192
Very nice Alex's bar

2050
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:04,960
Yeah

2051
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,520
But I wouldn't want to clear up one thing

2052
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,544
Disease now it's

2053
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:10,848
Taking over the 4th hour

2054
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:12,896
Matt Bracken is also there hanging out

2055
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:15,712
Moral support

2056
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:18,784
Owen wants to know like a man people founded

2057
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,064
Acting profile

2058
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,344
About you are you at

2059
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,112
Actor

2060
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:29,024
I just want us to address you obviously want to know about you is

2061
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:30,816
Profile that says you went to

2062
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:32,096
Acting school so they think you're

2063
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:32,864
Acting

2064
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:35,680
And this whole thing is just an act that would you like to dress that

2065
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:43,360
Reason why I haven't I can cut files because I worked with children for five-and-a-half years and

2066
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:47,712
Children and I got chased out of the home with a knife

2067
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:53,600
By one of the kids that pulled it out of a locked cabinet and I decided that I wanted to do something a little bit more fun

2068
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:55,136
Do I win in the business

2069
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:58,720
For myself I develop my own website my own YouTube I started writing book

2070
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:03,072
And I thought about well maybe I'll give us back to the shop turn a little bit of money on the side

2071
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:07,680
I haven't made any money as an actor I never got anyone we got that we believe you

2072
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:12,800
Use almost

2073
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:15,872
Star-Lord

2074
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:19,712
So close he's so, you just wouldn't worship the devil

2075
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:20,480
He wouldn't

2076
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:22,784
Take too much money for it

2077
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:29,696
Questions go away be

2078
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:35,840
Because this guy said he's not an actor on Alex Jones a show

2079
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:37,888
Alex and Infowars

2080
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:40,960
Are well-known for if somebody says they're not an act

2081
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:42,496
Believing

2082
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:44,800
Alex

2083
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:48,384
Is taking the approach to these sort of trying to shame and belittle

2084
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,664
Puta que shopping

2085
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:52,480
And I would argue that somebody who makes

2086
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:53,760
Their business

2087
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,296
Going around to protest

2088
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:56,064
Stressed

2089
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:59,392
That ridiculously for the sake of getting attention

2090
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,928
You're not going to be able to shame them

2091
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,976
You can't embarrass I would be very surprised

2092
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:04,512
Difficult yeah it doesn't work

2093
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,328
Your Accu wizard

2094
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:09,888
I'm asking you this for a 12-day

2095
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:12,192
Does Trump

2096
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:16,032
What happened to Trump you knows everything you don't know what Terry intelligent

2097
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,640
Well you know what man all I can say is

2098
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,712
I think that Donald Trump is

2099
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:28,064
Part of a much larger plan with it at the military plan with that be God

2100
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,648
God's plan I think that when you look at harmonics

2101
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:38,048
When you look into the way that energy frequency and vibration basically create and move

2102
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:40,352
Call physical form all matter

2103
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:41,376
Then

2104
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:44,448
We are all playing a part in a much larger grandeur

2105
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,360
You're not on stuff

2106
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:58,784
You told us

2107
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:05,184
Meadowlark

2108
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:11,072
What I'm saying and uses you putting words in my mouth again what I'm saying

2109
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:12,352
Is that

2110
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,400
Donald Trump is

2111
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:18,752
A part of a much larger plan to help us take back our country from globalist

2112
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:23,616
But Alex has said that to

2113
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:27,968
Of course this leads to its natural conclusion

2114
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:30,272
Which is Alex is going to blow up

2115
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:32,064
This guy

2116
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:33,088
Yes

2117
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,648
I just don't

2118
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:36,416
No

2119
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:37,440
What

2120
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:39,232
Like actual difference

2121
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,512
Since there is between their beliefs

2122
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,816
Donald Trump

2123
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:45,120
Has played a very

2124
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,656
Pivotal role

2125
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:47,424
Annex

2126
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:51,264
Closing the globalist and the cabal exposing the Chinese

2127
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,544
And the Communists

2128
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:57,920
And the way that they've infiltrated our government away they traded our media until traded or entertainment

2129
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:04,320
Brooklyn

2130
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:07,648
Can't you keep interrupting me

2131
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:17,888
You said he was invincible

2132
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:29,664
Two people after this

2133
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:42,720
Barbecue I can't talk to you anymore

2134
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:43,744
Lord help me

2135
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,792
That was

2136
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:46,816
Uncalled for

2137
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:47,840
Response I would say

2138
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:51,424
Damn if he's sick of those witches I think it's time to call Larry Nick

2139
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,192
Haha

2140
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:58,848
I think you know I don't know if Alex had the same preoccupation with wonton

2141
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:03,968
As the Q folks he definitely had a lot of about to get arrested got a boat.

2142
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,760
Go to jail soon

2143
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:07,296
Invincible is certainly like a

2144
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:13,696
Theme of chosen by God to defeat the Devil Alex has said that a whole bunch of

2145
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:15,488
There's not a lot of light

2146
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:17,792
Between these two ideology

2147
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:21,888
One of the reasons that Alex does do that fake blowing up there

2148
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:22,656
Is because

2149
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:25,984
Like the way he's presented Q

2150
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:29,056
Qanon stuff is very different than what

2151
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:30,080
What this guy is bringing

2152
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:30,848
To the table

2153
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:36,992
And for the audience to become aware that like oh no they're not all crazy the way that Alex wants you to think

2154
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:41,856
There's talk about the Federal Reserve there's talk about these deep underground bases there's

2155
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:43,136
You know a demon

2156
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:44,160
Hey I like that

2157
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:47,744
The elites are sacrificing kids and drinking their blood Alex

2158
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,536
Alex is in on that maybe there's a

2159
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:52,096
Alex runs the risk of

2160
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:53,632
Was blowing up right in his face

2161
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:54,400
If you

2162
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:56,704
I see clearly that there

2163
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:57,728
Pretty similar

2164
01:40:57,984 --> 01:41:01,568
I think I would also argue that there's nothing Alex hates more than a mirror

2165
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:03,616
Especially one that's younger than her

2166
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:05,408
Like that

2167
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:07,200
Cuz listen to the way he's talk

2168
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:09,504
Walking he's rambling he's saying all kinds of nonsense

2169
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,320
He's rattling off bulshit that he's memorized

2170
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:18,720
He's an unwilling to be interrupted for any stretch for any reason he's claiming his SpaceX

2171
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:20,768
This is an

2172
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:22,304
That's like this dude is

2173
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,352
Person who loves Alex Jones

2174
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:25,376
Who has

2175
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:28,448
But much of his Persona clearly

2176
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:29,728
Around his love about

2177
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:33,568
It's at least a strong

2178
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:34,336
No one

2179
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,616
And hates Alex Maybe

2180
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:36,640
More than out

2181
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:38,688
I know and hates people who like our

2182
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,224
Yeah I exact

2183
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,016
But you know what

2184
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:43,040
Shaman

2185
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:44,576
Execution

2186
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,392
Believe

2187
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:49,696
When they're wrong for the wrong

2188
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:53,792
Smallpox

2189
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:54,560
Ninja

2190
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:59,936
Really no ninjutsu

2191
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:08,384
We got you on the line

2192
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,968
So they go to commercial break

2193
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:12,736
And I come back

2194
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:14,784
And Alex is true to his word he is going

2195
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:15,808
Forgive the shaman

2196
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:16,576
Alaska

2197
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:25,024
Sorcerer to wizard.

2198
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:26,560
Shushana

2199
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,864
Hopping mad at me

2 days ago

2201
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:36,800

Good dab

2205

That's the bit huh

2206

Little boy videos right to be really mad at him

01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:17,760
Take the red pill

2218
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:19,296
Five and a half hours that if you

2219
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:22,368
Really want to know everything that there really is no to get caught up to

2220
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:28,256
Speed here now all you have to do is just watch that one video and it'll explain a whole lot of things that most men

2221
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:33,120
Weatherby things about about you

2222
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:35,424
Cube image completely full of crap

2223
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:36,960
Has been full of crap

2224
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:41,568
Facebook call

2225
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,920
After 20 minutes of that insufferable

2226
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:50,272
But he's on lightweight man

2227
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:52,064
Harry Potter

2228
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:54,624
Hocus-pocus crap

2229
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:06,144
All this Harry Potter crap and now I'm going to talk to you about the devil

2230
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:10,240
Dealing with Ley lines in quantum physics

2231
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:11,520
Just can't handle it

2232
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:15,360
No Alex

2233
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:16,640
Give the appearance

2234
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:18,176
XVideos something deeper

2235
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:20,992
But if he was forced to actually talk about it

2236
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:24,576
It'll be like when he's on Rogen and he realize like he doesn't really have anything

2237
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:25,856
Now

2238
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:28,160
That's really a dumb thing to do

2239
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,976
Alex is not good at

2240
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:33,536
Confrontational interviews with sincere

2241
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:37,120
Because they are running

2242
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:39,936
Damn that they care about what Alex

2243
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,032
The Q shopping

2244
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,312
Would like to have

2245
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:47,872
Positive exchange of Alex he looks up to him

2246
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:49,920
Yeah but he also isn't

2247
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:54,016
Invested in the Infowars scam in the same way that all of Alex

2248
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:55,040
His guests are

2249
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:57,344
Yeah Matt Bracken has no other

2250
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,160
Like media outlet that will ever talk

2251
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:02,720
I don't give a f*** about him again

2252
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:05,024
That's so he's part of the game

2253
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,816
Yeah everybody that

2254
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:08,096
He talks to is

2255
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:09,632
At least in some way

2256
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:10,912
Transaction

2257
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:13,984
Yeah there's a power Dynamic either Alex

2258
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:17,056
Does higher or lower everybody knows where they stand

2259
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:20,128
Everybody knows that they're working towards the shared goal of Griffith

2260
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:22,432
And Alex can work really well in that space

2261
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:25,248
Or at least he can operate there because

2262
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,784
People would know not to

2263
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:31,392
Contradict him not to get too out of line if you interrupt you just roll with it

2264
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:35,488
But yeah you got that you got someone like you Shaman and he think

2265
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,816
He is higher on the totem pole

2266
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:43,936
He just stormed the capital I bet that dude's arriving riding a wave of adrenaline that is still going

2267
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:44,960
While he's in jail now

2268
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:46,240
I also

2269
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:48,800
F****** flying off the walls

2270
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,336
Yeah it's

2271
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,360
It's complicated

2272
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,896
There's a power in Balance but it

2273
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:55,456
Perception

2274
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:59,296
I think that they're the Top Dog on this golf

2275
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:00,320
Infuriates Alex

2276
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:02,368
I imagine that the

2277
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:04,160
The Q Shaman thought he was doing a victory

2278
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:05,952
You know I just

2279
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:06,720
Got

2280
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:07,744
The most

2281
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:08,768
National attention

2282
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:09,536
Worldwide

2283
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:11,072
My pictures

2284
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:12,352
On the world right now

2285
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:15,168
So Alex Jones is calling me because I'm

2286
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:16,192
F****** famous

2287
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:17,984
Yeah and maybe maybe we have

2288
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:24,384
Some slight disagreement that we can work that out so I'll charm him up top we'll have a nice little conversation

2289
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:28,992
Rational guy we agree with each other on everything

2290
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:31,296
You not take me at my word as a

2291
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:34,112
Sincere person we agree on literally everything

2292
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:35,136
Sing about the globalist

2293
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:36,672
In the blood drinking in the

2294
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:39,744
The Chinese and the Communists

2295
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:45,376
Are you saying that I can't trust far-right media figures because they will cut bait

2296
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:48,448
And abandon me as soon as I'm not useful to them

2297
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:53,312
Oh I might need to rethink nothing I mean

2298
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:54,336
Not for nothing

2299
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:57,664
Alex is far from the only person who's sitting on this dude for doing

2300
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,480
Exactly what they want to do and they were told

2301
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:03,808
Kind of

2302
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:06,112
Kind of like the most predict

2303
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,136
Edible thing ever

2304
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,440
I wonder if anybody had

2305
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:10,464
Had said that this would have

2306
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,024
So Alex

2307
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,304
If he was there

2308
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:15,328
Things have gone differently

2309
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:17,120
We probably would have tackled

2310
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:18,144
Vacuum shop

2311
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:21,216
Rally Trump

2312
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:25,568
Call the Capitol Police

2313
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:26,848
We should have been down there

2314
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:30,176
Yeah man weirdest

2315
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,456
If I and

2316
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:34,272
20 guys

2317
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:38,624
Who are specifically very large I hired them from the same people that

2318
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,648
Tony Vargas

2319
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:43,744
20 of them cuz they were busy at the

2320
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,536
I mean

2321
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:48,864
A from the 8th

2322
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:49,632
And

2323
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:52,192
In the same way that the out-of-context drop that

2324
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:53,216
I'll get to this next

2325
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:53,984
Maybe

2326
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,264
Is a perfect

2327
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:56,032
Like just

2328
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:57,312
Boiled down

2329
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:58,080

With only six minutes

2335
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:10,368

Call Dad was much as you can learn and earn nobody to control

2344
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:45,440
He's not in control

2345
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:51,840
Tommy is employment government can be Godzilla

2346
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:55,168
To claiming everything's great buys got a plan.

2347
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:56,448
The only plans you just cry

2348
01:48:57,728 --> 01:48:58,240
That

2349
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:00,800
Thing there is

2350
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:04,128
Infowarsstore.com though gives you a God create

2351
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:14,112
That's good give it to me

2352

That's the kind of give you an overdose

2353
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:23,072
There's so many awesome layers to that it's

2354
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:27,680
Starts with him talking about wanting to have less commercials on music

2355
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:30,496
Definitely not

2356
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,032
Interesting

2357
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:33,056
That

2358
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:34,592
Business relationship

2359
01:49:34,848 --> 01:49:39,968
But we do our ads on the show like I'm about to do

2360
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:42,784
He starts talking about how God's plan is

2361
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:45,344
So that was intended to be part of a plug

2362
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:49,440
Futurist God's plan the divorced or what

2363
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:55,584
I don't know if you can amazing amazing

2364
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:57,120
Bookbyte

2365
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,144
Definition

2366
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:02,240
Of those would like those words like though there were ten of them

2367
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:04,800
Pretty important to people who love the Bible

2368
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:05,824
Yeah alright

2369
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:08,384
Fairly certain that you

2370
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:10,432
You cannot take God's name in vain

2371
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:11,456
More than he just

2372
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:14,016
I think that's the most you can do

2373
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:15,552
There was some

2374
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:19,136
Vena Stuart a little bit of ignis there

2375
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:24,768
I find this stretch right after the storming of the

2376
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:26,048
The capital at the end of last week

2377
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,096
Kind of interesting but also kind of

2378
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:29,120
Kind of

2379
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:32,448
I do I don't know I guess

2380
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:33,472
Google what you'd

2381
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:34,752
I know it is

2382
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:35,776
Is it is at

2383
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:36,800
Sorry I wanted

2384
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:38,848
Sorry to regress for 1 second

01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:41,664
But owner next episode I would like you to play

Go home

2390
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:50,112
Go home

2391

Respect the curfew

01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:55,232
Exactly. Pepper thing you sent his reporters home

2393
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:58,816
Sorry for interrupting

2394
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:04,960
I would be lying if I said that any of this

2395
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:08,288
Surprised me like Alex's Behavior

2396
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,360
You want the ride

2397
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:12,896
To the

01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:14,944
The storming you know what the storm exactly

2399
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:16,480
You need that

2400
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:20,832
State prior to conflagration

2401
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:23,136
Make money off of because

2402
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:24,928
Let's say

2403
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:25,952
To the Capitol Building

2404
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:27,232
Back right then

2405
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:29,792
Investigations would be

2406
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:31,072
Very crisp

2407
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:33,120
222 right wing

2408
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:35,424
How organizations militias figures

2409
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:39,264
Keep more people had died

2410
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:42,592
It certainly would be far more serious than Alex

2411
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:43,616
Can't profit in that

2412
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:44,640
Chico's

2413
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:45,408
Systemic

2414
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:48,480
And so obviously this is

2415
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:49,760
You know put the blame on

2416
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:50,528
Somebody else

2417
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:57,184
This is a false flag because they were scared of how close we were to getting that 10 days that Rudy wanted weed overturn the

2418
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:01,536
I'd also at the same time for a showing his ass and so he's too weak

2419
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:03,072
Can we need to look for new leadership

2420
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:04,608
Pizza

2421
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:06,400
It's all very predictable

2422
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:08,192
It's just so brutal

2423
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:09,472
It's so brutal

2424
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:10,496
Tactic

2425
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:11,264
After this

2426
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,032
Is not

2427
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:13,056
Cuz it's

2428
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:14,080
It's so obvious

2429
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:17,920
Alright you see the way I act now

2430
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:19,712
And you work backwards new go

2431
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:23,808
Oh obviously he wants to rile people up into a state of constant

2432
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:25,344
Fury

2433
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:27,392
And then that will get him money

2434
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:28,160
Their emotion

2435
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:28,928
Spell connection

2436
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:29,952
We'll get him money

2437
01:52:30,464 --> 01:52:31,744
And then when they did something

2438
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,048
He realize that that would cost him money

2439
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:34,816
And so he

2440
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:35,584
He stopped

2441
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:36,608
He changed his mind

2442
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:38,400
Quotient

2443
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:40,192
And so

2444
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:41,472
We can't trust

2445
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:43,008
And instead it's just

2446
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:45,056
How about I throw two different types

2447
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:45,824
Cognitive

2448
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:46,848
Dissonance at you

2449
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:49,664
All the time into your brain so much

2450
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:50,432
Open so hard they

2451
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:51,456
That you can't even

2452
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:52,224
See through

2453
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:52,992
Bedtime

2454
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:54,784
Obviously in this for money

2455
01:52:55,296 --> 01:53:01,440
Yeah how can you not see through that how could you not see-through when he says like God's plans the only one that's real

2456
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:04,768
What God gave you

2457
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:06,048
This guy's a f******

2458
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:07,328
Assholes

2459
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:09,376
Not that I agree with you but you know

2460
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:10,144
Time is

2461
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,680
Peacetime people are f******

2462
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:13,216
Lazy

2463
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:13,984
Full of s***

2464
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:14,752
This was a

2465
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:16,032
2:30

2466
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:17,312
Goddamn storming the

2467
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:24,736
2 days after a.m. to that should be fresh enough in your mind to where you go I got knocked out of the

2468
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:27,296
Headspace that I was normally in and it's just nothing

2469
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:28,576
Yeah

2470
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:30,624
Lisa Houck

2471
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,648
Quickly he went

2472
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:33,952
To like first of all calling Sandy Hook a false

2473
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,768
You saw how quickly the Boston bombing

2474
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:38,048
Became a conspiracy

2475
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:39,072
Edit make sense

2476
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:41,120
Like the fact that this is a

2477
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:42,400
Giant

2478
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:43,424
Eventually

2479
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:49,568
And I honestly don't leading the Boston bombing and he was at Sandy Hook he went

2480
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:54,688
That's what makes it even more critical for him to make it a false flag

2481
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:56,736
A good thing that went bad because of the

2482
01:53:56,992 --> 01:53:57,760
Trickery of antifa

2483
01:53:58,016 --> 01:53:59,040
Yeah he hasn't even

2484
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:00,064
Greater

2485
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:01,856
Connection to it

2486
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:03,904
That again

2487
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:06,720
This goes to one of the other feces that I have

2488
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:09,024
And that is that one of the primary ways that I was

2489
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:11,840
Money is by profiting off of Anna

2490
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:12,864
Exploiting tragedy

2491
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:14,400
And this is a tragedy

2492
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:15,424
No matter what

2493
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:18,240
Ends up coming from it and I don't think

2494
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:20,032
That we are fully process

2495
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,568
The reality of

2496
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:22,592
The last week

2497
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:24,896
Oh absolutely I don't think you could

2498
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:25,920
I just don't

2499
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:26,688
I-80

2500
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:28,992
It's staggering

2501
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:29,760
And almost

2502
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:30,528
Surreal

2503
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:33,088
Yeah I don't know nothing

2504
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:34,368
It's not good

2505
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:36,416
And that is the kind of thing that I like

2506
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:38,208
Make money

2507
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:41,536
The only thing I would say it was kind of surprised about is

2508
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:42,816
The Turning tax

2509
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:43,840
A little bit

2510
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:45,376
About the woman who got

2511
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:46,656
Yeah I don't

2512
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:49,984
That I felt him martyred building

2513
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:51,776
As much as he was the day off

2514
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:53,824
Murder build

2515
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:54,592
And

2516
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:55,360
Deescalate

2517
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:56,896
You can only

2518
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:58,176
Do one or the other

2519
01:54:58,432 --> 01:55:00,224
What you got a murder you're going

2520
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:02,272
There's No Going Back

2521
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:03,808
See my way and I think the fact

2522
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:04,576
Did she was really a

2523
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:05,344
Add to queue kinda

2524
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:07,136
Hurt his ability to adapt to

2525
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:08,160
Create

2526
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:12,256
Perfect figure out of that you can't scream it how stupid

2527
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:15,584
Accu Shamanism then be like this Q believer is also our new

2528
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:20,704
Virgin Mary turn them into a figure of

2529
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:21,472
Of

2530
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:23,776
Empathy and reverence

2531
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:25,056
Yeah

2532
01:55:27,872 --> 01:55:28,896
The path that they were going down on the

2533
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:30,432
Continue

2534
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:33,248
I have a feeling

2535
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:34,272
That's

2536
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:35,296
It's going to be bad

2537
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:36,320
This week

2538
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:39,904
If the plan or the

2539
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:42,208
Speculated is that there may be another repeat

2540
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:45,024
Y'all article coming down and will

2541
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,072
On Monday if that's the case then I would expect

2542
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:47,840
Expected Alex's go

2543
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:48,608
Can I have some

2544
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:49,376
Choice words

2545
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:50,144
What about that

2546
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:52,448
And so we'll see what happens but I don't look

2547
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:56,032
I don't I don't see by Future prospects of

2548
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:56,800
Relax

2549
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:57,824
Cynthia got good

2550
01:55:58,336 --> 01:55:59,104
I do love how stupid

2551
01:56:00,384 --> 01:56:01,152
They all seem credible

2552
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:01,920
Who is stupid

2553
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:02,688
It's so

2554
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:03,968
Unbelievably

2555
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:05,760
Ridiculously stupid

2556
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:06,784
To stop for once a

2557
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:08,576
On Wednesday

2558
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:10,880
The president incited a riot

2559
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:12,160
And people

2560
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:13,952
Storm the Capitol building

2561
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:14,720
So

2562
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,024
Because of this action

2563
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:20,352
We will swiftly drop articles of impeachment

2564
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:23,168
Which we will absolutely be delivering to the Senate

2565
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:24,704
100 days

2566
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:27,264
After biting the inauguration

2567
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:29,312
But solving the problem with

2568
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:30,848
Yeah

2569
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:33,408
I mean I don't know what else you do but

2570
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:37,504
Couple years

2571
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:45,696
But until then Jordan a website

2572
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:48,000
Go to bed Jordan net worth

2573
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:54,400
We are on Facebook any like that you could please find a local charity to help out people do

2574
01:56:54,656 --> 01:56:55,168
Doing

2575
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:57,984
Omniome Lido

2576
01:56:58,240 --> 01:56:59,776
Dzx Clark on Daryl run

2577
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:01,312
I if I had

2578
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:02,080
21

2579
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:04,896
Some guy

2580
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:07,968
I could defeat Alex's Buddy Guy

2581
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:09,248
Well maybe. Probably.

2582
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:10,528
I'm not really much help

2583
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:16,416
Alex

2584
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:18,976
Christian color
