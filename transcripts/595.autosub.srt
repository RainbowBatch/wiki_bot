16
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
Caught me off-guard

17
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,952
I am so now I'm very excited

18
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232

States Open tennis Communications and development and the fight

29
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,864
Final is between Novak Djokovic and Medvedev

30
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,776
And if Djokovic wins which he almost certainly will he will have 21 Grand Slam majors

31
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:24,128
You say you will have completed the first calendar Grand Slam

32
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,688
It's like 1960s

33
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,968
Jimmy Connors and stuff

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,272

I felt like

48
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
Sometimes you have to go off the beat

49
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,888
Empath it works sometimes we just

50
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
Need

51
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Something

52
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,776
Elsinore lives in Alex Jones

53
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,056

Even neutron stars

65
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,376
Each other

66
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,936

67
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
Planetarium

Rocks m

70
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,080
All of this

71
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,872
And this is indeed

72
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,152
Impark how

73
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,432

Fascinating

76
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
This is great

77
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,368
Put somebody through a neutron star Earth and suck Atlanta

78
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,648
That's what

79
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,208
Part of it

80
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
Just ask

81
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,351

Got2b

83
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,703
The longest time

84
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,263
People have been requesting that we get back to take

85
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543

In that kind of mood where this is very much necessary

88
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,319
Here's the great news

89
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,415
There's another YouTube clone type website

90
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:50,815

91
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,631

93
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,495
That is good news is good news

94
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,031
I kind of

95
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,823
Feel like the time that we've had away

96
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
Can like make us kind of

97
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,895
Forget that she's a

98
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,687
Like maybe better

99
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,343
We could have fun with it again

100
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,439
Sorbet where it's like if I need to remember the Tri-City credible anti-semite

101
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,839
I'll be there I got that

102
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,399
Wacky Wednesdays and I've discovered from

103
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,959
Trying to find other sources there's

104
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,495
Just nobody else who does

105
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,287
Does it Better

106
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,359
Warren G and Nate Dogg

107
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,247
Regulate

108
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Yo

109
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,831
Real anti-regulation

110
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,927
Before we get to today's episode which is a update

111
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,231
About the state of the world from September 9th

112
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,023
Okay Isaac Carree put out

00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,887
Is there a couple days back

114
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,935
I think if there's one thing that's important

115
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
The Alex is stressed

116
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,287
To me it's that diversity of opinion

117
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,823
It's something that should be cherish

118
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,895
That's true and that's why we need to bring in other voices

119
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,735
Find out what's going on with the political speaker what's going on

120
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,063
Maybe not about neutron stars being used as what

121
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
There's plenty of other things

122
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
The color

123
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
Gmail

124
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
How heavy do drugs

125
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
What stars are

126
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,951
Yeah but

127
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,511
Do you understand the technology that the Raptors have

128
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,351
I literally created a sinkhole in space-time

129
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,935

And as as all of these episode start

145
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
We must say hello

146
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,911
Hi everyone I'm Kerry Cassidy from Project Camelot

147
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:39,263
I want to talk about my latest articles and also the latest

148
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,311
Video interviews I've been doing

149
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,359
Because there are a lot of

150
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:47,199
Questions out there and obviously now that you know

151
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
Everything is not

152
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:53,087
Super simple so we're living in very complex times

153
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,647
Discuss

154
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
It is

155
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,999
Is definitely worth discussing how complicated the times we're living in our

156
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:00,767
I have a question

157
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:07,167
Possible in her worldview for things to get more complicated than they already are

158
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:13,823
I mean we've got international space trees going on I feel like an end this is from her perspective

159
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,687
Yeah Earth is low priority

160
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,015
Invisible

161
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
There's

162
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:28,159
Fairly complicated complicated

163
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,999
You make a good point

164
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,791
I honestly don't know

165
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,607
Everything's a little rude that we discovered

166
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,911
8 News states of matter

167
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:43,519
It's complicated complicated

168
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:49,919
To play in the world right now is it the forces that are jockeying for control of the world

169
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,479
Sure you got the good guys who are the Trump

170
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,087
Why not exactly

171
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,135
It turns out that they're in negotiation

172
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
Taking a look

173
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
At my web

174
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,999
I've got an article there which

175
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,303
Which is basically talking about

176
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
Negotiation

177
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
Going on between

178
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
The Deep state

179
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
And the trunk

180
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,055
And the trunk group can really be thought of as

181
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Q

182
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
As well as

183
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
Members of

184
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,223
Military Intelligence agencies Etc

185
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,759
Who are what we call wife

186
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,319
Score trying to change the system

187
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,367
From within secrets

188
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
Okay and

189
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,951
So that's how they started

190
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,791
We're entering a time in which they need

191
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
To infuriate

192
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
Become much more pub

193
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:47,007
But it is taking a long time.

194
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,311
A really long time

195
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,687
Almost like it's not going to happen almost Apple you got these white hat

196
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,503
But the whole big DM

197
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,599
People in the military whoever they may be

198
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
Although Steve pieczenik

199
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,951
Wide-ranging

200
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:11,839
Rodger Stones North Korean Powell sure at some weirdos who carry talks to that have funny ideas

201
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,887
Charlie freak

202
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,775
I don't know probably the Tiger game

203
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,591
Joe exotic

204
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,639
Yeah they're the good guys the white hats

205
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
And they're working

206
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
Against the Deep state but they're in negotiation

207
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,527
We're going to learn a little bit later what these negotiations are based

208
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,111
I want to know more about these negotiations real bad

209
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,695
We will learn a little bit more of that but we need to delineate here again

210
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,743
The state of play who are the team

211
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
Do you have the white hats

212
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
The cube

213
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,095
That's the good guys the Trump

214
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,727
Other political ideologies are

215
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,543
Just from the outset let's just say

216
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,567
The playing field

217
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
And understand that

218
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
Yes

219
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
As

220
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,199
Jordan Maxwell has always said

221
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,735
There are two

222
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
Two Wings to

223
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
To the bird

224
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
The Democrats and

225
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
Applicants they're both

226
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
Wings on the same bird

227
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
Another words

228
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
Be there is

229
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,231
The

230
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,607
What about what we think of as the Rino Republicans and the Democrats

231
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
Working together

232
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
Part of the deep state

233
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
And then there's

234
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
The Trump team

235
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
White hats

236
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,031
And they're part of

237
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
The people

238
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,103
The reflecting the will of the people

239
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
That's therein

240
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
Intention

241
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
That's their stated in

242
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
Contention

243
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,247
You think they do that

244
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
That's what

245
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
They are attempting to do

246
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
And

247
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
Trump is their leader

248
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
Four worlds

249
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,975
Super complicated that almost sounds like an over-simplification

250
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,559
So there's good and bad Ryan Trump is the leader of good

251
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
That doesn't seem very

252
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,143
And all the people in government

253
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,543
Are essentially working against the good. They're all collaborating together and get can't get anything done

254
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
That

255
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:03,199
Like somehow the Rhino like there are delineations in the Republican

256
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
There's a

257
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:09,855
Plethora of opinion as we know is the Republican rhinos and Weirdos that's basically what you've got

258
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:15,487
That's the only complicated Factor otherwise it's Republicans and Democrats are the same except for Trump speech

259
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:20,863
There's a couple people like a boat or a

260
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:27,263
Marjorie Taylor Greene

261
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,055
Yeah he's alright

262
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:34,431
Hawthorne School to see the wheelchair

263
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,991
In the GOP are okay

264
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,807
These are the teams

265
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
I'm thinking about going

266
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
To Riot

267
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:51,327
Obsessed Chicago

268
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
Mighty Bosstones

269
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:52,863
Are playing

270
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,399
And I am an old-school

271
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
Mighty Mighty Bosstones.

272
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,495
Of course and I will not apologize for it

273
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
Nobody's asking you

274
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:04,127
Someone is out there one of these people listening is wants me to apologize

275
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,943
Do apologize for the Boston refuse to never

276
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,295
But I also was like looking at the lineup in like on that same day Saturday

277
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
Who is playing

278
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:17,183
And I'd like to see them opening for Mighty Mighty Bosstones exit

279
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:22,047
I've liked the LPS

280
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:27,935
Stick damaging like the company flow know this s*** spree run the jewels

281
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,287
Motherfukers

282
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,079
And I was like a man

283
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
I'm old school

284
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,919
I'm I am I'm being a hipster about

285
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:41,759
My liking LP and that's not cool that's not

286
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
No

287
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,343
I mean Minneapolis address rap groups

288
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
I feel like you cannot also have nostalgia

289
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,719
Yeah but you have to let that kind of stuff

290
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:55,071
Because I was listening to like a father Factory in

291
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:59,423
Deep Space Nine mm back in the day

292
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,215
That I get to act all cool

293
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,007
The reason I bring this up is

294
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:07,359
Who carries been down with this s*** since way before Q course she's been hanging out with

295
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,431
But wait longer than you choose a cute hipster

296
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,711
What we know of

297
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,551
I've asked the white hats and I've been dealing with the white hat since long before

298
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
Hugh

299
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
Became public

300
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,391
And Trump was involved

301
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,439
You know my knowledge

302
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,231
The white hats had

303
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
A lot to do with

304
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
The group

305
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,559
That we're putting out the White House

306
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
Reports

307
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,631
And I was working with them

308
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
And

309
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,447
Interviewing Paladin

310
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,239
Interviewing T-man

311
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,823
And basically they were talking about

312
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
This group

313
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,175
That is called the white hats

314
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,199
It again

315
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,015
Is made up of people that are in

316
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,063
All aspects of the military

317
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
Retired military

318
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
Government officials

319
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
You name it

320
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,023
Around the world not just in the United States

321
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,303
And that they have

322
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,095
Created a network

323
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,399
Secret Network

324
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
Under the circumstances

325
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471
That is

326
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,775
Perhaps not so secret among the

327
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
Ball

328
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,079
Because they get attacked

329
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Terrifying

330
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
Yeah

331
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
Yeah that doesn't sound good at all

332
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,247
I think based on what a lot of

333
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
People in these

334
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:25,183
Conspiracy communities believe about shadoweave

335
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
National Group

336
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,535
Secret exit military folks or working

337
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
Kick 2 Chainz

338
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,911
The direction of the work of the thing I have with again we go

339
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,447
To their limitations on

340
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
Creativity

341
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,519
She's tossing out like

342
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:45,919
The government the military the cabals you name it for me

343
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:50,015
The you-name-it you doing out there yet

344
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
Here's what more terrifying

345
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
Alright

346
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,879
20 water treatment supervised

347
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
Vien

348
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:00,511
Think about a conspiracy of water treatment supervisor

349
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,535
All across

350
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
This f****** country

351
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,351
It would drive everyone mad

352
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:10,495
You don't need to be in the government, I can't do s*** we watch it fail

353
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
Effective

354
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
Under the radar

355
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,871
You make an interesting point I think that if you were

356
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:19,711
Trying to write some sort of a fiction about ways that

357
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,503
Disruption could happen

358
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,903
Have you come up with way better things then International group of X-Men

359
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,207
Military people who are all hanging out

360
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
And working

361
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:36,863
Trump yeah I mean imagine you don't know anything about these 20 water treatment super

362
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,655
Nothing

363
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,239
And then they're gone.

364
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:47,615
Wow is this your Nextbook I hope so

365
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,967
Not only do they unfortunately no water treatment

366
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,527
Supervisors on board the entire world

367
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,087
Militaries and governments or whatever

368
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
Folks were

369
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,415
Really cool

370
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
They also have

371
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
Hyperintelligence

372
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
Jhene Aiko

373
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,047
It's also useful to know

374
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
That

375
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,119
Chewing team have

376
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
Clearly into

377
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
Vacated that

378
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,495
First of all we know behind the scenes they're relying on it

379
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
When an AI

380
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
Some people

381
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
Mycolic qai

382
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:23,199
Then they're also working and relying on

383
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
Sun

384
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
Su Art of War

385
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,599
And if you read that hasn't gotten better season

386
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:34,207
Acting to be much weaker than you are is one of its main

387
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
Principles

388
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,511
So that the enemy

389
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,303
Doesn't attack you direct

390
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,351
So and also

391
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,399
Appearing to go along when I'm back

392
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,191
You plan to double-cross them

393
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
Towards the end is also

394
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
One of the

395
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
Principles and

396
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,103
Do your own research on that

397
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,151
I haven't read The Art of War Sun

398
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
College

399
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,199
Probably put

400
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,479
I think there's more to it

401
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,783
No he is really short

402
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,319
I don't

403
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,367
I think those were the basic idea

404
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,415
Like that did the primary ideas when I died

405
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,719
Trump has brought up

406
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,559
And maybe have to do with the art of the deal

407
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
I'm sorry

408
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,399
So you got to understand that this is

409
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,727
What's going on these are the teams and this is one of the

410
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,751
The primary ways

411
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,775
Is the decew team is

412
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,311
Figuring out bruschetta

413
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,919
Art of War has almost certainly

414
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
Not read The Art of War

415
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:34,111
So the II cannot assimilate Concepts from the aisle

416
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,647
Affordable Coronavirus

417
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,975
There's a method to Trump's Madden

418
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,535
And you got understand that he's not working alone

419
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
But

420
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,351
He's not working with

421
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,143
The person you might think he's work

422
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
So

423
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,519
Understanding the methods in The Madness of trump and

424
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
Team

425
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
You can

426
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,383
Kind of figure out why it is

427
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Trump.

428
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,455
Certain things or doesn't do other

429
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
And also

430
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,783
To really keep in mind.

431
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
So we're not talking about

432
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
Two men

433
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,207
You know Biden and Trump this is how people

434
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
Refer to it

435
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,767
But that's not really what's going on

436
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:17,375
Okay that how people refer to it I guess that there's a theory that Trump is working

437
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,655
Our like pulling

438
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:22,495
Biden strings behind the scenes

439
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,823
Guess what that's a theory that some people have put forth

440
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,359
That's not one that I

441
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,895
Run into too much so

442
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,431
Good to know that that's

443
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:36,831
The theory would kind of bummed me out to have a shity two-headed white man Hydra run

444
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,135
Running the country but you know

445
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
It could be worse

446
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,231
Two dudes you're disappointed with but in different ways

447
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Exactly

448
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,839
This is going to be good

449
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,863
Oh yeah oh yeah

450
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,935
So we didn't this like we learned that Biden is not biting

451
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:56,543
Biden's been being played

452
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
Okay

453
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,895
He probably being played by three entities

454
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,175
This is

455
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
So fun

456
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,479
Biden is

457
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,015
Said to be played

458
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,039
Goodbye at least

459
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,575
Three individual

460
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,367
One down

461
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
2

462
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
A general

463
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,695
That's on

464
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,255
Trump side and three Jim Carrey

465
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,047
Who's off the game

466
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,071
Brodovitch

467
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:25,727
That means that in theory Biden is under control of

468
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,263
From however

469
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
That's not quite

470
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,103
Case because a lot of the decisions

471
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,871
Biden is May

472
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,663
Making are what we call Deep state

473
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
Decision

474
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
And

475
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,295
Those decisions are being allowed to happen

476
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
Buy the truck

477
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,855
By the way

478
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,647
Again because

479
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:47,487
What they really want is they having an ending inside

480
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,023
They want to wake up

481
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,303
People who voted

482
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,583
For Biden or who

483
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,863
Who fell for the

484
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,399
For the deception

485
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,423
Sure sure

486
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,959
I almost lost it

487
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:03,615
When I heard that

488
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,919
It's quite a surprise

489
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,479
Clone a general into

490
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,391
Good man

491
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,696
Clone a general in Jim Carrey

492
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
Walk into a bar

493
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,280
Aeroplan

494
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,608
Clone been a general

495
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,656
Jim Carrey

496
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:32,032
Why not entertain the other one with references to his old movies I'm sure would love that

497
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:36,384
Hi I think this is my last name because what you have if you have to be like okay Biden's not by

498
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,456
Something else

499
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,760
He's a clone Jim Carrey and a general

500
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,808
He's working with Trump in the cutie

501
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:47,904
The General Eight who's playing him is

502
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,928
Inwood

503
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:54,048
The truck General carries kind of controller off also

504
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,328
So why is it

505
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,120
The bidens doing things we hate

506
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
Well it must

507
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
Because

508
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,472
Trump wants him to do those globalist

509
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,032
State decision yeah wake up

510
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,568
The public is fun

511
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
If you

512
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,640
Can understand

513
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,432
This is coming from

514
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,760
Alright you can reverse-engineer the thought process behind his

515
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
Decision

516
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,576
Now it could be incredibly complex

517
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,112
Or it could just be

518
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,160
Very simple does this benefit me

519
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:20,928
Or no

520
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,720
I will do the thing that benefits

521
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,768
I think I think one of the ways you could look

522
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
This is like

523
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
What if

524
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,120
Joe Biden is just a purse

525
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,544
What is Jim Carrey's look

526
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,616
Jim Carrey you don't need an explanation for why he's making

527
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,688
Decisions that the Q team doesn't like that doesn't make sense because

528
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,248
Here's the craziest part and this is going to blow your mind

529
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
All right right

530
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,320
Biden is making decisions that are almost

531
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,112
Entirely consistent with his 50

532
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,648
Year career in government

533
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,184
So it's obvious

534
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
Obvious

535
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,536
That while Ace Ventura was filming

536
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,096
Jim Carrey was also in Congress

537
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,144
There's no other explanation

538
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,472
Right filmed in Florida

539
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,872
I got one I got one got away with me I don't know where Dan Marino fit into this

540
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,944
We should have known like on Election night

541
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
When

542
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,528
Biden gave his acceptance speech and it ended with

543
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,904
If you guys want me to be the president

544
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:33,376
I don't I couldn't work that into a contact really hard

545
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,240
But here's the thing though

546
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,800
My explanation that Biden

547
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
Is President music

548
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,848
Person

549
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,152
But fails one very important

550
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,944
Test

551
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,224
Information to Trump

552
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,248
Actually

553
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,296
Right now the problem

554
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,832
To fit in with Joe Biden is a purse

555
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,624
We do know that

556
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,648
Trump has been sworn in

557
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
And he is actually surprised

558
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,232
And even now

559
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
How Trump is set

560
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,280
I could be sworn in by

561
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,816
107

562
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:06,656
And I wanna 7 in my opinion everything points to the back

563
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,192
Play Junior

564
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,264
I do understand there's another guy named Michael

565
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544
Protsman I think

566
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
Last name

567
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,616
Who is

568
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,176
Infatuated by numbers

569
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,968
And he's gone on several

570
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
Girl shows

571
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,272
Exedra some people think

572
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
Kids voice sounds like

573
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
Again

574
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,856
JFK jr.

575
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,160
Amy is neither here nor there

576
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
And assert

577
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,464
Play no proof of anything

578
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,744
Agreed yeah

579
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,144
What do you mean by he's infatuated by number

580
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,544
Beep I get a little bit like that you know he's just infatuated by numbers and it's eventually going to drive him mad and then he will be

581
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:50,176
Felipe's JFK jr. number 23 Jim Carrey played by ignant

582
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,248
Cancel

583
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,296
So 107

584
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,344
How did they get rid of

585
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,880
Clone Joe Biden's memory

586
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
Spotless Mind

587
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,512
Kate Winslet exactly Hillary Clinton

588
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:09,632
Baby cross in that movie probably

589
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:15,008
So 107 is a guy who's like one of Carrie's

590
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Like

591
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,848
Now that you can't go to prison and talk to Mark Richards

592
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,384
Juan o Savin is like a

593
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,944
A big Insider

594
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
Expert guy

595
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:28,576
I think I think his name is a play on 007 107

596
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:35,232
I think there's some sort of a numerological thing parent says he's picky fancies himself

597
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:38,048
So his name is intentional

598
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,072
To make himself look

599
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,376
Lucky's JFK jr.

600
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,936
I've done several shows on y

601
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,216
JFK jr.

602
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
And 1070 the same

603
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,032
In person

604
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
Aside from the

605
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,104
That Juan equals John

606
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,176
So it goes Jackie O and Savin is

607
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,200
Savin Hill

608
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
Weather

609
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
Library is

610
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,832
Built and no one would use that moniker

611
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
And come out

612
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,672
Not to the public unless they wanted to

613
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,464
People to know they were actually work

614
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,280
JFK jr. or associated with him in some

615
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,072
So that

616
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,352
Shows intention

617
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,400
On the part of 107

618
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,448
To be known as that other

619
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,240
It sure does

620
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
I mean

621
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,616
I'm honestly honestly I'm almost impressed

622
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:28,992
Well hello do you how far did she have to go to get from 107

623
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,784
A very simple 007 pot

624
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,088
Into JFK jr.

625
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:36,672
I think that but I think she's I think she's probably right

626
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,440
That

627
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,232
You know 107

628
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:42,048
Maybe intentionally chosen

629
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:48,448
Names in order to evoke JFK Junior capitalized on the excitement in the Keuka

630
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,776
Community junior is alive

631
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:58,432
I think that you might be right that like you intentionally did name himself or this as a means of

632
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,736
Intentionally trying to evoke that

633
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
But that also

634
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,600
So does not prove that he is now there is a problem there

635
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,136
Although I have heard

636
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,464
That he sounds like a young G

637
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,560
No I mean 100 are there

638
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,144
Neither here nor there we know that voices don't mean s***

639
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,960
Carrie

640
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
Psych profile

641
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
On

642
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
Juan o Savin

643
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,824
And also on JFK jr.

644
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,640
Okay but think of it I think they match up boy

645
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,712
I want to give you my hands on these high-profile

646
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,528
Shawano seven I did a whole psychology

647
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,088
Profile as to why this person is

648
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,160
JFK Junior and I think it holds up

649
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,208
And I also

650
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
Have

651
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
Also had

652
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,280
Psychic dreams about this

653
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,072
Sure pad

654
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,864
Constant on and off

655
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Dialogue

656
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
Text

657
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,728
And occasional phone calls

658
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,496
What's the weather

659
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,800
The person calling himself leidos

660
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,336
Or are you go

661
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:02,176
For all intents and purposes that individual is laying out

662
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,968
The philosophy

663
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,760
The plans

664
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,808
And and being sort of the

665
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
The laser

666
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,648
If you want to call and press

667
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
Liazon

668
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,696
For the trunk

669
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
Team

670
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,864
So yeah I guess you've got this guy who's so far at the sense that I'm getting is that he is he's branded himself

671
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,888
B of A

672
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,680
Hi

673
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,728
Hi access weirdo

674
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:29,312
And now we've decided to accept him as the

675
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,848
Media attention

676
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,640
Trump

677
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
Did involved

678
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
Jose isuper

679
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
Computing

680
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,760
And the Art of War

681
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:45,440
This is good I like when we cross genres and you can just see who would be a retired lieutenant colonel and who is

682
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,744
Super soldier and who's you know you can just

683
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,768
What kind of sibo

684
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
The basic archetypes

685
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,352
So this guy might've actually played multiple roles

686
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,936
We might have a little bit of History to I'm a little bit like Jim Carrey

687
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,728
Absolutely

688
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,824
So you might notice that this is something that I'm it's kind of an elephant

689
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,592
The room

690
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
And Carries got to

691
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,640
Address

692
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,944
The short time tonight is it a lot of her whistleblowers

693
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
To be like

694
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,248
Bulshit wow

695
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,784
Takers Flyers

696
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,808
Call shatara

697
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,088
Kahneman

698
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:18,976
Liar I think a better way to put it is they were born into Illuminati family

699
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,256
Have Arizona leave that

700
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,304
Another switch.

701
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,096
These individuals

702
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,400
Whistleblowers in fact

703
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,984
And all of the individuals I'm sure on the Trump team

704
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,288
Who have worked for the Deep state

705
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,312
In other words

706
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:37,408
Many being born into deep State families originally excetera

707
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,456
What we're talking about is

708
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
Individual

709
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
Girls who have

710
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,272
Change sides

711
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,808
And have decided

712
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
To come and work

713
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
With and for

714
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
For the people

715
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
So that's a

716
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,416
Chucky

717
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,696
Understanding.

718
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:53,280
You know these individuals regardless of their original back

719
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
And in fact

720
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,352
Because of their original background

721
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,400
They actually know what the

722
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
They're talkin about

723
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,704
They have seen

724
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,496
The reality behind the scenes

725
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:05,312
Having work for the Deep state in various capacities

726
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,456
Damn answer a lot of these people are like Oliver whistleblowers are from the Luminati families that

727
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,760
I like a lot of them are people who are using like

728
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:18,624
Deep Alias is in stuffing

729
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:24,256
Isn't is Leo zagami

730
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,792
Not sure not sure if

731
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:32,192
But he's one of the only people I've been able to like really break through and figure out a lot of details about his door

732
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,496
Does not check out no

733
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,032
But let this story was

734
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,080
Spell peed

735
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
Sick

736
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,616
B6

737
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:44,480
And a reputation around the room club scene for being silly

738
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
Yeah

739
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,552
Oh man

740
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,600
I just I mean

741
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,952
They all have to be from former Illuminati

742
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,488
All of them

743
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,816
Is the problem though with all of them being from Illuminati families

744
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,608
You can't trust any of them then

745
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,376
True

746
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:08,032
You know I mean if it's a few defectors you can tell that there's an organized block tried to keep people from

747
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,568
Artifact tank and you got a couple

748
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,128
People coming over who is like escaped and they've got really

749
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,432
Good stories and you can trust him in there double Asia

750
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,712
But if is everybody

751
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,736
Status II

752
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
For sure

753
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,272
What what I think

754
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,320
I think this is just a way to

755
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:25,440
Do you like have these people be allowed to have first-hand information about these evil things

756
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,768
And also they're not bad people were vapor and on it

757
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,584
Expose the darkness or whatever

758
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,376
It's a way to

759
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:40,032
I think I also call it now that's not right the right term but just make some unpalatable

760
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:43,104
Who's allowed to be like I was there when they killed all the babies

761
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,128
Rye or whatever

762
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,920
Swan

763
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,944
Isn't a tough spot

764
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,736
I don't know why

765
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:55,136
Yeah I'm really confused as to why it seems like he's doing great. The media liaison for secret Trump press people that involves

766
00:31:55,392 --> 00:32:01,024
Is a worldwide network of ex-military people who are controlling everything

767
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,048
EXO

768
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,096
Thankfully because he's JFK Junior he's

769
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,888
It's a fine

770
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,168
So Dove Road

771
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,704
2 to go down

772
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,240
Aura

773
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,264
A difficult

774
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
Tightrope

775
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,056
Assertive

776
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,896
That 107 has to

777
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,176
Could negotiate

778
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
But

779
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:23,296
As John F Kennedy Junior he's in a unique position to do so

780
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,088
And he does drop hints

781
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,368
By the way Wendy

782
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,160
Does interviews

783
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Time

784
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,720
As to the fact

785
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,608
Now there is probably

786
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,912
A so-called 107

787
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:42,752
Pretender behind-the-scenes who works with him call Dwayne Willis

788
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,800
No doubt there is a Wayne Willis

789
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,872
There are pictures you know online and there's

790
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
NetSpend

791
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
One video where

792
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,736
One was talking and then they showed up

793
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
Physical

794
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,600
View of

795
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,392
When will it be in the same room

796
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,416
But that's not

797
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,184
Surprised

798
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,208
In fact

799
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,512
Entirely possible.

800
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,560
When will it is not only

801
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
Comrade

802
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,352
Rod of

803
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
107

804
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656
A good friend

805
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,704
But he's also on a sign

806
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,752
Assignment and he's on his Steinman

807
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
2

808
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
Deflect

809
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,360
Whatever is necessary to play a double

810
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,152
If you will and two

811
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,432
To basically

812
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
Protect him

813
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,224
Sorry lot

814
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,760
Logical that he might even be

815
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,320
Checks out

816
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:34,720
This is a good way to explain away how like people have found videos of someone who looks exactly like 107

817
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:40,096
Do a conspiracy drift in the same room

818
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,400
They been in the same room there's no doubt

819
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,680
That way dwell

820
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:50,080
I don't know if I have not seen the video where they're in the same room I have no idea what you're talking about but I have sound

821
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,128
A number of people claiming

822
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,016
She's a guy was doing stuff back in like 2014 my

823
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,832
A guy's a big a big whistleblower type of type of

824
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,112
You've done this game before

825
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,648
It's basically the

826
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,672
What I, wave

827
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
You know

828
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,744
What I Come Away with this is

829
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,024
Hazel

830
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,816
So long as you say the right

831
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
Stuff

832
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,888
People like Carrie will makeup

833
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,680
Any reason to let you

834
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,960
Keep going

835
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:20,544
Any possible explanation will be way better than to

836
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,080
Just being like Oh well he's

837
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,896
Line I think that's definitely true but I also think

838
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,664
This comes down

839
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,480
The same issues that a lot of the mainstream media has with

840
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
Access

841
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,064
Yeah you know a lot of the

842
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,112
Reporting on Trump let's say was

843
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,160
Maybe not as critical as it could have been sure

844
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,464
Or not as could have been

845
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,280
Because of organizations fearing they would lose access

846
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:45,888
To like your land rightfully so you would have probably take that long

847
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:50,240
He already

848
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,848
Define unfortunately it's in that case it's the presses World APUSH

849
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,616
The issue

850
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
Satisfying

851
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,712
What what I think Akira suffers from the same thing

852
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:05,088
She has access to these people who are high-profile weirdos

853
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,904
If she pressed the issue she would lose access to

854
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,464
Want you lose access to Mark Richard Wright

855
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,744
And somebody else would go to

856
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,352
Go to them and take all of hers of vacuum that would be filled yeah people are Griffin

857
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,632
Avedro

858
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,656
Facilitate their grip

859
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:25,056
That's true but I mean God damn it really freaks me out sometimes cuz I'm I'm on the edge of her knowing that she's

860
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,872
F****** with me and I'm on the edge of her having no clue

861
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,664
Like I just don't know

862
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,712
I know there's no like Middle Ground

863
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,504
She's either in or out

864
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
You know

865
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,064
I don't think she's f****** with you

866
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,600
No I know but I mean like

867
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:42,208
Shinichi went back and let's go earlier episode to like what I got it

868
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,512
F*** with your Daddy's Hands On handy

869
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,168
So we were talking earlier about the negotiation

870
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:51,936
An aspect of this

871
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,728
I'm going on

872
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,544
Hey turns at the negotiation has to do with like a verdict

873
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,824
Civil War kind of thing

874
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,848
Sanctuary

875
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,664
But in their plan already to like kill a bunch of people

876
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
The Deep state

877
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
Sure

878
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,248
But they're going to stop that

879
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,600
Nice because the Deep state is now in a position where they have to negotiate because of three things

880
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,136
All three Joe Biden

881
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,440
Jim Carrey's

882
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,208
Here's the first one

883
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,024
So there was a negotiation he felt

884
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,096
The reason they're at a place of negotiation is

885
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:20,864
Is because

886
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
Of the follow

887
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,448
Which is

888
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,776
What's gone down in Afghanistan which has two

889
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,544
Suh dude

890
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,824
The

891
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,152
You know the Trump Administration to expose

892
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,944
The poor leadership

893
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:35,968
Under

894
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,016
Biden and team

895
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,320
And the Deep state in essence there

896
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,600
Their dark intentions

897
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,880
And how they would

898
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,416
You know basically you're happy.

899
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,208
See American suffer

900
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,488
And so on

901
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
So far

902
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,304
So they feel that.

903
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,608
Is going to be the coup de gras

904
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,424
It takes down Biden in the minds of

905
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,472
The unenlightened letshe

906
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,312
7-Eleven woken up

907
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,896
Was going to be what happened in Afghanistan during the wake up at Joe Biden

908
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:12,320
Boy if you're really thinking that this one reflects poorly on Biden's Administration instead of the entirety

909
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,880
City of the past 20 years of American government

910
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:19,744
You're out of your mind dwell on it pictures

911
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,304
The first thing is I've gained

912
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,352
Sam is the second thing

913
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,888
I don't know about this

914
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,264
Then there's hurricane Ida and hurricane Ida there was a lot of conversation he said about

915
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,032
That

916
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:32,800
And again

917
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,872
No pure cane Ida would have been a deep state

918
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,456
Shot across the bow a weather War

919
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,480
Weather weapon

920
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,296
Which state do use hurricanes all the time to do

921
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,088
And earthquake

922
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,880
Extend all other you know

923
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
So-called

924
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,416
Climate

925
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,696
Events

926
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,792
And then basically hurricane Ida was

927
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,328
Has

928
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,096
Purposes

929
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,120
One of which was

930
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
Shutdown

931
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,424
Oil production

932
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,960
2 Gang

933
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,984
To Cripple the country

934
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,544
And

935
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,592
To also

936
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,360
Shutdown

937
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
The area

938
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,408
Louisiana

939
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,016
New Orleans area and unrelated areas

940
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,040
And

941
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,576
2

942
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,600
To basically

943
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,624
Threatened

944
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,672
Again the American people

945
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
So

946
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:25,280
Yeah I guess hurricane Ida was a weather weapon that was my till like

947
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,304
Lookout

948
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,072
Bebo

949
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,376
We can do this to you at any time

950
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,424
I didn't invite invasion

951
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:34,240
Advertise that I didn't experience

952
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,776
Certainly.

953
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,056
The weather event

954
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Tragic

955
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
Anyways

956
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,384
Yeah I mean if it's a warning you have

957
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,152
To warn people

958
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,480
Going to be a warning

959
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,504
Yes

960
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,856
You can't warn somebody with magic that they have no idea you

961
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,392
You can do right

962
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,440
The reason to give a warning

963
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,000
Is to like change someone's Behavior

964
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:00,864
Kid is doing something you don't like you

965
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,960
You know I take away their allowing if they do it again here it's simple

966
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,264
Consequences which will lead to larger contact

967
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,288
Right

968
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,152
I don't understand what babe you're supposed to be stopped

969
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,200
Or else we'll get another hurricane

970
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,992
Even if

971
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:17,760
Like

972
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,040
It's like

973
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,320
Pranking somebody

974
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:24,672
With one of those things where they open the door and then the bucket of water falls on their head

975
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,696
Right but

976
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,744
Never Like Nobody's around

977
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,560
And nobody ever finds out it's you

978
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,584
That's not a warning

979
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:38,240
That's just a weird thing to do to somebody it's also not a prank even in that so it's just weird attack

980
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,568
Yeah I don't know this

981
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,896
Confusing to me these the reason that the Deep State swelling

982
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:48,480
Negotiate that is because of Afghanistan make inviting look bad

983
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,248
And then

984
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,064
Ida apparently being a deep State weather weapon

985
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,880
I know how that makes the Deep State more willing

986
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:55,904
To negotiate

987
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,928
Yeah I don't know

988
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,208
I think the thing I hate

989
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,256
Most about this type of

990
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,048
This is this group of people

991
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,328
Admiration for Trump

992
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,096
Is that

993
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,680
The one group of people who understands Trump

994
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,264
Is the one who likes him because of his psychopathic

995
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,544
Hatred for human life

996
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,592
And that allows them to

997
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,872
Indulging their violin

998
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:21,504
And then you've got carry who's got this whole other narrative Trump cares about people

999
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
And it's like

1000
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,064
Somehow

1001
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,928
You're crazier than people who are trying to murder right now cuz at least they know what Trump is for

1002
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,768
You know that's what she's ate you're out of your mind if you've

1003
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,560
Think he cares about one human

1004
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,096
Who died anywhere

1005
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:38,400
Yeah yeah definitely out of your mind

1006
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,216
So those are the two things the first two things there's a third thing

1007
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:45,568
Making the the New World Order deep State willing to negotiate

1008
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,104
And then we have the auto

1009
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,408
And this is where I think

1010
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,712
Phil made his most important point

1011
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,016
Basically saying that the audit

1012
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,296
With an ass

1013
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,088
We're not just

1014
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,392
Maricopa

1015
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,416
County but

1016
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,720
Going into all the other states

1017
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,768
And that the evidence was always already

1018
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,048
And that

1019
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,632
In essence what they have been doing is sitting

1020
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
So that the

1021
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,448
Trump team

1022
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,496
Is

1023
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,032
Sitting on

1024
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,080
Of the

1025
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:21,408
I was coming through these audits that are sort of like this

1026
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,176
Dog and pony

1027
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
Show

1028
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:23,968
With Michael

1029
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,248
DeLand

1030
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,784
Basically

1031
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:30,624
Going in slow motion to do a count a recount

1032
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,928
Of something they already have on blockchain

1033
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,512
They knew the election would be stolen.

1034
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,792
Trump had one

1035
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,072
8020

1036
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
Percentage-wise

1037
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,376
And

1038
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:45,216
That

1039
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,008
Actually before the election

1040
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,032
So they were

1041
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,056
Totally forgot

1042
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,640
In the background that's just delightful

1043
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,711
But yeah so

1044
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,479
Votes

1045
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:02,879
Sure all that is a sting operation like Steve told us naturally

1046
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,671
These these audits are happening

1047
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,975
Right they're going to reveal the information.

1048
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,255
Trump team already has

1049
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,791
The Trump 18020

1050
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:13,375
Shorten the election charges unheard-of numbers

1051
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:19,775
That would be difficult that's a registered the popular vote

1052
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:24,895
48 f****** States or whatever it is that he did not get a 220 that's for goddamn sure did not

1053
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,919
No

1054
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,687
Yes

1055
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,735
Answer these the reasons that they

1056
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,039
Deep States willing to negotiate they know they're in trouble

1057
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,391
That doesn't sound like it makes any sense whatsoever

1058
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,951
Why would the Deep State negotiate

1059
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,743
With people who can

1060
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:43,583
I mean essentially get rid of them at any point in time

1061
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,119
You know like if you have the evidence

1062
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,167
You can just go

1063
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,959
Yeah it really sounds like

1064
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,263
The bad guys are on the ropes

1065
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,847
So there must be some kind of a reason why

1066
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
This isn't happy

1067
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,919
Yeah I know there's got to be an explanation

1068
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,295
Trump and team now hold

1069
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,319
The trump card

1070
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,855
That shows that

1071
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,647
Trump is indeed legitimate

1072
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,439
Commander and chief

1073
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,487
I'm president of the United States

1074
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:15,583
He has been actually sworn in by the military since again March

1075
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
11

1076
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,143
2021

1077
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,703
It doesn't make sense it's something that one has said

1078
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,471
Repeatedly

1079
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,775
And so

1080
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,079
Basically were talking about

1081
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,359
An acknowledgement

1082
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,175
This fact and a recognition of this fact

1083
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,711
By the American public

1084
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,247
Our bird wet there

1085
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,039
Holding on the evidence

1086
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
To prevent

1087
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,599
Civil War

1088
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,367
Because they

1089
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,671
Believe that they still don't have

1090
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,767
A critical mass of individuals who have a wake

1091
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:49,631
Last time I heard one on one of the show's say

1092
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,935
They have something like 70

1093
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
Percent

1094
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,727
They need 80

1095
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,495
Percent

1096
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,311
They got this

1097
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,335
Deflect

1098
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,871
You know Civil War

1099
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:02,943
If you just come out and give this

1100
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:09,343
Proof

1101
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,367
Point of order

1102
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,183
If Trump 18020

1103
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,999
To find out that he won a T20

1104
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,303
Would suggest that 80% of the population

1105
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
Would be going

1106
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:19,839
Hooray

1107
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,399
80% the population we already know

1108
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,935
So why would there be a civil war

1109
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:28,799
They will get one.

1110
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,823
Also I want to see some

1111
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,591
Data

1112
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:36,991
Is there a Pew research

1113
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,807
That kind of access only 107

1114
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,855
Or JFK jr.

1115
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:42,879
Who knows

1116
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:49,535
Who's been around for a long time lying to people who knows

1117
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,839
Yeah I find this to be

1118
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,607
Ifun

1119
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,399
Underwhelming

1120
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:57,215
Explanation for why the evidence isn't there

1121
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:00,031
Really 10% more

1122
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,335
Listen it 75% now it's

1123
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,919
It's like a GoFundMe unless we reach our goal we don't get to overthrow the

1124
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,199
Bring up

1125
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:09,247
So there's that there's an election coming up

1126
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,271
In California

1127
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:14,367
Hours of the recall whenever he loses it

1128
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,671
Fall into a nightmare

1129
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
It's probably going to be stolen

1130
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,231
By the way we're about

1131
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,023
California election in which

1132
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,303
They've already photograph

1133
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,583
People stealing the

1134
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,887
The mail-in votes and all this kind of thing

1135
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,167
So there's no doubt

1136
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,959
Election is working

1137
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,751
Be stolen as well weather

1138
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,519
To be rough

1139
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
Skewed

1140
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,567
By the White House

1141
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,335
I don't know

1142
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:37,407
Isn't that a fascinating turn afraid

1143
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,967
Can this election be rescue sure

1144
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,503
Sure now

1145
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,271
1

1146
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,295
502

1147
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:47,135
Rescue Bots already imply

1148
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:50,463
I think there are a lot of people who have that mentality of like

1149
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,511
It's already implied they were going to lose

1150
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,791
Because of cheating

1151
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,583
So now the only way we can win

1152
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,119
Is buy some kind of aggressive

1153
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,679
Tactic to rescue the election

1154
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:00,959
Rhombus

1155
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,983
Presume that

1156
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:07,103
We've lost a legitimate election not because our policies and ideas are batshit

1157
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,383
Crazy and everybody hates

1158
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,479
It is definitely because it's going to be stolen bright so what

1159
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,015
We should do to these cheaters

1160
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,831
Is beat them up outside of polling

1161
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,599
Places

1162
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,135
And then we'll never have to deal with it

1163
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,207
That's a good way to rescue something

1164
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,047
So we can all see the political

1165
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,327
Intrigued

1166
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,095
The

1167
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:31,167
Is he is he not JFK jr.

1168
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,519
Negotiations with the Tri-State situation

1169
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,311
And now we have to learn about a woman

1170
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,847
Greater vision

1171
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,639
Does very important

1172
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,431
Apparently an in

1173
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,223
Individual called Anna Marie

1174
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,271
On 82

1175
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,551
21

1176
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:51,135
Saw a vision and she saw a

1177
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
Mushroom

1178
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,951
Cloud in helping field

1179
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,767
In what she thought was a national park

1180
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:57,791
Civil War

1181
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
4/10

1182
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,655
And in color and and then

1183
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,959
You know some some mountains and

1184
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,007
A plume of smoke

1185
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,543
That turned into a mushroom

1186
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,615
She believes it may be Gettysburg

1187
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,639
Or near Gettys

1188
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,663
Course

1189
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,431
Happens

1190
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,991
The reason that's interesting is B

1191
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,783
Because I did some research on Getty

1192
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,343
Leesburg and found out that during the Civil War

1193
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,623
Actually Gettys

1194
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,903
Pittsburgh was considered

1195
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
Tubi

1196
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,975
Supposedly the Battle of Gettysburg

1197
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,511
Bird was supposed to be the end of the

1198
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,279
Civil War

1199
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,815
In the minds of

1200
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,095
I guess

1201
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,887
Mine

1202
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,423
Girls fighting

1203
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,703
That were at the time

1204
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,239
And that instead

1205
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,263
Became

1206
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,055
Not only

1207
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
Sort of an inch

1208
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,847
Alligator but it's

1209
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:43,871
It actually

1210
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,919
Prolong the Civil War 4

1211
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:46,943
Another

1212
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
2 years

1213
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:52,063
She might want to read a couple more pages about the Gettysburg battle gone with a cup

1214
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,903
The people who thought it would be the end of the war where the

1215
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,671
Confederacy

1216
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,487
Lee was marching

1217
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:04,351
And the reason is a turning point in the war in the war ended up going longer was

1218
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,399
Because it was a decisive Union victory

1219
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:10,495
And so I guess if you're saying it should have been the end of the war

1220
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,799
Then you think the Confederacy should have won

1221
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:16,383
So congratulations on that interpretation of History that's a little bit weird

1222
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,687
Also wire welders

1223
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,223
Why are we

1224
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:24,575
Taking the as gospel divisions of a random woman

1225
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:30,463
You know I feel like here's what I feel like I think I figured out most of human history right

1226
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,791
You know how no one is interested in your dreams but you

1227
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,559
Well

1228
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,863
If you want to tell somebody a dream store

1229
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,911
Right and you know in advance

1230
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:43,007
That they're going to be like I don't give a s*** about your dreams you dumb dumb

1231
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,055
So you want to tell the story

1232
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,847
You have to say it was a prophetic

1233
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:53,759
Yeah otherwise people are going to listen to your dumb story about your dumb dream about a mushroom cloud in Gettysburg

1234
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:56,831
That's a dumb dream it implies a little bit more weight

1235
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:59,135
Yeah and it also implies it is

1236
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,927
Something not to do with g

1237
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:07,327
Just your own psyche like maybe the dream is saying something metaphorically about what you're going through these are

1238
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,887
Archetypical images maybe or something that reflect

1239
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:10,911
The part of your feeling

1240
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:14,751
Yeah as opposed to there's actually going to be a nuke set off at Gettysburg

1241
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,287
Yeah I mean it would not

1242
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,591
Make a religion if Matthew was like hey

1243
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,359
Hey dudes

1244
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:23,711
Check this out I had this dream where Jesus came out of this f****** cave am I right

1245
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,991
Everybody

1246
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:25,759
Oh yeah of course

1247
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,575
But the other possibility is that

1248
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,599
They're going to do Gattis

1249
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,159
If the Illuminati are looking

1250
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:32,927
Looking for a site

1251
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,207
By which two

1252
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,743
Unleash any kind of

1253
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,023
Weapon

1254
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:40,095
Whether it be a nuclear or something else

1255
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,375
The mushroom cloud

1256
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,167
Not sure what other things too

1257
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:46,239
Bomba

1258
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,263
Then

1259
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,287
Perhaps

1260
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:51,359
Annamarie was seeing

1261
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,175
Is something that

1262
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,711
That would be

1263
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,271
Physically

1264
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,063
Buy them and she thought

1265
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,599
This would happen in September

1266
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,135
Back I think she thinks

1267
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,159
It's on

1268
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:04,927
September 11th

1269
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,207
Which is coming up in

1270
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:12,863
You confirm or deny that

1271
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,655
Uber got nuked on September 11th

1272
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,935
I'm going to go to the nose

1273
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,215
The doctor

1274
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:22,079
How many score and seven years ago is Gettys

1275
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:24,383
I also think they

1276
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,919
It does bear mention

1277
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,943
Gary does bring UPS

1278
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:30,271
Some other remote viewers who are some of them instead September 21st

1279
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,319
That's good

1280
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:37,439
Pastor b******* and they also said that it might be New York

1281
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:43,839
So well I mean there's a lot of New York on the 11th or the 21st

1282
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,887
Probably is also involved

1283
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:52,799
If anything happens we predicted

1284
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:56,639
I'll find a way to hammer that into a mushroom cloud metaphor

1285
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:00,479
But it's not just this random woman Anna Maria who saw this

1286
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,015
It's also

1287
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:02,783
Something that

1288
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,855
Like I said these remote viewers that carries heard about assure

1289
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,159
Then what happened was

1290
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,439
I stumbled on

1291
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,487
Just somebody sending me a

1292
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,023
Crypto video

1293
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,583
Which normally I wouldn't even bother to watch

1294
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:16,863
But I

1295
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,655
Nized of the individual

1296
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,703
On the cover

1297
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,287
Quite remember 280 West

1298
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,335
Hand and then I realized it was Dick

1299
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,895
Algar the famous remote viewer

1300
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,687
Do I have interviewed in the past

1301
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,711
She's used to work with

1302
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,991
With Courtney Brown

1303
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,831
So did Dad Smith who's on this team of

1304
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,391
Expert remote viewers and

1305
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:42,207
They were going to look at events in shut

1306
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:42,975
September

1307
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,279
Very recently

1308
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,559
And they're going to

1309
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,327
Report about

1310
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:50,399
Krypto and instead they all saw a mushroom

1311
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:51,935
And they sought

1312
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,215
You know their self

1313
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:58,591
Ways and they didn't know the other one saw that and then eventually they came together and discussed it

1314
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,359
Well

1315
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,383
I think this

1316
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,663
Got to put this to bed

1317
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:02,687
Yeah

1318
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:06,015
Leesburg lovey idea

1319
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:12,159
A ragtag band of remote viewers just getting together and being like we got a

1320
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,975
Stop this apocalypse

1321
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:19,327
Books today I'm telling you right now we got the water treatment supervisors

1322
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,351
We got the form

1323
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:24,959
Ragtag remote viewers coming out of everywhere we got Jim Carrey becoming president

1324
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:31,103
They're all in there I'm a little bit pissed off that Biden did such a bad job as the Riddler

1325
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,967
He wasn't great I do think of that

1326
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:38,271
That's picture that you have about a ragtag group of

1327
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,063
Remote viewers that kind of sounds like

1328
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,879
The Forgotten Philip K dick novel

1329
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:49,023
Second Foundation by as about maybe that's what I'm thinking

1330
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,839
Beaver Mountain View hours they also this mushroom cloud

1331
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,863
It's September

1332
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,423
They won't come and talk

1333
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,983
Harry Caray

1334
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,775
Will explain that they don't like

1335
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:03,871
Talk about things separately so they don't have their stories in concert

1336
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:07,455
Man sucking laissez-faire

1337
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:11,295
What I know about these remote viewers is they don't want to

1338
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,831
Talk about this

1339
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,623
Because they don't want to be a

1340
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,647
Placated in

1341
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,183
Putting out false

1342
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,719
Stata if they're wrong

1343
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
And

1344
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,791
Number two

1345
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,815
When

1346
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:25,375
Trying to you know give energy

1347
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,911
To this idea

1348
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:27,935
However

1349
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,983
In the interest of

1350
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,775
Deflecting

1351
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,079
The acts of The Darkside then

1352
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,127
Eliminating the element

1353
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:36,895
Surprise

1354
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,735
Is why I'm doing this and why I'm making a Sazon

1355
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,783
I'm here is simply because this

1356
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,063
Will possibly

1357
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:44,831
Deflect

1358
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,111
Them

1359
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,391
If they sink their

1360
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,439
There are plans are known

1361
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,207
They may not

1362
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,231
Carry them out

1363
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,767
Or they may change

1364
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,303
Their plans whatever that have

1365
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,071
Tubi

1366
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:58,399
You know these are the kinds of things you're dealing with your dealing

1367
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,679
With a lot of variables

1368
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,959
When you have some kind of

1369
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,239
Dyer Act

1370
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,031
But I would

1371
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,311
Pass them to

1372
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,591
Actually carry it out anyway

1373
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,127
So what you have here is

1374
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,151
Do you have Carrie

1375
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:13,759
Setting up the exact same scenario that Alex does whenever he makes these predictions

1376
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:17,599
What you doing is your creating a trap where you can never be wrong

1377
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,927
Because you're talking about this thing and

1378
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:27,327
The bad guys are going to maybe hear this and they might change their plans because their plans have been exposed but also

1379
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,655
You should still be scared cuz I wouldn't put it past them to do it anyway

1380
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,703
You can never be wrong

1381
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:34,239
When you set up

1382
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:38,079
But predictions and Analysis like this

1383
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,359
Because you can

1384
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,639
You have a fish

1385
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:43,199
External back door built into your story already

1386
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:43,967
Yeah

1387
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:44,991
It's it's

1388
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,527
Interesting to see these kind of like

1389
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,087
Rhetorical similarities

1390
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:50,367
Ride

1391
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,415
You know cuz it is it is how you

1392
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,439
Keep people stuck

1393
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,975
No I mean

1394
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,511
If you were

1395
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,327
If you were talking to somebody and they were like I remote viewed

1396
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,607
The future and you are like okay

1397
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,655
So it's going to happen and they were like

1398
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,447
Maybe not

1399
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:09,567
Then you be like well then what's the f****** point of view I don't know the future and I know maybe or maybe not

1400
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:15,711
So you don't need to be here at 5 so they have to add this element of like but I did something by

1401
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,247
By my actions

1402
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,063
I averted the future that I predicted

1403
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,087
Okay

1404
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,647
Never allowing you to prove me right or wrong

1405
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:29,279
They can do nothing with this thank you very much

1406
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:32,607
Carrie I was talking to someone named Kim gouge

1407
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,911
I'm not sure who this person is I think it's another

1408
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:35,935
Radio host

1409
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:37,983
There's some sort of another YouTube show

1410
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,031
Any related to Paul Go-Go

1411
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,311
Probably

1412
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,079
Distantly

1413
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:46,175
There's some talk about whether or not the US went to Defcon 2

1414
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:47,967
When

1415
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:48,735
Recently

1416
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,015
Why I don't know

1417
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,063
Okay text me Kim has an explanation

1418
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,599
A what

1419
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,367
Explain what Kim

1420
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,391
Has to say but

1421
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,159
I want to be

1422
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,439
A clear very fair

1423
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,719
Terry's not

1424
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:01,023
Actually saying that she's recording at this is what

1425
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:01,791
Campsite

1426
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:04,095
Can go again come back to me and said

1427
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,887
The death come

1428
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,935
Chew on Monday or Tuesday

1429
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:08,703
Was

1430
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,799
Current information was that

1431
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:15,359
The death come to on Monday or Tuesday

1432
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,919
Was stated to be dude

1433
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,943
To send

1434
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:22,527
Text and ballistic missiles found in Boulder Colorado

1435
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:28,415
What's DHHS bomb squad was called in most likely they will pick

1436
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,463
4 missiles

1437
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,815
Boogeyman and go to war this was authorized enclosed

1438
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:38,399
By military agencies otherwise it would never have made it

1439
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:40,447
Over the Mexican border

1440
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:46,079
The story is that it was attempted repeated

1441
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,103
The chance to move

1442
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,639
The financial system

1443
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,663
Texas

1444
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,199
It was supposed to

1445
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,223
Deflect and

1446
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,527
Sort of attention from the movement of

1447
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,295
Financial

1448
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,575
Systems to

1449
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,599
To Texas

1450
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,927
Ask her what she said okay

1451
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,207
Her sources said

1452
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,279
Circa a he's not necessarily saying that you're not saying

1453
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,303
It's not true

1454
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,327
Apaches just reporting

1455
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,375
This isn't this something that's being chatted about

1456
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:12,191
Through the Defcon two because they were missiles

1457
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,215
That came up

1458
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,519
From Mexico that were found in Boulder Colorado

1459
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,799
And the DHHS

1460
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:19,103
I was going to find somebody to blame on that

1461
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,383
And start a war in order to

1462
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,151
Deflect from

1463
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:25,247
The fact that they're trying to move the financial Market to Texas

1464
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,319
Interesting Wall Street now in Texas

1465
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:29,855
DIA

1466
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,623
VI

1467
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:34,463
Dia of the DHHS calling in a bomb squad

1468
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,487
For Missy

1469
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:37,791
The funniest

1470
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:40,095
Possible thing I can think of

1471
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,887
I mean imagine

1472
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:48,287
Just imagine there being missiles in the bomb squad is wearing the f****** bomb suit going to be like

1473
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,591
Hey maybe I'll survive this f***

1474
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:56,991
Basil if I blow it up get the f*** out of here

1475
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:59,807
Maybe somebody whose job it is to deal with missile

1476
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:03,903
Somebody will probably not like there's a million different types

1477
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,951
The missile also North

1478
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:09,023
Grumman has a station in Boulder

1479
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:14,399
So like a bunch of people there

1480
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:17,471
Blame it on a patsy

1481
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:21,567
Thrive in the financial system

1482
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:25,407
What does that mean

1483
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,687
Victor MIT

1484
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:29,503
Has been caught with a missile that he brought

1485
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,783
Kim from Mexico

1486
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,063
So we're going to start a war

1487
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:37,439
And this is all too distracting the fact that Joe Rogan and Elon Musk move to Texas

1488
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,463
Or something

1489
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:43,327
I want it I want to see I want to see it

1490
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,375
There's some other talk going on

1491
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,935
That is if they're going to shut down a state

1492
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,471
I don't know which

1493
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,519
State security doesn't remember which state

1494
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,567
Jimmy Choo doesn't sweat the details

1495
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,895
State in the United States

1496
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:57,663
Going to be shut down

1497
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,431
Just shut down

1498
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,967
Someone recently said

1499
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:01,503
They're going to cut

1500
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,271
They're going to

1501
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,063
Completely closed down

1502
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,599
Forget what you said it is

1503
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:07,647
Whatever

1504
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:15,327
You do not let people in or out and and all kinds of craziness is going to go on

1505
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,143
Apparently they do want to try

1506
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,191
Divorce vaxis

1507
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,983
That's going to cause

1508
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:24,543
More Civil War type issues

1509
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,591
You don't want a civil war if

1510
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:32,735
The Chinese are at your borders which they are

1511
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,783
Find it on my website

1512
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:39,135
Saying that they're actually training in Pennsylvania

1513
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:43,743
So shutdown Pennsylvania Chinese military is training in Pennsylvania

1514
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,559
Burning a land invasion

1515
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:49,119
When they're already in the United States

1516
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,935
I love the idea of the

1517
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,215
The Chinese military

1518
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:55,007
Anywhere in the United States

1519
00:59:55,775 --> 01:00:01,407
Sing for anything because there's zero possibility in the United States that a Yoko will not stumble upon

1520
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,431
0

1521
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:08,831
0 possibility that somebody will not stumble upon the Chinese military practicing

1522
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,903
I got to get out of here

1523
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:16,255
I have to I have to make a confession

1524
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,279
I did not

1525
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:21,119
Go check out her website.

1526
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,655
Goddamn

1527
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,959
I let this one slip

1528
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:28,031
I'm going to stipulate

1529
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:28,799
Whatever

1530
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:33,663
If she doesn't know what state she's talking about Ryan

1531
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:38,015
I'm not going to look into the Chinese land Invasion by way of Pennsylvania

1532
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:41,087
You can't just say you know what happened you don't have a 11

1533
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:45,183
The Chinese are working with a Pennsylvania Dutch

1534
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:49,791
Yep

1535
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,327
Oh man

1536
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:54,655
I give Carrie a hard time and you know

1537
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,191
Some of it is

1538
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,727
Good-spirited

1539
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,495
Some of its not

1540
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,519
But

1541
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,079
I think that there are really salient

1542
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,359
Similarities

1543
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:05,663
Is between the way that she disseminates information

1544
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,431
Another way Alex

1545
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,223
You can't learn from

1546
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:10,271
Totally now as a way to punch

1547
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,551
Alex Wright in his gut

1548
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:13,343
I would like to play clip

1549
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,367
That

1550
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,159
I think goes along way too

1551
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:16,927
To show that

1552
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,207
Even carry

1553
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:21,023
Someone who believes in space Raptors

1554
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,815
And all this nonsense

1555
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:25,375
He's still a little bit more sensible than our

1556
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,935
So one and two are basic

1557
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,703
Sickly one

1558
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:30,239
Sandwiches

1559
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:32,287
In absence the Rino

1560
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,567
Pelicans and the demo

1561
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,103
Then

1562
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,639
The other group would be

1563
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,687
In essence the

1564
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,967
White House

1565
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,735
People

1566
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:45,343
Part of the people can easily be a person who is a demo

1567
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,367
Republic

1568
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:50,207
These labels actually have to go by the wayside eventually

1569
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:52,511
Because they don't really symbolize

1570
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,279
The truth

1571
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:56,607
What's going on here in the philosophies of the people

1572
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:01,215
I'm sure there are plenty of Democrats out there that think they don't want

1573
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,007
To be in a

1574
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,591
Can't do anything with their bodies whatsoever

1575
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,871
Let alone

1576
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,711
Democrats that are

1577
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,503
What I call closet Nazis

1578
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,527
And there

1579
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,063
Just the opposite so

1580
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:19,647
Yeah I think it's important not to so to slot somebody

1581
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,695
Automatically into a

1582
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,231
An enemy

1583
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:25,279
If you will category of humanity

1584
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:29,887
Swimming carries even sensible enough to know that like some people who are like

1585
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,655
Like maybe

1586
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:33,727
Visually or superficially on a different

1587
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,287
Track the new

1588
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:42,687
Where is Alex spends most of his time talking about how everyone who disagrees with me eventually the Democratic Party

1589
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,063
Killing babies as a ritual

1590
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,111
It's a

1591
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,951
It's a bummer you know this person who believes

1592
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,999
The JFK is her weird friend

1593
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,327
Ed's all this stuff is going on and there's a

1594
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,095
Caballo

1595
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:00,863
Secret until the

1596
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,423
People around the world that are working with

1597
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,703
Trump

1598
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:09,567
And they still have like in terms of where the rubber meets the road how you treat other people

1599
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:12,895
Beautiful more evolves

1600
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:15,711
More tolerant kind of perspective

1601
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:18,015
Yeah especially when you Jeff

1602
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:24,415
Deposit with 2003 Alex fan like these nut bags out there making us all look bad

1603
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,439
They make us look like

1604
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:28,767
Conspiracy theorist these people out there with their

1605
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,583
Oh I've met aliens before

1606
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,631
Man buddy

1607
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,423
Even she's like

1608
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,703
Hey what's up

1609
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,471
Dick all the time

1610
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:43,871
Everybody's

1611
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:46,431
We won last clip and I was

1612
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:49,759
Feeling something as I was listening to this and I was like

1613
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:50,527
Where are the

1614
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,807
Ifucking aliens

1615
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:58,207
There is nothing about Raptors

1616
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:00,767
There is nothing about the Mercantile dogs

1617
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,047
Nothing about the feline

1618
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:02,815
Contessa's

1619
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,863
There is nothing about the

1620
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,911
Wrapped up adamantas beating

1621
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,191
There's nothing about the

1622
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,727
Squid I think there's some

1623
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:11,263
Squid involved somewhere

1624
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:14,335
Disappointed

1625
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,639
And then we get towards the end

1626
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,687
And Kerry says this and I kind of felt like

1627
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:21,503
This is lip service oh no

1628
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:23,551
I guess whatever you take what you can

1629
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:28,415
This situation is also influenced by the ETA

1630
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,207
Visitors

1631
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:32,767
Andy T's inhabit human bodies

1632
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,047
The Schumann

1633
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,327
E.t.

1634
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,119
Hybrids that are here

1635
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:42,495
Many of us are a mixture of many races of UT's

1636
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,263
And

1637
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,799
There is also

1638
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:47,615
Said to be in a show called

1639
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,639
By human

1640
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,175
Group that's Adama

1641
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,711
Are from Adam

1642
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:53,247
Adam seed

1643
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,807
But I think that that's also a

1644
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,087
A misunderstanding

1645
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,879
Because if you go into the work

1646
01:04:59,135 --> 01:04:59,903
Ashiana Dean

1647
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,183
And her books are on the phone

1648
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:01,951
Page

1649
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:02,975
On the Lord

1650
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:03,743
Apart of

1651
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,791
Front page of my website

1652
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,071
And read those

1653
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,095
She will find out that

1654
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,655
Life on Earth and humans did not

1655
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,679
Bpn

1656
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:14,495
When is the Anunnaki decided

1657
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,263
2

1658
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,287
You know inter

1659
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,311
Kefir with are chinos

1660
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,359
Tooele home

1661
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,151
You know Garden of Eden

1662
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,943
Story stems from that

1663
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:23,711
.

1664
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,271
And at certainly

1665
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:27,807
Talking about

1666
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:30,111
Where the Bible stems from and and

1667
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:32,415
Prior to that time there was no Bible so

1668
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,207
A lot of those stories also

1669
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:36,255
Are slightly

1670
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,303
If not completely misleading

1671
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,327
Alex wouldn't

1672
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,095
Like that

1673
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,887
That would not be good

1674
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:45,215
That would not make it easy to talk to somebody who's been to heaven

1675
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:47,775
A lot of the Bible is barely Wiggly

1676
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,799
Who would have guessed

1677
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:53,151
I felt a little bit sort of

1678
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,431
Unsatisfied by that

1679
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:57,759
Does not your aliens are involved but how

1680
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,551
Yeah

1681
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:05,951
This is big stuff like we got a lot going on right now

1682
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:06,719
What she's talking about

1683
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,743
Nuke

1684
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:08,511
Gettysburg

1685
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:13,119
Yeah I have to be involved bulshit before

1686
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:19,519
They were like oh there's a trade disagreement between China the United States so we got the Mercantile.

1687
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:25,919
Austin ago she was actually aliens eating people and they had to close off an area

1688
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:34,623
Whenever there was like a war it was close a portal or something

1689
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,927
Do with like with good alien

1690
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:39,743
No mantis beings anywhere

1691
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,279
No no Beatles

1692
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,815
A little disappointed

1693
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:47,167
Betrays the entire worldview

1694
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,703
Because it either goes

1695
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,727
One way or the other

1696
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:52,287
You know it's got to be small s*** with aliens

1697
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,079
Otherwise we would notice

1698
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:56,127
Right so that's got to be that like

1699
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,431
We're showing up in Vietnam during the war

1700
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,711
That thing

1701
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,271
Aurora's got to be so big

1702
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,831
That the only thing that matters is space

1703
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,599
ACNL

1704
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,159
Like if you're talkin about intergalactic

1705
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:08,927
Take travel

1706
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:12,255
Who gives a f*** about politics in the United States

1707
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:18,655
Do you know like the only thing that implicates

1708
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:24,799
Exactly or it's part of a larger war between them and it's a proxy war them everybody where the universe

1709
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:27,871
Does Vietnam you know that but I'm not seeing is

1710
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,151
How's that work

1711
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,687
In relation to the topics

1712
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:34,271
But she's covering from here

1713
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,319
Aliens are involved

1714
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,087
And then

1715
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:38,879
A drop

1716
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:41,183
I find that to be not at all

1717
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,463
Now I need more

1718
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,999
Weak tea

1719
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:44,767
Itweak

1720
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:47,327
There's something that I wanted what by coming back

1721
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,911
But I did get some

1722
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,959
Black-eyed nice reprieve

1723
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,007
There was some fun

1724
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:57,567
And to be found your Waters yeah

1725
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:02,431
And so like I'm glad that I was able to find these not vinup a wall

1726
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:05,247
Assertive ethically discuss

1727
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,039
Get another voice

1728
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,575
About what's going on in the world

1729
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,111
It's important it's important

1730
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,391
To be able to have different

1731
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:13,951
Different information streams

1732
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,231
You know I think what

1733
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:16,255
Really disappoint

1734
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,303
I think what really disappointed

1735
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,583
Is that

1736
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:22,655
It's because I would assume it's because of carries audience

1737
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,679
But she has to go in

1738
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,471
You know what I'm saying

1739
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:28,031
Because if anybody is set up

1740
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,311
To be in a situation

1741
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,359
We're even during the Trump and Biden

1742
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,639
Disagreement years

1743
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,687
Or whatever it is we wouldn't even during the

1744
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,223
The cold Civil War we've been fighting

1745
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:36,991
Obama

1746
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,295
It's right you know I mean it's like

1747
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:41,599
You can stay above The Fray

1748
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,391
You're talking about space

1749
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,927
You're out there

1750
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:48,511
You know and you can apply the greys

1751
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,047
Is to whatever's going on

1752
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:53,375
But that's not as important as the international trade disagreements

1753
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,423
Between the f****** bluebirds

1754
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,471
Yeah

1755
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:00,543
I think social media algorithm gaming and

1756
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,359
Like a lot of those

1757
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,127
Influences

1758
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:08,223
Just became such a Gold Rush people during the Trump.

1759
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,783
That's how I feel like it maybe they were it.

1760
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,831
But it was impossible to avoid couldn't

1761
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,599
You couldn't

1762
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:16,159
Not there might be a place in the market

1763
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:18,207
Good place for you to have weird ideas

1764
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:21,535
Maintain an audience and not have a strong position on Trump

1765
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,583
Right cuz there's other people out there who

1766
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,863
Who's got alien weirdos

1767
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:28,959
But they've got a strong position on Trump and now that those two are intertwined

1768
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:32,799
I think it's possible I don't know maybe someone will write a book about it one day

1769
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,335
Jordan will be back

1770
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,639
With another episode will get back to Alex Jones

1771
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:41,759
Had to give him a break had to give ourselves a break break feel I feel much better

1772
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:47,135
Yes I will be back but until then we website
