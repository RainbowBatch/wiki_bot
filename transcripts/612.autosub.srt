00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,584
Alex Jones

00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,656
Jordan Jordan

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,824
I started watching finally a said watching Better Call Saul

9
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,152
And it's good

10
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,224
That's basically

11
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,272
Oh yeah very enjoyable

12
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,576
I expected honestly even from the height

13
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,880
People have surrounding it

14
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:35,744
I've enjoyed it a different way than I expected in go well done

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
Folks

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,816
Play the nice show

17
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,912
You know it's but what's great about Better Call Saul

18
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704
Deeply funny

19
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,568
Certain situation down it's so willing to lean into how funny

20
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,616
That it can be and then in the next

21
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,432
It can totally change the tone and you're still in

22
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,808
Yeah yeah there's a lot of like emotional feeling there's a sentiment and then also good comedy

23
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:06,208
Oh yeah well done something has actually lived up to

24
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
Exceeded

25
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,792
The hype that I had in my head

26
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,352
Tell me to watch something

27
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:16,192
I'll put it off and then I'll watch it no back alright or elected

28
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,264
Socks

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,336
No one told me to watch that

30
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,128
No that was all you

31
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,664
Myself to watch that

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,528
AE86 always excited

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,088
What's up with your brights on

34
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:39,488
Is and I we went to see Sylvan Esso at the Aragon

35
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,512
Ballroom affair

36
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,280
Fantastic

37
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,840
Amazing awesome

38
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:49,216
Finally a music act that I've heard of that you that you bring up

39
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
But

40
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:55,104
Remember I showed you that the clip of them doing the life

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,504
Performance I believe so the band all together in a circle plan yeah yeah I remember that

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
That's a bit

43
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:08,928
This concert was really really great but it also helped me remember that I'm not just an old crank like tomorrow

44
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,256
Alarm music

45
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,304
It's better with a live band

46
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:20,960
It's in Tavares their live show touring is the two of them the producer and the incredibly

47
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,752
Talented singer and it's

48
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
It's great

49
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,312
Dave the music is really good

50
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,872
But when you got a couple of drummers when you got

51
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,152
Guitarist when you got

52
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,944
Real musical instrument

53
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
It's just better

54
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:38,112
I think that's the premise of the roof you know it's so good

55
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,976
Today we're talking about finally getting back in

56
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,560
Into the present I would save this is a sneaky snake episodes

57
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:50,400
Technically I think the Sneaky Snake was Monday when we had asked

58
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:55,264
The Spooktacular Sneaky Snake tacular

59
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:59,872
But today you were getting back to the present we're looking at October 31st

60
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,176
Halloween

61
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,576
I got lots of Halloween

62
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,160
The Halloween

63
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,952
Romero basketball

64
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,256
Many dream 23 after I

65
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
Fell down and broke my

66
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,583
This is Sunday Show Halloween

67
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
It stinks

68
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,519
All right how are you doing

69
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,079
Go to talk about and you know all that

70
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,687
If I had to rate it in terms of Alex's shows it's not in the tub.

71
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,479
Not in the top to you though

72
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,551
And we'll get that business

73
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,367
Looks like little moments say hello.

74
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,927
So first Wyatt thank you so much you're an alcoholic

75
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,583
Thank you so much you're not you

76
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:02,591
Kinsella

77
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:07,199
I'm a policy wonk

78
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,759
This is

79
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
I don't know if this is

80
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
Open find my inability to

81
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,879
Pronounce names

82
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
My fiance is Irish friend

83
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,999
Pronounce my name Craig but it's pronounced

84
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
Craig

85
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:26,911
Thank you you're now a technocrat

86
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
Correctly

87
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Doughboy

88
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
Money off that heroin

89
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,599
Freakishly large

90
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,671
How would you pronounce the

91
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,487
Gray obviously cray

92
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Dash

93
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,047
Geha

94
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
Craig

95
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,399
No

96
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,447
If he's talking about Irish

97
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,495
If you talk about Irish

98
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,335
Is Beyonce's Irish friends and family pronounce his name Craig

99
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,383
What is actually crazy Dash

100
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
Ge8

101
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,199
Okay okay

102
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,807
Here's what I would say knowing what I know about how Irish people talk

103
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:21,695
I don't think he's Irish no he's not Irish but it's Irish that's important hooker

104
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
Because they're pronouncing it more like

105
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,279
Bike rack

106
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,583
Which is in an Irish knot

107
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
It means good

108
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:35,263
I'm actually spelling of How It's actually pronounced

109
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,663
But not one for How the Irish people pronounce it

110
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:49,087
Yes it's probably that anyway this mystery we shall not be solved

111
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,111
But thank you

112
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
Call Hitler

113
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,351
Probably added me out saying that it's a Love Jones your child Hitler

114
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:05,727
I did

115
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:06,751
I'll Hitler

116
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,079
Hope we don't accidentally use that for

117
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:16,735
Irritator Heil Hitler

118
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,807
Show me startup today's episode and there's a couple of

119
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,343
Maine stories

120
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
Alex's

121
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
This is preoccupied with

122
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,999
And the first one is one that is going to annoy everybody

123
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
Across-the-board

124
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
October 31st broadcast

125
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
Wow the info

126
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,239
Rideable amounts of this year

127
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,103
Diapers.com

128
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,639
In the Charlottesville 4 years ago

129
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
Leading the

130
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,295
To stir up racial conflict

131
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,135
So that they can try to derail on election and make sure the demo

132
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
Democrat

133
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
The monster

134
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:07,679
Caught red-handed right during the national firestorm

135
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,775
Basically every newspaper and every so-called news TV program

136
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,591
Attacking Tucker Carlson and by extension

137
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,223
For daring to say that January 6th at

138
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
Ngos Bob

139
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,111
Provocateur

140
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
What like the Red Cross

141
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,463
Small minority of the million people that were there for

142
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
The break into the capitol

143
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,935
Alex has never and will never present any compelling evidence that either of the unite the right rally it's what he says

144
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,983
17 of the capital

145
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,263
On January 6th

146
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
Where provocateur

147
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,639
Or somehow run by shadowy forces of the government or some unnamed NGO like

148
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
Red Cross

149
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:56,575
This standard is required to claim that something is proving his solo on this show that he can just get away with saying whatever he wants is

150
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
Proven

151
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,927
How do I answer the current situation it has to do with a dirty trick

152
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:05,535
Types. That the Lincoln project pulled on Virginia gubernatorial candidate Glenn Young

153
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,839
They had five people dress up in

154
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,655
Khakis and hold tiki torches near younkins bus

155
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,703
During a photo op and voice

156
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,983
Support for the GOP Canada

157
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:20,895
There's number of angles to this whole thing but I wanted to say up front so it's totally clear that I am entirely opposed to what the link

158
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
To project it

159
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,759
The first and most important reason is there the kind of stunt like this

160
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
Disrespectful to the folks

161
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,135
The community in the activists or at the unite the right rally

162
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,463
Head very least it seems like a co-opting in a very

163
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,255
Crass way of their experiences

164
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
The trauma

165
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,583
And using that as a prop for a political rally

166
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,143
Second this just isn't in effect

167
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,703
Do strategy and it's tailor-made to backfire

168
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,543
The intent was allegedly to create a spectacle that would highlight younkins bigger

169
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
Patreon shittiness

170
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
There was never going to be the out

171
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,687
It's kind of hard for me to believe that the Lincoln project

172
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,527
A group of Republican strategist who made their brand just not liking

173
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,855
Trump know that the right-wing media as it exists

174
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,903
Wheatley tear this apart

175
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,487
And immediately shift the conversation to being about how this done proof

176
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,095
The left is just creating fake white supremacist to be mad at it make you scared of

177
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
And how January 6th was really the Democrat

178
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
That's when you get

179
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
Right down to it

180
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:22,847
I cannot in good faith believe that the specific people who run the Lincoln project would be so naive as to not know

181
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,919
That this is the result that would happen

182
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,711
Actively hurt the cause of their pretending

183
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
I find that difficult

184
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,111
Yeah I mean I all I saw was Republicans dressing like Republic

185
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,927
I didn't see a stunt

186
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
At all

187
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,743
Sure

188
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
That means like you could

189
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,679
Problem is like the various people that were actually the people who dressed up may have been Democrats

190
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Themselves

191
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,495
That creates the entire Opera

192
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
Pics of

193
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
A Democrat

194
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,823
Dirty trick or whatever

195
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,151
As for what Alex is saying all this

196
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,687
Is completely detached from reality

197
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
The Lincoln project

198
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
Is not the left

199
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
Has Alex Glenn

200
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,063
The Lincoln project sucks

201
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,599
And it's not aligned with the lab

202
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,415
Even as left-leaning as the Democratic Party

203
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:15,071
There's actually a bunch of Republicans who read the room and they realize they didn't want to be on Trump side and decided to work

204
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
Conservative

205
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,447
Target it's desperate to find some Republicans who

206
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
Evil

207
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,263
I'm a 2020 report from open

208
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
Secrets pointed out the following

209
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:29,663
Quote the Lincoln project reported spending nearly 1.4 million dollars through March

210
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,967
Almost all of that money went to the group

211
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,271
Board members and firms run by the

212
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,855
The Super PAC spent nearly $1000000 with summits

213
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
Strategic communication

214
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,183
The Firm run by Linkin project treasurer

215
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
Reed Galen

216
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,023
Another $215,000 went to the tusk

217
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
Digital

218
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,327
A company run by Lincoln project

00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
Advisor Ron

00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
Tesla

221
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,703
Both companies received a little business from other Federal committees

222
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
Since Trump's

223
00:11:55,007 --> 00:12:01,151
February 20-21 peace on the optical input Huffington Post reports that over 50 million dollars of the 90 million dollars the Lincoln

00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
Padres dad quote

225
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
Gone to firms

226
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,247
Controlled by the group's leaders

227
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
Really strong

228
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,087
Suspicion that these folks are just rotting

229
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,903
BMW further Persuader this

230
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,743
I would submit to you the response at their co-founder Steve Schmidt gave

231
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
When asked about their financial schedule

232
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
Quote

233
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,863
We fully comply with the law

234
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:27,519
The Lincoln project will be delighted to open its books for audit immediately after the Trump campaign and all its Affiliated super Pacs

235
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
Do so

236
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:32,383
Explaining the cash-flow nearly 700 million dollars that flow through the organization

237
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
Who's the girl by Brad parscale

238
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,943
A Kush

239
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:42,111
I don't know if I could come up with a response that makes you look more guilty than that but that one wasn't that good

240
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,391
We'll open our books

241
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,183
In the exact same way

242
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,511
That the theoretical evil person that we don't like

243
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,815
Should open his books and since he won't

244
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
We won't

245
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,167
Does proven were morally Superior today

246
00:12:55,423 --> 00:13:01,567
I am a youth you are and these other evil people kind

247
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:07,967
They do it when some other person

248
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,991
But yeah there's a game of

249
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,319
F****** Domino's in three Lee stupid

250
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,087
Just like a

251
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
F******

252
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,159
Pouring water in an uneven

253
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,463
Tile floor below sea level just like

254
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,303
Wherever there's a hole to be filled with money they will find

255
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:27,167
What are the primary things that spark suspicion about their business model of the Lincoln project

256
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
Outflow to Lincoln

257
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,031
Jack folks other cup

258
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:39,455
But the real kicker is that they spend a suspiciously high percentage of their budget

259
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,735
Producing their ads

260
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:46,367
Elizabeth 2 article in opensecrets points out they spent $19,000 on an ad against Martha

261
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
McSally

262
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
But only one

263
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,719
Quarter of that amount was spent on ad placement

264
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
Quotes with the rest

265
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
Spent on production

266
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,095
These are of course production cost

267
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,679
They're paid to companies that are run by the people in charge of the Lincoln project

268
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,703
You can write those off

269
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,287
That's three-quarters of the budget go into production cost is just

270
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,847
Suppose with that OVI pro-trump Super PAC

271
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,127
America First action

272
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
Production

273
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
Costed

274
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,943
2%

275
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,759
Quote with the rest of their budget going to add buy it

276
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,599
The Lincoln project are not anyone's friend but their own

277
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:22,719
And to drive that point home think about the fact that if George W Bush was president right now

278
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
Their organization wouldn't

279
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
Exist

280
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,095
They don't really care about the things they want you to think they care about

281
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,143
They just want you to think that they do so they can

282
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
Can fundraise

283
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:38,079
Also they had to cut ties with Hunter co-founders John Weaver after multiple allegations of him quote sexually harassing young man looking to

284
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Break into public

285
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
16 to the surface

286
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,479
A credit they did put out a statement denouncing Weaver in January 2021

287
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:51,391
Do the opposite of their credit they knew about the quote at least 10 specific allegations of harassment since June 20th

288
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
What if I choose to ignore it

289
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,511
Until the outlet the American conservative began reporting on the allegations

290
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
Anyway

291
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,631
This stupid stuff that they tried to pull the young kid event is exactly what you'd expect from

292
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,679
It's flashy it seems like

293
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,959
Just making a point but it actually

294
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,263
Isn't and it's red meat for the right wing

295
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
Media

296
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:12,383
The important thing to understand about this is that regardless of the motivation for their actions with

297
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,711
What the Lincoln project date is counterproductive then they should just stop

298
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
No I mean ultimately

299
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
The Lincoln project

300
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
Exist

301
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,087
To create

302
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
Groupon

303
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:27,743
Put people more than willing to lean into whatever right-wing narrative is already being created about

304
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,023
The Left End

305
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,071
Safayet giving them more power

306
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,351
And because the Lincoln project

307
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,655
Theoretically separate from the

308
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191
Go to parties you can have

309
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
The Lincoln project doing

310
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:42,847
Exactly what the right needs the left media to do that they're not doing

311
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
I don't I wouldn't

312
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:51,295
Controlled upright I wouldn't go as far as

313
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,903
Is what you're suggesting kind of and I know that you don't mean this literally but that that kind of does and up

314
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,207
Getting into coordination

315
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,511
Mike Eichner of coordination is

316
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,607
It's just that they are smart enough to know a spot where they can

317
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,911
That's that's what I'm saying you can make a little bit of

318
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:11,775
They can get a piece of the attention economy and use it to fundraise totally and make a lot of money

319
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,847
I mean cuz the thing is

320
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:21,247
What can happen if I'm not saying that it's like collusion or that they're they're operating in Cairo.

321
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:27,135
I don't think they were saying I just wanted to close tonight that's why I really really understand that

322
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,183
When there is

323
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,975
A spot for

324
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
V

325
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
Left media

326
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
But the right wants

327
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,839
Hate right

328
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,167
The right will always go to that left media as well

329
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,447
Because I hate it so much

330
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,775
In the same way that they are afraid of their own media so they can

331
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
Constantly go back to that

332
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,079
So there's a Griff

333
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
To be made there

334
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
They make it

335
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,711
And it just so happens to dugdale perfectly with what they already want

336
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,783
You're right and I think the other thing too is

337
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,087
By doing these stunts

338
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
And

339
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Also

340
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,439
Being like we don't like Trump

341
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:06,815
They allow themselves to be portrayed as actually democratic

342
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:12,447
Useful the media slobbers all over themselves to portray them as

343
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,519
Non-stop just like look at what these

344
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:21,919
Brave conservatives are doing they can be painted as actually secret Democrats

345
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,991
By the right-wing media and it allows them to perpetuate

346
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
Recycle whole graph

347
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Does there

348
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,807
It's not even hard

349
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:31,391
It's really about is that the left is freaking out

350
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,743
Because Tucker Carlson is doing this documentary thing

351
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,839
About the Patriot Purge January 6th

352
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,143
Yeah they're mad that people are mad at Garba

353
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
Tucker's

354
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,799
All week on Fox

355
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,639
Freaking out about

356
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,711
The three-part series that starts airing tomorrow night

357
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,623
After celebrating and it's only available on

358
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,183
Foxnation.com

359
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:10,303
Tucker's ratings are going to go into all-time high need to be covering it all week

360
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,607
The biggest highlights and proof

361
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
Chagas watching Tucker

362
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,727
Play the left like a fiddle and really

363
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,543
Corn sheller fraud is a beautiful thing

364
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,127
Even more satisfying when

365
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,503
That it is a little bit

366
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Let's just say

367
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
Cool

368
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,695
I do

369
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
Pathetic because I

370
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,303
I I don't

371
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
Thank you

372
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:46,399
Is dealing with reality that Tucker Carlson wood

373
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,727
Throw him under the bus as if it helped his radio

374
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:54,079
Yeah whatever the through whenever the wind blows in another Direction

375
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
And get his bow tie back

376
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:03,295
You didn't wake him up he showed him a profitable lainho to

377
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
Be able to

378
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,111
Heaven audio

379
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,903
Yeah I know when the wind changes

380
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,743
He and John Stewart are going to go on a tour debating for

381
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,815
25 cities in six months or whatever and that's

382
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,863
They're going to be millionaires or got all over again

383
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,191
Whatever the case maybe Alex

384
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:25,567
Pretending that you woke him up somehow and like this whatever Tucker is doing now is somehow like

385
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:31,711
All this is B sincere version of of

386
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,503
Rye Rye

387
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,319
Is Brandon now is give him

388
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,087
Thermocouple

389
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
Give me a couple years

390
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
See where he's at

391
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
Anyway

392
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,439
Is really just about white

393
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,023
Under attack they are

394
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
White people

395
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
Everybody

396
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,143
All the major corporations

397
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,447
Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan

398
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
You name it saying

399
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,615
I hear I got copies of it

400
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,735
Critical race Theory training put out by the CEO sign by

401
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,575
CDL critical rate

402
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,415
On the critical race

403
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
Terry training

404
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,975
Call AT&T employees

405
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,279
White people

406
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,559
The problem

407
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,935
Sonic says white being white is inherently a genetic trait

408
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
I'm being a bad person

409
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,799
100% Hitler

410
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
She's being reversed

411
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,895
To say

412
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
What

413
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,015
Are you f****** talking about

414
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,039
Trailer slave

415
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,695
Death was that

416
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:53,887
So yeah he didn't have too much problem with wait what

417
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,215
I kind of wonder if he actually even understands what Hitler was up to

418
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,543
Why did Alex say that Hitler spoke about his

419
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:04,895
I I don't I don't know if you thought that maybe he didn't

420
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,175
Act on the things he's

421
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,967
Maybe that

422
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:14,367
F****** weird with say those things in the media came up with this fake narrative about him doing

423
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,416
Doing those things he was just asking question

424
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:20,256
Dad and I don't know the media always tries to hate people who ask questions

425
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,280
These are really

426
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,096
Quotes from AT&T training materials

427
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:31,008
This is a story about race-related training that have been leaked to a journalist who then made claims about the material without

428
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
Actually

429
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,080
You know he wasn't actually citing stuff

430
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
From the material

431
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:41,760
Those claims are the things that have been repeated by figures in the right-wing media presented as being from the actual documents

432
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,552
Close to a writer's interpretation of them

433
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
I just wish this was hard

434
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
Haha

435
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:52,256
Brother Bart AT&T released a statement saying that the reporting on this is quote filled with misinformation and an Acura

436
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,024
Receives

437
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:57,120
Journalism question for actually releasing the documents of the

438
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,912
In question here so I can take a look at the

439
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,448
See for myself

440
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,776
What are the problems that jumps out to me immediately when I see these.

441
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
Documents is that it

442
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,128
Clearly what amounts to a printout of an interactive web

443
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
Platform

444
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
Basically our program

445
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:16,832
Huge selection of links in different sections which obviously will take you to other pages that service resources

446
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
10 formed

447
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,624
Point of the X

448
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,672
Undergone

449
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:27,840
What are the big things that constantly parotid about this document is that each of the employees that if white people want to know who is

450
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,120
Responsible for racism

451
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,656
They should look in the mirror

452
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,960
Yeah that formulation isn't it

453
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,240
Ton of Articles covering

454
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,776
This attempted a scam

455
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,568
And here's what that comes

456
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
Is it a section of length

457
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:44,224
And it goes to an operating the Chicago Tribune titled quote White America if you want to know who's there

458
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,760
Responsible for racism looking

459
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,088
Yes those words do. This document

460
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:53,184
Is pretty intentionally ignored by the people trying to drop outrage about this

461
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,512
The op-ed was written by delete glanton

462
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,560
And for the most part it makes a point

463
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,096
Probably article quote

464
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,912
Racism is no different from any other chronic problem

465
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,216
It occurs as long as it goes on check

466
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,776
Black people for the most part our power list

467
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,544
Stop racism

468
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,848
If we could we would have done it a long time

469
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,616
Time ago

470
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:16,992
In many ways the soffit share some common themes of Martin Luther King Junior's letter from a Birmingham Jail

471
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,576
Particularly the part about it being Gravely disappointed with the white moderate

472
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,160
You know it is everyone is heard that we don't need

473
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,696
Me too

474
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,720
Belabor that

475
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,024
I'm okay if you don't know look them up

476
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,400
Play thumbs up it is essentially an articulation of a challenge

477
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,680
For people who are not race

478
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,216
Us to recognize their inaction

479
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,008
Jennifer actively AIDS racism

480
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:39,776
Continuing

481
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,360
And that the change needed to get where we want to go starts within your own mind

482
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,176
It doesn't take away people are evil or bad it's

483
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,528
You know that's the interpretation you might expect a racist to Havasu

484
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,064
Because it's kind of threatening to race

485
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,648
You can either be anti-racist racist or you can

486
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,440
Facilitate racism but

487
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
You can't be

488
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,232
In the middle

489
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:05,888
The thing about white people being genetically racist isn't actually from the AT&T materials

490
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:11,264
But if you didn't read anything past this latest articles about this you might think that it was

491
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,568
Actually just another misrepresentation

492
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,592
Know something from glass

493
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
Zolpidem

494
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,384
The Chicago Tribune

495
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,968
American racism is uniquely white tray

496
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,016
Black people cannot be racist towards you

497
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:26,624
Racism by definition is quote Prejudice discrimination or antagonism Direct

498
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,720
It against someone of A different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior

499
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,816
Black people cannot exude a sense of superiority that we have never

500
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
Experience

501
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:41,216
I guess if you want to get mad about that quote you can do that but it would be good if you were mad at the actual contest

502
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,752
Fake version of what

503
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
This person say

504
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,312
And that's all that's going

505
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:52,992
I ran over this this whole document from AT&T and honestly it's a well-intentioned but dorky attempted a

506
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
Listen to appear to be doing their part

507
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,112
At the end of it there's this 20 21 day challenge

508
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,648
Suggest some questions

509
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,928
Consider it's a bookstore

510
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,464
But it also includes

511
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,280
Suggestions on things like how you should stay inspired

512
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,816
They suggest you quote

513
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,656
Create a soundtrack for justice playlist that fuels you

514
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:13,984
Orkin service a conversation starter with people of all ages

515
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,264
All right well now I'm at

516
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,800
Had their suggested soundtrack

517
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:22,432
Conclude such a dork Is the Love by the Black Eyed Peas

518
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,736
Brave by Sara Bareilles

519
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,784
And Roar by Katy Perry

520
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:32,416
Wow I mean that you just don't get more justice-oriented into playlist

521
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:38,560
There's some good tracks on there to love to know that beyond the Moon is on there

522
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,144
Okay but there's also three songs by Macklemore

523
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,168
So take that for what

524
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,192
Wow

525
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,472
Wow

526
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:54,688
Dream of the day Macklemore walks up to Gil Scott-Heron and says

527
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:58,528
Did I do a good job and then Gil Scott-Heron served as a cold ass honky

528
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:07,232
The journalist to publish this Sensational article about the document is a guy named Christopher rufo

529
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,024
And that might not be a name that

530
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,328
It's familiar to most people but it probably should be

531
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,424
He's essentially the entire reason that the right-wing is up in Arms by critical race

532
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
Rufo was

533
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:22,592
Read some documents from an anti-racism seminar put together by the city of Seattle's office of civil rights

534
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,896
And after you reported on it as a scandal

535
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,456
He began to get other such slideshow sent to him

536
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:34,112
According to a profile him in the New Yorker quote rufo noticed that they tended to cite a small set of popular

537
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,136
Anti-racism books

538
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,416
By authors such as

539
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,952
Ibrahim X kendi

540
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
And Robin diangelo

541
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,048
Ruffa read the footnotes of these books

542
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,584
Sometimes they pointed to academic

543
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,216
Scholarship from the 1990s by a group of legal Scholars who referred to their work as critical race Theory

544
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,032
In particular kimberle Crenshaw and Derek Bell

545
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,824
Ruffo follow depth

546
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,408
Brad and decided that the entire idea of anti-racism is actually

547
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
Kind of a Marxist

548
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
Plot

549
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:04,064
Which I hate to break it to him that's exactly what the John Birch Society was saying in the 19th 6

550
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,464
When they were opposing the Civil Rights Movement is brand-new.

551
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,864
New thought did you see the the video on Twitter going around of like the guy who

552
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,960
Who is like what's the biggest issue in the election

553
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:24,288
Why are we jumping on all he's saying is that the biggest issue is

554
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:28,384
He doesn't care about the bread

555
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,272
This is about white people dominated I think the reason the people are dunking on that video is

556
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
Because

557
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,064
The follow-up Quest

558
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
Is what is

559
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:41,440
Brighton

560
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:47,840
Benjamin wallace-wells the author of this piece in the New Yorker correspondent with rufo and this is how rufo explained his

561
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,424
We've needed new language on these issues

562
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,752
Political correctness is a dated term and Bill reportedly does

563
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,776
And apply anymore

564
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:59,616
It's not that Elites are enforcing a set of manners and cultural limits there's

565
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,944
Speaking to re-engineer the foundation of human psychology and social in

566
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
Institutions through the New Politics

567
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,248
Pics of race

568
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,808
It's much more invasive than mere correct

569
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,392
Who do the mechanism of social control but it's not the heart of what's

570
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,696
The other frames are wrong too

571
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,280
Cancel culture is a vacuous term that doesn't translate into Apple ID

572
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
Program

573
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,584
Woke is a good episode.

574
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,144
What is too broad to Terminal 2 easily brushed aside

575
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,936
Critical race theory is the

576
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,704
Perfect Villa

577
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,240
We can say race

578
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:32,896
But people won't just say oh they're saying it's about white people versus everybody else last September rufo. On Tucker

579
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:39,296
Carlson show and put the term critical race theory on to the right-wing media is mapping from there it's become the new way for conservatives to express

580
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,064
Racism

581
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,624
Well maintaining an appearance of social acceptability

582
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:46,720
I also hate to inform conservatives that they are just repeating themselves again

583
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,024
Illustration I'd like to present to you

584
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,352
Passage from a 1981 interview with Republic

585
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
Strategist

586
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,960
And Rodger Stone Buddy Lee at water that guy was great

587
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
Quotes

588
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:04,128
You start out by the way whatever I say and it's a hard-r cuz I'm not Dave Anthony

589
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:08,480
Quote you start out in 1954 by saying and

590
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:12,320
Play 1968 you can't say and that hurts you backfires

591
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:18,208
Stuff like forced busing states rights and all that stuff and you're getting so abstract

592
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,488
No you

593
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,888
I'm talking about cutting taxes and all these things that you're talkin about are totally economic things in a byproduct of them

594
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,936
Is blacks get hurt worse than white

595
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:34,592
We want to cut this is much more abstract than even the busing thing and a hell lot of more abstract than yelling

596
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
NM

597
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:42,272
Hey you know what size you know it's great and not doing anything about a pandemic that disproportionately affects

598
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,832
Minorities over-the-top

599
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,904
Holding racism in abstract in Marc deblois that's kind of a

600
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,928
Standard operation

601
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,952
A conservative so

602
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:55,072
It's not surprising to see rufo found a new term to use to play that old game and he thinks he's a genius

603
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,888
Anyway Trump saw him on Twitter got him covered

604
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,448
BC and help too I had that he helps

605
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,752
Executive order

606
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
Great

607
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,824
I am am

608
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,104
Just just

609
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,640
Love that Lee Atwater

610
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:09,920
Say it

611
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,456
Doesn't matter

612
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,224
Right

613
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:16,064
And you can see the exact same thing

614
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,368
The New Yorker

615
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,024
New Yorker article about Roofing also a bit from Kimberly Crenshaw the law professor who coined the term critical race Theory

616
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
3 years ago

617
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,072
I think your take on this

618
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,096
This is pretty much exactly

619
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,704
Quotes reform itself creates its own backlash which reconstitute

620
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,728
Problem in the first

621
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,264
Play scrimshaw said noting

622
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,848
But you made this argument in our first law review article in 1988

623
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,408
George Floyd's murder in led to quote

624
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,456
So many corporations and opinion shaping

625
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,736
Institutions making state

626
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,272
It's about structural racism

627
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:50,112
Creating a new broader anti-racism racist alignment or at least the

628
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
Potential for what

629
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,928
Quote to this is a post

630
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,232
Did George Floyd backlash Crenshaw said

631
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:59,584
The reason why we're having this conversation is that the line of scrimmage has moved

632
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,888
As she saw at the campaign against

633
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,192
Critical race Theory presented a familiar effort

634
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,240
To shift the point of the argument so that

635
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,288
Rather than being about structural racism

636
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:11,360
Who's George Floyd politics were about the seminar

637
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,664
Was that a proliferated to address structural races

638
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,712
I think that about sums it up

639
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,088
Anyway the guy who got mad about the corporate seminars and stumbled into a shiny new buzzword for races

640
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,112
Do use the hide

641
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:25,696
He mad about and hopefully he's going to get

642
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,976
It's Maritime on Tucker

643
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,512
His career

644
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,536
In the city

645
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,584
Scam

646
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,192
F*** all that really built

647
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,496
Are the idiots who run

648
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,288
I like

649
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,312
Everybody who

650
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
4

651
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,872
By the rules of

652
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,896
Television to

653
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,176
Pretend that this is

654
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,968
Valuable

655
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
Don't

656
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,808
With this garbage

657
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,624
If somebody says oh critical race Theory just go

658
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,160
Okay your problem is race

659
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,952
Get rid of the critical in the theory

660
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,488
Your problem is

661
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,256
Via

662
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:03,840
If you want to have like a like a conversation like this

663
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,120
Stay on Tucker Carlson

664
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,144
Some show about

665
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,424
Critical race Theory

666
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,704
I would just roll up a news

667
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,312
Or just

668
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,688
A trailer house

669
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,248
Whenever you says it's good

670
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,040
Or he just

671
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:28,160
Doesn't talk about some Praises buzzword for a while

672
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
You get a treat

673
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,952
So

674
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,792
Story number one is basically this Lincoln project

675
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,120
BIG Story number 2 is

676
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,424
Jim Acosta p

677
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,496
By myself

678
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,800
Anybody else he just tells you discredited

679
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
A joke

680
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,360
Touch him Acosta

681
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,016
He tried to Gaslight everybody in a 7 Half Men

682
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,808
Don't take him to 20 minutes

683
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,576
Burlesque

684
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,368
Play it.

685
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
Play it stop because

686
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,464
He saying about myself Carlson

687
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,488
Is what

688
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,512
He's doing

689
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,072
I'm rubber he is glue

690
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,608
Yep yep

691
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,680
Promise of another

692
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,448
Just like

693
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,984
Analysis of a clip

694
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,264
Yeah I'm going to take this

695
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,592
Inch by inch who segments 20-minute right

696
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:22,944
Thorough always kind of got excited and that happens cuz I know Alex is just going to

697
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Like

698
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,504
Find words to hinges

699
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,064
Responses on and by who

700
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,416
Contacts that could disagree with him

701
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,952
Classic

702
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,256
I was looking forward to that

703
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,792
Towards the end of the episode

704
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:41,376
The problem that system and establish

705
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,400
But has with

706
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,424
Tucker right

707
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:46,240
Emblematic of the fact

708
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,008
That

709
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
The GOP

710
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,312
Is waking up

711
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,592
To the New World Order

712
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,616
Oh I thought that

713
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,688
Was absurdly easy to be a billionaire off of line

714
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:59,040
Do the a disorder rhetoric is exactly what leads to people getting hurt

715
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,856
Terrorism

716
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
Now it's

717
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,464
Is that the GOP is waking up

718
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
He's waking up

719
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,072
The New World Order the global list of the great reset the most of it

720
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:15,424
And the whole neocon arm of Karl Road and George W bush

721
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,704
And the rest of them

722
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,240
Are becoming completely

732
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,904
Wanch

733
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,512
So technically isn't

734
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:46,400
True like a he's also mixing things up here cuz like every talking about general elections or primaries is

735
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,192
Trump's endorsement doesn't matter in

736
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,216
The general really

737
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,776
I mean just really matters in the primaries

738
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,568
But you pretty close Alex

739
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,848
Is pretty close

740
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,408
It's disturbing as hell so funny that

741
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,200
When he said races

742
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,992
I was like I was like well obvious

743
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:01,760
He said racist

744
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:07,136
I meant it was like out of 150 racist T supported only two losses like

745
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,696
At least you're honest

746
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,840
My time for Trump in the Battleground primaries in the 2020 election

747
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
He went

748
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,912
21 and 2 among the candidates eBay

749
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:23,520
That's even an improvement from the 2018 midterms where you went 50

750
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,312
Keenan to the solid record yeah

751
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:30,176
He has a slightly less successful batting average when those candidates get to the general election

752
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,736
But you know the numbers drop there a little bit

753
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:33,760
Honestly

754
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:37,088
That's not the claim that Alex is making or at least it's not the relative

755
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:43,232
He's saying that the bush types of loss weigh in the Republican Party in the Trump is a kingmaker in the GOP now

756
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:49,888
The only metric that's relevant there is how these candidates do in the primary and Trump's numbers are undeniably solid

757
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,168
How's the general

758
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,288
It's worse than bad

759
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,056
Like

760
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,336
70%

761
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,920
Something as opposed to a bit higher in the

762
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,760
It's terrifying at all it really speaks to is

763
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,296
How badly they water catering

764
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:14,976
Just bought a dictator really funny watching the Democrats right now because it does feel like they're mad that

765
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:18,816
Lying to their electorate about doing something and then not doing it

766
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,120
Doesn't work as well as the right wing

767
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,656
It feels like they're like

768
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,680
This should work

769
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,216
They do it all the time

770
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,496
They lie to you

771
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:30,592
Non-stop he didn't do any other s*** that you said that you wanted them to do

772
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,408
Still Love Drunk by can't we just lie to your face

773
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,432
Because

774
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,736
Their version of the Lion

775
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:43,392
Is aspirational and it doesn't actually involve the same sort of bloodthirsty Miss and anger

776
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:49,792
At the right-wing does which are the appealing parts of it for a lot of other folks who get tricked by it over and over and over and over again

777
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:56,192
Not going to Trump because they think Trump is going to give them Healthcare they're going to drop because they think Trump is going to let them murder people they don't want

778
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:02,592
Want to live anymore

779
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,664
So I Hope Springs Eternal

780
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,320
It probably will be with us for the rest of our lives is that every single election will be stolen

781
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,672
The case here in the Virginia gubernatorial race

782
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,952
Infowars

783
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,232
Tom

784
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,816
Virginia elections director says

785
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,888
Tuesday's results may have to quote wait

786
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,448
Until Friday or maybe longer

787
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,496
Because of Maylin

788
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,312
Vote absentee voters

789
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,384
Were you signing it certified you've already voted

790
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,664
This is a large

791
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,432
Porsche

792
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
Sing Ono

793
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,504
We don't want to go vote

794
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,528
Because of covid

795
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,576
A shame replay

796
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,392
Piles of all these extra

797
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,232
Been waiting deserted warehouses

798
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,072
Or until the next middle-of-the-night a few days later

799
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,864
And then pull the van

800
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,144
And the next

801
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,680
The balance that are all

802
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,216
Canidae

803
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,264
To the machine

804
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,592
We saw the footage of that in Michigan

805
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,384
In Pennsylvania

806
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,944
We saw the record of that happening in Arizona

807
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,504
All the places that Trump won

808
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:18,624
2345 or even up to 10 times

809
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,184
The numbers he won

810
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,256
2016

811
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:29,120
Nightwing

812
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
Trump

813
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,216
One by one point 2.3.15.2

814
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,288
Also Stacy barely won by a fraction of a point

815
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,640
7

816
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,712
This is too many numbers

817
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,528
If you're listening to this first of all

818
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:51,648
None of that's true but also if you're even like listening to him and you like this is like my God I can't

819
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,672
Keep track of all these numbers

820
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:56,512
Alex can you please find a folksy way to help me understand this

821
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,912
Grandmother for

822
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
Suspicious music

823
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,248
Bedtime

824
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,344
Looking

825
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,648
Add behind the couch

826
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
Georgia

827
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,048
Crown

828
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:37,984
Tablecloth

829
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,432
And watch this

830
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:53,600
Crap steal the election in front of us

831
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:57,952
I was talking about the

832
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,256
Alex's child with a two-year-old like

833
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:05,376
The table right I'm still kind of stuck on that order of operations problem so I've got like 10 x

834
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,656
Parentheses

835
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,960
2 + 2 points

836
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,984
Finest

837
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,568
-3 points for areas that is foolish

838
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:19,968
I do this because you don't understand crazy mess you must

839
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,760
Crazy math in order to

840
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,296
Non-euclidean geometry

841
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,064
Beyond Vape

842
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,904
So a bit of what Alex is talking about like the end there was a Georgia

843
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,720
Video that's a bit of fiction that the right-wing media

844
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,768
Put together to service

845
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,840
Debbie 2020election was stolen from truck but it's b*******

846
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,912
That file is like the Left Behind movie was dead to rights proof set

847
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:41,216
We've already lived through the

848
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,240
Chirp

849
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,288
In Georgia there was a pipe that burst

850
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,408
State Farm Arena where absentee ballots were being processed at approximately 6 a.m. on November

851
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,176
4/3

852
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:56,576
There's also a video that made the rounds what appears to be people pulling balance out from under a table at the State Farm Arena vote-counting are

853
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:01,440
That video was for about 10-15 the night prior and it nothing to do with the piper

854
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:07,072
Some Anonymous weirdo called The Hip Hop Patriot decided to combine the two into a compelling story

855
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:10,144
Put it out on Twitter and from there I became Alex's real

856
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:10,912
What is so easy

857
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:16,288
It's a way better scene for a detective novel The Way Alex is telling this story but none of it

858
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312
True

859
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,336
It's a problem right

860
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,640
That's also why detective novels are way better

861
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:26,528
Then realized lumbo would hear this one more thing

862
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,552
Give me one more thing

863
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:34,208
Also after what we learned on our last episode about how

864
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,488
Evil Halloween is

865
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,304
I can't believe Alex allows his children to take part in it

866
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:44,960
That seems really dangerous there are so many witches out there that don't want Alex to know all this yet they're doing to

867
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:48,800
To his four-year-old right now about it if this child gets

868
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:49,824
Tootsie Roll

869
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,895
You have a positive association with Halloween

870
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,175
Devilry knife

871
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,479
Cable lousy

872
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:02,879
Veil Between Worlds is that it's finished

873
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:07,231
Woman child Alex's Mormon child got to become a witch

874
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:11,583
The power that that women child is going to have

875
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,935
Because of the lineage of Alex Jones

876
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,775
The Terry Pratchett witches

877
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,311
Is every time he says

878
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
Which has edges

879
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:25,407
He just make me laugh so much child

880
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,967
Nonsense

881
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:31,551
So anyway Alex has a national file article

882
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,599
That he

883
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,903
I don't I don't know about that

884
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,463
I got to make a correction on the Fly

885
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,791
Michaud

886
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,095
Ryder

887
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:47,935
And this article

888
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,543
The drastic changes the various

889
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,335
Election laws Nationwide

890
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,895
Almost

891
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,687
Consent decree by the governor's

892
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,479
Legislators it was not

893
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,247
The law

894
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,295
Talking about like

895
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,087
Steve Allen

896
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
You can vote

897
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,647
Why the whole election was a fraud right

898
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,975
Election

899
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,535
Redone

900
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:23,263
That's why Mike lindell's right about Albania

901
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,615
The political will we need to stop worrying about reinstating Trump

902
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,967
We need to start working on stopping a fraud

903
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,575
And the general election

904
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
Rectify

905
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:47,583
Way way way way way way I thought we were dead already could have swore that we were not going to make it 3

906
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:53,983
To the next election Alex just have like a little tantrum like a week ago

907
00:43:54,239 --> 00:44:00,383
Everybody who gets the vaccine dies within six months to a year how about the end the end the rest of the unknown

908
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:06,783
Vaccinated who survived this calling will have to beat down the global hat

909
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:09,599
There's an election October 2024

910
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,903
Deadly off

911
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:18,303
We need to really focus on getting out the vote after the f****** zombies arise from beneath the

912
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:24,703
Earth with their vaccines to destroy well I mean honestly we will have to have a very uncomfortable conversation at that point about whether or not

913
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
Zombies going to vote

914
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,495
I mean

915
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,263
I don't know

916
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,287
The question

917
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:37,503
No matter what we choose it didn't look bad in hindsight

918
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:41,855
Be real pissed at us a week ago week and a half ago everybody

919
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:45,695
His dad cuz Alex is in a bad mood cuz he lost that case

920
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:52,095
Judgment

921
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:58,495
Hey look we got to remind yourself that they're always

922
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:01,567
So you think you're going to die in 3 years that's actually 30

923
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,895
Do you know this kind of Discord

924
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,479
Thing is a poker another thing that's at will you call a towel

925
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:13,087
We're going to die in

926
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,367
That's just kind of annex

927
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:17,439
Stream Sensational bulshit thing to keep the audiences

928
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:20,767
Keep their emotions heightened keep them scared

929
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,791
In order to

930
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,839
Funnel their attention towards the

931
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,119
Political project

932
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,911
That you helped to push in the midterms

933
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:27,935
924

934
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,471
That's essentially

935
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,007
Alex

936
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
Engagement

937
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,055
Again it should

938
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,079
Harder

939
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,359
You should have to work

940
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,127
Carter

941
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,407
You really don't

942
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,711
It turns out you don't get just don't

943
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,759
Well you know who doesn't work hard

944
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,855
Brown

945
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,415
Baseball swag

946
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,975
Of course so many false flag

947
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,519
The very same crew in power today

948
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,663
Attorney general fingerprints all over it that he was fully operative sadly evolved

949
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,991
Nanny fast forward

950
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,551
Two things like

951
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,671
Were you just get a bunch of democratic operatives

952
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,231
The dress up and taking torches and to go out in

953
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:27,071
Then you have a leftist mob shows up actually Believing lyrics

954
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,095
Fight on seasoning

955
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,143
Huge explosion

956
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:37,567
This is stupid and obviously not true but man it's so weird how Alex is somehow proven that all of the high-profile electivire

957
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,103
Silence by bigots in history

958
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
Those are real

959
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,199
It's so weird and you would say

960
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:46,015
I think that the party and the people pushing

961
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,295
Horrific

962
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,575
Racism

963
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,391
As a matter of course

964
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,415
Would also

965
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:55,743
Probably be the ones at fault for the terrorist violence

966
00:46:56,255 --> 00:47:01,119
They claim I mean they but they would be

967
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:01,887
Yes

968
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:07,519
They are not cuz otherwise they'd be responsible

969
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:13,663
Although I hear that Joe Biden's fingerprints are all over the OKC

970
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,015
So I

971
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:22,623
Trying to think that he was just a senator in Delaware

972
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:25,183
I'm interested to see how Alex Wood

973
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,719
Spell this conspiracy

974
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,023
Just tells me that he was freestyling

975
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:33,119
He just said whatever Paul yeah yeah

976
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:37,471
That might be fun to say

977
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,263
Indeed OKC

978
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:44,895
That's a big swing that's a that's a pieczenik level swing if you can back that up with secret.

979
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,687
Deep State sources in the state department

980
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,735
That you used to work with

981
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,015
For sure

982
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,831
Sometimes though you have

983
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,135
Some things that appear

984
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,159
Appears to be

985
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,207
Media manipulation

986
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,743
Sure

987
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,511
But

988
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,815
If you don't know anyting

989
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,607
And you're stupid

990
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,887
Right sometimes

991
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,935
Your ignorance about things

992
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:11,263
Is actually the cause of what you think

993
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,823
Is Media manipulation

994
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,871
Wavy Wayne baby

995
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,687
Bway baby

996
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,735
Movie with baby

997
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
Ball sack

998
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
Come out

999
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,391
Happen again

1000
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,183
Friday

1001
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,231
There were people with tiki torches

1002
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,511
Winding up

1003
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,791
Republicans bus

1004
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,375
They were there officially with the

1005
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,727
We don't know of

1006
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:42,751
Enough

1007
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,799
The warehouse is the Democrats do

1008
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,127
Bring in the dead of night this time

1009
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,663
Stop

1010
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:02,719
Torches and the media enemy see all of them ran with all the white supremacist are there supporting

1011
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,999
First of all

1012
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,815
We're call anyone ever claiming that Jane Roe a

1013
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,839
Actually gotten aboard

1014
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,655
The case was entirely predicated on the fact that she

1015
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,935
She couldn't get in divorce

1016
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,215
And which is why there was a loss

1017
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:20,639
She wouldn't make a good person to pace and access to abortion case around for very obvious reason

1018
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,919
She had access to

1019
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:27,039
I think if people just assume that you got an abortion because of the association with

1020
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:30,623
But I don't remember ever learning that or the media implying that

1021
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:34,719
She gave the baby up for adoption and I feel like the only way you wouldn't know that is

1022
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,511
As if you never really actively looked at

1023
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,535
Into the case at all

1024
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:41,631
Seems like a mind-blowing bit of trivia for Alex but like I said I suspect that's

1025
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,655
Just because he's an idiot

1026
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:48,031
A couple quick points though first the fake protesters didn't say that they were officially there with young

1027
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,055
They were there

1028
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,079
Supposed his supporters

1029
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,615
It's not an official wing of this campaign

1030
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:55,711
Stupid second I never heard this story reported as white supremacist

1031
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,759
The tiki torches at a Virginia rally

1032
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,343
By the time I saw this was already about how this was a

1033
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,111
PR stunt

1034
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,135
Lincoln project

1035
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,439
Third how could the Democrats

1036
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,487
Ever not have enough fake ballot

1037
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,303
Everything it election is as simple as Alex seems

1038
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,095
To think it is they can just print more

1039
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,119
Like is this dumb

1040
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,911
No no no no no

1041
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,935
You're not understanding

1042
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,239
The FED controls inflation

1043
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:22,847
Okay to many ballots the value of the ballots goes down

1044
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:28,735
That could destroy the economy entirely elections would become Fair

1045
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,271
Making them the ink is not

1046
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,831
Now that's true again I'm not the

1047
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,855
Democratic Party

1048
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:39,999
Do they have a little bit more access to

1049
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,023
Postage money

1050
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:43,583
Pink money is it where I do like that

1051
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:49,983
Arbitrary

1052
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:56,383
Look dude don't know if they have enough warehouses full of fake ballots in order to swing this election so they have

1053
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,407
To send out fake

1054
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:01,503
T torch guys to make a young kid little Platte

1055
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
Vine

1056
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:08,159
I do love just arbitrary all man

1057
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,463
These guys are evil

1058
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:15,327
Unstoppable incredible however terrible with infrastructure and paper cost

1059
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,351
Well actually

1060
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,655
There are evils they run everything

1061
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,191
Wedding to do paper jam

1062
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,751
We've all been there

1063
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,543
Devil can't train people on copy

1064
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,567
No

1065
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:31,967
The guy who fixes a copy machine died of covid

1066
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:32,991
They can't get it fixed

1067
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:37,855
I needed to get the Lincoln project

1068
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:42,463
Send up some every time

1069
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,023
Text the last time and then I'll enough of them more like well we

1070
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,047
Just won't fix your copy

1071
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,863
So Alex believes that

1072
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,631
The Lincoln

1073
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,911
Can project essentially

1074
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,447
Alana grenade

1075
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,263
This is your party who did this

1076
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:01,151
Because it blew up in their face or whatever right Lincoln project

1077
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,687
So that's a kind of

1078
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,455
What's the story

1079
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:08,063
Come to the rescue

1080
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,111
Lincoln project went on CNN

1081
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:15,999
For what they did

1082
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,023
Republican

1083
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,887
That's like saying that Bill Clinton is a wrap

1084
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,167
4

1085
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,727
Thomas

1086
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,287
Can or you can make it

1087
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,591
You are

1088
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,407
What's the Democrats for getting the blame for the false

1089
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:38,271
Well here comes as fast as they could almost

1090
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,575
Fall of themselves

1091
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:44,159
Oh no that sucks calling it a false flag is a little bit rich

1092
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:48,511
But also Alex left in the middle there because he knew he'd f***** up in his list

1093
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:50,303
But it was too late to do anything about it

1094
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:56,959
Not only could you say that Thomas Jefferson was a republican you could say that he literally founded the democratic-republican party

1095
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,031
Also known as the Jeffersonian Republican Party

1096
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:03,103
Republican party that we know.

1097
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,895
Today but none of the parties resembled

1098
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,663
Themselves

1099
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,431
100 years ago

1100
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:12,831
Also great whatever no nothing party is made a very strong comeback.

1101
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,599
The wig

1102
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:17,695
Lincoln project

1103
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,231
The same as calling Thomas Jefferson

1104
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,767
Center Republican

1105
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:24,863
You can hear him laugh

1106
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:31,263
At least I'm not having a bad day today and I'm going to tell everybody hit billions are going to die tomorrow kind of interesting to me because

1107
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:36,127
Is he knows so little about Thomas Jefferson in terms of these fake quotes that he throws out all the time

1108
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,919
Clear awareness that he's like

1109
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,967
He actually is a Republican

1110
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:44,063
That dick for half a little

1111
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,391
These actors

1112
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:50,207
Who were it this is why I brought this up with the beginning of the end

1113
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,487
These actors

1114
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,255
Scuba

1115
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,791
The people who are pretty

1116
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:56,095
Tiki torch wielding people

1117
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,143
Figured out the

1118
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,215
Twitter

1119
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,495
Tarantulas

1120
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,287
Other people

1121
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,823
And they're well-known high-level dinner

1122
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:08,127
Disguises

1123
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,151
Bachelor.

1124
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,175
Glasses

1125
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,711
And they're not blinking

1126
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,271
The Lincoln project

1127
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,295
Party cutouts

1128
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:18,367
Project

1129
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,671
Posing is white supremacy

1130
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,463
White nationalist

1131
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:23,999
As well

1132
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,791
Posing as everybody

1133
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,399
They really are Democrat Party

1134
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,191
Operative

1135
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,239
Well

1136
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,031
Georgetown University

1137
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:40,383
I think of taxpayer money

1138
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,687
Coming tsuyu to shut you up

1139
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:49,087
This is how Alex is trying to rationalize why he's being sued for defaming

1140
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,647
Brandon Gilmore in the United States

1141
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:55,487
A suit that is going to trial fairly soon probably

1142
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:56,767
Having troubles with that

1143
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:02,399
The little espro a high-profile that the Sandy Hook one but he's learned his lesson

1144
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:07,263
So the people who portrayed the fake white nationalist in the Lincoln project

1145
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:09,823
Start very well may have been Democrats

1146
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,127
But even if you prove that they're involved in politics

1147
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,151
2nd Swing to the left

1148
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:17,503
That still doesn't prove they are engaged in this stunt under the any official auspices of

1149
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,527
The Democratic Party

1150
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:23,391
You think about it for a second who else you going to get to pose as white nationalist Adagio

1151
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,927
Dear Ally other than Democrat

1152
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:27,487
Probably highly motivated young one

1153
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:31,839
That's the pool of people you might be able to get to be

1154
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,631
Hey it's political start Where can I

1155
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:37,983
Yeah I don't forget it'll I would also have to be somebody who's like wait a sec

1156
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:44,383
You want me to go to a place where horrific violence happened and traumatized

1157
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,175
Yeah I would love

1158
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,967
To do that I'm on the left

1159
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,271
Yeah I kind of have to be not not that

1160
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,551
Full of person

1161
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:55,903
So this point we are we get back to the AT&T manual

1162
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,487
AT&T

1163
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,255
Mets

1164
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,047
Did this is just

1165
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,839
Racial re-education

1166
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,119
Is not true

1167
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,215
AT&T says

1168
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:10,751
Racial

1169
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,055
Re-education program

1170
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,103
Assert

1171
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,479
Category education

1172
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,015
White people are the problem

1173
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,855
The article infowars.com

1174
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,023
John

1175
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,679
Tanty

1176
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:43,519
The whole world problems

1177
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:49,151
Inoculation

1178
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:52,479
No-No No-No No-No No-No No-No

1179
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,831
Gonzaga

1180
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,879
Supernatural

1181
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,415
I don't think that

1182
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,695
Hey what'd you come away

1183
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,975
With from

1184
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:06,303
Reading these are looking at these documents is it that they're arguing that it's the only pray

1185
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,095
Problem or even the biggest problem in the world is

1186
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,375
Is this a problem

1187
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:15,775
Also toxic waste dumping is a weird thing for Alex have on that list

1188
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:22,175
Find me of white people

1189
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:25,759
We should just ask Corporation

1190
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:28,575
Nicely know what's right

1191
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,647
Wait no

1192
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,439
I don't like that AT&T does

1193
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:40,607
So these Lincoln project people who went out and did this

1194
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:44,191
Could be I already called it a

1195
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:47,007
Language is a little severe

1196
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:52,383
Party has been caught in a racial fall

1197
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:57,759
Call flag for their operatives posing as white supremacist and the chain is what Republican Party

1198
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:00,831
Just a standard thing they do continually and

1199
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,111
Do not want you discussing it

1200
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:04,671
And we believe Jessie Smollett really got attacked

1201
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,439
Don't you believe that

1202
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,791
Turn out to be

1203
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,351
I think that

1204
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,399
If you are the Lincoln project

1205
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:18,239
You have a responsibility to understand their right-wing media ecosystem

1206
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:21,055
And doing something like this so trance

1207
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,847
Apparently stunts

1208
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,127
A PR stunt

1209
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:26,687
He's not going to really stick

1210
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:28,223
Is a negative thing for young

1211
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,015
Buddy will stick

1212
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:34,111
Inside the right-wing media ecosystem and then

1213
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:37,695
As a resulting example of

1214
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:40,767
Something that had to do with fake races

1215
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,535
Yep

1216
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,839
And will be something that could be used

1217
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,631
To keep people

1218
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,399
Problem

1219
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,167
Rekha

1220
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,215
Synchronizing larger societal issues

1221
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,239
It'll keep people crap

1222
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,775
Apt in that to that

1223
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,543
Space

1224
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,567
That facilitates

1225
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,103
The racist

1226
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:55,871
Violence

1227
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,407
Yeah that's

1228
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,943
They believe is fake

1229
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,991
Yeah and when you say responsibility

1230
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,527
That is true

1231
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,575
I would also say that if

1232
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,599
You expect

1233
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:10,207
People who have worked within the Republican Party strategy and

1234
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,255
Play It Again media

1235
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,023
Situations

1236
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:15,071
For most of their lives

1237
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,351
It would be hopeless

1238
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:18,399
Leslie naive to think that they didn't already on

1239
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,727
Probably it's at but I don't know I don't know their heart

1240
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:25,311
That way I know Alex's art

1241
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:29,919
Taka renny's excited about

1242
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:30,687
Along Comes

1243
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,711
Tucker Carlson

1244
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,735
With his

1245
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,039
Big report coming out from fart series

1246
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,599
The plot against America or the federal government

1247
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,623
Open Leah Brandon

1248
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,671
America

1249
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:46,047
I told you they were announcing the Bible

1250
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:48,607
Anybody questioning Alexa's a terrorist

1251
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:53,471
And then I'll go to the school board and say

1252
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,007
Appreciate you

1253
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:57,311
Teaching that white people are inherently bad

1254
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,359
Is a total Nazi crap

1255
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,943
Because of what

1256
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,223
Way cigar is not

1257
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,343
You're naughty stuff

1258
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,439
The official US government stratagem

1259
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:16,511
The National Security Council put out by Joe Biden in June

1260
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:19,839
I got a lot of news you're a lot of stuff to cover

1261
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,655
Because this is

1262
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:30,079
Alex is actually selling himself in

1263
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,639
Incredibly short here

1264
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,943
He called this when Joe Biden got into office

1265
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:41,599
Alex has been claiming that the homeland security apparatus is about to be turned against white people for basically his entire career

1266
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:48,255
This is one of these instances were illustrate that Alex said they should 15-20 years ago really doesn't make him sound like a psycho

1267
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:52,607
Make him sound like a broken record or a boy who's crying wolf in a really racer

1268
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,375
This way

1269
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,935
He doesn't help his case the January 6th was a

1270
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:59,263
Plot to turn counter terrorism against white people if you point out

1271
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:02,847
Did he said the exact same thing about almost every other terrorist act you can think of

1272
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:09,247
Turning the power of the State against white people is why Alex claimed they frame Timothy McVeigh for the Oklahoma City bombing

1273
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:14,111
Why I would spend so much time pretending that the FBI was going to frame a white Patsy for the Boston

1274
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:14,879
Vomit

1275
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:17,183
Did you go back to 911 that's even part of his

1276
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,207
Conspiracy there

1277
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:23,583
Passing things like the Patriot Act only happened because the state wanted to make you afraid of foreign terrorists

1278
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:27,935
But it was really about giving the state more power so they could actually use it against white people

1279
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,703
Or Patriots

1280
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:30,239
Alex

1281
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:33,055
Is a preoccupation for Alex because he's racist

1282
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,847
These would be the stupid rompers

1283
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:35,871
Entire career in

1284
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:38,431
I'm going to go on the mantle what he's doing right now

1285
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,991
This is another time that he insisted the sky was falling

1286
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,527
In-N-Out

1287
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,063
Don't really have the

1288
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,599
Perspective of hindsight

1289
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:46,879
Is happening in the present

1290
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,159
Right2know

1291
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,951
Bazooka be another one of those

1292
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:50,975
Really hope

1293
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,255
That's that

1294
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,047
Clip of Owen Shroyer

1295
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:54,815
Burning up

1296
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:55,583
Flag and saying

1297
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:56,607
Fuckbay LMS

1298
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:02,495
Patriot Purge documentary

1299
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:04,287
Contacts to the whole thing you know

1300
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,567
If you realize that

1301
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,359
The people leading the rally

1302
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,639
Are themselves saying

1303
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:10,431
F*** BLM

1304
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,455
Burning flag

1305
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:15,295
I'm and Alex just talked about something you know like when you

1306
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:18,367
When you think that should also play clips of Harrison

1307
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:24,767
Broadcast b a on April the capital is falling

1308
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,815
Because it's going to be a patriot

1309
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:28,351
So we need to know

1310
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:30,143
Exactly who the Patriots want to purge

1311
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:36,031
Probably want to get rid of those people to make the Patriots look better right

1312
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,359
Boo

1313
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:41,919
Systems freaked out

1314
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,735
Freaked out because Alex and Tucker when

1315
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:47,039
When they talk about these sorts of issues

1316
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,575
Short and they bring light

1317
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:51,647
Stewie globulus false flag

1318
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,671
Variability

1319
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,951
Interpol future false flag

1320
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,743
God

1321
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,047
Carlson hammering on it

1322
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:01,119
You know that they've got the system scared

1323
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,167
Because they are so freaked out

1324
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,727
Richarlison raises this

1325
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,263
I raised this because

1326
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,823
The elephant in the room

1327
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,199
Just as sure as the sun came

1328
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,223
40

1329
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:23,647
The next year before the midterms just like they did Oklahoma City in Downey

1330
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,415
5

1331
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,695
What would be real life

1332
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,095
The Oklahoma City bomber

1333
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:32,863
Look it up

1334
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,167
Clinton said he owed his

1335
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:39,775
Oklahoma City web

1336
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:42,335
Do web search do an image search will see the headline

1337
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,151
Air Force 1

1338
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,319
Hours ago

1339
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,855
Film books you name it

1340
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,647
Right

1341
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,695
Exactly that

1342
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,743
Provide specific citation I'll look into it

1343
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:02,559
I suspect this is just Alex putting The Dramatics

1344
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:05,631
Spin on the idea that Clinton saved his re-election with his

1345
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,423
Response to the Oklahoma City bombing

1346
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:12,031
As The Story Goes his numbers were terrible and it wasn't looking good for him getting a second

1347
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:16,127
Then the Murrah building is attacked and he shows up and gives an amazing

1348
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:19,455
Speech that Comforts Oklahoma and the nation in this horrific MoMA

1349
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,247
It encourages a path forward

1350
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,551
Many folks have said that that speech

1351
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,575
And Clinton's leadership

1352
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,343
After the bomb

1353
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,135
Play the major role in his re-election

1354
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,183
It is Bill himself ever express

1355
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,463
Feeling that way I don't

1356
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,999
I think that would be too surprising

1357
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:35,327
Don't prove that he did the bombing in order to get reelected

1358
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:38,143
It's still this giant leap that Alex wants us to make

1359
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,167
It's f****** dumb

1360
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,191
Right yet mean

1361
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:44,543
Do you really think Obama would have been elected without a massive financial crash

1362
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,591
Obama's not going to be like

1363
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,663
Good thing that financial crash happened otherwise I wouldn't be president

1364
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:56,063
I'll be back with all this being said if you look at gallup's approval ratings for Bill Clinton you'll see that he was hovering

1365
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,087
Around the mid 40

1366
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:59,391
3% approval prior to the bombing

1367
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,439
46% the week before

1368
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,487
1051 percent for the neck

1369
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,255
Next two weeks

1370
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:08,095
By June 5th it was back down to 47% and around there

1371
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,119
Consistently

1372
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:12,703
It didn't go back up into the 50s steadily until November

1373
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:16,031
I just think it is a little bit of mythologizing

1374
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,567
Sing based on how good that's

1375
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,359
Spirit was after that

1376
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,895
And how that did

1377
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:26,783
Really some at him as as a strong leader

1378
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,111
On the day MLK died

1379
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:32,927
Tide is there different we're on the day the government murder dive okay

1380
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,975
I think that

1381
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,791
More to the point about this stuff too but

1382
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:41,375
This is not freaked out because you're going to blow some kind of false flag they're playing

1383
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,167
Cuz this is going to get people hurt

1384
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:45,983
This inevitably leads people down to pass

1385
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,007
That leads to viola

1386
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,543
Man not good

1387
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,103
No-sew Alex likes

1388
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,151
Pretend that he does a lot of stuff behind the scene

1389
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:57,247
He is a man with a hydro with many heads does he likes

1390
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,015
To say sometime

1391
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:02,879
They contributed to Tucker's documentaries

1392
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,927
Apparently

1393
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,207
YouTube background logo

1394
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:09,023
Bigger than this documentary

1395
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,815
That we can trim it into and then

1396
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:13,119
Tucker footage for

1397
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,215
You're going to see you tomorrow

1398
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:27,711
Morgan

1399
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,503
So desperate to be associated

1400
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,551
But that's

1401
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,599
The people saying like oh my

1402
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,367
My God like

1403
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,415
Tucker's just doing Infowars

1404
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:39,999
And insult

1405
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:40,767
Tucker

1406
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,839
They're saying that I better

1407
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,375
F****** use this to play

1408
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,935
Yeah probably good

1409
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,471
Wagon to a horse

1410
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:51,519
And the reality for Alex's that he's

1411
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:55,359
Guilty himself in competition with people like Tucker Glenn Beck

1412
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,175
You know they're better than you

1413
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:02,527
This is actually incredibly interested on Alex

1414
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:04,319
I agree with him at 1

1415
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:08,671
Hundred percent is a watershed moment

1416
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,231
Talk show host

1417
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,535
Probably the end of the day smarter than I am

1418
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:16,607
Not hard

1419
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:20,703
But when it comes to firing people up at fighting tyranny and not backing down

1420
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,495
Having the Holy Spirit

1421
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,031
I got more of it

1422
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:26,847
I'm not trying to brag it's all glory to God

1423
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:30,431
To get people fired up at a guy

1424
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:33,503
I completely 100% agree with this

1425
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,039
People like Glenn Beck

1426
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:37,343
And Tucker are smarter and better host

1427
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,623
And a TV

1428
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:41,695
Alex's job is not to be accurate

1429
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,231
He's not there to be a good

1430
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:44,511
Broadcast arrojo

1431
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:48,095
He's there to incite people

1432
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:50,143
To f*** with people's emotions

1433
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,935
Use information as a weapon

1434
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,471
Whether it's

1435
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,751
Accurate or not

1436
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:57,311
And incite them to action

1437
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,591
That he will then later

1438
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:03,199
Call Volkswagen it's very odd but even he's like

1439
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:07,551
My job is to incite them to Action Now obviously whatever my fans do stuff

1440
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:12,159
Number to do that how could you even claim that I said that was a deep state

1441
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:18,559
Nonviolent

1442
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,095
Politically

1443
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:21,887
Alright buddy

1444
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:24,191
What a dick

1445
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:27,519
Completely accurate also unfortunately shows

1446
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,823
Too much self-awareness

1447
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:32,895
To accept that he is unself-aware of so many others

1448
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,479
Also

1449
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,271
Is this

1450
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,855
Plus years

1451
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:45,439
Cuz the first 56 years I didn't understand not calling at USB

1452
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,463
Push by gods

1453
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,511
20 years ago

1454
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,071
Was just like a voice in my head

1455
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,119
Almost episode

1456
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,679
You are going to relay the what will pass

1457
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,959
You're going

1458
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,031
Myself

1459
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,335
Baptism in the

1460
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:03,359
In the

1461
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:04,895
Wilderness

1462
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:09,247
Oh my God

1463
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,527
Party strategy.

1464
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,343
Jones is the John the back

1465
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,927
He's the main engine our computer studies

1466
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,231
He's got to be stopped

1467
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,279
This is delusional nonsense

1468
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:23,327
But also I don't think it was a democratic

1469
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,095
Party

1470
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:26,655
Documents said that Alex was a voice in the wilderness

1471
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:27,679
Victor was

1472
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:31,007
Just a term that is used Like a Rolling Stone piece about it

1473
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:33,567
Like I don't I don't think it was just an article

1474
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:40,991
Absolutely do not believe that the government doesn't like party consensus

1475
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:46,111
The wild profit

1476
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:51,231
I know some somebody who's writing a profile added in that line at like we've moved on

1477
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,327
I think

1478
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,607
It's kind of

1479
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,631
Bucked up

1480
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,399
2

1481
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,423
Think that

1482
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,447
There's any

1483
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:06,847
Reality to Alex's even his own subjective perception of twenty years ago he had a vision and

1484
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:07,615
Prophetic

1485
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,639
Dreams that he was

1486
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:10,431
Supposed to lay the groundwork

1487
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:12,223
For this holy battle like

1488
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,783
F*** this this is this is

1489
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,319
Unhinged

1490
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:19,135
Nonsense pathological

1491
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,415
Self mythology

1492
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,207
Not just like

1493
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:23,743
You know

1494
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:24,767
I

1495
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,047
Was called to this

1496
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,327
Now

1497
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:29,375
I didn't say anything or feel

1498
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,471
But now that I'm claiming it

1499
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:38,591
When I was on air

1500
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:40,639
Definitely would never said that

1501
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:47,295
And now it's too late

1502
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,343
I won

1503
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:54,463
I beat you into submission we have that perception of Alex and maybe that's our

1504
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,231
Position

1505
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:57,023
But there's another position and that is Alex

1506
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,327
And that is the key is the light of the world

1507
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:03,935
Him and his buddy are the only option

1508
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,471
We're now the light of the world

1509
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:08,543
This fight against the new world order the fight against the great reset

1510
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:14,687
Does America is in control as we are sometimes

1511
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,759
We're still the best help this planet

1512
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:21,087
Not clutch want to thank you all for your support and keeping us on Arab

1513
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:24,159
We have two more excitable historic time to be alive right now

1514
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:25,951
Actively destroying the world

1515
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:33,375
Our political movement

1516
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,399
If I'm in the man

1517
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,239
Is the span

1518
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:42,079
Because that's how they see it as well

1519
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:44,383
What it is

1520
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:47,711
We're going to come back

1521
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,991
Desperation

1522
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:51,295
When you hear him talking it's Jeff Zucker

1523
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,831
AT&T

1524
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:55,391
Evil Global Corporation

1525
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,463
They had America at the PT but are just now realizing

1526
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,511
Sleeping giant

1527
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,559
Is coming up and separately

1528
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:09,215
We are major awards has to do a lot of the projects were launching

1529
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,519
Black Friday comes early

1530
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,287
We launched

1531
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:15,615
The first two weeks of every November we wanted early this year

1532
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,407
Excitement

1533
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:23,807
Play Black Friday comes early. Lobster call Shirley

1534
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:26,623
I like the defensiveness about like I wasn't

1535
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:34,047
I thought this was a bit player you didn't he did a little baptizing

1536
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:36,351
Maybe you did a little faith healing he wasn't that big of a

1537
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:39,167
Also I like the defensiveness about that

1538
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:42,239
After he says that him and his buddies are the light of the world

1539
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:47,103
John 8:12 says quote I am the light of the world that Jesus speak

1540
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:49,663
Well I mean Jesus was a while back

1541
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:54,527
And now he needs an assist

1542
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:59,135
Osher I little like blasphemy is an issue but I'm not

1543
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,671
Yeah

1544
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:02,207
So Alex

1545
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,511
Complains about Jim Acosta

1546
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,559
A couple of these clips

1547
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:07,327
Just cuz they're like

1548
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,887
What I could take that I could beat the course on this

1549
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:16,287
Omigod omigod it's by Alex Jones

1550
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:27,551
Shelters name which is fun events for a timer

1551
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,343
But

1552
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:32,927
This is the beginning of the review you finally get

1553
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:35,231
It's to his Jim Acosta review

1554
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,511
And I will say

1555
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,583
My review this piece is

1556
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,351
Dorky

1557
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,191
City Pawn

1558
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,471
I think it might be old

1559
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,799
Not surprised it up that's not

1560
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:52,895
Surprising Alex's review is he comes in hot

1561
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:53,663
Here is

1562
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,431
Acosta

1563
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:55,455
Truth

1564
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,759
Is releasing his big

1565
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,551
Blockbuster movie on Monday while the

1566
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:01,855
I've been calling for a sequel to Dune

1567
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:04,927
As in

1568
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,951
Crazy as a loon

1569
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:11,583
I'm crazy and alone all you're going to calls conspiracy theorist

1570
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:13,119
Crazy and white supremacist

1571
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:22,079
Lunatics conspiracy theorist white supremacist me you're about to hear it

1572
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:24,639
Was he

1573
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,431
Was he referencing something

1574
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,199
Tucker said

1575
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:27,967
About

1576
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:28,991
Dune

1577
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:31,039
No it was just trying to

1578
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:33,087
It into something that is kind of

1579
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,647
Culturally relevant right now it's over written

1580
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,463
That's what he was trying that was the point

1581
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,023
The kids are clamoring for a sequel to Dune

1582
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:43,327
But Tucker thought they said loon

1583
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:47,679
That's the joke I thought the Tucker actually said

1584
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:54,335
Made that mistake that seems far more reasonable man writing that I think that you

1585
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,359
B not watch

1586
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:58,687
Enough of these like 24-hour news channels

1587
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,551
I don't know if Alex me to deposit their tours

1588
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:05,343
Respond

1589
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:08,415
How to get a writing job in TV of Jim acosta's got one

1590
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,439
Well I don't know

1591
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,719
You might not write all of the

1592
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,743
He better

1593
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:16,607
I think there's a stash

1594
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,631
Should be fired

1595
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:21,471
He continues with the the dude metaphor also it's not just a one-off

1596
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:28,383
All flags have happened in this country

1597
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,687
One of which may have been January 6th

1598
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,271
Darn

1599
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:37,855
Global domination

1600
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,135
Packer season shop is kind of 8

1601
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,927
Timothee chalamet

1602
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:43,231
The comparisons and there is Tucker

1603
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,023
White wash the whites

1604
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,327
Capitol on January 6th

1605
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:49,375
Anna gets more Sinister than that

1606
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,399
Where is Petaling

1607
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,447
Propaganda

1608
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,239
That the Insurrection was actually a

1609
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,799
Flag operation he has floated this before

1610
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,335
It's ridiculous

1611
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:01,151
Government was ratified

1612
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:06,271
Ridiculous conspiracy theories

1613
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,319
Just like

1614
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:13,183
Caught dealing

1615
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:19,327
Again all the uses of hyperbole all uses words like

1616
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,375
Stupid dumb

1617
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:24,959
LG spiracy Terrace white supremacist

1618
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,519
Oh yeah Alex's

1619
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,799
Complaining about people

1620
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,591
Call I mean

1621
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:36,991
I can't imagine what would happen if he said something about the way Alex looks being similar to a demon

1622
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:43,391
That he would be up in arms about somebody who would throw away basic human decency like that

1623
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:45,183
Here someone looks like a demon

1624
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,487
About level no

1625
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:53,887
Vampire

1626
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:59,007
That's frankly offensive a little anti-semitic I'm going to go there

1627
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,799
Selected according to

1628
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:03,103
Jim Acosta there's no false Flags

1629
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,127
Some other flag

1630
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:05,919
But there are potholes

1631
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,479
Big enough for Alex Jones and drive a monster truck

1632
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,271
Alaska flag

1633
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:15,135
Flags

1634
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:22,559
Did you guys lose the states pieces

1635
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,119
1

1636
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,167
Rebel flag for everything

1637
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:28,703
Thousand American flags

1638
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:32,543
So you're now demonizing a million people that contested election

1639
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:33,823
Because it was a few

1640
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:37,151

Uncle Junior

1643
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,759
I don't think that's all he's

1644
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:42,527
Scott

1645
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:46,111

1648
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,815
Were involved in the writing

1649
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,095
Get Universal

1650
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:58,655
Some of these guys are the Capital One in universal

1651
01:17:59,167 --> 01:17:59,679
KKK

1652
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,591
Almost

1653
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:07,615
K-bus they have

1654
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,175
Is led by the FBI

1655
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:13,247
And the FBI goes and creates the plan grow

1656
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,551
And then advertisers and then pays

1657
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,831
Short bus

1658
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,855
Literally

1659
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:19,647
What

1660
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:23,231
Of course they're Works 7 White

1661
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:23,999
Scribs

1662
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:27,071

Democratic Party

1664
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:33,983
This is kind of how you know Alex is ripping this and kind of freestyling

1665
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:40,383
Is because he was like oh yeah he's bad at the Confederate flag that's all he's got and then immediately there's

1666
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,407
There's a point about

1667
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:45,759
How the January 6th committee has released seven

1668
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,551
Supremacist white nationalist group

1669
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:53,439
Edit order to that's exactly counter to what I was saying

1670
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,487
Is that all the KKK are fake

1671
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,535
Are all the FBI

1672
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:08,287

On whatever thing he thinks he can

1674
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,871
Whatever thing is like a hold on the rock

1675
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:18,271
Call Matt work

1676
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,551
Little bit off on that

1677
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:26,207
Finding Nemo is popular amongst the kids but Trump is finding Nero

1678
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:30,815

Grapes

1680
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:34,143
There's no kind of fun do you want to try one

1681
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:34,911
No

1682
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:38,239
I get I get I get the enjoyment in it

1683
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,263
A little fun

1684
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:52,319
This is going to be your version of my Clips where Alex says damn

1685
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:57,439
Navigate me to credibly enjoyable I hope you have a lot of fun with

1686
01:19:57,695 --> 01:20:02,559
I'm not doing it anymore I'm not doing it anymore feel free to

1687
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:05,119
I'm never going to go to bed and defend

1688
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:09,983
That style of writing for a new piece

1689
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:16,384
It is very cringe-worthy United States

1690
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,408
F****** government

1691
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,176

1697
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:31,232
Doodle boy like Lulu

1698
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:37,120
Alex

1700
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,192
Creeped me out

1701
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,520
A republic

The New World Order

1706
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,880
He grew up in the family

1707
01:20:59,136 --> 01:20:59,648
But

1708
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,000
Red

1709
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:05,280
Well

1710
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:07,328
His family's own goodness

1711
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,120
My world

1712
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,264
Or was it nice like his dad

1713
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:19,104

How do I know that

1717
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,808
Well Tucker told me that to my face

1718
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,856
Show me other people

1719
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,184
You got to stop being naive

1720
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,720
Call Bednar

1721
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,024
Admit how much trouble we're in

1722
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:39,840
I recognize who our enemies are

1723
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,376
Stop

1724
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:42,656
Listening to

1725
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,192
Stop even debating

1726
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,472
Where I am

1727
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:47,776
Breaking my

1728
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:48,544
Phone

1729
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:49,568
Rule here

1730
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,128
That is giving it

1731
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:53,920
To the system

1732
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:57,248
It's Alex in Breakers rule because

1733
01:21:57,504 --> 01:22:03,648
CNN said his name every time

1734
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,928
Anyone says his name

1735
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:06,720
On Twitter for a while

1736
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:08,000
It's so annoying

1737
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:08,768
He breaks

1738
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:10,816
Everything we're not

1739
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:17,216
We're not talking about anything in the news here's what they

1740
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:19,776
Brandeis

1741
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:21,312
That's what I'm here for

1742
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:23,360
Other thing too though is that like

1743
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:24,640
Alex doing this

1744
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:25,920
Is weird soft taco

1745
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:27,200
Ramble about

1746
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,736
How great talker is in his

1747
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:29,760
Family and all this

1748
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:32,320
How do I know cuz you told me

1749
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,600
I think that

1750
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:34,624
Anytime Alex

1751
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,392
Reports

1752
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:38,208
On something based on something somebody else has told him

1753
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:40,256
You should know that he's an idiot

1754
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:42,304
And you gullible as hell

1755
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,888
He's the guy who hung out with Steve pieczenik for like 20 years

1756
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,936
He's a guy who got duped

1757
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:49,472
By Rodger Stone

1758
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:55,872
This is not a guy who has a good b******* radar do you know how I know that rich people

1759
01:22:56,128 --> 01:23:02,272
Orr betters and should be in charge and are absolutely looking out for us I guess you're not going to say because rich people

1760
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:05,088
That I needed actually is because rich people told me that okay

1761
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:10,720
Yeah and I believe how could you not believe them damn sure how could they like

1762
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:17,120
You can't get rich by lying they say they're better people so they wouldn't lie

1763
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:23,520
Actually interesting will you bring bring that up cuz Alex also is incapable

1764
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:36,576
All I can do shoot straight I can't even control myself and I don't want to tell the

1765
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:43,232
Can't even lie

1766
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:45,280
She physically can't lie all my

1767
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,584
Why did I see

1768
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,864
Pink parody is even pause

1769
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,144
Possible it's not

1770
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,960
What kind of idiot am I at

1771
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:55,520
Charlie Brown Lucy faulhaber

1772
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:56,544
Every time

1773
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,104
They're running at that football

1774
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,432
So also something that keeps happening much like you getting dupe

1775
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,968
By trying to be

1776
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:07,552
Spiracle

1777
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:10,112
Another thing that keeps happening is that whatever Allen

1778
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:12,160
Watch breaks his own Rule and does these

1779
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:12,928
Coverage

1780
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:14,208
The things away

1781
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,000
Pops up in it joke

1782
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:18,048
He gets kind of bored once

1783
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:23,680
Once they get past the part where his name comes up

1784
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,240
Listen to it

1785
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:31,104
Not wrong is that all this is not plot holes big enough you can drive and Alex

1786
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,896
Downsize monster truck through

1787
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:38,528
Definition of faith

1788
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,600
What holes are your claim

1789
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:47,744
I just kind of runs out of gas cuz he's not involved anymore on the argument to the

1790
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:51,584
The content is I know you are but what am I

1791
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,352
EXO

1792
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,632
Once you've lost that purr

1793
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:54,912
Personal grievance you don't have

1794
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:58,240
Yeah you try to make the impersonal personal

1795
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,800
Here is

1796
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:01,824
I think this is Elias

1797
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,616
Sklep actually of the Acosta

1798
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,384
The coverage

1799
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:06,176
People

1800
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:08,736
Are using

1801
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:09,504
And that's your fire

1802
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,272
Weapons

1803
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,832
Country

1804
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,624
You see people walking around and take

1805
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:18,976
All of them by the way ramerica

1806
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:23,584
Tucker has already described the insurrectionists as Taurus

1807
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:25,632
So they were just tourists while also

1808
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:26,400
Carrying out a

1809
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,680
False flag attack on the

1810
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:29,984
You can't have it both ways

1811
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,264
Pause again

1812
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:34,592
You can't have it both ways you little liar

1813
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,384
Are you take a 10-second clip

1814
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:39,456
5 minutes

1815
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:40,992
I watch the hookah do something

1816
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:43,296
No shows

1817
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:50,208
He said a very small group of people got roped into a riot

1818
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:52,512
And then the police were ordered to stand down

1819
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,936
Waved in by the police

1820
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:01,472
Neymar fights

1821
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,824
600 people have been arrested

1822
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,872
Over 400 were non-violent

1823
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:10,432
Some of them are still in jail in solitary confinement

1824
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,968
That's what Tucker was talking to

1825
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:15,040
Try to fall Flags

1826
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:17,600
They tried to make this much more violent than it was

1827
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:23,488
Provocateur groups on record seeing a guy

1828
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,584
It's all on record CNN

1829
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:32,448
I'm sad that way someone did plant two bombs at the RNC and DNC headquarters

1830
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:34,240
Where's the night before January 6th so

1831
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:37,312
If you don't see people with bombs are bayonets in

1832
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,848
The videos of the capitol

1833
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,128
Yeah you might want to look at

1834
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:42,688
Surveillance videos of the FBI's release cuz they're you

1835
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:46,784
Goosebumps also I do appreciate that they are absolutely Taurus

1836
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:53,184
And the police stood aside because they were tired of fighting when you go on vacation and you want to go to a big

1837
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,000
Monument or something like that

1838
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:56,768
Sartorius

1839
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:58,816
Any new fight the cops into submission

1840
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:01,888
Cuz you can't pay

1841
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:03,424
You're whatever animal what if it's closed

1842
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,960
You got beat up enough cops

1843
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:07,008
Apps to where they quit

1844
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:13,408
In order to get those hot dogs

1845
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:14,176
Get out of 50

1846
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:17,248
Peacock was amazing diculous

1847
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:23,136
Also are the antifa leader that Alex is claiming Sienna and paid to go inside things that's Jaden X

1848
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:24,416
Score John Sullivan

1849
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,952
CNN did pay him first

1850
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:29,792
Some footage that he got inside the capital which is actually the exact same thing but Alex

1851
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:30,560
The staff did

1852
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:32,352
If it satisfies the climate

1853
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:34,144
It's getting paid him to incite a riot then

1854
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,424
And so did Alex

1855
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:42,336
That was just trying to claim that he had like 40 and people men behind him to burn down the capitol

1856
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:48,480
I control whatever you don't have a government willing to do anything to

1857
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:53,600
To correct a violent overthrow of the government they're going to make up stories and then try it again

1858
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:56,160
Did do something

1859
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,232
Locks

1860
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:00,256
In order to punish the

1861
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:01,024
These people

1862
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:05,632
Just people

1863
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:10,752
The people that got robbed

1864
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:14,080
Pelosi's dad for Drinker beer

1865
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,640
You gave Democrats

1866
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:19,968
Charges dropped burning down Federal Building

1867
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:23,040
You let them go

1868
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:24,320
You got to let somebody go for

1869
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,392
Especially when he's been in solitary confinement

1870
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,184
I think that sentence served

1871
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,024
Okay

1872
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:39,424
No one should on Nancy Pelosi's desk on January 6th

1873
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,192
Capital piston

1874
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,472
S*** wherever they wanted

1875
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,752
Electrocuted mess behind

1876
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:45,568
In addition to that a guy named Eric jancar

1877
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,360
Who was part of the storming of the building

1878
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,896
He claimed that in his defense

1879
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:49,664
America

1880
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,968
Considered shooting on Nancy Pelosi's desk

1881
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:57,344
Although people were chanting for someone to do so someone

1882
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,392
Also I think it's a little bit

1883
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:01,184
Before

1884
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,744
September 2020 if I recall correctly

1885
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,560
Some YouTuber s*** on Nancy Pelosi's driveway

1886
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:09,120
This just gets mixed up in

1887
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,144
Conflated

1888
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,472
Alex has turned it into some guy s*** on Nancy Pelosi's desk

1889
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:17,824
Solitary confinement for 8-ball print the legend buddy

1890
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,360
Listen

1891
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:21,664
If you sit on Nancy Pelosi's desk

1892
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,944
You do get some respect

1893
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,736
Formation

1894
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:27,040
As long as you don't try and overthrow the country

1895
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:30,112
Grape you in

1896
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,136
So Alex

1897
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:35,744
There's actually one more clip here I believe in relation to the cost

1898
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:41,376
It has to do with the Costco rightly pointing out that hey guys

1899
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,400
Trump was president

1900
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,936
When that happens

1901
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:45,472
And Alex

1902
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:46,496
Zakk Wylde what movie was

1903
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,032
Bbbb

1904
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,080
As well

1905
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,616
Which is a reminder that

1906
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:52,640
Oh yeah

1907
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:55,968
This alleged false flag operation

1908
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:00,832
Shut off no one was even

1909
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:01,856
Advice

1910
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:04,672
The trash

1911
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:08,000
99% of his staff or left

1912
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:10,048
Pyramid threatened by people

1913
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:15,168
So now Trump was in charge for 10000 National Guard

1914
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,448
The Democratic Party

1915
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,216
Refuse them

1916
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:23,104
Threatened

1917
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:28,480
Totally tried to request troops but was blocked is actually the exact opposite

1918
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:32,320
Military times

1919
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:33,600
Precise timeline it is

1920
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:40,512
On December 31st 2020 DC mayor Muriel Bowser extended a request an invitation to the National Guard to come helps

1921
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:41,536
Support local police

1922
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,304
In the

1923
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:46,656
Several hundred troops did respond to they were posted in DC but

1924
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:47,936
They couldn't work

1925
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,216
With the Capitol Police

1926
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:52,032
Specifically they were not allowed to work on federal property

1927
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:54,336
Without approval from the Capitol Police

1928
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:57,408
Score outside the jurisdiction of Mayor Bowser

1929
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,688
I did not

1930
01:30:58,944 --> 01:30:59,456
Approve that

1931
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,736
The federal issue

1932
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,272
That is Trump's purview

1933
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:06,368
If the Capitol Police had appropriately coordinated with local law

1934
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:08,160
National Guard troops would have been there

1935
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,184
They failed to do so

1936
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,000
I guess the bucket

1937
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,536
Don't stop anywhere Corvallis

1938
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:15,328
That's that's something that like

1939
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,936
Over there

1940
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:22,496
Kitchen Nightmares in 24 hours to hell and back

1941
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:24,800
The Gordon Ramsay show where he goes in the fine

1942
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:27,872
Small businesses that are struggling and they're about to fall apart

1943
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:29,152
Maddie tries to help him out

1944
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:30,432
Enough love that show

1945
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:32,224
I love it when a business gets help

1946
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:36,320
And it's very funny to me that they can make a lot of

1947
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:39,904
It's very funny to me that they can make a show about it

1948
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:43,232
Because every episode is essentially the exact same thing

1949
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:45,280
Gordon Ramsay goes in there and he says

1950
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:46,048
Hey

1951
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:47,584
Do you want to run a good restaurant

1952
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,120
Professionalism and accountability

1953
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:53,216
That's literally it like generally ultimately

1954
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:55,008
Professionalism and accountability

1955
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:56,032
And the

1956
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:57,568
It's so obvious

1957
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:58,848
Once you like

1958
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:00,896
Just hear him continue repeating that like

1959
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:01,664
Oh

1960
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:06,784
Does somebody continuously blame other people for ship

1961
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,064
They're probably the problem

1962
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:10,880
Yeah yeah there's a there's a trend

1963
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:15,744
Sometimes things are other people's fault and there are other people's problems

1964
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:21,376
Constantly somebody else's problem always somebody else's fault

1965
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:27,776
When you're the president of the f****** United States and it's somebody else's fault guess what

1966
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:32,128
You my beautiful be the problem

1967
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:33,152
So Alex

1968
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:34,944
People have been enjoying

1969
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,272
Jeff Foxworthy's okay I'm not going to do it

1970
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:43,392
I want you to I don't want you to come except I'm sort of

1971
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:45,696
Pleasant roasted in this Jim Acosta piece

1972
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:46,720
Because again

1973
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:47,744
He is only mentioned

1974
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:52,096
Free right now

1975
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:53,120
Gets distracted by big

1976
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,144
Covid news

1977
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:59,520
I've got some big covid-19 news but I tend to start the shows with that

1978
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:02,080
So I'm in the in the broadcast next segment weather

1979
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:08,480
Infowars

1980
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:14,880
Alex Jones Show on your mind

1981
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:22,304
Positive

1982
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:24,864
Covid-19

1983
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:29,472
Hospitalized or die

1984
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:34,080
So yeah Jen sake White House Press

1985
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:35,104
She up to

1986
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:36,640
I am tragic

1987
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:39,456
I don't know if this is

1988
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,736
Big breaking news

1989
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:41,760
It's a minute snooze

1990
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:48,928
Are also that British thing is just that Gregory support we talked about in the in a previous episode that I totaled

1991
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:49,696
Bulshit

1992
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,488
But yeah great

1993
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:57,376
Weird noises of how you can tell devil-worshipers

1994
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:02,240
How they make sure they come in contact

1995
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:07,872
The jump through portals

1996
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:09,920
It's it's so crazy how you

1997
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:12,480
You can tell when someone's weird noises

1998
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:19,648
Fugitive didgeridoo did seem like he was trying to make this sound of the music

1999
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:24,512
But what he did decide to make a sound like a

2000
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:25,536
Didgeridoo

2001
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:32,192
That's my version of constipation

2002
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:38,336
That's the problem it wasn't a bad pun about something terrible in pop culture

2003
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:41,408
Alex

2004
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,992
Have some claims about Jim Acosta about how bad he is

2005
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:46,016
Another there now

2006
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:46,784
Not accurate

2007
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:52,672
How do you suck a monster Guinea runs around event

2008
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:59,328
He personally runs around internet he's just

2009
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:00,096
Horrible

2010
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,192
He's riding League was in the CNN that you know said

2011
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,472
Trump

2012
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:07,520
Junior butt

2013
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:09,056
5 years ago

2014
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:21,344
CNN did that in

2015
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:24,672
Acosta's in League with that I don't know how

2016
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:26,720
Is necessarily

2017
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:28,512
Something to Jim Acosta dead

2018
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:30,048
Also another problem is

2019
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:33,632
That they reporting on that story

2020
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:35,168
To do very

2021
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,728
It's a retraction automate

2022
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:44,128
Porting on that that wasn't done by Sienna and that was actually done by Z

2023
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:44,896
Zeke Miller

2024
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:45,920
4 hour timer

2025
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:48,736
So Alex is mixing those things out because who cares

2026
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:51,296
It doesn't really matter really

2027
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:54,880
Nope nope so what are the things that I think is really troubling

2028
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:56,160
In the recent

2029
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:56,928
Past

2030
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:57,952
Was

2031
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:58,720
That clip

2032
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:03,072
From a turning point USA meeting

2033
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:04,096
Where someone asked

2034
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:05,120
Charlie Kirk

2035
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:06,912
What time does

2036
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:08,192
The time start using the gun

2037
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:14,592
Elections are we going to let them see that you're alright

2038
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:20,480
That you so clearly are teasing us with because you're trying to Griff but I'm not smart enough to figure that out so here we are

2039
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:23,296
So Alex is very predictable

2040
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,064
In his discussion

2041
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:27,904
This he says that the person who asked a question with a plant

2042
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:34,304
Are all the people who called him asking the same question plant

2043
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:38,912
Answer the question well

2044
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:41,472
But Alex would have gone a little bit differently

2045
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:45,056
You would have also added some insight meant to now

2046
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:46,080
Got this plant

2047
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:48,896
When do we get to use the gun

2048
01:36:57,344 --> 01:37:00,416
Is all they want to set us up that's their plan that's their overall agenda

2049
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:02,720
Can't wait to watch go battle League when I physical

2050
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:06,048
Which is totally true Bravo kudos to tutor

2051
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:08,864
Continued

2052
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,728
MSNBC sang

2053
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:14,496
We got to take

2054
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:16,288
Got the mother effing white people

2055
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:18,848
That we've got to kill Trump we got a

2056
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:22,176
Kill all these people they're the ones

2057
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:28,064
Thousand times more than I've calling for violence so I would have a response to a question if

2058
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,600
Is it time to start shooting people

2059
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:30,624
I would have

2060
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:37,024
Ronin a bunch more stuff to f*** with people's emotions and make them scared and feel like they're in danger

2061
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:41,888
More likely to use guns while at the same time I say ah to trick

2062
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,704
That they they want to trick you into being offensive

2063
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:48,288
Anything you do violent is defensive

2064
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:49,568
Cuz they're the ones who were superb

2065
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:50,848
Charlie

2066
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:53,408
What you're misunderstanding about answering that question

2067
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,688
Time

2068
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:55,456
Was

2069
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:56,480
I guess

2070
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:58,016
When Timothy McVeigh

2071
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,296
Bok Homa City

2072
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:01,600
We should have been using guns from the beginning

2073
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:05,696
You can't tell people that so you need to say it without saying

2074
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:11,840
You should just say now political exactly that's exactly what you should have said better though

2075
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:15,936
So Alex comes from a tradition of deep into communism

2076
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:17,472
Of course all of his

2077
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:19,776
Heroes and role models are Dum Dums

2078
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:21,056
Right

2079
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,848
They're cold war holdouts in

2080
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:26,432
And even anti-communism as another metaphor for

2081
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:28,480
Another euphemism for just

2082
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:30,272
Right right

2083
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:34,368
When I say I don't mean someone who's supposed to

2084
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:38,720
Chicago sort of a tradition

2085
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:40,000
Babe

2086
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:42,304
It has tendrils all over the place

2087
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:45,888
Yeah conspiratorial mindset definitely

2088
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:49,472
That links up with all kinds of historical Frameworks

2089
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:53,568
Spit blood libel be at the protocols of the Elders of Zion

2090
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:56,640
All these sorts of conceptions about the New World Order

2091
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:59,200
If the Illuminati right

2092
01:38:59,456 --> 01:38:59,968
Uses

2093
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:00,736
Opposition

2094
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:01,760
The communism as a man

2095
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:06,624
Who is

2096
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:09,184
Against social welfare programs

2097
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:11,232
Against

2098
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,000
Bob Wright

2099
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:16,864
Four people in minorities disenfranchised group

2100
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,216
I think you can I think it might be able to do a little better than that

2101
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:24,288
I do think this could be

2102
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,360
Something of a mislead a misleading name

2103
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:30,688
I do recognize that I thought about that for a while and terms of like

2104
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:31,712
How I frame

2105
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:34,016
Thanks I mean

2106
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:37,088
I think there's a more precise term I agree

2107
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:40,928
I wasn't criticizing your uses

2108
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:41,696
But yeah

2109
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:43,744
That that is just such a

2110
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,512
Great

2111
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:49,120
Brilliant and accepted way for them to get away with saying we're White supremacists

2112
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,400
At everybody

2113
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:53,472
Just being like well they come from an anti-communist tradition of

2114
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:54,240
Just like

2115
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:58,592
They come from a we should Blacklist the Jews tradition where they come from

2116
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:01,408
What black people shouldn't be allowed to drink from the same water fountain

2117
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:06,528
Extradition you don't understand why but only because they don't want black people to drink the water fountain

2118
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:07,552
Riot States right

2119
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:12,416
It's the rebel flag there's nothing wrong with the rebel

2120
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,952
Flag Day

2121
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:15,232
Who do I bring this up

2122
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,000
Because

2123
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:18,304
What are the

2124
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,840
Hallmark's

2125
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:22,400
Particularly of the early anti-communist Folk

2126
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:23,424
Is

2127
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:25,728
Severe red-baiting

2128
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:31,104
In Russia

2129
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:33,664
Apparently though Alex has one of these

2130
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:39,296
Neo anti-communist

2131
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:41,088
Let me just get this out there right now

2132
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,672
Power structure

2133
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:46,720
Globally is is Beyonce

2134
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:49,792
America

2135
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:54,912
Sold out American power to build up Commons China

2136
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:56,448
Polygon with

2137
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:57,984
Corporate Alberto,

2138
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:00,032
But now the Communist Chinese have double

2139
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:00,800
Crosstown

2140
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:03,872
What are Samurai

2141
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:07,712
Just like you want

2142
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:10,016
Screw you

2143
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:13,088
I thought you were mad about the genocide

2144
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,232
And then you've got

2145
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:21,536
Russia out from under the New World Order

2146
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:23,328
They got their own problems not not

2147
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:26,912
Romanticizing that but they're definitely not Hollywood

2148
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:31,264
Got all that going on you got the Midwest

2149
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:34,848
All over the world

2150
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:36,896
Leaving people on the West Coast

2151
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:41,504
We're winning

2152
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:44,064
A world ID vaccine passport

2153
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:44,832
Carbon taxes

2154
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,624
Because they're getting their ass handed to him

2155
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,392
Now

2156
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,952
Now the power structure works

2157
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:55,584
Talking about how we're starting to win the fight

2158
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:00,192
Thought we were already dead

2159
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:02,496
I mean

2160
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:04,800
It just it

2161
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:09,664
Disorienting and then also just feed the the framework that he lives in now we're like

2162
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,968
China and Russia are the good ones

2163
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:15,296
Omar is really bizarre

2164
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:16,576
It is kind of like

2165
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:19,904
What he thought was supposed to happen with 9/11

2166
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:22,976
I'm coming you know like they're making you afraid of foreign enemies

2167
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:26,304
To bring that home

2168
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,328
Is tradition

2169
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,888
Is to make you afraid of foreign enemies

2170
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:32,448
And now you bring it back home and you should

2171
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:36,288
You just be afraid of anyone in the world in a densely populated urban center

2172
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:38,336
Yeah

2173
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,872
Now there's something to that

2174
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:43,200
Alex plays a clip

2175
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:44,736
The show but before he does

2176
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:46,528
He wants you to know

2177
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:47,552
That the globalist

2178
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:51,392
The same people who ran Obama

2179
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:52,672
Play run by

2180
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:54,208
I mean

2181
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:55,744
The distinction between the

2182
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,536
That's nice yeah

2183
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:02,144
Same people that control Obama are the ones that are controlled by

2184
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:06,496
Bagatelle Obama because he's so evil and so hateful and

2185
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,592
The Star Chamber tribunal level

2186
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:12,640
He's actually in there with the top global

2187
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:13,920
What's an otter album

2188
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:15,712
Oh, is that the table

2189
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:16,736
Stop.

2190
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,296
Plus I'm grandma

2191
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,368
Bill Gates

2192
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,184
Warren Buffett

2193
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:28,768
All those people at the table we got the.

2194
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:35,680
They decided the world belongs to them and they've all got a lot to literally depopulate you and your family

2195
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:38,752
Virus 1000 times worse than covid-19

2196
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:42,336
And let them March you

2197
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:46,944
Or you going to wake up and wake others up and say hell no

2198
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:48,480
I'm not going down your rattle

2199
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:52,832
Looks like Alex is doing his job of trying to incite people that sounds about right

2200
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:55,648
So I'd like those document

2201
01:43:56,160 --> 01:44:00,256
About the people at the table exactly

2202
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,280
All I want

2203
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:02,560
What are the

2204
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:07,168
Huge hundred people and people with big old ego

2205
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:12,800
Yeah they're not going to be sitting cramped at that table eating with only 14

2206
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:13,824
No no

2207
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:20,224
I would like those documents because I've heard a lot of different things about the relative position of Bill Gates over the course

2208
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:26,368
How does this work with the

2209
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:32,768
Team of 12 group within the hundred

2210
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:36,864
Or is it even is there another hierarchy within the hierarchy I guess there's like

2211
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:40,448
88 people who are at the main table

2212
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:45,824
Like the Kids Table adults the Council of twelve sitting over there

2213
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:46,848
Straight

2214
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:47,616

01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:49,152

AMV

2217
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:54,016
The people who are at the Kids Table they don't get wine

2218
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:55,296
See this room saying

2219
01:44:55,552 --> 01:45:00,928
About the table that's unfair

2220
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:03,232
Does Obama get to tell joke

2221
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:04,768
Obama

2222
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:06,304
Got to this table of 100

2223
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,608
Just cuz he hates America so much

2224
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:09,632
When

2225
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:12,192
When are you

2226
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:17,568
I would argue that there's a lot of people hate America

2227
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:23,456
I should be at that table if that is the prerequisites like Tyrion either you running

2228
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:30,624

2229
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,648
Married

2230
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,416
Discussion

2231
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:33,440

2232
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:39,584
