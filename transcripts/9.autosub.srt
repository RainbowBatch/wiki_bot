I think you look sexy with me

24
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:18,592
I got to check the statistics of every download some occupied Texas

25
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,992
It's not like Austin it is occupied.

26
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:32,672
Yeah there's no doubt that digital drop box office

27
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,464
For the first time

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,048
Is the show where I listen to way too much Infowars Alex Jones

29
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:38,816

Explore A Day in the Life of Alex

32
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
What

33
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:03,392
For the longest time Joe Rogan has been trying to get Alex Jones on his podcast

34
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,928
You can't because

35
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Austin

36
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
Like to do Skype call

37
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,120
Call Sophie

38
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,936
And lo and behold it was her episode 911

39
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,472
Of course

40
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
Horse

41
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,568
Joe brings italics

42
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,200
And join them along for the ride is a young man by the name of

43
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
Eddie Bravo

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,528
Eddie Bravo martial arts

45
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,856
Instructor and all-around with all due respect

46
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
Totally

47
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,488
You could beat my ass like a rented mule

48
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,536
I have no doubt about that.

49
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,096
Call martial arts

50
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
Instructors

51
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,472
But I'm also saying that all Idiots Are Marshall

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,264
I believe that's how that works

53
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,784
Come on man

54
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,184
Like you really believe the Chemtrails we've been listening to Alex Jones and this guy to you is the first time you're like

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,024
Come on man I have a special relationship about

56
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,864
Connected or energy

57
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:25,312
Like the

58
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
I wonder if

59
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:30,432
He felt something weird the day I was born

60
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
Pictures like a premonition

61
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,576
208

62
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,904
Just like that old gypsy woman said that he would be taken down

63
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,488
Cross-eyed dick hole in the Chicago

64
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,792
Specific

65
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,472
Sweet cakes

66
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,568
Eddie believes in like Chemtrails super into that

67
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,664
And also apparently doesn't believe in dinosaurs

68
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:07,808
Maybe not totally of a headlock total any beliefs

69
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,392
That's what I do I don't know that for sure conversation should

70
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
Stop in determining somebody

71
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
Idiots

72
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,607
Studied Eddie Bravo so I don't know if that's for sure but they bring it up a couple times on the episode

73
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
A little bit

74
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,983
But you have that like

75
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,847
Six-year-old boy phase of liking dinosaurs

76
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:35,711
Stegosaurus

77
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Not real

78
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
Here's

79
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,391
I overheard a conversation at work the other day

80
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
And this guy was like

81
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,743
I'm not sure if I believe in dinosaurs

82
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,887
If that was a non sequitur that's the best thing to hear

83
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,703
If I was just writing on the trailer

84
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,751
Woke up like The Manchurian Candidate

85
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:05,151
Just like dinosaurs

86
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,199
A lot of people who don't believe in dinosaurs

87
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,503
Believe it like Jews bury the bones

88
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,599
And so you know that like a lot of the anti dinosaur stuff is

89
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
Is antisemitic

90
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,487
Nothing that isn't pinned on the Jews

91
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
Nope literally everything

92
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
Literally every

93
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,071
Yeah

94
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,655
Dep the media

95
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,567
Why do they have to make us like that I don't know

96
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
It's so f******.

97
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:41,759
So the show starts out on a boring note

98
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,783
Because Alex

99
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,855
He wants to make his presence felt

100
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
So

101
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,927
They start the show off

102
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,719
And the first clip I'm going to play is

103
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,279
I would I would call the first lie

104
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,631
First lie and exaggeration

105
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,447
That is the new segment of our show

106
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:06,079
This one is about Alex Jones assertive

107
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
Political leaning

108
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,887
George Bush jr.

109
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:35,775
And you were always against the power structure the media

110
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:50,111
President

111
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
What's up

112
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,327
You said we were going to do the first lie

113
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,119
I believe we're on lies

114
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,935
One through 44 right now

115
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,055
Does he think

116
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,591
The Communist Chinese

117
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,895
Saudi Arabia are all working

118
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
Gathering

119
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
Absolutely

120
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,503
Or does he think they're individual actors

121
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,599
All of them coming to the same conclusion

122
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
Then drop

123
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,671
Then Alex and Trump

124
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,719
Two of them

125
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:30,559
Yeah I think what he would say is that they're not Nessa

126
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,351
Sara Lee working in concert but it's

127
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
Some enemy of my enemy is my friend

128
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,727
For a dollar

129
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,287
Not more

130
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
Yes

131
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,151
Southside

132
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:03,071
Because

133
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,127
Hillary and Obama

134
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
What's up

135
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,999
Where did he lose you

136
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
How

137
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,815
Breakfast he is on

138
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
Somebody else

139
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,167
The show

140
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,519
Barrage of nonsense

141
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,127
The same as social engineering is that like a

142
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,687
Of course

143
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:55,807
He wants real Prosperity not social engineering and I don't know how it is those things are related

144
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:01,439
They're not really but they aren't his social engineering

145
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,231
He's trying to keep us poor

146
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,583
The social Engineers are doing things for our advantage

147
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,143
They want a dumbass down they want to make us

148
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,447
Pay too much in taxes

149
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
All this stuff

150
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,311
Why and how

151
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
Super Bowl Li

152
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:31,391
How far you have I believe it's Super Why

153
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,975
Before out as I was using metric

154
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:41,375
Social engineering right one of these social engineers

155
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,959
Let's go through this all right you're poor now

156
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,031
Oh god dammit I'm pouring out how does that

157
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
Cuz I'm not you

158
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,687
Fremont

159
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,223
Then your loss is my gain

160
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,015
What's the Celtics score

161
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,575
I mean is the engine is in the hole

162
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,135
Why are we having

163
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:08,511
Quit never one of them already game we had a lot today

164
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:15,167
That was us intelligence

165
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,799
New York congressman

166
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
I said

167
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:36,415
Yakima computer

168
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,327
So this is the direction that goes we're going

169
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:51,263
This idea that he predicted or he had sources the told him Anthony Weiner was going to get arrested for child

170
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,079
That's like him saying he predicted 9/11

171
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,383
Feels like everyone knew something was coming

172
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,991
Ever since they found

173
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,551
We looked on

174
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,111
Humans computer affordable

175
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
New emails

176
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,487
Yeah we're looking on her computer was to find out if he had

177
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
Pictures of that underage

178
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,655
That's what the child

179
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,239
That's that's what the article say

180
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
16

181
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,127
11 stroker kit

182
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,431
Nachos

183
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,479
17 + 1/2

184
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,575
To me and I'm not saying

185
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
This law is bad

186
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
But I think

187
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,463
It's a little bit weird about

188
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
Support child

189
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,815
I'm not I don't know what has a prophecy

190
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,399
I'm not at your child for not going on though

191
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,935
Fake news

192
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,775
It is weird

193
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:00,895
Illegal is that there are different

194
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
Use of consent in different states

195
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,295
Federally you know what I mean

196
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
Ginger Alden

197
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
But you can't take pictures of

198
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
That's bizarre.

199
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,719
But it's bizarre

200
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,743
I don't think

201
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:20,351
If there's any part of any of those laws that isn't bizarre at any given point

202
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
Human history

203
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,679
There's no doubt

204
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
Human beings

205
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,495
Especially Anthony Weiner

206
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,055
Especially God he was so good

207
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
For so long

208
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,687
He did good things the problem is

209
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
Who doesn't

210
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,183
I don't think that's other stuff

211
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:50,559
Yeah it's all that other stuff that really bums me out

212
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,863
During his time in government

213
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,655
He was kicking ass for good people

214
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,703
It did seem that what he was doing

215
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
But

216
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
We now end up

217
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
In the murky Waters

218
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,151
Something I hope we never have to talk about

219
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:12,575
Time baby first 40 minutes of the show they talk about

220
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Pizzagate

221
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
And it

222
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
So

223
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Bucked up

224
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
Cuz here's why

225
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
What video wrestling

226
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,535
Joe also Joe Rogan

227
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
Alex Jones

228
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,399
Are all struggling with the fact that pedophilia is

229
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,751
Like

230
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,823
Ascensore in like a is this reality

231
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,431
Sort of baffled by it and because they have to be like

232
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,247
Now it's listening this is real

233
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:49,183
Make discovered pedophilia no but they think that no one else believes it's real

234
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,231
Or whatever everyone else

235
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Whitewash

236
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,583
I think that's the number one fear for literally every parent

237
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,119
On the planet right now

238
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,655
Parents so it makes sense

239
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:04,799
Yeah it's fine but I don't think anybody doesn't know about good job at all

240
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,919
Tracking from point A to point B where a is the pedophiles exist

241
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,223
And some of them have been high-powered

242
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,063
That does not lead necessarily to

243
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:20,415
There is a ring of pedophiles running the Democratic Party

244
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
And

245
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
All of our staff

246
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,559
Worldview is contingently based

247
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
On

248
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,631
Pedophile blackmail

249
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:36,031
Keeping people in mind and underlying Narrative of everybody's a pedophile

250
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
No no no no

251
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,615
Whoa not getting married

252
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,919
No because I don't want you to pay them in like the

253
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,455
It's not representative

254
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
What he has said

255
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
Is that

256
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,087
Pedophilia is used as blackmail

257
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
So people in power don't get out of line

258
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,951
He has in the past multiple times

259
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,511
Set the powerful

260
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
You have to like

261
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,559
Soccer kid

262
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
In front of the elite

263
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,887
So then they know

264
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
Then you are

265
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,471
You're have no moral

266
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,287
And that you can be trusted and

267
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,079
If you get out of line they've got that on

268
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,151
He said that before on the show

269
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
Yeah so

270
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,991
So let's say I

271
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,063
Run for governor governor

272
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,599
Let's not even called a good steak

273
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,903
Let's call it Rhode Island

274
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,743
Because of Governors houses

275
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,071
Alright I am running for Senator of the

276
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,607
The great state of New Hampshire

277
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
Which has

278
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,935
The population of nobody knows

279
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:47,711
Most of the country lives in New Hampshire most people can't tell the difference between

280
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,551
It's the one that goes down while the other one goes

281
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
How can I help

282
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
I'm running

283
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,095
I'm on the cusp

284
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
Unless they get

285
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
40%

286
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,983
The only way I can get over that last

287
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
Really

288
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:24,575
Control Bureau

289
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,367
Slugworth in Willy Wonka

290
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,207
Everlasting Gobstoppers

291
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,071
People that it stretched out another kid inside the trench coat

292
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
I mean like

293
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,119
I don't want to make light of it

294
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,423
This because it is a horrible thing

295
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
But I believe

296
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,495
Sincerely

297
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,335
Also makes light of the real problem that it

298
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
Exists in the world

299
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,271
Cuz he's using it for political gain and political point

300
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,831
As opposed to treating it as a real

301
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:03,487
Yeah but not least if you are if you are all the time

302
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,047
Then that diminishes the effect of

303
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,839
Actual people who are pedophile

304
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,655
Let's hear a little bit of

305
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
Females that Alex

306
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
Pretty much lies about

307
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:33,183
Okay

308
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
6

309
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,535
$5,000 in hot dogs

310
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,591
Really

311
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,127
How to make a male prostitute

312
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,967
To keep the f****** mouth shut well Cosentino's bad things happen if you don't

313
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:01,343
Federal c********* charges possible for Anthony Weiner

314
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,391
I'm on record months ago

315
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:19,775
Look at 4chan

316
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
What's up

317
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663
You confused

318
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
Fortune

319
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,735
You know what 4chan

320
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
Yeah

321
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,063
A lot of investigators

322
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
Air quotes

323
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
What what's

324
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
Do they know about Fortune

325
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,559
I know he said the words

326
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,887
Yeah he knows it exists right he's heard of it

327
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,983
You haven't gone there

328
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,591
In my experience it's mostly people posting like

329
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,871
Pictures

330
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,455
Graphic pictures and then trying to bully people into killing

331
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,527
Large part of what

332
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,319
There are separate boards

333
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:11,743
B discuss anime and paranormal show

334
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,447
I like how we said that at the same time

335
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
Kentucky

336
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,127
Does look back I don't know if you knew that when you look at it this morning but the

337
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,919
The thing is that a lot of the

338
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
Stuff about the

339
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
The codes

340
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,247
That were used in emails

341
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
A lot of it comes

342
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,855
From quote-unquote researchers on 410 and Reddit

343
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
And now vote

344
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,159
308

345
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,231
See that website

346
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,815
Reddit head over to this

347
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,143
But they talked about

348
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,959
But there was a whole subreddit dedicated

349
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,727
Pizzagate

350
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,007
And then they started dachshund

351
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
10 people

352
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,543
And so

353
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,823
They like your band

354
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,871
We might close this thing down

355
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,639
Play started.

356
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:07,295
In the TV show Heroes

357
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,367
The second season

358
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,927
Actually disagree I think

359
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:19,583
A lot of legs

360
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:25,471
I have no further noblest Faith argument

361
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
Today

362
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,567
The thing is like a lot of the codes

363
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
Were found to be

364
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
Completely made up

365
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,663
A lot of it wasn't based on

366
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
Any

367
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,759
Slang for the world

368
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,135
Well here's the thing that wasn't email but it was

369
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,695
A guy was writing that last

370
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,231
Year Obama ordered

371
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,535
Like pizza and hot dogs from

372
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,303
Chicago

373
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,887
To be flown and it was $65,000 worth for a big event

374
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
Right now

375
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,703
Sure it could have been

376
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,751
F****** gay prostitutes to stuck off

377
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,031
That's possible

378
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:03,359
Also seems like

379
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:07,967
From Chicago it was actually be pizza and hotdogs

380
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,015
We are really weird about

381
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,551
And hotdogs

382
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:15,903
Is something that people

383
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:22,560
Notorious the especially people are plastic you have a way of making hot dogs

384
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,984
Are you saying that he might be ordering those two things from his City that are most

385
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,384
Well known about his Paris and he's ordering

386
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,688
Plan I don't know what's playing

387
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,760

Call David Swan let's go with blonde

389
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,624
Took that that is one of the emails that I think

390
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,648
Really

391
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,952
Probably unfairly

392
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
Misrepresent

393
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,256
I'm baby

394
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,328
Misrepresent

395
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
Flat-out bowls

396
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:00,960
How much leeway as possible in case there's some

397
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:06,848
I don't understand or whatever local b******* food

398
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:11,200
You're going to order pizza from Chicago

399
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:15,296
If you're from Chicago

400
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,112
From Chicago

401
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,160
Chicago

402
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,208
Islamic senator from Maine

403
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,536
Ordering $65,000 of

404
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
Crabs

405
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,376
It's not dirty p****

406
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:35,776
Ordering $65,000 worth

407
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,568
Pizza and hotdogs for men

408
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
Photos are frosted

409
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,784
How do you know if

410
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,832
Well there's that New Haven style pizza

411
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:05,728
Network

412
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,624
Looking for all of us

413
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,440
Joe responds really well to a couple things

414
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,000
But overall I've got to give him a grade of likes

415
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,536
C-

416
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,072
Actually calling

417
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,912
Not true

418
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
I don't know about that

419
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,176
I give Joe way more leeway

420
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,272
You can't know everything

421
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,808
In this particular instance

422
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,856
Joe does not have that

423
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,184
He is a pure this friend entertainment

424
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,464
And this is all like

425
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
He

426
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,072
Cheerleader

427
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,608
That's crazy

428
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,144
Going to say

429
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:14,848
And he is perhaps the only person in our field of vision on the Alex Jones

430
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
Situation

431
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,688
By no means

432
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,456
Himself to be adjourned

433
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:23,040
No. Never once said

434
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,856
You should listen to me because I tell only the truth

435
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,160
I still

436
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,864
Curious and he likes learn

437
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,400
Chupacabra

438
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,704
Yeah I will say that after listening to this like

439
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
3 *

440
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,824
Yeah

441
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,104
Hate Rogan

442
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
I don't think

443
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,920
I don't have I didn't lose

444
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,248
Ton of respect for him but I think what he did was bad

445
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,600
I think having Alex Jones on a platform like that

446
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,880
On his show

447
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,416
Really

448
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,720
Can only serve to humanize him

449
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,768
And really only serve to normalize

450
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,168
Can I pick up a dangerous absolutely

451
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
I don't think

452
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
It's a positive thing

453
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,984
To do

454
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,384
You get this guy on your like

455
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,272
Is going to be like in this

456
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,296
Situation

457
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
You pointed out the

458
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
Jimmy Fallon singing

459
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
100

460
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,000
And then taking another

461
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,328
Another piece of it

462
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
I heard he's a paddle

463
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:46,240
Come on man

464
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,872
There's a lot of people who I think probably would respond to what I'm doing

465
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,408
Why do you care

466
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:57,248
And I care because I was Jones's incredibly relevant

467
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,624
And everyone's ignoring him because he's a joke

468
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,928
Because

469
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,584
Can joke

470
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,120
The country

471
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
But I like

472
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,152
Like to the point that Joe Rogan has a huge audience

473
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,432
Rat King

474
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
With his appeal

475
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,504
Like really

476
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,528
65000

477
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,832
Plus people who were streaming it live

478
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:37,440
And now a day after the day after that if so came out

479
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:44,352
It's been watched over like 1.5 million times on YouTube

480
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,400
A sideshow

481
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,424
I understand that

482
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,008
Alphabet

483
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,336
You are bringing Alex Jones on because you like

484
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:57,408
Looking are weird

485
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,456
Discussion of why

486
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,296
Pizzagate

487
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,344
And Joe being

488
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,368
This is what

489
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,392
This is where Joe Rogan is

490
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
Actually pretty dumb

491
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,976
What the f*** is pizzagate

492
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:16,864
There was this very angry

493
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,888
Did you see

494
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,424
He did

495
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,728
Do you know what he's talking about you

496
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,824
Okay so this local news guy benswann did a story about

497
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,384
It was like about

498
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,944
Justino the broad Strokes

499
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,808
About what people had found on Reddit

500
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
And stuff like that

501
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,112
Okay

502
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,648
People is like a primer

503
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,768
Yeah it's a lot of complaints about it but I'll get to them after the Clippers

504
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,072
Alright

505
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:53,472
And he was making some connections to between that book for child pedophilia

506
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,032
And

507
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:59,360
End

508
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:03,712
He also made

509
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:10,880
Confirm child molester

510
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,184
Important stops

511
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,280
So true that hastert in jail

512
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:22,912
Extruded hamster is a known pedophile that a judge called the serial pedophile

513
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
Is 100%

514
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,264
That's a hundred percent

515
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,544
Yes

516
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:37,504
If you look at it dispense one guy with his

517
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
He's just kind of expressing

518
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,576
What is weird about this

519
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:45,440
And

520
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:51,328
I was kind of shocked people calling him a moron

521
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,912
So people were calling him a moron not because he

522
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
He covered a top

523
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:00,032
Did not adhere to any of the rules of Journalism

524
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,824
When you're doing the story

525
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,360
Yuri

526
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,152
When you're doing the story

527
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,176
You fact check

528
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:06,944
Text thing

529
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,224
And when he did this

530
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,296
Did is regurgitate things that were found

531
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,088
On conspiracy blogs

532
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,880
And on Reddit and vote

533
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,648
And these are two things

534
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,440
Without doing any

535
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,976
Absolutely not

536
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,280
So you're saying that he was a moron

537
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,072
Yeah absolutely

538
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,400
Such a misunderstanding of what journalism

539
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,936
Very hard job

540
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,472
Resume have to

541
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:33,568
You have to you have to try and get people to talk to you

542
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,896
In order to publish something in a mainstream publication

543
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,664
You can't

544
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,456
One source for things

545
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
Yeah

546
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,088
I have friends who are journalists

547
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,112
It's

548
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
Did they do

549
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,672
It's too fake news

550
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:54,816
Here's what I think it is here's what I think it is

551
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
We've got to the

552
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,936
Now where everything is

553
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,704
So

554
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,472
Australian

555
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,496
Lately baffling

556
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,544
Sing to the baby boomer generation

557
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,896
Other Generations

558
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,688
You were the same for like

559
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,736
All the way from your great-grandfather

560
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,504
Your

561
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,808
You pretty much live the same life

562
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,136
Our grandparents went from

563
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,416
Horses

564
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,720
To where now we can

565
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,744
Fly with our feet

566
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,512
Like

567
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,072
Really really quickly

568
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,680
To somebody who is for somebody who is

569
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,616
Let's call that let's call them simple

570
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,688
Okay

571
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,760
So rather than complicate things with

572
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
Multiples

573
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,832
Verifying

574
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,368
You just want a big

575
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,904
Strongman

576
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,744
But I think it even goes

577
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
Dad to our generation

578
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:02,656
Younger too because with the proliferation of the infant how easy it is to set up your own shop

579
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,704
You can just report things

580
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,752
I'm just saying

581
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:10,080
Yeah but that's not exactly a

582
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,640
What's more powerful now

583
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:16,224
You know William Randolph Hearst all the way back down.

584
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,440
Our Generation Now is much better at filter

585
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
That stuff out

586
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,488
Then you might imagine

587
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,328
I want

588
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
Statistically speaking

589
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
Crime is gone.

590
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,472
Everybody stinks

591
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:42,336
The opposite because our personal experience tells us otherwise.

592
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,432
Statistics is bulshit world so I

593
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:50,272
A bad sample

594
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,832
Is an education and all this stuff anyway

595
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,648
Prevailing narrative

596
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:56,928
Mission is always going

597
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,816
The actual

598
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,376
It's always true that generation

599
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,168
Wind up getting better at educate

600
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,984
Yeah it is

601
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,544
It is hard to divorce ourselves from

602
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
That like

603
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,896
Mass is

604
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,176
Map all the time

605
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,456
It's not all the time

606
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,248
It never stops

607
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,648
Talkin about

608
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,728
I never saw that

609
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,056
Seems like poop

610
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,296
Let me know he's referring to an email that does exist

611
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,136
Totally misrepresenting what it says

612
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,720
The lady who sang that these kids will be dropped off

613
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,768
To be looked at

614
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,048
Babysitting

615
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,120
Whatever I

616
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,680
But not as entertainment she says

617
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,240
She's like saying there will be these

618
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,008
Three kids

619
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,312
So you'll be entertained

620
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
And it's like a

621
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,616
Parrot saying like

622
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:20,896
Good luck

623
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,224
I think you're not going to be bored

624
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
Cuz he's kids

625
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,040
Is our ages 7 to 11

626
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,576
The rambunctious as f***

627
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
Right

628
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,696
They said it's interesting how any ATMs that we use

629
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,488
Just like in Daily conversation

630
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,280
If you pull them out of context

631
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:43,680
Is any kind of a ATM looks like

632
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,216
Emailing

633
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,288
They will be in that pool

634
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,824
Which you could take a

635
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,104
All we're going to get those bodies

636
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,200
Or it could be like a swim

637
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,992
Right ever again

638
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:00,320
Look at me in the eye for the next

639
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:04,672
10 minutes after you said that if my parents had email back when I was a kid

640
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:08,000
They would have said something like jam going to be in that pool

641
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,792
I love to swim

642
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:15,680
I loved it and we were too poor dead Dan.

643
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,800
It's fine whatever you want to find wherever you want to fight

644
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,408
Perfect instant and the way that he's lasciviously

645
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,432
Presenting it

646
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:31,040
Misrepresenting him is so f******

647
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:37,952
It doesn't have that ring of disgust to it it has more of that

648
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,792
Tablet ring of like no almost

649
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,656
Quit later when he's like

650
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,936
Almost going into a

651
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:54,080
Yeah where he's talking about like globalist taking your kids out of backyard

652
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:54,848
And then like

653
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,408
It's just a big guy comes up behind them

654
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,480
Punches him in the head like that

655
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,528
It's like a

656
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,856
Timmy is in the original Matrix

657
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,136
Where

658
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,672
They go through that office

659
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:12,256
Lobby and they can shoot everybody up

660
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:18,912
20 minutes of just slow mode

661
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:25,312
Yeah today to discuss that other than the second every moment

662
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,664
Lovingly you like just

663
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,432
Master

664
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,712
Vader mask

665
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:35,040
The differences in there was sort of like

666
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,064
An interesting artistic

667
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,344
Thing they were doing

668
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,368
And in this case

669
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:43,488
Alex is just trying to convince you of things that aren't true

670
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,328
Where your you're turning it into a fantasy

671
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,352
You're turning this

672
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,888
Horrifying things

673
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,960
People being shot again and again

674
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
This

675
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,568
Oh yeah you know you don't

676
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,040
Two things that Alex is good at

677
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,832
One of them

678
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,904
Slander laws

679
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,208
Is

680
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,488
Completely contradicting

681
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,256
Himself

682
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,840
In this club

683
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,888
Now be careful because the

684
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,656
Second part

685
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
Microphone.

686
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,112
Megyn Kelly went on and took a cliff

687
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,184
Hillary

688
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,312
With me Hillary Clinton kill children

689
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,904
Did will get the Apocrypha

690
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,952
Did that happen

691
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
Not quite

692
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,096
A perfectly honest version of what happened

693
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:24,864
Send was

694
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,936
Is spiritually correct

695
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
And that

696
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,776
He did

697
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,616
I just want to say though first before we talk about that

698
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:40,992
I'm not doing anything

699
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:45,344
If you eat

700
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:52,000
That their c****************

701
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,072
I would never say such a good way to not have to go to court

702
00:37:55,328 --> 00:38:01,472
But the story is that I'm reporting that other people

703
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:05,312
Timezone is episode smart but it also shows

704
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,872
Your cards a little bit and that you don't believe what you're saying

705
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,408
Smart

706
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,712
No it's smart because of

707
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,504
He didn't you could get sued

708
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,808
You open yourself up to

709
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:20,160
Dangerous

710
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,048
Well I mean yeah it's it's

711
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,352
It's self-destructive but it's not smart

712
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,144
Knock knock

713
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
Do this

714
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:35,776
He's not like Dinesh D'Souza

715
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:40,128
Destructive a spot and then the thing about Megyn Kelly

716
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,968
Yeah no doubt

717
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,040
For the 10 millionth time

718
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,320
Okay there's not Isis

719
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,112
Is Al-Qaeda

720
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,184
No no

721
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
Okay

722
00:38:55,232 --> 00:39:00,608
Feel similar if you don't know anything

723
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,632
That is it

724
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,168
Nailed it

725
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,728
But the thing about Megyn Kelly

726
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:07,776
Hatchet

727
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,544
Job

728
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,312
On him

729
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,592
What

730
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,616
Correct in a sentence

731
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,944
Who's my favorite Judy Blume

732
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,480
The thing about Megyn Kelly

733
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,832
Something sort of out of town

734
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,904
So in their piece about pizzagate

735
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,440
But they were doing it about how

736
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,208

00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,024
Internet his sensationalize things that I have you

Alex Jones

740
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,120
He's coming in from break

741
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,144
Atlanta

742
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,800
Gorilla

00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,336
I got a message

744
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,104
Search for Hillary

I'm not afraid of you

00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:53,856
You

00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,392
You know you kill and murder

752
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,184
Hillary Clinton

753
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,208
Who killed

754
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,512
And murdered thousands of children

755
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,304
She's personally raped

756
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
Children

757
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,912

758
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,472
Personally

What you're saying personally

760
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,848
Lexi the person now they cut at the end of that

761
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,176
And then on his show what he ended up saying is

762
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,968
I'm not talking about

763
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,528
This pizzagate kind of stuff

764
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,064
I'm talking about

765
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,112
Her killing Christians and funding

766
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:30,464
Islamic terrorism and stuff like that

767
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,232
To say

768
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:34,816
But what I mean is she did this like

769
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,888
Twice removed through the military or her

770
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,776
It's

771
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,312
It's a tactic

772
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,104
You know it's sensational

773
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,432
Gets people into taking you out of

774
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,736
Ridgeway

775
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,296
Which then give Tim the grievance to act

776
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,344
Like the victim

777
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,368
Yes it's

778
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:03,744
Just like or or Milo complaining that people don't want him to speak on their campus

779
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,560
Cellulitis

780
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,376
Wow that's really blatant

781
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,936
It's Not Butter

782
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:18,336
No I forgot I forgot the

783
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:23,968
I don't have is prepared that well at all

784
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,320
We're going to get to is the rank hypocrisy

785
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,136
On display and Alex admitting to it

786
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
Who cares

787
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:39,328
That's where we watch this where it where is it that they did that. The comparison the two up

788
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,872
Alicia

789
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:55,711
I love you

790
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:01,599
You don't like that you don't think Megyn Kelly's house

791
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:07,999
No

792
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,279
Yeah that's not okay

793
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,047
No

794
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,143
We have Illustrated on multiple occasions the

795
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,911
Credible

796
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,471
She goes to installed her based on her appearance

797
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,751
And all this stuff

798
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,543
Amen

799
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,311
Admitting

800
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,359
Yeah she's really pretty just want to make fun of

801
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:30,015
Know if you wanted any pretenses of Journalism if you want to pretend that you're

802
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,807
Standing up for the truth

803
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,599
And you yourself

804
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:38,719
I'm a bully cuz he's on the other imaginary side that I'm against

805
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:44,095
I think his rationale

806
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,375
At least

807
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,423
If I'm going to try and engage him

808
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,263
Even though

809
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,823
She is a woman in journalism

810
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,359
To him

811
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,639
It feels like punching

812
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,223
Very beautiful woman

813
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,759
She's a very successful woman

814
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,623
She's not psychotic

815
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,903
She's nuts.

816
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:13,791
So she's not relegated into having a business entirely safe

817
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,839
Stone selling fake pills

818
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,399
So to him that must feel like he's

819
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,167
Punching up

820
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,191
Instead of punching

821
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,215
Probably

822
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
Now

823
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,799
Humans is crazy

824
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:30,687
At least understand why you can rationalize that

825
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,711
His own my

826
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,247
Alex doesn't believe in prison

827
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:34,783
So he doesn't

828
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,063
Believe that because he

829
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,599
He's white and male he has any

830
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,879
Any privilege

831
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,183
I do my best

832
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:41,951
Succumb to his

833
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:45,023
Defense you immediately come back with why that is

834
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,047
The dumbest thing I could

835
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:50,399
In his worldview that is

836
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:56,799
Also if you're listening we're 40 minutes into this

837
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,871
Don't turn it off

838
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,151
Cuz at the end

839
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:05,247
F***** up are you telling our audience to turn it off

840
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,295
I'm getting self-conscious

841
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,087
Two and a half hours

842
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,975
Alright how about we do this

843
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,791
F******

844
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,583
Run the jewels

845
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,119
Let's try

846
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,959
Okay this next clip where it we've now got out of the murky Waters of pizza

847
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,519
The gate and we are getting into

848
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,567
Something about

849
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,151
A man

850
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,967
About the Iraq War

851
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,759
Anna and Afghanistan

852
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,575
I would save this is about Ally

853
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:46,975
Weird

854
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:21,023
They're not going

855
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:31,775
Production

856
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:45,855
And then look at the latest 2014-15

857
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,463
The 7%

858
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:58,911
Look at the ha

859
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,679
Memory

860
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:05,055
The reason that's a lie about a lie is that I don't think that most liberals

861
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,615
Deny that at all

862
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,663
No the idea that

863
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,199
There is a real

864
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:17,855
Weird thing going on with opium production

865
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,183
Weird at all

866
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,255
Absolute result of demolishing a country

867
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:28,607
Also Auto

868
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:32,703
Switch to something that they can do without any f******

869
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:36,287
Of course and we seem to have a vested interest in

870
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,311
Protecting

871
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
And helping it

872
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,639
A little bit weird

873
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,783
Most liberal people that I know most

874
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,831
People on our side of the fence

875
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:54,207
I don't know why we all know there's only one real

876
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,487
Alex Jones

877
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:58,815
But then also the lie about the it went

878
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,839
From 3%

879
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,119
Lights to ninety seven percent

880
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,959
33%

881
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,007
Jessica taken from when we were

882
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
Invading

883
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
Destroyed everything

884
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,359
Yeah

885
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,127
Easy to do

886
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:15,455
All your bones do all the stuff

887
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:21,087
Super easy if you look at the graphs of the percent of opium production so it's like flat

888
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,671
Like what year and then facts

889
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,719
Like I don't know what it'll be

890
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,511
Like 40 or so and then it is

891
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,791
Big Rock

892
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:30,815
Really

893
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,423
They make tons of opium

894
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,471
The perfect climate for it that's the thing that's

895
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,263
A lot of these

896
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:42,335
Codependent

897
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:43,871
Opium is

898
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:46,687
Smoke a lot open

899
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:49,503
Pima College

900
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,527
To opiates

901
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,807
Yeah I mean

902
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,087
Because it's not great

903
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:56,671
I took painkillers a couple times in my life and I didn't really enjoy them

904
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,743
Enemies there opium was really it was just

905
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,023
Do you smoke it with weed

906
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,607
Better than just being high

907
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:08,959
Mel was amazing

908
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
Is so

909
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,823
Delicious I remember correctly from Legends of the

910
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,847
The fall

911
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,895
I know that you can do it on a boat real

912
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
Yeah I'm sure

913
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,455
But also

914
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,735
This is important I Mad Men

915
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,015
Best drug use

916
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,343
Repentance become up later

917
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,391
But I wonder as I will not

918
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,415
To bypass

919
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,695
I want to be clear

920
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,975
We're not squares

921
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,511
I'm sitting here drinking

922
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,279
And some wine

923
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,559
You've got some whiskey

924
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,375
Author of how drunk

925
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,655
Alex Jones

926
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,423
Has been

927
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,215
Oh that my job

928
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,239
Straight

929
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,543
You so mad that people think it was drunk

930
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,663
I think if you're mad that people are drunk that just

931
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,687
The Earth

932
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,223
If you're mad that people think you're drunk

933
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:57,087
That just proves you're so much more drunk much bigger problem

934
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,183
Like if people thought that I was way too drunk

935
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,207
Regularly

936
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:02,975
Legitimate

937
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,255
Real talk

938
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,791
My reaction would be

939
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:06,815
Please talk to me

940
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,583
Me more about this

941
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,119
I want to know your

942
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,935
Perspective I want to know if you think I should get help

943
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:15,775
Do not like

944
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,311
F*** you I wasn't drunk

945
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,407
This next Eddie Bravo

946
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,431
Question

947
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:28,575
Eddie Bravo his questions ask Alex about why

948
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,391
Here's my here's my ass on the clean take

949
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,927
Can we

950
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,975
Isolate all of his questions

951
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:40,351
Create an Eddie Bravo's questions corner across talk

952
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:44,447
I have dreams but will more work

953
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,495
I saw physical hard as it is

954
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:55,455
Like an idiot hours of prep show

955
00:49:55,967 --> 00:50:02,111
Anyways

956
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,647
Infowars is fake

957
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,415
Fake news

958
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:09,279
Fake news

959
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:15,679
A lot of people out there think Infowars

960
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:21,823
Funded by Soros

961
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,767
Liberal conservative Administration

962
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:45,887
Israel

963
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,543
Call Sue

964
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,319
That's not an answer but

965
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,623
Happy that he's against

966
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,183
I don't think

967
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,743
Killing I don't that we were supposed to take away 4

968
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,023
Furniture but I

969
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,815
I think you started studies Fair

970
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,375
But I don't think that the track record really backs that up

971
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:22,495
I like that I feel like

972
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,519
Was

973
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,823
Kenny was Bravo being

974
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,127
As smart as he possibly could there

975
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,919
Well he gives away that he literally

976
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:33,759
Allergy forecast

977
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,039
You know you know

978
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,927
He repeatedly says that he listens to Alex everyday

979
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,719
It's all real

980
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,023
Anyway and then there's also the WikiLeaks

981
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,071
The u.s. leaks not the Russians

982
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,607
Always have

983
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,143
The Russians are take

984
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,983
People inside the

985
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,311
Part of his counter-coup narrative

986
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:01,407
Anyway the Clippers

987
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,247
Call Dad

988
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:20,607
Why do they think Infowars

989
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,167
Really intelligent

990
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:26,239
The real news is pmf

991
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,663
Soros

992
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,479
Which again

993
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,247
Is not true

994
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,551
No

995
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:52,095
George Soros

996
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,639
And they always ignore real facts I talk about

997
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:18,719
Only had one lesson

998
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:24,863
Breezy news

999
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:31,263
Competition with someone who has an independent news organization the operated

1000
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,799
Well that's one Theory

1001
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,151
No really is

1002
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:41,503
If you don't really take

1003
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,271
Okay

1004
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,831
What is there is a monetary interest

1005
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,671
You say that these Independent News Outlet

1006
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,999
So don't go listen to them come listen to us

1007
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,023
That makes sense

1008
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,559
On a

1009
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,327
Pure level

1010
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,351
Wow

1011
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,119
Till

1012
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,655
You think for two

1013
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:02,751
And you see all of the competing news Industries

1014
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,823
Very many there are

1015
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,175
Mysteries are united in saying

1016
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,711
Alex Jones is full of s***

1017
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:18,111
Yeah you got to put that also you look at all of the people who are in alternative media

1018
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:21,951
Fairly

1019
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,303
I don't know how to describe that they don't do their due diligence

1020
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,327
In terms of Journalism

1021
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,631
Like they just spout bulshit

1022
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,423
Sensational and it gets

1023
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,007
Posted repeatedly Raditz all attention-grabbing

1024
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:35,775
S***

1025
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,311
I would assume

1026
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,871
I don't know if this is entirely true

1027
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,407
But I would assume

1028
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:44,223
The people who are legitimate journalist

1029
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:46,271
Would f****** hate Alex Jones

1030
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,063
Because he doesn't do the work

1031
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:51,135
Jeff doesn't do the actual job ilysm

1032
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,671
And it didn't

1033
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,463
To work that they do

1034
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,767
It is it is interesting go how

1035
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,351
Turning journalist

1036
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,631
Diamonds

1037
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,399
Like

1038
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:05,471
The only people who are

1039
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,495
Still in journalism

1040
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,775
Arnot

1041
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:11,359
No journalist we have now

1042
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,383
Exactly

1043
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:15,711
And now it's even less than in their heyday

1044
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:19,039
And the ones who are doing investigative journalism

1045
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:19,807
F******

1046
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,087
True Believers

1047
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,647
Like these are people who

1048
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,719
Will fight and die for a story

1049
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:29,023
So I was one of them

1050
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,583
I would put out

1051
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:37,215
Like you're you're making a mockery

1052
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,495
Everything that I believe

1053
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:42,847
And I think that anybody who has a full awareness

1054
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,895
And the importance of Journalism

1055
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,943
Acknowledge the danger

1056
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,991
Of someone like him

1057
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,783
Becoming super popular

1058
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,831
Especially because

1059
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:55,647
Disposing

1060
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:56,671
Is there

1061
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,695
You guys

1062
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,975
Are fake

1063
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,511
Yeah and our enemy

1064
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:04,607
So if you're demonizing the people who do the actual work

1065
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,631
Well you don't

1066
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,959
It makes total sense that they would hate him

1067
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:11,263
Take away the financial aspect of it

1068
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:12,543
Yeah

1069
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,591
It's nonsense

1070
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,871
The financial aspect

1071
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:18,943
But you're much more you're much more

1072
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:19,711
Effective

1073
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,759
Getting that kind of gullibility

1074
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,063
In-N-Out

1075
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:29,183
Edit a legitimate criticism for literally all aspects of our lives right now we're done

1076
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,719
It is always that

1077
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,743
Instinctively

1078
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:36,095
Yeah

1079
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:40,191

1092
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:17,055
Teasing when he's about to break some big news

1093
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:22,175
What is what do you think he does he reveals all of his sources

1094
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:24,735
And tells us exactly what it is he's about to

1095
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,319
You're not close

1096
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,351
The basis of what's Happening

1097
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,263
Okay

1098
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:00,319

Translator

1115
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:43,839
A mighty might have been doing something in the bathroom

00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,703
That's what I was hoping

1126
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:24,031
He comes out of the bathroom with a bottle of Jack Daniels

1127
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,567

Point

1131
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,455
He does not stop

For Alec

1145
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,287
There are a couple moments

1146
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,079
That actually made me very

1147
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:02,175
I believe that he has a problem with alcohol

1148
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:04,991
Some of his behaviors

1149
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,527
Suggest that he is unable to

1150
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:07,295
Control himself

1151
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:10,879
Listen

1152
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:13,183
I don't want to go around diagnosing people

1153
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:15,231
Responsibility

1154
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,511
Dangerous for Layman

1155
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:17,791
But what I glimpse

1156
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,071
From this

1157
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,655
A lot of these behaviors remind me of some of the worst drunk

1158
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,679
That we know in

1159
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:26,751
Year

1160
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,799
If anybody other than

1161
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:31,359
Joe Rogan Eddie Bravo were in that room

1162
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,383
I think

1163
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,151
There was

1164
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,199
Be the potential for Alex Jones's career

1165
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:35,967
Be ruined

1166
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:37,503
By his

1167
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,295
Yeah he

1168
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:40,831
Real drunk

1169
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:41,599
Excellent

1170
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,391
The next clip

1171
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,415
This is a hymn

1172
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,951
Teasing information again

1173
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,999
And then we have some evidence

1174
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:48,767
Joe Rogan

1175
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:52,095
Never listen to Alex Jones Show

1176
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,639
Freddy

1177
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:15,135
German cheers

1178
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,207
Butt stuff

1179
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,487
People were so

1180
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:26,399
So much anticipation regarding the show much house

1181
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:27,935
Do it

1182
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,471
We don't make those noises

1183
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:33,567
No

1184
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,335
We do not

1185
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,359
We don't do that

1186
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,127
We are perfect

1187
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:40,991
Grossest thing I've ever heard we all want to die right now

1188
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:41,759
Breathe

1189
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,527
Makes me sick

1190
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,647
Well I mean

1191
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:52,767
Outlook

1192
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:56,095
Under braids

1193
01:01:56,351 --> 01:02:02,495
Telling me that they don't want him to breathe people that we know did a podcast

1194
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:05,567
Podcast net worth

1195
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:07,615
Dude

1196
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,663
Half of this podcast

1197
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,455
Is you guys breathing in

1198
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,247
So hard to listen

1199
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:16,575
So much of that now

1200
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,647
Here we go this is where

1201
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:20,927
Alex

1202
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,047
Gotcha

1203
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:37,567
Even heard you say a racial thing

1204
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:43,711
Consequential

1205
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:44,479
Ever

1206
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:50,879
Almost I've never heard you discuss

1207
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:57,535
We can just leave that without comment I don't really think we need to get into that we have

1208
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,655
Refer to Oliver last episode

1209
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:09,055
Let's just let the next episode this is a clip we're either talking about the Gravity by the p****

1210
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:12,127
Alex does markable spin

1211
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,663
Job for Donald Trump

1212
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,479
His ever-lovin Volvo

1213
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,279
That is friends with him

1214
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:34,399
20 years ago it's all just completed

1215
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:40,799
At the RNC speech he says Republicans

1216
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:52,575
Executive order that they removing anaganaga protection

1217
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,599
Do the lgbtq

1218
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:56,415
Well

1219
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,951
Complete

1220
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:02,047
The opposite opposite approach

1221
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,631
Brett

1222
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:09,471
Actions speak louder than words

1223
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,007
I don't believe

1224
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:14,079
I don't believe the trouble necessarily hates gay people but I

1225
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:14,847
I think he doesn't

1226
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:18,431
I don't think he has anything to do with it I think it's purely Mike Pence

1227
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,527
Donald Trump

1228
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,367
Anyway

1229
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:34,047
Call my b

1230
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,839
To use a real

1231
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:42,239
Yoruba

1232
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:47,615
So again I wanted I didn't mean to cut there but I want to cut

1233
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,383
Just to

1234
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,431
Talk about this for a second

1235
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:53,503
There's going around and Alex

1236
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:57,599
Pictures of the lot in a lot of like Owen Shroyer is really big on this one of his

1237
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,367
Reporters

1238
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,159
This idea that

1239
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,695
Being called a racist

1240
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,975
Is worse than racism

1241
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:03,999
Essentially

1242
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:06,047
The idea that it's like an attack

1243
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,071
On YouTube

1244
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:07,839
Have

1245
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:10,399
Some racist behaviors

1246
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,167
Pointed out

1247
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,703
Nvidia stock

1248
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,471
Control Mecca

1249
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,287
And I think that is

1250
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,591
Dumb on one level

1251
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:22,175
Test response

1252
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:24,223
You could possibly get

1253
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:27,551
But it really is it

1254
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:28,319
F******

1255
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,367
Denny's

1256
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,903
Abusive

1257
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:33,695
Sing to a wife-beater like

1258
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,231
Oh you know I

1259
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,023
Just don't don't point out his

1260
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:37,791
Failing

1261
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:38,559
You know

1262
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,607
He's trying hard not to be a wife

1263
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,143
Not awake

1264
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:45,983
He slips up and be forever down again

1265
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,007
To do it's not that he does

1266
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,311
Time to have

1267
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:52,383
I'm not sure that that analogy

1268
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,431
Because

1269
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,735
I am

1270
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,527
Offended by your insinuation that I'm not

1271
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,855
Well I think it comes back to this like

1272
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:03,903
Refusing to acknowledge the Privileges

1273
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,183
Like 88

1274
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,207
It comes back to that

1275
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:10,303
Different

1276
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:13,631
We're talking about Alex

1277
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,167
Right

1278
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:20,031
As well as defending straight I want to take that away from it slightly and

1279
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:23,103
You just look at the idea that calling someone a racist

1280
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,127
Is away

1281
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,407
To gain power over

1282
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,735
That is not what people are doing

1283
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,015
If it was

1284
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:36,415
It would be a lot better by that

1285
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,815
You can shut them up and

1286
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:43,583
You can other

1287
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:46,143
People by calling them a racist when they're not racist

1288
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,167
As opposed to just

1289
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:49,215
Authoring them by

1290
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,239
Right

1291
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,263
I mean it's

1292
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,311
Located

1293
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:57,407
It's the same as this idea of like

1294
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,711
Calling the alt-right Nazis

1295
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,759
He's trying to other them

1296
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:05,087
When people were calling the Nazis are doing that because

1297
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,159
Seem to be in bed with some literal Nazi

1298
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,439
So they're not

1299
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:15,071
You can't be offended in like if I look at a rock

1300
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:15,839
How can I go

1301
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,143
Tree no

1302
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:20,191
Not okay

1303
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,983
Is it really bad

1304
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,103
Octopussy

1305
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:41,951
He's a man

1306
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:46,303
And those kind of do their type a hyper aggressive personality

1307
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:51,935
Frank Demeter

1308
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:58,591
The big one is in consonance with that Billy bush.

1309
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:25,727
Laugh

1310
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:38,527
Bushes and wait for joggers

1311
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:52,351
Mindy

1312
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:55,423
Wrestletalk

1313
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:00,543
40% of all men should be murdered at this moment

1314
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,431
Opening us up to attack now

1315
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,199
Now

1316
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:07,967
Here here's

1317
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:12,319
I think Joe is doing his duty and I think some of his negative

1318
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,343
Viewpoints

1319
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,367
Just showing a little bit

1320
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,391
Because

1321
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,183
That's not accurate at all

1322
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,463
In any way

1323
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:20,511
Joann

1324
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:22,815
Eddy racing about women

1325
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:25,119
I bet that is comedian

1326
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,959
So we can Circle discount that a little bit

1327
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:29,983
A tiny bit

1328
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:36,383
I am very much like they were away on the go

1329
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:45,855
So I'm going to let that go for now because the the bigger issue is

1330
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:47,647
I hear

1331
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,183
Was describing

1332
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:55,327
He was talking specifically did not want him to do that moving in on her like a b****

1333
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:59,423
Movie times I kiss them I can't stop myself

1334
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,447
Yeah I just

1335
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,983
Kiss them immediately

1336
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,263
He describes

1337
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,567
Describe

1338
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:10,431
Correctly describe a sexual assault

1339
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,199
You saying

1340
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,783
When you're a celebrity they let you do it

1341
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,087
That's not describing somebody

1342
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,623
Who's all up in your s***

1343
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:21,183
Upon

1344
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:22,719
You do it

1345
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:24,255
Not they want

1346
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:27,327
Or something like that so freezing it like

1347
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,863
Really wrong

1348
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,143
I meant at the end

1349
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,167
When Alex is like

1350
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,471
And there's a guy outside with a recorder

1351
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,495
Tiana Micon

1352
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:41,663
There was no there was not a guy it was him talking into the microphone

1353
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:46,271
He agreed to have on him it wasn't confident it wasn't said in confidence

1354
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,295
It was

1355
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:51,903
Part of a building case but a lot of people have that he's gone senile

1356
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,207
I don't even necessarily

1357
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,487
I think he just doesn't

1358
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:58,815
He's not into me he's a lot like Robert Durst

1359
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:01,119
Like when you want

1360
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:07,775
V a little bit smarter

1361
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:08,799
Murder over those years

1362
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:16,479
Man I bet Hillary Clinton is personally gotten away with a lot of murder in life

1363
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,039
She's done

1364
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:23,903
Go back to episode

1365
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:27,231
Goddamnit varsho

1366
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,511
This is this

1367
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,679
About

1368
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,447
What he did

1369
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,215
On Y2K

1370
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:38,751
Ono

1371
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:45,407
Well here's the big enchilada

1372
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,503
I forgot this also is another example of

1373
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:51,807
Play music about to tell a big story and then

1374
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:59,999
Bravo.

1375
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:03,583
FEMA and Joe

1376
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:06,143
Also this is aware Alex

1377
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:09,983
Retreat from the whiskey and also starts doing drugs

1378
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,847
There is a whole Breakaway civilization

1379
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:18,943
UFOs

1380
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,271
Hold on

1381
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:29,951
How many times did I tell you

1382
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:42,495
Conspiracy theory is just not trusting Criminal

1383
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:52,991
Computer expert

1384
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:59,391
House waiting for that goddamn power to go out

1385
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:12,191
So this clip is going to be kind of long cuz he does

1386
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:12,959
Describe scissors

1387
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:15,007
Experience of Y2K

1388
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,311
A total wine

1389
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:20,383
Non-Stop about how he was wrong about the concentration

1390
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:26,783
Camps right now

1391
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,623
Own up to the fact that he was pretending the ad sources

1392
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:37,791
Howard Lee kind of dog does he have multiple sources confirming

1393
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:41,631
On the road

1394
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,655
Nope none of those

1395
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,959
But I want to save this

1396
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:47,519
Because it AA Bears mentioning

1397
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:50,847
Like when you're listening to Eddie and Joe talk

1398
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,383
They're having fun

1399
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,663
And like there

1400
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,431
It's it's

1401
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,479
Different it feel different cuz

1402
01:13:56,735 --> 01:14:02,879
Would you even in this case when they're talking about how the two of them were idiots and they believed in 2012

1403
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,415
Having fun when you bring

1404
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,975
Alex bringing them into superstick

1405
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,511
Bravo

1406
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:09,535
Strfkr

1407
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:13,631
That's why we talk to use a tiny bit but I also think

1408
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:17,727
For as much as beginning of the show said you was an idiot I would hang out

1409
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,263
Even his

1410
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:21,311
Even if he seems like but he

1411
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,335
You seems like a congeni

1412
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:25,407
Sure even his even his life

1413
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:27,967
Be right all the time

1414
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:29,247
Such a lie

1415
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:31,295
Little like I'm going to rub your belly

1416
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,575
Kind of

1417
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,367
Oh you can't be right all the

1418
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:40,767
If I know a few of the things that I do know I would suspect that he was

1419
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:41,791
Resetting Alex up

1420
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:44,351
Like that kind of behavior would be like

1421
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:51,007
Who's playing

1422
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:52,543
Doesn't believe in vaccines

1423
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:55,615
Does leaving chemtrails

1424
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,687
Hiralal

1425
01:14:59,455 --> 01:14:59,967
Is

1426
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,247
Wild

1427
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:08,671
I did I was just very strong tobacco from Mexico

1428
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,951
Michael reasons and legal

1429
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:22,239
Also there it's for the rest of the show he pretends he didn't smoke weed although it's on cat

1430
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,311
You can hear him

1431
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:30,943
Let me be clear I don't give a fuk

1432
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:37,087
If you smoke weed I'm actually for him smoking weed

1433
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:43,231
Care about is when you are a self-appointed leader of the information War

1434
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,511
And you go on

1435
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:46,559
Biscuits

1436
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,863
Hundreds of thousands millions of downloads

1437
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,423
Comport yourself like a f****** professional

1438
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,471
Don't go in there

1439
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:56,031
And get high when you know you can't handle weed

1440
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,055
Drink

1441
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:57,823
At least

1442
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,103
6 glasses of whiskey

1443
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:04,223
Rome situation Rogan podcast

1444
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:09,599
Uur

1445
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:13,695
Everytime I come

1446
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:14,719
I don't know

1447
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:17,023
I'm trying to do your job

1448
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:24,959
Stop

1449
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:28,799
Most benefit of the doubt I can I'm going to let the rest of the split place

1450
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,079
So feel free to take notes

1451
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,359
Let's not interrupt it because

1452
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,639
I want him to be able to get

1453
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:35,199
His words out and speak his peace

1454
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,735
About Y2K

1455
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,271
How can I keep in mind

1456
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:42,623
That the sponsor doesn't know where

1457
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,231
The sponsors that he had back then

1458
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:54,143
Many of them are the same as he has now also keep in mind when they mock the idea of selling survive

1459
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:54,911
Bible stuff

1460
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:57,727
He still sells all of that now

1461
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:01,311
Keep that in mind when they laugh about it

1462
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:03,359
It's important to be reminded of that uptown

1463
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:09,503
Admit

1464
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,295
That he's delusional

1465
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:13,087
I'm going to put the microphone

1466
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,367
That

1467
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:18,207
It's important. Inhale

1468
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:24,095
What is Nibiru

1469
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:33,055
This is one of the few

1470
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:43,807
And so I was wrong the wrong reasons

1471
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:47,903
One radio station

1472
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:59,167
Allstate Howard Stern

1473
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,191
Huge ratings

1474
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:14,527
You're not what

1475
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,855
Endorsi sponsors

1476
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:46,783
I just kind of went

1477
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,575
Okay okay okay

1478
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:21,599
Especially

1479
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:35,167
Producer

1480
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:49,503
Right

1481
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:53,599
Missile fired from Russia

1482
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:57,439
Which one

1483
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,399
But

1484
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,447
Government

1485
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:12,543
Then they use it to demonize alternative

1486
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,944
It was BS

1487
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:34,304
Arrow

1488
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,120
Apparel

1489
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,216
Jordan

1490
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:42,752
Judaica

1491
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:50,176
The yelling was prompted by him basically admitting that he is malleable

1492
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:51,456
And key

1493
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,224
Is

1494
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,552
You can just talk him into believing

1495
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,904
And then I believed it

1496
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:09,888
Is what happened it is believed but also I let them tell me that I believe that

1497
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:11,168
I believe that

1498
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,448
Did not believe that at the time

1499
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:17,824
I didn't listen to my gut I don't believe anything I believe everything I believe it all my friend

1500
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,384
It's time to pray

1501
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:31,904
F*** him so very important to note it doesn't bring up

1502
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,952
How he's changed his tune on Putin

1503
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:40,864
Also very important I brought this up in the middle of the click when I got to repeat it Midas resources

1504
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,424
We played a commercial from his show

1505
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:45,984
From night from Y2K

1506
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,776
From Midas resources

1507
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:50,336
They still with him

1508
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,616
Well they convinced

1509
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:53,920
But now they sell like the doctor wallet

1510
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:57,248
Products like that

1511
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:59,296
Still gold mine

1512
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,832
He's a bunch of notes

1513
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:02,880
Okay also

1514
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:05,952
If you're listening and you haven't listened to our episode about Y2K

1515
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:09,024
Go back and listen to that it'll give you a lot of context for why

1516
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,304
That clip was full of

1517
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,936
Feel my rage

1518
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,984
Tactile level

1519
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:26,432
The top show with huge I don't care

1520
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,200

1521
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:32,832
Nail guys

1522
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:37,440
Say okay

1523
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,720
Panic inducing

1524
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:40,768
Buck

1525
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:50,752
Telecommunications Act of 96

1526
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:54,336
Later

1527
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,616
I'm guessing he knows

1528
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,408
Broad Strokes

1529
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:01,248

1530
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:07,648

1531
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:10,976
Just randomly throw that s*** out of me like nobody's going to follow up on

1532
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,256
Give a f***

1533
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,680
Dbm

1534
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:20,960
If you knew was it

1535
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:24,544
I don't know anybody I can confirm this

1536
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,616
No always makes me think of a cold shower

1537
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:30,176
IC bowel

1538
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:34,272
I hate hearing missile discuss

1539
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:39,648
Are you ready for the next one

1540
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:42,976
Apparently so at this point Eddie takes the

1541
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:45,280

Bravo

1543
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:49,376
He wants to give you

1544
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,144
The chemtrail

1545
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:53,472
He wants to ask Alex

1546
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:55,520
About what

1547
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:58,336
The deal what's the reality with chemtrails

1548
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:04,480
Mmsbee

1549
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:12,416
But they're doing it for different folks

1550
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:19,072
Weather weapon programs for 27 years

1551
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:29,312

01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:03,616
Wine or hurricane or typhoon

1556
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:05,408
Holyshit

1557
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,904

Lubbock

1559
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:44,832

Villa Monte

1561
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:03,776
Bill Gates

1562
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,128
Oh boy

1563
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:16,064
Bill Gates owns the weather machine that was emotional for you

1564
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:24,768

Bonaventure

1566
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:30,656
The other one

1567
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:33,728
It really is before it is the plot of The Avengers

1568
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:37,312

1571
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:42,688

Bill Gates got it

1575
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,856
You got it

1576
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:54,208
In-depth that you can control hurricanes

1577
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:59,072
Alex

1578
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,120
Say they can come

1579
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,912
Control hurricanes

1580
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:05,984
All I said

1581
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,312
Because it's not

1582
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:15,200
When he has whiskey and weed on Joe Rogan show

1583
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:16,480
And we're going to get into

1584
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:18,528
Believes

1585
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:22,624
He said whether weapon immediately pulled up as much as I can

1586
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:25,952
Here is the best reference

1587
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:26,976
That I could find

1588
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:27,744
Immediately

1589
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,328
The former Navy

1590
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:33,376

1594
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,688
What is thing

1595
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:50,272
Who talks the gorilla Gorilla Monsoon

1596
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:51,296
That's right

1597
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,576
Alright

1598
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:56,416
Neither of us are dummy

1599
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:00,256
He did a special even on the

1600
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:02,560
Beersy website it says

1601
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:04,608
It's a bit sensational

1602
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,680
Questions everything

1603
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,264
TV show about

1604
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:12,544
Courtesy stop

1605
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,568
And they looked into

1606
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:15,360
2m trails

1607
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:21,760
HAARP

1608
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:23,552
This is dumb

1609
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:41,728
They have

1610
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:44,544
Really

1611
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:49,408
Weather weapon

1612
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:51,968
Sitting in front of everybody and every time City

1613
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:57,856
Russians and Chinese are just discovering.

1614
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:58,880
So

1615
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:00,928
This clip is really long because

1616
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:02,976
Does a little bit of debunking

1617
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:04,256
Porter

1618
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:07,072
Yeah

1619
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:07,840
That weather

1620
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:14,496
Are all times and every small town every small town

1621
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:18,336
One-tenth of 1% are used for Doppler radar

1622
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:21,664
But if your power goes down even a little bit

1623
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,992
If you live in sin

1624
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:31,392
Centralia Missouri or Macon Missouri small town tomorrow night

1625
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:37,280
2

1626
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:42,144
A way to clean information about the weather

1627
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:48,544
Yeah find out if there's going to be a tornado every every

1628
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,616
Better to him seems like a like what

1629
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:54,944
What's this magic how much pressure there is

1630
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,480
12

1631
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:58,016
We're going to get to Alex

1632
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:00,064
It's not really believing the people can figure

1633
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,600
Things out at some point

1634
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,672
This clip is pretty long

1635
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:05,952
Demystified by Alta

1636
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:09,280
I wanted to say we're going to let this play

1637
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,048
Because

1638
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,072
There's something

1639
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:11,840
Super bottles

1640
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:12,864
That Rogan makes

1641
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,912
And I want to be able to

1642
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:15,936
Mitsubishi Greer

1643
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:16,960
The simplest

1644
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:18,240
Is that the

1645
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,520
Quintessential

1646
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:20,800
Sign that

1647
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:21,824
Alex Jones

1648
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:23,872
Is if he says

1649
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:24,640
You could kick

1650
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:27,456
Old guy that is

1651
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:30,528
Installation of the only thing that

1652
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,064
Respect

1653
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,344
This guy looks like

1654
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:35,136
Could beat me up also

1655
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:35,904
He's such a

1656
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:36,928
Pure like

1657
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:38,720
This is the only whale.

1658
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,000
This is the only way to deter

1659
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:43,072
Determine male dominance guys of Miami lunch with me

1660
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:45,376

1661
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:49,984
Meetup only the greatest

1662
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,520
Also I don't want to

1663
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:53,056
I don't want to body shame people

1664
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:54,080
That's not what I like to do

1665
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,104
Do but Alex look like

1666
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,640
S***

1667
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:58,688
You look like anyone could kick

1668
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:02,784
But I also that that guy who flew in

1669
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,320
Tornadoes that he's talking about

1670
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:06,112
Are hurricanes at work

1671
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:09,440
The event being 90 does really call into Quest

1672
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,208
And what he's telling

1673
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,840
The ones that I work with the elderly I don't believe

1674
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:22,240
S*** there 90 and they're all there is a relative thing

1675
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:25,056
Admittedly

1676
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:27,360
Flying into a hurricane

1677
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:29,408
Sure there's no

1678
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:31,968
If you did that also wasn't the first to ever do it

1679
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,248
Probably didn't

1680
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:38,112
They exaggerate

1681
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:40,928
Possibly the f*** is going to call him

1682
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,208
Alex

1683
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:43,488
Nope but anyway

1684
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:44,512
This

1685
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:45,280
Earthquake news

1686
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:47,328
I'm just going to let it play

1687
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,096
It's important

1688
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,632
Is Joe rebuttal

1689
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:52,448
And then Alex tries to readjust

1690
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,216
His argument

1691
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:56,800
And then when this clip is over I'm going to explain

1692
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:58,080
Why Alex Jones

1693
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:02,432
Is a filthy liar

1694
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:04,480
Control the weather

1695
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:10,880
Ideas for barges to pump cold water from the depth of the ocean to create some sort of a roadblock for the hurricane

1696
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:14,464
This what he has done is Google's Bill Gates weather

1697
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:15,232
Control

1698
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,024
Hey Joe is found

1699
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,352
Uncle about how cold water does stop game

1700
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:21,888
And so there's a possibility

1701
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,168
Great trenches that release

1702
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,752
Coldwater

1703
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:28,544
Started again

1704
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,336

1705
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,128

1707
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:39,808
Target pool Power Commander In The Water could have theoretically

1708
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:52,608
Coldwater

1709
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:55,680
In the front of the CFR it said we were doing this

1710
01:32:55,936 --> 01:33:02,080
Because global warming

1711
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:03,616
About

1712
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:06,432
You're wrong about dinosaurs

1713
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:09,248
But hey what about that

1714
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:24,864
Yes

1715
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:31,264
Livingston

1716
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,824
Finished

1717
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,872
AR

1718
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:37,152
What is drunk by the

1719
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,688
Until he's drunk

1720
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:41,504
Oh yeah he's ready to eat

1721
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,344
As long as you don't ask him to

1722
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,624
He will talk about it

1723
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:50,720
His bring us

1724
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:52,256
Oh actually

1725
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:58,656
Play can't I don't have the Improv skills to you cuz we've been watching him drink

1726
01:33:58,912 --> 01:33:59,936
Whiskey like its water

1727
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:05,568
Behaving exactly like he doesn't make clip where he's yelling at that

1728
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:09,408
He's acting and sounding like he does in the secret of 2017

1729
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:12,736
So it's like it's kind of reaffirming all of our

1730
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:13,760
Like what

1731
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:14,784
Quick question

1732
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:22,464
What is the secret of 2017 you just that she's not so I do

1733
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,232
I don't know

1734
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:26,048
Interrupting

1735
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,072
Ariel

1736
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:33,216
Program

1737
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:38,848
Get this done with a real program

1738
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:56,000
And

1739
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:08,032
It doesn't

1740
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:22,624
Chinese

1741
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:39,264
About various options for controlling

1742
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:51,040
Don't you think they would have measuring these temperature

1743
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:58,464
Blitz

1744
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:15,104
I think what I'm saying is they're absolutely is

1745
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:15,872
Frank

1746
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:22,272
What is a theano directions for global warming

1747
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:41,216
Mobile cycle

1748
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:43,264
Astrophysicist

1749
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:50,944
Big Spring

1750
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:58,112
Carbon dioxide water sunlight they have total control over the whole life cycle

1751
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:04,512
Let's play the video

1752
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:10,400
Solutions

1753
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:17,056
What is the CIA

1754
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:23,456
Question what do they have to do I don't know what to say

1755
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:29,856
Stop the spread of Communism

1756
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,464
If they got hired

1757
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,744
To assess a threat

1758
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:42,400
And its threat being from global warming like what would we have to worry about it we really going to lose cities do we really have an issue with her.

1759
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:45,728
He was that was Alex Jones just totally gone

1760
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:52,128
Yeah there's a

1761
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:52,896
There's a

1762
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:53,920
There's a

1763
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:55,712
Like whenever Alex's

1764
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:59,040
He really doesn't

1765
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:00,064
Don't know what to do

1766
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:03,648
That was that was

1767
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:04,416
Completely.

1768
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,720
Completely different conversation

1769
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:13,376
Yeah. And then we're having the same conversation with each other happens a lot

1770
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,424
Always pure chaos

1771
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,448
It's not even over yet

1772
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:25,408
No I'm going to go

1773
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:26,688
Is 1

1774
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,224
A lovable

1775
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:31,808
Yeah I am fully on his side as a hug

1776
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,624
He's such a silly little goofball

1777
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,440
I feel like he's the most an Oculus person

1778
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:42,560
He knows a lot of things that he's ready but he's one of these guys who just watches

1779
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:44,864
Like YouTube videos and thinks their

1780
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:48,192
Yeah and maybe his read a couple documents

1781
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:52,800
But doesn't really understand what they say

1782
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:54,336
To do with global warming you're like

1783
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,432
Don't

1784
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,248
No but that don't have anything to

1785
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:03,552
But if they did

1786
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:06,880
Joe has a good response to that in that if there are

1787
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:08,160
Rats that are posed

1788
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,440
Dubai global warming

1789
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:11,744
The intelligence Community should be

1790
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:17,632
Yeah they should be but they're good answer to a hypothetical question

1791
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,424
But be that as it may

1792
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,192
Wait for this

1793
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:22,752
Alright conversation takes

1794
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:24,288
Turn on Alex pools

1795
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,568
What do you think

1796
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:28,384
Is a trump card out of the closet

1797
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:31,200
We'll get to why it's not

1798
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:32,736
As

1799
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:37,856
George Soros

1800
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,392
Project

1801
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:52,448
Chemtrail geoengineering stratospheric aerosol

1802
01:39:53,984 --> 01:40:00,128
Soto

1803
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:06,016
Council admits geoengineering the form of stratospheric aerosol

1804
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:09,856
Is taking a place I eat kenturah taking place IU chemtrails

1805
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:16,256
And the robot

1806
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:22,656
Maintenance

1807
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:25,472
Elements of instability in the world

1808
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:31,872
Asai program if ever implemented could penetrate conflicts and security threats if misused

1809
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:35,200
All types of Concepts

1810
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:41,600
Concepts for potential the science oriented concept

1811
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:48,000
Is it possible

1812
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:55,168
Boy saying is that there are potential issue

1813
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:05,408
You can Google

1814
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:22,048
2005 the department of energy program

1815
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:23,584
Testing $5 a year

1816
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:28,448
U.s. code

1817
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:51,232
Brings out

1818
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,072
He uses as a

1819
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:57,376
That

1820
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:58,400
His argument

1821
01:41:58,656 --> 01:41:59,168
What is

1822
01:41:59,424 --> 01:41:59,936
That

1823
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:02,240
These people call things studies

1824
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:06,848
I have pulled up this

1825
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:08,640
Subsection a

1826
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:10,176
If so

1827
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:11,712
432

1828
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:15,296
Subsection 128 paragraph

1829
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:16,064
I have found it

1830
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:18,880
Google

1831
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:26,816
I'm assuming that he quoted it perfectly and agrees with everything

1832
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:29,376
Restrictions on use of

1833
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:30,144
Human subjects

1834
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,192
For testing of chemical and biological age

1835
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,472
Prohibited

1836
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:34,240
Activities

1837
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:35,264
The secretary

1838
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:37,056
They knock

1839
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:38,848
Conductor directly or by contract

1840
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,640
Any test or experiment involved

1841
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:44,480
Civilian population

1842
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,576
Any other testing of a chemical agent or biological age

1843
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:53,184
I believe this was probably

1844
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:54,720
Shortly after that

1845
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:58,560
And let's say that

1846
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:02,144
Let's go through

1847
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:04,448
That the government has actually done that

1848
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:06,240
I don't know this

1849
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,520
I don't I don't have a date

1850
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:10,336
But let's just go with it

1851
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,360
If it wasn't

1852
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:12,128
It should have been

1853
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:12,896
And it wasn't

1854
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:18,016
This is this is

1855
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:19,040
For the government

1856
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:21,600
Has absolutely tested chemical agents on

1857
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:22,368
Unsuspecting peep

1858
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:25,952
Here's where Alex's argument comes into

1859
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:28,256
Soccer paragraph be

1860
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,840

1871
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,432
Any pizza

1872
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:49,760
A purpose that is related to a medical therapeutic Pharmaceutical

1873
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:51,040
Agricultural Industrial

1874
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:51,808
Or research

1875
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:53,344
2

1876
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:54,112
Any purpose

1877
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:54,880
What is direct

1878
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:55,904
Play related to protect

1879
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,208
Or biological weapon

1880
01:43:58,720 --> 01:43:59,232
Agent

1881
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:01,280

1882
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:03,840
Including any purpose related to Riot

1883
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:07,936
Now that's disconcerting

1884
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:12,032
I don't like I don't like that number three at all

1885
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:14,080
Do I do very scary

1886
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:14,848
Let's not

1887
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,920
Let's pretend that three was not allowed that's

1888
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:18,944
Scary

1889
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:19,712
Now

1890
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:24,832
As long as you're testing it out on right control

1891
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:27,904
You can do whatever the f*** you want if it's related to

1892
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:30,464
Do medical therapeutic pharmaceutical agricultural

1893
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,000
Those ones are fine

1894
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:34,048
Because those ones are beneficial

1895
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:35,840
Control one is very scary

1896
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:37,632
It doesn't really matter though because

1897
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:40,960
Help subsection paragraph Beast is

1898
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:43,008

Hold on one second

1915
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:22,944
How many times have you

01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,224
Agreed

1917

Chemtrails you go with those and you're like yeah I'm not going to read this whole thing out of nail dystrophy

1921
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:44,192
Conspiracy ever Trails is Apple

1922
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:50,336
Subsection D is about notifying Congress

1923
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,872
Amy is

1924
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:53,408
Is just too really

1925
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,944
Put into definition what

1926
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:56,224
A biological age

1927
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:57,248
Is Brad Pitt

1928
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:58,016
Definition

1929
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:01,344
Siri used to kill all those people

1930
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:04,672
Sure those two are just sort of definition

1931
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:07,744
Paragraph B is super in Port

1932
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:11,072
If you were if you're using this

1933
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:11,840
Statute

1934
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:13,632
This title 50

1935
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:15,424
Chapter 32 Subs

1936
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:18,240
Section 128

1937
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,520
If you're using this

1938
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:22,336
You have to mention paragraphs

1939
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,616
Cuz if you don't

1940
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:30,016
It's not the full payment really important

1941
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:34,624
Mentioned

1942
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:37,184
Beholden to

1943
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:42,304
You can't test ride control without informed consent

1944
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:45,376
Yeah actually a very well-written

1945
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:47,680
It is here's my favorite part of that

1946
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:48,704
B b Q's

1947
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,240
8

1948
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:51,776
Equate

1949
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:53,824
And Wednesday bring it up

1950
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,896
Pulls up the statute and they read it

1951
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:58,176
They don't read every

1952
01:46:58,688 --> 01:47:00,736
So it looks like

1953
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:02,016
And at this point

1954
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:02,784
Drunk

1955
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:03,552
And he gets this

1956
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:04,320
Smug

1957
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:06,112
Smiley look on his face

1958
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,136
And at this point

1959
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:09,184
Joe becomes his ally

1960
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,488
This is when your righteous Fury Unleashed

1961
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:13,280
Is itself a worse

1962
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:17,632
Half hours long

1963
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:18,400
Is it

1964
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:22,240
Everything Alex says is true

1965
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:24,288
He pulled out this subsection

1966
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,592
Paragraph

1967
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,872
And oh my God

1968
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:28,640
He's right

1969
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:29,920
He must know everything

1970
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:32,480
The actual Tech

1971
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:34,016
Fighting

1972
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:37,856
Does not agree with what he was saying

1973
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:41,952
We talked about this on the last episode he's winning the battle of

1974
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:43,744
And it's f****** insane

1975
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:47,072
No one looks

1976
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:48,352
You're saying

1977
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:49,120
Yeah

1978
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:49,888
Then you'd

1979
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:51,168
Just get to say whatever you want

1980
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:54,496
I am

1981
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:55,264
1

1982
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:59,104
I'm so mad

1983
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:04,992
Just discussing our roles earlier prior to the show is like

1984
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:12,928
Is to try and make this

1985
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:18,304
And then you went on this

1986
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,096
Fury rent bikes

1987
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:24,960
That's your f****** job my friend hours of batteries in your f****** job right there

1988
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:25,984
Your job is to

1989
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:27,264
Be filled with

1990
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,056
Samuel Jackson

1991
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:33,408
Eureka Pacific study says

1992
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,480
Felipe

1993
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:37,248
Evil show

1994
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:40,064
Like that's what that is

1995
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:41,856
It's banking on people being dumb

1996
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:43,648
But here's the thing about

1997
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:48,256
That just like the the thing that I immediately thought of was all of the

1998
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:49,536
The executive orders

1999
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:50,560
Trump has pulled out

2000
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:51,584
And the past cup

2001
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:53,376
Yeah

2002
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:54,400
Blatantly

2003
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:55,936
Clearly either

2004
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:57,216
Unconstitutional

2005
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:58,240
Orally

2006
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:01,312
Take a step back

2007
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:03,616
Weird weird weird

2008
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:05,408
They've all been

2009
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:06,944
Steve Alban

2010
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,480
Seemed to suit actual

2011
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:12,576
Using part about that was while you were reading that

2012
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:13,344
Whole like

2013
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:14,624
Subsection

2014
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:20,768
How could anybody

2015
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:21,536
Possibly paid

2016
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:22,304
Detention list

2017
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,864
And then you realize oh that's why they're all on

2018
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:30,496
He doesn't read those subsection that were built in there

2019
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:35,104
This is a thing now I like that that's what happened

2020
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:38,944
It's legislating by order as a

2021
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:43,040
Social order by order like

2022
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:46,880
It shouldn't be it's like there's all these

2023
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:49,696
These little rules in their government should work

2024
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:51,488
Essentially by negotiation of

2025
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:55,840
Because conservative

2026
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:57,632
Point

2027
01:49:57,888 --> 01:49:58,400
Anymore

2028
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:02,240
Conserve

2029
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:05,824
No it's all they've all lost their by the political philosophy of

2030
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:06,848
Small government

2031
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:07,872
States rights

2032
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:13,504
And I think I think that there's a conversation that should be

2033
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,528
She had and

2034
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:19,136
That has to do with that

2035
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:22,208
Could have been had where we not where we are

2036
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:25,280
Political philosophy is

2037
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:26,304
Better government

2038
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:28,608
Especially the federal government

2039
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:29,888
What is best

2040
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:30,912
Buy disc

2041
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:31,936
Degree invoices

2042
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:33,472
Having an argument

2043
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:35,776
Negotiating with each other

2044
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:36,800
Compromising

2045
01:50:37,056 --> 01:50:38,848
But that's why we're losing

2046
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:42,944
He don't you and I both have this idea of a

2047
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:43,968
Effective governance

2048
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:49,344
He has lost their mind and gone like hey how about instead of that we

2049
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:53,696
Look at this

2050
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:54,976
This code

2051
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:55,744
About restrict

2052
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,024
Interviews of human subjects

2053
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,048
For testing a biologic

2054
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,072
Chemical agent

2055
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:04,704
Really well-written but if you also look at it

2056
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,824
Didn't exist in the original version

2057
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:10,848
The greeting for

2058
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:13,408
Consent

2059
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:15,200
In those very small

2060
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:16,992
Tails

2061
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:17,760
To put this

2062
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:22,880
Somehow all of this

2063
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:28,256
Would be right any it's not

2064
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:30,560
If somebody didn't give a

2065
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:32,352
The fuc to that my level

2066
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:34,656
It would be chaos

2067
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:40,800
Is the people who run things do not give a f*** to that much

2068
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:43,616
Level dislike Alex Jones

2069
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:50,272
Go on Joe Rogan show

2070
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:51,552
Characters

2071
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:58,464
He's bad news.

2072
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:00,768
Clip is pretty fun

2073
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:03,584
Transition out of me yelling about it

2074
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:12,032
So I need to know I need to know

2075
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:13,824
And how much are aliens real

2076
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:17,920
Okay

2077
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:22,272
Camp horno Charlotte

2078
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,576
What is Donald Trump

Oh yeah it was he know now right cuz he's in the office

2080
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:34,048
The first thing I did

2081
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:35,584
The office

2082
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,376
Who's got the documents

2083
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:40,448

People don't

2121
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:30,272

2122
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:34,624

To the wall

2133
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:57,152

Please don't interrupt this

2136
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:04,832
It's a synthesis

2137
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:06,112
Of a belief

2138
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,392
And

2139
01:55:08,928 --> 01:55:10,464
Some thoughts that I need to

2140
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,256
Explain

2141
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:13,024
Already

2142
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:14,816
I will allow this

2143
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:16,608
Enjoy to happen

2144
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:29,664
Right

2145
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:36,064
Metaphysical religion

2146
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:39,136
Play is on air

2147
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:42,720
He prays on air

2148
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:43,488
He said he didn't

2149
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:44,768
Beatles

2150
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:46,816
Yeah I'm sorry

2151
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:53,216
I told you not to interrupt your internet so f******

2152
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:57,824
The rest of this is

2153
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:08,832
What's happening

2154
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:12,672
Okay

2155
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:14,976
I wouldn't use that word with full confidence

2156
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:17,792
I've never said that let me give you a basic just stalled

2157
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:20,096

2158
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:35,200
The Forever at the secrets of the universe

2159
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:38,784
But the good ones don't ever want to organize

2160
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:42,624
Powerful

2161
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:47,488
Consciousness is don't

2162
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:51,072
Until things are really late

2163
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:04,128
It's a false hologram

2164
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:07,456
Artificial the computers are

2165
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:10,016
Ascensionpoint

2166
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:12,320
He's bleeding in

2167
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:15,136
This universe

2168
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:22,048
Such a wisp in some computer program

2169
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:43,808
Species

2170
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:49,696
Destroy

2171
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:56,096
Which level we want to go to we

2172
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:00,960
Believe

2173
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:10,944
Where they're going to merge with machines

2174
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:17,600
Which is kind of like a full transmission

2175
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:22,720
About building

2176
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:23,744
And so

2177
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:24,768
Google setup

2178
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:31,424
Is the longest

2179
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,192
Stream

2180
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:33,472
Uninterrupted

2181
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:34,496
Insanity

2182
01:58:34,752 --> 01:58:35,264
Heard

2183
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:36,288
Since I got off the

2184
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:39,872
But also

2185
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:45,760
Can see the length of this clip that you cute

2186
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:47,552
I can see how we still got

2187
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:48,576
11 + 1/2

2188
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:49,856
Million more minutes to go

2189
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:51,136
No there's like three

2190
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:54,720
That was taking notes

2191
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:56,256
I halfway through that because it

2192
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:57,280
It's clearly

2193
01:58:59,072 --> 01:59:00,608
All of One

2194
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:03,168
Dimensions don't work like how he thinks dimension

2195
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:04,960
No but if it does

2196
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:08,032
He saw Doctor Strange is like

2197
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:09,312
What happened

2198
01:59:10,336 --> 01:59:11,872
He is f******

2199
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:13,664
12 Dimensions nobody

2200
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:15,712
What no

2201
01:59:15,968 --> 01:59:16,992
Einstein

2202
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:18,784
Play Selena

2203
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:25,952
What are constants

2204
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:29,792
If there's anything that you can say about plank it is at plank

2205
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:31,584
Never said there were 12 dementia

2206
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:37,984
StubHub

2207
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:39,264
Transmissions

2208
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:42,080
Yeah below the third dimension

2209
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:47,712
Into the third dimension demon on the 5th

2210
01:59:47,968 --> 01:59:48,736
They're six dimension

2211
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:51,040
I feel like he's confusing

2212
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:56,672
With Lord of the Rings

2213
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:58,208
With

2214
01:59:58,464 --> 01:59:59,488
Dante's Inferno

2215
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:02,304
What's going on right different

2216
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:04,352
Max Planck

2217
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:08,704
Only one other than

2218
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:12,800
Challenger

2219
02:00:13,056 --> 02:00:13,568
Length

2220
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:14,336
Of things

2221
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:16,384
Like it is constant

2222
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:18,432
Is asked to do with

2223
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:20,480
Yeah

2224
02:00:20,736 --> 02:00:22,528
Yep Mike was a vacuum

2225
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:24,064
And stuff like that

2226
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:28,928
All regular stuff 00 mention of the twelfth dimension

2227
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:29,952
So Jordan

2228
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:32,256
What you need to know about this

2229
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:34,304
Is a lot of the stuff that he's spouting

2230
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,328
Comes from

2231
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:36,352
An anonymous post

2232
02:00:36,608 --> 02:00:37,632
That was put on Reddit

2233
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:39,936
Exactly

2234
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:41,216
Years and years ago

2235
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:43,008
I read all of this

2236
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,032
Like

2237
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:45,568
8 years ago

2238
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:46,336
Or so

2239
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:51,200
Honestly him spouting this stuff

2240
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:52,224
Andre

2241
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:54,016
Show while he's really drunk

2242
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:55,040
And being like this is

2243
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:56,320
The big thing

2244
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:59,136
It's actually disappointing

2245
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:01,184
Bandannas

2246
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:02,208
Bit worse

2247
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:05,280
What we've been talking about for the rest

2248
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:07,328
These episodes where it's like the globe

2249
02:01:07,584 --> 02:01:09,376
It's worse than that

2250
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:10,400
No

2251
02:01:10,912 --> 02:01:13,216
Yeah that's Pure Fantasy.

2252
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:14,240
That's a f******

2253
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:16,544
Dragons

2254
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,592
Song novel by Ann McCrary

2255
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:22,176
It's important to point that out

2256
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:23,200
Because

2257
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:25,504
When he says he has sources

2258
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:26,784
It's very

2259
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:29,344
Always

2260
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,112
Has

2261
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:31,648
And they are

2262
02:01:31,904 --> 02:01:32,416
Very

2263
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:34,976
High up there always very high up

2264
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:36,768
His sources are so

2265
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:37,536
Buried

2266
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:38,816
Yeah and expert

2267
02:01:39,328 --> 02:01:41,376
It is hard to imagine that he is not in

2268
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:43,168
Infiltrated every single level

2269
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:46,752
A government every single level of Technology

2270
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:49,824
Everybody possible to your like

2271
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:50,848
The only place

2272
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:52,896
Doesn't know a lot about is

2273
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:56,736
Guatemala because he thinks there's a f****** wall there

2274
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:58,528
I'm not sure that I actually have this

2275
02:01:58,784 --> 02:02:00,320

Podcast

2278
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:02,880
You like I was talking

2279
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:03,648
Come to a head of state

2280
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:05,952
Which

2281
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:08,768
Name

2282
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:11,840
Donald Trump Donald Trump would it be

2283
02:02:12,096 --> 02:02:16,960
God we're all going to have such great sources

2284
02:02:17,216 --> 02:02:18,496
State

2285
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:25,920
Yes yes

2286
02:02:26,176 --> 02:02:26,688
Righteous anger

2287
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:34,880
Okay I need to be clear when I'm talking about all of the

2288
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:36,928
Patrol post

2289
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:41,024
Nadia's already years ago or so

2290
02:02:43,072 --> 02:02:44,608
She's taking from there

2291
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:47,936
But saying he doesn't believe it's what the elite

2292
02:02:48,192 --> 02:02:48,704
Believe

2293
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:50,752
But will you have tubal would you have

2294
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:52,288
2 take away from that

2295
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:55,104
Is that he believes that the elites believe that

2296
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:56,640
Important

2297
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:58,688
The fact that he says

2298
02:02:58,944 --> 02:02:59,968
Is kind of a dog

2299
02:03:00,736 --> 02:03:03,552
Believe it and there's some power in

2300
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:05,600
When it's a fantasy narrative

2301
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:08,416
Yeah so anyway the rest of the script is going to play

2302
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:12,768
He talks about this and a later clip which will get back to at the end of the show

2303
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:13,792
Eyewear

2304
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:15,584
Kind of invalidates a lot of things

2305
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:20,704
Let's enjoy the latest

2306
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:26,848
Let's get on this Willy Wonka at boat into

2307

Enjoy the ride where Joe calls him out on

2308
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:30,944
But not nearly enough

2309
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:36,320
Artificial system

2310
02:03:36,576 --> 02:03:41,952
The first artificial intelligence will be

2311
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:43,744
Based on the neuron

2312
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:49,632
The billions of people

2313
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:56,032
Walmart.com

2314
02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:06,016
Future prediction powers

2315
02:04:13,952 --> 02:04:19,072
The future

2316
02:04:19,328 --> 02:04:25,472
Consciousness

2317
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:27,264
Everyone knowing our hopes and dreams

2318
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:33,664
Delivering

2319
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:38,528
Pleasure

2320
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:49,024
The shutter shop

2321
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:56,448
Cut off the pedophiles

2322
02:04:56,704 --> 02:05:02,848
Control system

2323
02:05:15,904 --> 02:05:18,976
What is a population

2324
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:21,792
Why is 40 weeks talking about

2325
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:26,400
Explain that you just

2326
02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:28,960
Preacher tells you about his tummy control

2327
02:05:33,568 --> 02:05:34,080
Porsche

2328
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:39,968
Rather than the divine

2329
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:01,472
That's not an answer

2330
02:06:01,984 --> 02:06:04,032
But also I will say this I didn't

2331
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:10,432
Keep this particular cuz that was way too long but Jo-Jo does bring up the

2332
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:15,040
Understanding where technology is going to go and sort of

2333
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:18,624
That was

2334
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:20,672
That was the robots of dawn

2335
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:25,024
Timeline described

2336
02:06:25,792 --> 02:06:28,096
Literally from iRobot

2337
02:06:29,376 --> 02:06:30,912
The foundation

2338
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:32,704
And Isaac Asimov nozzle

2339
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:38,080
I think that's what he read that's what he described every single step of the way

2340
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:41,152
Was going to happen we're going to have

2341
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:42,688
How to deal with and I think this

2342
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:44,224
Document actually

2343
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:45,760
Takes Alex

2344
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:47,552
A different category in my mind

2345
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:54,208
Like I really think it's important interdimensional beat

2346
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:57,536
Nobody

2347
02:06:58,560 --> 02:06:59,328
I I think

2348
02:06:59,584 --> 02:07:00,608
List

2349
02:07:00,864 --> 02:07:01,888
Experience

2350
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:04,704
I hate hearing him say

2351
02:07:05,472 --> 02:07:07,776
Crazy Legs

2352
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:10,848
I have to deal with him on two levels

2353
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:13,152
Cuz you're the propaganda

2354
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:19,040
The 3rd

2355
02:07:19,296 --> 02:07:20,064
There

2356
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:23,136
Footlight I believe

2357
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:25,440
That he is a propaganda

2358
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:27,488
Yes but I also

2359
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,536
Have to wrestle with the fact

2360
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:31,840
He knows the difference

2361
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:33,120
Between fiction and reality

2362
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:36,192
No he absolutely does not he constantly brings up

2363
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:41,568
Lots of movies like pointed out

2364
02:07:41,824 --> 02:07:43,104
Huge part of his phone

2365
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:44,896
Alright

2366
02:07:45,152 --> 02:07:47,200
We're going to go with now we've had it

2367
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:53,600
Isaac Asimov Elysium seems to be really and is a Zeitgeist going to go with

2368
02:07:53,856 --> 02:07:59,744
The Matrix

2369
02:08:00,256 --> 02:08:02,048
I really think that I'm not saying

2370
02:08:03,072 --> 02:08:07,936
Phrenic or anything like that but I think that there is a part of his brain that is unable to

2371
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:09,984
To grasp what is real and what is

2372
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:10,752
Fart

2373
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:12,544
Like I really don't know if he

2374
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:13,568
Until

2375
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:15,872
Because when I read that

2376
02:08:16,128 --> 02:08:16,640
Huge

2377
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:17,408
Long

2378
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:23,808
Post that was clearly famous sacrifice yourself so the rest of us don't have ticket

2379
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:30,208
I went around

2380
02:08:30,464 --> 02:08:32,000
Then I enjoyed it for what it was

2381
02:08:32,512 --> 02:08:33,024
Oppression of

2382
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:34,048
Oven

2383
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:36,096
People online

2384
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:39,936
Indispensable interesting way that wasn't abusive

2385
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:42,496
Did that long postumia seem to be like

2386
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:47,104
This is someone f****** around but doing it really well

2387
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:53,248
There's another great example if you guys are listening are the guy claimed to be a time traveler

2388
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:54,016
I am

2389
02:08:54,272 --> 02:08:54,784
Gave a bunch of

2390
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:56,064
Very wrong prediction

2391
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:57,600
About what can happen in Spanish

2392
02:08:58,112 --> 02:09:00,672
But it was real loud house really interesting

2393
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:01,952
It was fun

2394
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:06,816
Yeah and like I like all of those like all the times already see that pic

2395
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:08,352
That's like

2396
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:15,008
Nextel phone

2397
02:09:15,264 --> 02:09:16,800
300

2398
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:22,176
Verily like Nicolas Cage

2399
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:26,272
But also got an idiot

2400
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:29,344
If you're unable to realize the variables that

2401
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:31,136
It exists within a population of

2402
02:09:31,392 --> 02:09:33,696
Billions

2403
02:09:35,488 --> 02:09:37,536
We live in a world

2404
02:09:37,792 --> 02:09:39,584
Statistically anything that could happen

2405
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:41,632
MaxPrep

2406
02:09:42,912 --> 02:09:46,496
Realizing that he's got a few gradually running out of righteous

2407
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:51,872
Okay this is Alex realizing

2408
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:52,640
Somebody's got to put on

2409
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:53,920
Alright

2410
02:09:54,176 --> 02:10:00,320
The globalist are in

2411
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:06,720
Do with the luciferian Freemasonry

2412
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:12,864
I thank God for you and brother

2413
02:10:21,824 --> 02:10:27,968
Go for it

2414
02:10:34,624 --> 02:10:36,672
Alex

2415
02:10:36,928 --> 02:10:43,072
Walmart

2416
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:53,312
Just to give some context of work

2417
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:56,640
Smoke weed earlier but also.

2418
02:10:57,152 --> 02:10:59,712
They were talking about how I Buzz Aldrin

2419
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:00,480
Interviews

2420
02:11:00,736 --> 02:11:02,016
Just talked about Heather

2421
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:05,600
Buzz Aldrin

2422
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:10,464
He eats whether that or he's nowhere else

2423
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:14,304
There's a formation on Jupiter's moon or Venus

2424
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:15,328
Is the moon Phobos

2425
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:16,608
Or whatever there's like a

2426
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:20,704
Or demote earlier in the show

2427
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:24,800
Alex was talking about how Buzz Aldrin came on his show

2428
02:11:25,056 --> 02:11:28,384
And told him a bunch of Truth

2429
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:29,152
And they pulled up

2430
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:31,456
Video of him saying

2431
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:32,992
You set a reminder show first

2432
02:11:36,576 --> 02:11:38,880
Gears world give Eddie Bravo some really nice

2433
02:11:39,392 --> 02:11:40,160
The whole time he's like

2434
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:46,048
These fight with you

2435
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:52,448
I love I love Eddie Bravo's it like The Narrative of this episode has been dead

2436
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:54,496
Bravo going from sycophant to

2437
02:11:55,008 --> 02:11:55,776
Hey Alex

2438
02:11:57,312 --> 02:11:59,872
Topic attorney wants to know

2439
02:12:00,128 --> 02:12:00,640
Yeah

2440
02:12:00,896 --> 02:12:03,200
As a curiosity that is

2441
02:12:03,456 --> 02:12:08,064
I think Eddie realizes that

2442
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:13,440
Music Charming little hours ago

2443
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:19,072
You shouldn't believe in vaccines are terrible and also

2444
02:12:19,328 --> 02:12:20,608
Chemtrails are stupid

2445
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:23,936
He's one of those

2446
02:12:24,448 --> 02:12:25,216
I'm gullible

2447
02:12:25,472 --> 02:12:30,592
Makes him so susceptible

2448
02:12:30,848 --> 02:12:31,616
Yeah he means

2449
02:12:32,128 --> 02:12:34,944
World to be a better place

2450
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:40,064
People are screwing people over

2451
02:12:40,576 --> 02:12:41,088
He believes

2452
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:43,392
Then his fellow man

2453
02:12:44,416 --> 02:12:46,464
Underneath the Tyranny that is m

2454
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:48,000
Imaginary Trails of

2455
02:12:48,512 --> 02:12:49,536
You're so right

2456
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:52,096
I mean like I don't have this clip but it

2457
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:55,168
At some point in the episode he's talking about one of his interest

2458
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:59,264
I have a kid I don't want my kid to

2459
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:00,800
Live in a world that I could have

2460

I'm so you are you're right there where is motivated from

2461
02:13:06,432 --> 02:13:07,712

Has this one very

2466
02:13:17,696 --> 02:13:19,744
Simple like fork in the road where it's like

2467
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:22,048
You give him one set of information

2468
02:13:22,304 --> 02:13:22,816
Kitchen at 1

2469
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:26,144
In his life

2470
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:26,912
Publix

2471
02:13:27,168 --> 02:13:31,008
Defender giving up everything to defend the

2472
02:13:31,264 --> 02:13:32,032
Poor in The Help

2473
02:13:32,544 --> 02:13:35,360
Has one angle

2474
02:13:35,616 --> 02:13:37,664
Asking Alex Jones whether or not chemtrails

2475
02:13:39,456 --> 02:13:40,224
Pure-hearted

2476
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:45,600
Martial arts instructor

2477
02:13:46,112 --> 02:13:49,440
In the world

2478
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:52,768
Well Joe If Logan knows him

2479
02:13:53,024 --> 02:13:59,168
Joe Rogan

2480
02:13:59,424 --> 02:14:01,472
Because people have been murdered on his

2481
02:14:02,752 --> 02:14:03,520
Anyway

2482
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:33,216
Is there a

2483
02:14:35,264 --> 02:14:36,544
Subspecies

2484
02:14:38,336 --> 02:14:39,616
Darwin stuff came from

2485
02:14:44,224 --> 02:14:50,368
Restaurant

2486
02:15:11,104 --> 02:15:17,248
And you sit there and act like you don't know about it

2487
02:15:17,504 --> 02:15:22,368
Motorsport

2488
02:15:23,392 --> 02:15:27,488
So that was Alex realizing he had to show up do you know he's drunk and he's like

2489
02:15:30,816 --> 02:15:31,840
Alex

2490
02:15:32,608 --> 02:15:34,656
Going

2491
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:37,472
Winter break

2492
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:42,848
I've got a shift into my own mode

2493
02:15:44,128 --> 02:15:46,176
No

2494
02:15:46,432 --> 02:15:52,576
Well there was this is going to be Isaac

2495
02:15:53,856 --> 02:15:54,880
Does he believe all that nonsense

2496
02:15:55,136 --> 02:15:55,904
Descartes

2497
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:56,672
No thank you

2498
02:15:56,928 --> 02:15:59,744
I also want to give credit I don't have the rest of the clip

2499
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:03,328
Ramble the whole bunch

2500
02:16:03,584 --> 02:16:04,352
2

2501
02:16:04,608 --> 02:16:06,144
Apparently the guy who

2502
02:16:08,192 --> 02:16:08,704
Newton

2503
02:16:12,288 --> 02:16:12,800
Within 2

2504
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:15,360
Answer that

2505
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:18,432
What the hell I mean

2506
02:16:18,688 --> 02:16:20,992
Darwin was into a bunch of weird

2507
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:21,760
In that

2508
02:16:22,016 --> 02:16:25,600
He was part of a club that was all about eating as many

2509
02:16:25,856 --> 02:16:26,368
Different types of Anna

2510
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:30,976
My weird to me

2511
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:32,768
Have you even asked

2512
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:33,792
Never would

2513
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:38,912
How to write interesting

2514
02:16:39,168 --> 02:16:39,936
What are you doing

2515
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:46,592
Can I walk I don't know

2516
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:50,688
But imagine that you know what there's no point

2517
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:53,504
The thing is they

2518
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:55,552
Plenty of insane

2519
02:16:56,064 --> 02:16:57,856
Like they're mentioning of test

2520
02:16:58,368 --> 02:17:00,672
Tesla was not somebody who believed in the

2521
02:17:00,928 --> 02:17:02,464
You called and then became

2522
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:06,560
Smart Tesla with somebody who is so unbelievably ridiculous

2523
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:07,328
Wesley capable

2524
02:17:08,096 --> 02:17:08,608
Holding

2525
02:17:09,888 --> 02:17:11,424
Purely

2526
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:13,472
Physiological images inside of a

2527
02:17:13,728 --> 02:17:14,752
This had that week

2528
02:17:15,008 --> 02:17:15,520
Can't really like

2529
02:17:15,776 --> 02:17:16,288
I can't

2530
02:17:16,544 --> 02:17:18,080
Even comprehend the idea of

2531
02:17:18,592 --> 02:17:19,360
Holding entire me

2532
02:17:20,128 --> 02:17:20,640
Schematics

2533
02:17:21,152 --> 02:17:22,176
Inside of my brain

2534
02:17:22,432 --> 02:17:23,712
Like he couldn't even write it down

2535
02:17:25,248 --> 02:17:26,528
Was a f****** genius

2536
02:17:26,784 --> 02:17:29,600
It's like he figured out Wireless power and we're still work

2537
02:17:29,856 --> 02:17:31,904
Working on it I'm 100 years later

2538
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:32,672
Then I am too

2539
02:17:34,976 --> 02:17:38,304
If you were that guy living in a world full of the rest of us

2540
02:17:39,328 --> 02:17:41,120
Why wouldn't you believe crazy nonsense

2541
02:17:41,376 --> 02:17:42,144
Straight

2542
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:45,472
Now Descartes on the other hand Descartes was a meth

2543
02:17:45,728 --> 02:17:47,008
Not a legit

2544
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:50,592
Even then it was

2545
02:17:50,848 --> 02:17:53,152
Because of his Affinity to Mac

2546
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:55,200
All of all of his

2547
02:17:55,456 --> 02:17:59,296
All of his syllogisms word purely if

2548
02:18:01,088 --> 02:18:02,112
It was already

2549
02:18:02,368 --> 02:18:02,880
Exactly

2550
02:18:03,136 --> 02:18:04,416
Now Isaac

2551
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:06,464
And was a Purell

2552
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:07,488
Alchemist

2553
02:18:07,744 --> 02:18:10,560
Where is like

2554
02:18:11,584 --> 02:18:12,096
Gold

2555
02:18:12,608 --> 02:18:13,120
God

2556
02:18:13,376 --> 02:18:13,888
The whole shebang

2557
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:16,704
So what's your point

2558
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:20,032
As it relates to Alex my point being as it relates

2559
02:18:20,544 --> 02:18:22,336
To the nonsense that Alex

2560
02:18:23,616 --> 02:18:24,128
Is that

2561
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:26,944
At no time does he engage with

2562
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:27,968
What

2563
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:28,736
Did

2564
02:18:29,504 --> 02:18:35,648
Call about the Sierra mountains

2565
02:18:37,696 --> 02:18:38,208
Beautiful

2566
02:18:38,464 --> 02:18:39,232
Interested in the fact

2567
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:40,512
They get this information

2568
02:18:42,560 --> 02:18:43,072
They get it

2569
02:18:43,584 --> 02:18:44,096
Transdimensional

2570
02:18:44,352 --> 02:18:44,864
Dimensional being

2571
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:46,912
What to do

2572
02:18:49,216 --> 02:18:50,752
That's the end of that question

2573
02:18:51,264 --> 02:18:52,544
Right there

2574
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:56,128
Here is a fun clip

2575
02:18:58,176 --> 02:18:59,712
But it's short

2576
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:18,400
Inside

2577
02:19:18,656 --> 02:19:21,728
Women

2578
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:23,776
Versus a bunch of Potbelly

2579
02:19:25,824 --> 02:19:28,128
That's the one that's a war

2580
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:29,152
But the war man

2581
02:19:29,664 --> 02:19:30,176
Steak

2582
02:19:30,432 --> 02:19:31,456
Cigars and p****

2583
02:19:31,712 --> 02:19:32,224
Versus

2584
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:33,760
Potbelly

2585
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:39,904
I didn't know it would call that an over-simplification

2586
02:19:40,672 --> 02:19:43,232
Yet somehow that is not a strong enough

2587
02:19:43,744 --> 02:19:44,768
Yeah

2588
02:19:45,024 --> 02:19:46,048
I didn't isolate this

2589
02:19:46,304 --> 02:19:48,096
Because what surrounded it wasn't

2590
02:19:48,864 --> 02:19:49,632
But there was a point

2591
02:19:51,424 --> 02:19:51,936
Alex

2592
02:19:52,704 --> 02:19:55,264
Probably like 2 hours into the episode is like

2593
02:19:55,776 --> 02:19:56,544
Black

2594
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:57,824
Full grown women

2595
02:19:58,336 --> 02:19:59,360
Of course

2596
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:02,176
I get it you can just stop

2597
02:20:08,832 --> 02:20:10,368
8

2598
02:20:10,624 --> 02:20:11,136
Almost like

2599
02:20:11,392 --> 02:20:12,160
Can be a very

2600
02:20:12,416 --> 02:20:13,696
White version of

2601
02:20:13,952 --> 02:20:14,720
The lady.

2602
02:20:14,976 --> 02:20:16,000
Protest too much

2603
02:20:16,512 --> 02:20:20,352
So we have a couple hang yourself

2604
02:20:23,424 --> 02:20:24,448
I will get back

2605
02:20:24,704 --> 02:20:25,472
Text to

2606
02:20:25,728 --> 02:20:26,240
The dumb

2607
02:20:26,752 --> 02:20:29,056
Weirdo Illuminati narrative from earlier

2608
02:20:29,312 --> 02:20:30,336
But this one

2609
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:31,360
Is

2610
02:20:31,616 --> 02:20:32,128
Alex

2611
02:20:32,384 --> 02:20:33,152
Drunk

2612
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:34,688
To f****** make a cup

2613
02:20:34,944 --> 02:20:37,504
Argument

2614
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:38,784
The discussion

2615
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:40,832
Obama's birth certificate

2616
02:20:41,088 --> 02:20:41,600
It comes up

2617
02:20:42,112 --> 02:20:42,880
And it's

2618
02:20:43,648 --> 02:20:44,928
So fucken bizarre

2619
02:20:46,976 --> 02:20:50,560
I genuinely think we should start to

2620
02:20:51,328 --> 02:20:53,632
Save all of my notes pages

2621
02:20:53,888 --> 02:20:59,008
Auto be too because I had to talk

2622
02:20:59,264 --> 02:21:04,128
This looks like the ramblings of it this is like

2623
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:05,408
The Notebook

2624
02:21:05,664 --> 02:21:11,808

Kind of long I want to let it play Jay

Like I don't want to interrupt and get rid of contacts cuz

2638

Power to figure it out

2654

02:24:51,968 --> 02:24:54,272
I'm sorry to interrupt I did Google all day

2665
02:25:00,416 --> 02:25:01,696
I'm just like you

2666
02:25:04,256 --> 02:25:05,536
Okay

2667
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:09,888
Also that is not at all how he presented on his own show

2668
02:25:10,144 --> 02:25:10,656
At all

2669
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:12,704
Generally speaking

2677
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:34,208
That was thoroughly debunked

2678
02:25:34,464 --> 02:25:35,744
Over and over and over again

2679
02:25:36,256 --> 02:25:36,768
How many times

2680
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:43,168
25 million would you stay over and over again over and over and over and over

2681
02:25:43,424 --> 02:25:46,496
How many overs Against Humanity over

2682
02:25:52,896 --> 02:25:54,944
I wasn't early on Obama supporter

02:26:25,664 --> 02:26:26,176
Dads

2685
02:26:38,208 --> 02:26:41,792
+ 6 + 7 is

2686
02:26:48,448 --> 02:26:49,216
And then

2687
02:26:49,472 --> 02:26:52,800
Harvard Law review

2688
02:26:53,056 --> 02:26:56,384

Across

2691
02:27:09,952 --> 02:27:10,720
Which is still

2692
02:27:22,496 --> 02:27:23,520
Country

2693
02:27:40,672 --> 02:27:45,536
Okay she saying is this home from Ireland

2694
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:06,784
What did someone like me

2695
02:28:09,088 --> 02:28:15,232
Maybe made an incorrect judgement

2696
02:28:15,488 --> 02:28:16,256
Information

2697
02:28:29,312 --> 02:28:30,592
He did

2698
02:28:36,992 --> 02:28:40,576
Wow why is that

2699
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:43,392
Front

2700
02:28:49,024 --> 02:28:51,072
Communist famous pornographer

2701
02:28:51,584 --> 02:28:54,144
Somersworth

2702
02:29:12,064 --> 02:29:12,832
And so

2703
02:29:20,768 --> 02:29:23,072
I mean that's a rambla goddamn

2704
02:29:37,152 --> 02:29:40,224
Why there

2705
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:43,552
Is the birth certificate

2706
02:29:44,064 --> 02:29:45,600
Alright

2707
02:29:47,392 --> 02:29:48,160

Frank Marshall Davis

2711
02:29:53,024 --> 02:29:54,304
He's dead the CIA

2712
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:56,864
Maybe isn't it

2713
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:59,680
Obama's mom was a CIA operative

2714
02:29:59,936 --> 02:30:01,984
A groom by the CIA from birth

2715
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:02,752
Alright

2716
02:30:03,008 --> 02:30:03,776
Now 1

2717
02:30:04,544 --> 02:30:05,056
Apple juice

2718
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:06,592
You keep saying

2719
02:30:07,616 --> 02:30:09,920
I'm cute I feel like he's not just drink

2720
02:30:10,944 --> 02:30:11,456
No and

2721
02:30:11,712 --> 02:30:12,224
The end

2722
02:30:14,528 --> 02:30:17,600
Drinking it like water

2723
02:30:17,856 --> 02:30:19,392
It looks like

2724
02:30:19,648 --> 02:30:22,464
It sounds like he's drinking it like

2725
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:24,768
Pictures of him just pouring shots and see like

2726
02:30:25,024 --> 02:30:25,536
Joe's face

2727
02:30:27,072 --> 02:30:28,608
Like there's a couple that dope

2728
02:30:28,864 --> 02:30:31,168
Play on audio so I didn't have plenty.

2729
02:30:32,704 --> 02:30:33,216
Okay

2730
02:30:33,472 --> 02:30:34,752
So Trump got involved

2731
02:30:35,008 --> 02:30:35,776
Because he got caught

2732
02:30:36,288 --> 02:30:39,360
That's the story that you will

2733
02:30:39,616 --> 02:30:40,640
Get out

2734
02:30:40,896 --> 02:30:44,224
The whole thing is Trump is in nocuous ruin the

2735
02:30:46,272 --> 02:30:48,064
It all came it was progenerate

2736
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:52,672
B*******

2737
02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:53,696
Straight b*******

2738
02:30:54,208 --> 02:30:55,232
Alrighty so

2739
02:30:57,024 --> 02:30:58,304
Somehow

2740
02:30:58,816 --> 02:30:59,328
1

2741
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:02,144
Alcoholics are mad at him for drinking too much

2742
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:04,448
That. Came up

2743
02:31:06,752 --> 02:31:09,824
Joe Rogan and clearly

2744
02:31:13,152 --> 02:31:14,944
Yeah but I mean

2745
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:17,760
Alcoholic

2746
02:31:18,016 --> 02:31:20,320
I'm still up

2747
02:31:20,576 --> 02:31:21,088
Already

2748
02:31:22,624 --> 02:31:26,720
But yeah that is very lovable hero in this

2749
02:31:26,976 --> 02:31:27,744
In this all fake

2750
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:30,816
Between an alcoholic and a functional

2751
02:31:31,584 --> 02:31:33,888
You know that those two things are very different

2752
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:38,752
Behavior is indicative of an alcoholic

2753
02:31:39,008 --> 02:31:39,520
I can drink

2754
02:31:40,032 --> 02:31:44,896
And not really be a professional alcoholic

2755
02:31:45,152 --> 02:31:47,712
As opposed to might be part of Arkham

2756
02:31:47,968 --> 02:31:54,112
Median life.

2757
02:31:55,392 --> 02:31:55,904
Alright

2758
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:58,208
I like that

2759
02:31:58,464 --> 02:32:00,000
Alex Jones said that he

2760
02:32:01,024 --> 02:32:03,328
Sure because I don't know if that's a

2761
02:32:03,584 --> 02:32:04,096
Thing that's

2762
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:07,168
Will my therapist like to tell me that shame mean

2763
02:32:07,424 --> 02:32:07,936
I'm bad

2764
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:09,472
I did something

2765
02:32:10,496 --> 02:32:14,592
So when you're ashamed of that means that you're indicating that you are bad

2766
02:32:15,104 --> 02:32:18,688
Your behavior was actually bad it wasn't just an action it was something about you

2767
02:32:18,944 --> 02:32:20,992
Yourself so what you're saying is on her next podcast

2768
02:32:21,248 --> 02:32:22,016
Your therapist is

2769
02:32:22,272 --> 02:32:23,040
Is going to be a guest right

2770
02:32:23,296 --> 02:32:24,576
I wish

2771
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:26,880
Sing Lady

2772
02:32:27,136 --> 02:32:28,416
There's so much

2773
02:32:28,672 --> 02:32:30,208
There's always another clip

2774
02:32:30,464 --> 02:32:31,744
That was the thing that I listen

2775
02:32:32,256 --> 02:32:32,768
Thinking

2776
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:34,816
Every single time

2777
02:32:35,072 --> 02:32:38,400
Every single time that he

2778
02:32:38,656 --> 02:32:40,192
It's because you didn't watch the right

2779
02:32:41,984 --> 02:32:42,496
The right thing

2780
02:32:42,752 --> 02:32:44,800
If you watch this rainbow in the sky

2781
02:32:45,056 --> 02:32:45,568
The clip

2782
02:32:48,128 --> 02:32:51,456
Not at all

2783
02:32:51,712 --> 02:32:55,552
There's ice that supports whatever I used

2784
02:32:56,064 --> 02:32:57,088
From about

2785
02:32:57,344 --> 02:32:57,856
Our point

2786
02:32:58,368 --> 02:32:58,880
Restarts drink

2787
02:32:59,392 --> 02:33:00,672
Throughout this episode

2788
02:33:00,928 --> 02:33:01,440
Okay

2789
02:33:01,696 --> 02:33:03,232
His face

2790
02:33:03,744 --> 02:33:04,512
Is this smog

2791
02:33:06,304 --> 02:33:07,072
Smogon

2792
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:15,264
Whenever whenever

2793
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:16,288
Title 50

2794
02:33:16,544 --> 02:33:17,568
Chapter 32 Subs

2795
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:19,360
I haven't written down that's why I can

2796
02:33:19,616 --> 02:33:21,152
Are you remember

2797
02:33:23,456 --> 02:33:24,736
There was a look on his face

2798
02:33:26,784 --> 02:33:29,344
I've convinced

2799
02:33:29,856 --> 02:33:32,416
I have been to the Mountaintop

2800
02:33:32,928 --> 02:33:34,208
There wasn't it never asked

2801
02:33:34,464 --> 02:33:36,256
It didn't look like friends interaction

2802
02:33:37,024 --> 02:33:38,048
15 from Josie

2803
02:33:39,328 --> 02:33:40,608
And it really looks

2804
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:41,632
Someone who's like

2805
02:33:42,656 --> 02:33:43,680
Like I made it through this trial

2806
02:33:44,192 --> 02:33:46,496
Well yeah go everything is okay I don't

2807
02:33:48,544 --> 02:33:49,312
That lead to anyone

2808
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:50,592
Who isn't

2809
02:33:51,104 --> 02:33:54,176
Drinking the Kool-Aid so to speak you look like a

2810
02:33:54,432 --> 02:33:54,944
Total idiot

2811
02:33:57,504 --> 02:33:58,016
Cuz

2812
02:33:58,272 --> 02:33:59,552
Default position

2813
02:34:00,320 --> 02:34:00,832
Explain

2814
02:34:01,088 --> 02:34:01,600
Sing to me

2815
02:34:03,392 --> 02:34:04,160
There's a

2816
02:34:05,184 --> 02:34:06,208
So every it

2817
02:34:06,464 --> 02:34:08,256
The amazing thing about

2818
02:34:09,024 --> 02:34:10,304
That long list of

2819
02:34:11,328 --> 02:34:11,840
Was that it

2820
02:34:12,096 --> 02:34:12,608
It seems like

2821
02:34:12,864 --> 02:34:14,144
Every single thing

2822
02:34:14,400 --> 02:34:15,168
He said letting

2823
02:34:15,424 --> 02:34:16,192
To the next thing

2824
02:34:16,448 --> 02:34:17,728
And yet they are

2825
02:34:17,984 --> 02:34:18,496
Completely

2826
02:34:18,752 --> 02:34:19,776
And utterly unrelated

2827
02:34:20,544 --> 02:34:22,336
And I should say it does go on

2828
02:34:22,592 --> 02:34:26,176
Frank Marshall Davis

2829
02:34:26,688 --> 02:34:27,200
But have you

2830
02:34:28,736 --> 02:34:33,856
Frank Marshall

2831
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:35,392
Right

2832
02:34:38,464 --> 02:34:38,976
Is that safe

2833
02:34:39,232 --> 02:34:40,000
They put up

2834
02:34:40,512 --> 02:34:41,024
A shot

2835
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:42,048
A picture on screen

2836
02:34:42,816 --> 02:34:43,840
Davis Obama

2837
02:34:44,096 --> 02:34:44,864
Dad and Obama

2838
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:48,704
You looked exactly like almonds

2839
02:34:49,984 --> 02:34:52,800
I don't know

2840
02:34:53,056 --> 02:34:53,824
Is Joe is like

2841
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:58,432
I don't know I think it looks like his dad more than he looks.

2842
02:34:58,944 --> 02:35:02,016
And there's no response cuz of course

2843
02:35:02,528 --> 02:35:04,320
Would you say cuz of course

2844
02:35:04,576 --> 02:35:05,856
I withhold judgement I don't

2845
02:35:14,304 --> 02:35:15,840
I'm sure you've done research

2846
02:35:16,096 --> 02:35:18,912
My job is to please

2847
02:35:19,168 --> 02:35:19,680
Listen to this

2848
02:35:19,936 --> 02:35:20,448
I do

2849
02:35:20,704 --> 02:35:22,240
I can't fully explain it

2850
02:35:22,752 --> 02:35:24,544
But I didn't know that

2851
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:26,336
A lot of sources I've been able to

2852
02:35:26,592 --> 02:35:27,104
How to find

2853
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:27,872
Site

2854
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:29,152
Fake

2855
02:35:29,408 --> 02:35:30,176
College ID

2856
02:35:30,944 --> 02:35:32,480
Alright that has that name

2857
02:35:32,736 --> 02:35:33,504
That's all I ever

2858
02:35:34,272 --> 02:35:36,832
Be at the aliases theme to be photoshopped

2859
02:35:37,088 --> 02:35:37,856
Identification

2860
02:35:39,392 --> 02:35:43,744
It goes back to the idea of that there was this whole narrative that

2861
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:46,304
No one that went to college

2862
02:35:47,072 --> 02:35:47,584
Remembers

2863
02:35:48,096 --> 02:35:48,608
Except for all the

2864
02:35:49,632 --> 02:35:50,400
Right

2865
02:35:52,192 --> 02:35:52,704
Don't worry about that

2866
02:35:54,496 --> 02:35:55,008
Because his actual

2867
02:35:55,776 --> 02:35:56,800
Barry Soetoro

2868
02:35:57,824 --> 02:35:58,848
I don't I don't know

2869
02:35:59,104 --> 02:36:02,176
I'm not interested in this narrative cuz I I dip I dip

2870
02:36:06,272 --> 02:36:07,040
Cool and I was like

2871
02:36:12,928 --> 02:36:14,464
Smelter

2872
02:36:15,744 --> 02:36:18,560
Down all of the you like little Angela

2873
02:36:19,584 --> 02:36:20,352
And I am

2874
02:36:20,608 --> 02:36:21,888
To see one that's related

2875
02:36:22,912 --> 02:36:23,680
Can you

2876
02:36:24,192 --> 02:36:24,704
The other ones

2877
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:27,776
So that the whole

2878
02:36:28,544 --> 02:36:29,568
Idea behind this

2879
02:36:30,592 --> 02:36:31,104
Question and an

2880
02:36:32,128 --> 02:36:33,408
Set up

2881
02:36:33,664 --> 02:36:34,176
Yes

2882
02:36:34,688 --> 02:36:35,200
Okay

2883
02:36:36,992 --> 02:36:38,016
Was there any

2884
02:36:38,528 --> 02:36:39,040
Like

2885
02:36:39,808 --> 02:36:40,576
Evidence

2886
02:36:42,368 --> 02:36:44,160
So all all the

2887
02:36:44,928 --> 02:36:47,232
All the time I wrote it more like what

2888
02:36:47,488 --> 02:36:50,048
All the stuff that I rode

2889
02:36:50,304 --> 02:36:51,328
Do you like one

2890
02:36:51,584 --> 02:36:53,376
The first thing I wrote is Bravo's

2891
02:36:55,936 --> 02:36:56,960
That's what I that's

2892
02:36:57,216 --> 02:37:01,056
The only thing that ate all of my nose I can confirm 100%

2893
02:37:02,592 --> 02:37:05,152
My favorite character so far

2894
02:37:05,408 --> 02:37:07,712
It's like a lot of our friends who get high all the time there

2895
02:37:07,968 --> 02:37:10,016
Being high in all of our episodes

2896
02:37:10,528 --> 02:37:12,064
Braless is our hero at this one

2897
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:14,112
Does Bravo not Bravo's like it

2898
02:37:14,368 --> 02:37:16,416
It's Game of Thrones

2899
02:37:16,672 --> 02:37:19,488
Eddie Bravo

2900
02:37:23,328 --> 02:37:27,680
Keep me from saying his name is Kevin Bravo or Eddie Bravo

2901
02:37:29,472 --> 02:37:31,008
Three more clips

2902
02:37:32,288 --> 02:37:32,800
Okay

2903
02:37:33,568 --> 02:37:34,336
Here's my ultimate

2904
02:37:36,896 --> 02:37:39,200
I have no idea what the f*** he is trying to say

2905
02:37:39,712 --> 02:37:41,504
Neither do I

2906
02:37:42,272 --> 02:37:43,296
Anyway

2907
02:37:43,808 --> 02:37:45,088
We get back to the elites

2908
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:46,368
What their plan is

2909
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:47,392
Yes

2910
02:37:47,648 --> 02:37:49,184
And Alex brings out

2911
02:37:50,208 --> 02:37:50,720
Example

2912
02:37:51,488 --> 02:37:52,256
One of the evil

2913
02:37:52,512 --> 02:37:53,024
Members

2914
02:37:53,792 --> 02:37:54,816
Of the elite cabal

2915
02:37:55,328 --> 02:37:55,840
Interdimensional

2916
02:37:56,352 --> 02:37:57,376
And then I want to get props

2917
02:37:58,144 --> 02:37:59,680
Joe kind of

2918
02:38:04,288 --> 02:38:05,312
What's the movie with the big picture

2919
02:38:05,568 --> 02:38:07,104
Please admit

2920
02:38:25,024 --> 02:38:26,048
Have Regional Wars

2921
02:38:26,560 --> 02:38:28,096
Play people off against each other

2922
02:38:28,864 --> 02:38:33,728
Send it

2923
02:38:35,776 --> 02:38:41,920
Who are the Elite like when you say the elite who are these people how do they get together

2924
02:38:43,456 --> 02:38:49,600
Who votes to the Superbowl

2925
02:38:49,856 --> 02:38:56,000
The same thing

2926
02:38:56,256 --> 02:39:02,400
Bilderberg Group

2927
02:39:04,448 --> 02:39:04,960
Davos

2928
02:39:05,728 --> 02:39:10,336
Club of Rome is a population reduction group.com right now

2929
02:39:10,592 --> 02:39:11,616

02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:21,344
Or she's part of a secret

2931
02:39:24,416 --> 02:39:29,536
But I like killing people

2932
02:39:32,608 --> 02:39:35,424

2933
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:41,056

02:39:48,992 --> 02:39:55,136
Turn on the news

2936
02:39:59,488 --> 02:40:05,632
When someone like her says something about reducing the amount of

2937
02:40:05,888 --> 02:40:07,680
Birth control

2938
02:40:07,936 --> 02:40:14,080
Construed into population control

2939
02:40:14,336 --> 02:40:18,944
Start saying she's

She's pushing

2941
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:31,744
Like to have you ever been in here what they said

They just pulled rrtiming on that didn't

2944
02:40:40,704 --> 02:40:42,752

02:40:53,504 --> 02:40:59,648
Construed into population control

2949
02:40:59,904 --> 02:41:02,720
In control

2950
02:41:02,976 --> 02:41:09,120
Time

2951
02:41:09,376 --> 02:41:15,520

02:41:30,624 --> 02:41:34,208
McFlurry

2958
02:41:34,464 --> 02:41:36,000
Mangrove

Yeah and antonym I recommend everybody look into the real story

2960
02:41:42,912 --> 02:41:43,424
It's insane

2961
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:49,056
No. No one cared look when you

2962
02:41:51,104 --> 02:41:52,384
If you go after Oprah

02:41:54,432 --> 02:41:54,944
Shitz wrong with

2964
02:41:55,712 --> 02:41:58,528
Any best nightmare

Whatever he's mad at her about that

2971
02:42:11,328 --> 02:42:12,608
There is zero

2972
02:42:12,864 --> 02:42:15,936
Of all the people

2973
02:42:16,448 --> 02:42:18,752
Maybe Ellen DeGeneres

2974
02:42:19,008 --> 02:42:20,800
Is the lesser of like

2975
02:42:21,312 --> 02:42:21,824
Okay

2976
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:22,592
Do notice

Never widen

2980
02:42:26,944 --> 02:42:27,456
Mail

2981
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:30,528
It's not a coincidence

2982
02:42:31,040 --> 02:42:33,856
Everybody credibly

2983
02:42:34,112 --> 02:42:35,136
Santa that you would

2984
02:42:35,648 --> 02:42:37,952
Say that about RS

2985
02:42:38,208 --> 02:42:38,976
Race-blind

2986
02:42:39,488 --> 02:42:40,512
Alex

2987
02:42:40,768 --> 02:42:42,560
Who is never talked about race

2988
02:42:42,816 --> 02:42:46,656
On his show how Cody why would somebody label him as a bigot

2989
02:42:47,168 --> 02:42:48,704
There's a whole episode we never cover

2990
02:42:49,472 --> 02:42:51,776
Screwed by Don Lemon

2991
02:42:52,288 --> 02:42:58,432
Because I don't know what yeah yeah that's one thing

2992
02:42:58,688 --> 02:43:04,832
I know I don't want to I don't want to get into that argument there

2993
02:43:05,088 --> 02:43:07,392
Area where we find

2994
02:43:07,648 --> 02:43:08,160
Together

2995
02:43:10,208 --> 02:43:11,488
The clip is the

2996
02:43:14,304 --> 02:43:15,584
Listen for it

2997
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:16,352
Joe says

2998
02:43:18,912 --> 02:43:19,936
Just isolated one of them

2999
02:43:20,448 --> 02:43:20,960
It's the gray

3000
02:43:21,472 --> 02:43:21,984
Nail it

3001
02:43:22,496 --> 02:43:28,384
Junior size that can make you think

3002
02:43:28,896 --> 02:43:31,200
Stock dis I'm going with

3003
02:43:31,712 --> 02:43:34,272
Eddie is talking about hypothetical situations

3004
02:43:34,528 --> 02:43:35,040
Where Jeff

3005
02:43:35,296 --> 02:43:36,064
Cave kid died

3006
02:43:36,320 --> 02:43:36,832
Before

3007
02:43:38,624 --> 02:43:39,136
He started going after

3008
02:43:40,160 --> 02:43:40,672
Anyway

3009
02:43:40,928 --> 02:43:41,440
Sure

3010
02:43:49,632 --> 02:43:52,960
I'm coming after you

3011
02:43:57,568 --> 02:43:59,616
Just because it's like

3012
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:02,944
Couple times

3013
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:03,712
Glasnost

3014
02:44:04,736 --> 02:44:05,504
What's

3015
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:06,784
Just keep bringing the whiskey

3016
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:11,648
What's a good Eddie Bravo is our conscience as Bravo is our guide

3017
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:16,000
Yeah I guess Eddie Bravo and every aspect of what he say

3018
02:44:16,512 --> 02:44:17,024
Houston

3019
02:44:18,304 --> 02:44:19,328
If your kid dies

3020
02:44:19,584 --> 02:44:22,656
Basically Eddie Bravo is giving you life

3021
02:44:22,912 --> 02:44:24,704
To believe that taken

3022
02:44:24,960 --> 02:44:25,472
Israel

3023
02:44:26,240 --> 02:44:27,008
Easy

3024
02:44:27,264 --> 02:44:27,776
Let you know

3025
02:44:30,592 --> 02:44:32,128
Pushing

3026
02:44:32,384 --> 02:44:33,152
3 hours

3027
02:44:33,408 --> 02:44:34,432
We were always going to

3028
02:44:35,968 --> 02:44:37,760
This next clip is where at

3029
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:40,064
The ghost a little bit

3030
02:44:41,600 --> 02:44:42,368
It shows his cards

3031
02:44:42,880 --> 02:44:43,392
Let's play

3032
02:44:44,416 --> 02:44:48,000
Globalism is like neocolonialism but it's corporate

3033
02:44:48,768 --> 02:44:49,792

Depopulation

3038

Centralized systems of Monopoly

02:45:11,808 --> 02:45:13,088
Why do they want stop innovation

3040
02:45:14,624 --> 02:45:16,672
Because I see it

How is Donald Trump going to stop this a bolt came off the

Course

3052

This is this pronounce this tax plan

3054

It's on his website

3056
02:46:48,831 --> 02:46:49,599
And

3057
02:46:51,903 --> 02:46:54,975
What's on there

3058
02:46:58,303 --> 02:47:00,351
Previously presented as

3059
02:47:00,607 --> 02:47:01,375
Like

3060
02:47:01,631 --> 02:47:02,655
There's going to be lower taxes

3061
02:47:02,911 --> 02:47:04,447

Tax plan

3068
02:47:15,711 --> 02:47:17,759
People who make very little would have to pay note

3069
02:47:18,527 --> 02:47:19,039
Riches

3070
02:47:20,063 --> 02:47:21,855
Through now

3071
02:47:23,135 --> 02:47:24,415
Will not

3072
02:47:25,695 --> 02:47:26,719
People who make

3073
02:47:27,487 --> 02:47:29,279
Very little are exempt from taxes

3074
02:47:29,535 --> 02:47:30,815
That's called a progressive

3075
02:47:31,071 --> 02:47:32,095
Texas.

3076
02:47:32,351 --> 02:47:32,863
Exist now

3077
02:47:33,119 --> 02:47:34,399
For a good reason

3078
02:47:34,655 --> 02:47:36,703
There was somebody else that exist

3079
02:47:37,215 --> 02:47:37,727
Way better

3080
02:47:37,983 --> 02:47:38,751
There's a bunch of

3081
02:47:39,007 --> 02:47:39,519
Assistance

3082
02:47:39,775 --> 02:47:40,543
I'm done on

3083
02:47:41,055 --> 02:47:41,567
Trump

3084
02:47:41,823 --> 02:47:42,335
Proposed

3085
02:47:43,615 --> 02:47:44,127
And

3086
02:47:44,383 --> 02:47:45,151
Whatever

3087
02:47:45,407 --> 02:47:45,919
Sound is

3088
02:47:47,455 --> 02:47:48,991
The bigger tax cuts under Trump

3089
02:47:49,503 --> 02:47:51,551
Who would have guessed

3090
02:47:52,319 --> 02:47:53,087
The lowest

3091
02:47:53,855 --> 02:47:54,623
Income group

3092
02:47:54,879 --> 02:47:55,391
Would be

3093
02:47:55,903 --> 02:47:56,415
Point6

3094
02:47:56,927 --> 02:47:57,439
Percent

3095
02:47:57,695 --> 02:47:58,207
Cut on there

3096
02:47:58,975 --> 02:48:00,511
Yeah

3097
02:48:01,535 --> 02:48:04,351
Percent of whatever bulshit they're making is almost nothing

3098
02:48:06,143 --> 02:48:11,519
I mean when you make very little 6% is more important

3099
02:48:11,775 --> 02:48:13,311
Yeah it does matter

3100
02:48:13,823 --> 02:48:16,127
But when you make a lot

3101
02:48:16,639 --> 02:48:19,967
The middle day there which would be what

3102
02:48:20,223 --> 02:48:22,783
Are we okay

3103
02:48:23,039 --> 02:48:25,087
47

3104
02:48:26,111 --> 02:48:27,135
The analysis broke into

3105
02:48:27,391 --> 02:48:28,159
La Quinta

3106
02:48:28,415 --> 02:48:29,439
Pittsburgh 55

3107
02:48:30,463 --> 02:48:30,975
What's the top 5

3108
02:48:31,487 --> 02:48:32,511
Let me take a guess

3109
02:48:32,767 --> 02:48:33,279
As to what their toys

3110
02:48:34,815 --> 02:48:35,839
Percentage-wise

3111
02:48:37,119 --> 02:48:37,887
Laurette

3112
02:48:38,143 --> 02:48:39,679
Are you going lower

3113
02:48:39,935 --> 02:48:40,447
Ultimate tag

3114
02:48:40,703 --> 02:48:41,471
Okay the top

3115
02:48:43,263 --> 02:48:44,287
Let's go with

3116
02:48:45,311 --> 02:48:46,079
3:40

3117
02:48:48,127 --> 02:48:48,639
No

3118
02:48:48,895 --> 02:48:51,199
They're great

3119
02:48:51,455 --> 02:48:53,759
The top is 31.1

3120
02:48:54,015 --> 02:48:55,807
So they're going to lower it to

3121
02:48:56,319 --> 02:48:56,831
Streamyx

3122
02:48:57,087 --> 02:48:57,855
Write 27

3123
02:48:58,111 --> 02:48:58,623
7.9

3124
02:48:59,391 --> 02:48:59,903
The three-point

3125
02:49:00,159 --> 02:49:00,927
2% drop

3126
02:49:01,695 --> 02:49:03,231
You know what that's not as bad as

3127
02:49:03,743 --> 02:49:04,511
It in the top

3128
02:49:04,767 --> 02:49:05,279
Quintile

3129
02:49:06,303 --> 02:49:07,071
Let's betapa

3130
02:49:07,327 --> 02:49:07,839
Group

3131
02:49:09,119 --> 02:49:10,399
Now if you break it down even

3132
02:49:10,655 --> 02:49:11,423
Further the top one

3133
02:49:12,703 --> 02:49:13,215
Drops

3134
02:49:13,471 --> 02:49:13,983
6.5

3135
02:49:15,263 --> 02:49:16,543
Course and the top of one

3136
02:49:16,799 --> 02:49:17,823
Point one

3137
02:49:18,079 --> 02:49:18,591
Percent

3138
02:49:18,847 --> 02:49:19,871
Drop seven points

3139
02:49:20,895 --> 02:49:22,943
Wonderful

3140
02:49:23,455 --> 02:49:23,967
Keep more of their money

3141
02:49:24,223 --> 02:49:26,015
I was really concerned that they

3142
02:49:26,271 --> 02:49:26,783
I had to

3143
02:49:27,295 --> 02:49:28,575
Proposal

3144
02:49:30,623 --> 02:49:31,135
Lower tax

3145
02:49:31,647 --> 02:49:34,463
For poor people but Inn in Council

3146
02:49:37,023 --> 02:49:38,815
Got rid of the mortgage

3147
02:49:39,071 --> 02:49:42,143

3148

02:49:44,191 --> 02:49:45,471
And our rivers are now poised

3150
02:49:45,727 --> 02:49:48,031
Yeah. Rivers are now on fire

3151
02:49:48,287 --> 02:49:53,151
Exactly going to go back to the old days of Cleveland are rivers to be made of Fire

3152
02:49:53,663 --> 02:49:55,199
Instead of water

3153
02:49:55,455 --> 02:49:56,479
Yeah but the

3154
02:49:58,527 --> 02:49:59,039
But there is

3155
02:49:59,295 --> 02:49:59,807
Is like this

3156
02:50:02,111 --> 02:50:03,647
Text thing that

3157
02:50:03,903 --> 02:50:04,415
Super

3158

Progressive

3159
02:50:06,207 --> 02:50:06,975
Is b*******

3160
02:50:07,231 --> 02:50:07,999
Complete

3161
02:50:08,255 --> 02:50:10,303
It's it's an absolute live

3162
02:50:10,559 --> 02:50:11,327
Sounds good

3163
02:50:11,583 --> 02:50:12,863
Like the way that represent

3164
02:50:13,119 --> 02:50:14,143
It does sound good

3165
02:50:14,655 --> 02:50:16,447
But upon further analysis

3166
02:50:17,471 --> 02:50:17,983
Decent

3167
02:50:18,751 --> 02:50:19,263

Things lightly last night

But there's huge tax breaks for the rich

3170
02:50:26,943 --> 02:50:27,967
Slightly less

3171
02:50:28,479 --> 02:50:30,783
But you're going to wind up getting way fewer benefits

3172
02:50:33,599 --> 02:50:35,391
One more

What do you mean

3188
02:51:16,351 --> 02:51:18,399
What I say is not political

3189
02:51:19,167 --> 02:51:21,471
And it's not from my particular

3190
02:51:21,983 --> 02:51:24,031
Okay

3191
02:51:24,287 --> 02:51:24,799
Okay

3192
02:51:31,199 --> 02:51:32,479

It's not in the third dimension door Bailey receiving transmission

3198
02:51:44,767 --> 02:51:47,839
That doesn't make sense

Beetlejuice

I don't believe it

3205
02:52:10,623 --> 02:52:16,767
I'm simply telling you what

The very short lives

3211
02:52:41,599 --> 02:52:42,367
Because we're like a

Channel live

3214
02:52:54,655 --> 02:52:57,215
Because we live so close to the Sun

3215
02:53:00,287 --> 02:53:01,823
So

3216
02:53:03,871 --> 02:53:05,151

02:53:12,319 --> 02:53:13,599
And we're trying to progress

3221

Well let's just say we're not in Kansas anymore

02:54:12,223 --> 02:54:15,551
And all those words

3229
02:54:17,087 --> 02:54:22,207
I did those words are not connected to other words in all of those words

3230
02:54:22,719 --> 02:54:28,863
No not not money I've heard a lot of those words before but never in the order that those words were said

3231
02:54:29,119 --> 02:54:33,215
Those were the crazies

3232
02:54:33,727 --> 02:54:36,543
Call the word does make total sense

3233
02:54:36,799 --> 02:54:40,127
If you know it makes total sense if you have access

3234
02:54:40,383 --> 02:54:40,895
2

3235
02:54:41,151 --> 02:54:41,919
Like a lot of this

3236
02:54:42,175 --> 02:54:43,199
Weirdo internet

3237
02:54:43,711 --> 02:54:44,991
Like it so it's part of the

3238
02:54:45,503 --> 02:54:48,319
Acres Acres Acres

3239
02:54:50,111 --> 02:54:51,135
Resources that aren't real

3240
02:54:52,415 --> 02:54:53,951
Do this thing where he believes his

3241
02:54:54,207 --> 02:54:54,719
Listcrawlers

3242
02:54:55,231 --> 02:54:56,767
The call in the tell him like

3243
02:54:57,023 --> 02:54:58,047
Hey.

3244
02:54:58,303 --> 02:54:58,815
Build Memphis

3245
02:54:59,071 --> 02:55:04,703
. she is out on the road maybe company received

3246
02:55:05,983 --> 02:55:10,591
Something on a message board and it becomes reality

3247
02:55:11,103 --> 02:55:17,247
It's the same thing over and over and over again this is the thing

3248
02:55:17,503 --> 02:55:20,575
About this episode that makes me

3249
02:55:21,087 --> 02:55:21,855
Question a lot of it

3250
02:55:22,111 --> 02:55:23,135
Things that upset another episode

3251
02:55:23,647 --> 02:55:25,183
Is this is him with his guard down

3252
02:55:25,439 --> 02:55:28,767
Yeah like this is not him performing this is him letting

3253
02:55:29,535 --> 02:55:30,559
What he believes

3254
02:55:35,679 --> 02:55:37,215
Performative

3255
02:55:37,727 --> 02:55:41,055
Well no not even that like me speaking from the heart he's drunk

3256
02:55:41,567 --> 02:55:42,335
He's f****** high

3257
02:55:42,591 --> 02:55:43,103
He's letting it

3258
02:55:45,407 --> 02:55:46,431
Apologize for

3259
02:55:46,687 --> 02:55:47,199
Rhyming

3260
02:55:48,479 --> 02:55:50,271
No I I will

3261
02:55:50,527 --> 02:55:51,039
Never forget

3262
02:55:51,807 --> 02:55:53,343
No he's

3263
02:55:54,367 --> 02:55:55,135
Reviewing

3264
02:55:55,391 --> 02:55:57,183
All of those deep-seated beliefs he have

3265
02:55:57,439 --> 02:55:58,463
Which is

3266
02:55:59,743 --> 02:56:00,255
Ratchet

3267
02:56:00,511 --> 02:56:01,279
Saturday like

3268
02:56:01,535 --> 02:56:02,303
He's as like

3269
02:56:02,815 --> 02:56:05,631
Simple idea that dimensions

3270
02:56:06,143 --> 02:56:07,167
Exist the way that

3271
02:56:07,423 --> 02:56:08,191
He's described him

3272
02:56:08,703 --> 02:56:09,727
It's so insane

3273
02:56:12,031 --> 02:56:17,663
That's exactly that's the least of the insane things he said

3274
02:56:17,919 --> 02:56:24,063
Like he's adjusting said like oh we're on the third dimension you're like well that's the least crazy

3275
02:56:24,319 --> 02:56:30,463
Crazy thing you've said we exist in three dimensions like I meditate a lot

3276
02:56:30,975 --> 02:56:34,303
Just like lucid dreams been things that I

3277
02:56:34,815 --> 02:56:35,583
Tapped into that

3278
02:56:36,095 --> 02:56:40,703
Just my brain something from outside myself

3279
02:56:40,959 --> 02:56:43,007
It seems like that idea of like

3280
02:56:43,775 --> 02:56:44,799
Cured existence

3281
02:56:45,567 --> 02:56:48,383
Maybe there's something to it you know what I'm not going to

3282
02:56:48,639 --> 02:56:52,479
To base my world that is exactly where we become

3283
02:56:52,735 --> 02:56:53,247
Fred

3284
02:56:53,503 --> 02:56:57,343
My Spear of the government

3285
02:56:57,855 --> 02:57:00,159
The old

3286
02:57:00,671 --> 02:57:06,815
How is it that inter-dimensional beings is the least of what we're talking about

3287
02:57:07,071 --> 02:57:08,607
Believes in interdimensional beings

3288
02:57:09,631 --> 02:57:10,399
Beetle

3289
02:57:10,655 --> 02:57:11,167
Googlys

3290
02:57:11,679 --> 02:57:17,055
Yeah from

3291
02:57:17,311 --> 02:57:19,359
Batman is drunk Batman

3292
02:57:19,615 --> 02:57:20,127
F*** off

3293
02:57:20,383 --> 02:57:22,431
He's very drunk I'm not going to

3294
02:57:23,967 --> 02:57:26,271
Listen to a lot of episodes Logan

3295
02:57:26,527 --> 02:57:27,551
I never heard him

3296
02:57:28,063 --> 02:57:28,575
Cut someone off

3297
02:57:28,831 --> 02:57:29,343
Batshit

3298
02:57:30,111 --> 02:57:31,903
Like I've never heard him be like a bar

3299
02:57:32,415 --> 02:57:32,927
And be like

3300
02:57:38,303 --> 02:57:40,607
Okay alright alright

3301
02:57:40,863 --> 02:57:42,655
If he lets more he's gone

3302
02:57:42,911 --> 02:57:47,263
Let's let's get into our final like this is the final part of this pie

3303
02:57:47,519 --> 02:57:48,543
We are done with the clip

3304
02:57:48,799 --> 02:57:49,311
Alright

3305
02:57:49,567 --> 02:57:52,383
I will say that the show does go on a little bit

3306
02:57:56,479 --> 02:57:57,503
I didn't want to play bikes

3307
02:57:57,759 --> 02:57:58,527
Some of the embarrassing

3308
02:57:59,039 --> 02:58:03,135
Front clips

3309
02:58:03,647 --> 02:58:04,671
It's really embarrassing

3310
02:58:07,231 --> 02:58:07,743
In the shoulder

3311
02:58:10,815 --> 02:58:11,583
Like its 8

3312
02:58:11,839 --> 02:58:12,351
Why can

3313
02:58:12,607 --> 02:58:13,887
Idiot who don't want it

3314
02:58:14,143 --> 02:58:14,655
The party whose

3315
02:58:15,935 --> 02:58:16,447
Like trying to

3316
02:58:19,775 --> 02:58:22,847
It actually made me feel very dirty and it's part of the amp

3317
02:58:23,103 --> 02:58:23,871
Apathy part

3318
02:58:24,127 --> 02:58:25,919
Lakewood Manor

3319
02:58:26,687 --> 02:58:27,199
Yeah

3320
02:58:27,455 --> 02:58:30,015
And I don't think

3321
02:58:30,527 --> 02:58:31,039
Man I've been there

3322
02:58:31,295 --> 02:58:37,183
Castle being without looking it up

3323
02:58:37,439 --> 02:58:38,719
There's an episode

3324
02:58:38,975 --> 02:58:40,255
My friends

3325
02:58:40,511 --> 02:58:41,279
Some friends

3326
02:58:41,535 --> 02:58:43,071
Of mine did a radio show

3327
02:58:43,327 --> 02:58:44,095
In Columbia Missouri

3328
02:58:44,351 --> 02:58:46,399
That went from 2 to 5 in the

3329
02:58:46,911 --> 02:58:50,751
That's the wrong time to have a radio show it was a local access

3330
02:58:52,031 --> 02:58:53,823
People would show up

3331
02:58:54,079 --> 02:58:54,591
Get drunk at

3332
02:58:55,871 --> 02:58:58,175
On my birthday 1 year I went

3333
02:58:59,199 --> 02:58:59,711
Getting wasted

3334
02:58:59,967 --> 02:59:00,735
Access

3335
02:59:00,991 --> 02:59:01,759
I just start

3336
02:59:03,551 --> 02:59:04,319
Talk about a Great Neck

3337
02:59:05,343 --> 02:59:05,855
Where was

3338
02:59:06,111 --> 02:59:07,135
I ramble

3339
02:59:08,415 --> 02:59:09,439
I'm I don't even

3340
02:59:09,695 --> 02:59:10,719
I'm embarrassed

3341
02:59:15,583 --> 02:59:21,727
And then they keep cuz you're out

3342
02:59:21,983 --> 02:59:23,007
Alright

3343
02:59:23,263 --> 02:59:24,287
I did that

3344
02:59:24,543 --> 02:59:26,079
On my birthday 1 year and then like

3345
02:59:26,335 --> 02:59:26,847
Year later

3346
02:59:27,103 --> 02:59:28,383
I found out that my brother had

3347
02:59:30,431 --> 02:59:31,455
We of the audio of

3348
02:59:33,759 --> 02:59:36,575
The people because he thought it was hilarious

3349
02:59:36,831 --> 02:59:38,111
It's probably Hilaire

3350
02:59:38,623 --> 02:59:39,647
I can't I can

3351
02:59:39,903 --> 02:59:41,439
Can't muster the courage to listen

3352
02:59:41,695 --> 02:59:42,207
Intuit

3353
02:59:42,463 --> 02:59:42,975
But

3354
02:59:43,231 --> 02:59:46,303
It's

3355
02:59:46,559 --> 02:59:48,095
Real talk

3356
02:59:48,351 --> 02:59:52,447
I will put that out for them

3357
02:59:53,471 --> 02:59:56,031
I get the idea of being too drunk

3358
02:59:56,543 --> 02:59:57,055
Broadcast

3359
02:59:57,311 --> 02:59:59,359
That's one thing I empathize

3360
03:00:00,127 --> 03:00:00,639
I get that

3361
03:00:01,151 --> 03:00:03,455
When I was on that broadcast I wasn't

3362
03:00:03,711 --> 03:00:04,223
I'm trying to explain

3363
03:00:04,479 --> 03:00:06,015
Plain truth about the globalist

3364
03:00:06,271 --> 03:00:08,063
Well that's just talk

3365
03:00:08,575 --> 03:00:10,879
That's the conversation for us

3366
03:00:11,135 --> 03:00:11,647
To have

3367
03:00:11,903 --> 03:00:12,415
Right now

3368
03:00:13,439 --> 03:00:17,791
At what point are we going to get into the the hole in vino veritas

3369
03:00:18,815 --> 03:00:20,607
Like literally no

3370
03:00:21,119 --> 03:00:21,887
Like okay

3371
03:00:22,143 --> 03:00:23,167
Is he drunk

3372
03:00:23,423 --> 03:00:24,447
Look and high enough

3373
03:00:24,703 --> 03:00:25,727
To tell the truth

3374
03:00:25,983 --> 03:00:27,775
Or is he drunk

3375
03:00:28,287 --> 03:00:29,055
Too high

3376
03:00:29,567 --> 03:00:30,079
To make a

3377
03:00:31,103 --> 03:00:32,127
Here's where I would draw the

3378
03:00:33,151 --> 03:00:34,431
What I was on that show

3379
03:00:35,199 --> 03:00:35,711
On my birthday

3380
03:00:35,967 --> 03:00:36,479
Pikachu in the morning

3381
03:00:38,015 --> 03:00:40,063
I didn't say anything that I don't agree with

3382
03:00:40,831 --> 03:00:41,855
How do you spell nickel

3383
03:00:44,159 --> 03:00:45,183
I might have said some hack

3384
03:00:45,439 --> 03:00:45,951
Joke

3385
03:00:46,207 --> 03:00:47,487
I might have repeated something

3386
03:00:47,743 --> 03:00:49,791
Things that I heard other places

3387
03:00:50,047 --> 03:00:50,815
I have conversation

3388
03:00:52,351 --> 03:00:55,423
Unpredictable

3389
03:00:56,447 --> 03:00:57,471
I believe

3390
03:00:58,751 --> 03:01:00,799
That I don't think of it when you're drunk

3391
03:01:01,055 --> 03:01:01,823
Your your truest

3392
03:01:02,079 --> 03:01:03,103
Form right

3393
03:01:03,359 --> 03:01:05,151
But I think when you're wasted

3394
03:01:05,407 --> 03:01:07,199
You're capable of coming up with some

3395
03:01:09,503 --> 03:01:10,015
Okay

3396
03:01:10,271 --> 03:01:11,295
That's interesting

3397
03:01:11,551 --> 03:01:12,319
Interesting idea

3398
03:01:13,087 --> 03:01:13,599
I think that is

3399
03:01:13,855 --> 03:01:15,903
It's a middle ground

3400
03:01:16,159 --> 03:01:17,439
Mentally ill person

3401
03:01:17,951 --> 03:01:20,255
Of the bipolar

3402
03:01:22,559 --> 03:01:24,607
We get it yeah

3403
03:01:25,375 --> 03:01:28,447
For the rest of your life

3404
03:01:28,703 --> 03:01:29,471
Jordan get a f******

3405
03:01:29,727 --> 03:01:31,775
Impersonality I thought you was diagnosis

3406
03:01:32,031 --> 03:01:33,567
Dumb

3407
03:01:34,847 --> 03:01:38,687
How about develop your own

3408
03:01:40,991 --> 03:01:43,039
As far as my experience

3409
03:01:43,551 --> 03:01:44,063
That right

3410
03:01:44,319 --> 03:01:45,599
So when I'm manic

3411
03:01:46,367 --> 03:01:51,231
It is not that I am accessing some sort of inner self that

3412
03:01:51,743 --> 03:01:53,279
He's not allowed to come out

3413
03:01:53,535 --> 03:01:54,047
Whenever I'm under

3414
03:01:54,303 --> 03:01:54,815
Control

3415
03:01:55,071 --> 03:01:56,095
So much as it is

3416
03:01:56,607 --> 03:01:57,887
AA like

3417
03:01:58,143 --> 03:01:58,655
Constance

3418
03:02:00,703 --> 03:02:01,727
Aspects of creation

3419
03:02:02,495 --> 03:02:04,287
Every single moment

3420
03:02:04,543 --> 03:02:05,567
Is me creating some

3421
03:02:05,823 --> 03:02:06,335
Pneumonia

3422
03:02:07,615 --> 03:02:08,895
So what are oppressive

3423
03:02:09,151 --> 03:02:09,663
Yeah

3424
03:02:09,919 --> 03:02:10,431
Recipe

3425
03:02:10,687 --> 03:02:11,199
Yeah

3426
03:02:11,455 --> 03:02:14,015
To the point where the moment that I've just created his

3427
03:02:14,271 --> 03:02:14,783
The only mama

3428
03:02:15,295 --> 03:02:15,807
Everett

3429
03:02:17,599 --> 03:02:18,623
Another one

3430
03:02:19,903 --> 03:02:21,951
Is going to be way better than the one that I just said

3431
03:02:22,207 --> 03:02:22,975
Yeah

3432
03:02:23,231 --> 03:02:25,279
However not what I would describe

3433
03:02:25,791 --> 03:02:26,303
Drunk ass

3434
03:02:27,071 --> 03:02:28,095
Like to me being

3435
03:02:28,351 --> 03:02:29,119
Drunk is

3436
03:02:29,375 --> 03:02:30,399
Is just loosening

3437
03:02:30,655 --> 03:02:31,423
All of those

3438
03:02:32,191 --> 03:02:32,959
Those guards

3439
03:02:34,495 --> 03:02:36,799
So to me listening to him talk

3440
03:02:37,311 --> 03:02:38,079
When he is s***

3441
03:02:39,871 --> 03:02:40,639
When he wakes up

3442
03:02:40,895 --> 03:02:41,663
The next day say

3443
03:02:43,967 --> 03:02:45,247
I was drunk

3444
03:02:45,503 --> 03:02:46,527
And I shouldn't have said that

3445
03:02:47,295 --> 03:02:47,807
Not

3446
03:02:48,063 --> 03:02:48,831
I was drunk

3447
03:02:49,599 --> 03:02:50,111
I made all that

3448
03:02:53,695 --> 03:02:55,743
Today

3449
03:02:57,279 --> 03:03:00,863
He only had the only thing he said about it was that Joe Rogan

3450
03:03:01,119 --> 03:03:01,631
Podcasts

3451
03:03:02,143 --> 03:03:02,655
Most downloaded

3452
03:03:02,911 --> 03:03:05,983
In the world of cars

3453
03:03:10,335 --> 03:03:10,847
In terms of that

3454
03:03:11,103 --> 03:03:11,871
I don't like

3455
03:03:12,383 --> 03:03:12,895
For me

3456
03:03:13,919 --> 03:03:14,431
Drink

3457
03:03:14,687 --> 03:03:15,199
And baby it's

3458
03:03:15,711 --> 03:03:17,503
Physiology or whatever but

3459
03:03:17,759 --> 03:03:18,271
Hungover

3460
03:03:21,343 --> 03:03:22,367
Play truth right

3461
03:03:23,647 --> 03:03:26,719
B i g really think that what wound up happening

3462
03:03:27,487 --> 03:03:27,999
He got caught

3463
03:03:28,255 --> 03:03:28,767
In a couple of

3464
03:03:29,791 --> 03:03:30,303
But you didn't

3465
03:03:30,559 --> 03:03:31,071
Get caught

3466
03:03:32,351 --> 03:03:33,375
Not unlikely

3467
03:03:33,631 --> 03:03:35,679
He got caught got your wife but like

3468
03:03:36,191 --> 03:03:37,471
In in his

3469
03:03:37,983 --> 03:03:39,519
Would like physical brain come

3470
03:03:40,287 --> 03:03:40,799
He got caught in

3471
03:03:41,055 --> 03:03:41,567
In two ways

3472
03:03:41,823 --> 03:03:43,359
One he got caught into

3473
03:03:43,615 --> 03:03:45,151
To the spiral

3474
03:03:45,919 --> 03:03:46,431
Staying

3475
03:03:46,943 --> 03:03:48,223
The the underpinning

3476
03:03:48,479 --> 03:03:49,247
Things of what all of his

3477
03:03:50,527 --> 03:03:53,599
Which are that if you if you genuinely think

3478
03:03:54,111 --> 03:03:55,647
They're interdimensional

3479
03:03:55,903 --> 03:03:56,415
Spell being

3480
03:03:57,951 --> 03:03:58,719
Yeah exactly

3481
03:03:59,231 --> 03:03:59,999
That justifies

3482
03:04:00,511 --> 03:04:01,791
Every single

3483
03:04:02,047 --> 03:04:02,559
Conspiracy theories

3484
03:04:03,839 --> 03:04:04,607
It is

3485
03:04:04,863 --> 03:04:08,191
The underpinning of it doesn't

3486
03:04:08,447 --> 03:04:08,959
Propping up

3487
03:04:09,215 --> 03:04:10,495
George Soros

3488
03:04:10,751 --> 03:04:12,031
Doesn't matter

3489
03:04:14,591 --> 03:04:15,103
He's not

3490
03:04:15,359 --> 03:04:19,711
Anti-semitic he's not anything it just don't get it mention will be

3491
03:04:19,967 --> 03:04:22,271
Understand it

3492
03:04:22,527 --> 03:04:23,039
You couldn't

3493
03:04:23,551 --> 03:04:27,135
They're interdimensional beings

3494
03:04:29,439 --> 03:04:29,951
You just don't

3495
03:04:30,207 --> 03:04:31,231
Get it exactly

3496
03:04:31,487 --> 03:04:32,255
You don't get it

3497
03:04:33,023 --> 03:04:35,327
Get it because you are living on this

3498
03:04:35,583 --> 03:04:39,167
2nd Dimension noise

3499
03:04:39,423 --> 03:04:42,495
Fourth finger on The Drifters

3500
03:04:42,751 --> 03:04:43,263
Yeah

3501
03:04:43,775 --> 03:04:45,311
Now there's that

3502
03:04:45,567 --> 03:04:48,383
And then there's also the part that is the exaggeration

3503
03:04:49,407 --> 03:04:49,919
The where

3504
03:04:51,199 --> 03:04:56,319
All my horses are amazing

3505
03:04:56,575 --> 03:04:58,623
He doesn't really believe that 12 dimension

3506
03:04:59,903 --> 03:05:02,975
What do you believe is that there's six dimensions and he's just

3507
03:05:03,231 --> 03:05:03,743
Going over

3508
03:05:04,767 --> 03:05:05,279
Like that kind of

3509
03:05:07,583 --> 03:05:09,119
I genuinely think

3510
03:05:09,375 --> 03:05:10,143
Let's use cardio

3511
03:05:10,399 --> 03:05:12,191
All of the stuff that he

3512
03:05:12,447 --> 03:05:13,215
He said is

3513
03:05:13,471 --> 03:05:13,983
Exactly what

3514
03:05:14,239 --> 03:05:14,751
He believes

3515
03:05:15,263 --> 03:05:16,031
But just

3516
03:05:16,543 --> 03:05:18,079
He exaggerated

3517
03:05:18,591 --> 03:05:19,871
To be cool

3518
03:05:20,639 --> 03:05:22,175
Like he wants Joe Rogan to think

3519
03:05:22,431 --> 03:05:24,991
You cool so bad

3520
03:05:26,527 --> 03:05:27,295
Joe Rogan

3521
03:05:28,831 --> 03:05:29,855
No Doubt

3522
03:05:30,111 --> 03:05:31,391
No doubt it is

3523
03:05:31,647 --> 03:05:32,927
It is pathetic

3524
03:05:34,207 --> 03:05:35,743
Against his whole Narrative of being like

3525
03:05:35,999 --> 03:05:36,767
Like I'm not impressed

3526
03:05:37,279 --> 03:05:37,791
Stars

3527
03:05:41,375 --> 03:05:42,399
Here's the new one

3528
03:05:43,167 --> 03:05:45,983
But that's that's not necessarily A

3529
03:05:46,751 --> 03:05:48,287
Like that song

3530
03:05:49,055 --> 03:05:51,871
Like I have to I want to think I'm cool

3531
03:05:52,127 --> 03:05:54,687
And all of their names are

3532
03:05:56,735 --> 03:05:57,247
Beach

3533
03:05:57,503 --> 03:05:59,807
You did the joke how dare you

3534
03:06:05,183 --> 03:06:05,695
Both a Time

3535
03:06:07,743 --> 03:06:10,303
We're at the end of the show

3536
03:06:14,399 --> 03:06:16,703
Aspire euros

3537
03:06:19,519 --> 03:06:20,287
There

3538
03:06:21,055 --> 03:06:22,335
There's a bunch of

3539
03:06:23,359 --> 03:06:24,639
Anything goes back to what I was saying

3540
03:06:25,919 --> 03:06:28,479
How many years ago was the

3541
03:06:28,735 --> 03:06:33,087
4473

3542
03:06:33,343 --> 03:06:34,111
Guthred

3543
03:06:34,367 --> 03:06:35,135
The he's weaving

3544
03:06:35,647 --> 03:06:36,671
He's trying to do them

3545
03:06:37,951 --> 03:06:38,719
In his own brain

3546
03:06:41,279 --> 03:06:44,351
Andy's job

3547
03:06:44,863 --> 03:06:46,911
One of them is the narrative

3548
03:06:47,167 --> 03:06:47,935
Trump

3549
03:06:48,191 --> 03:06:48,959
Being great

3550
03:06:49,727 --> 03:06:50,495
Texas

3551
03:06:51,519 --> 03:06:52,287
Immigrants

3552
03:06:52,799 --> 03:06:53,823
That's the propaganda

3553
03:06:54,847 --> 03:06:55,871
And then the other thread is

3554
03:06:56,127 --> 03:06:56,639
Is kind of what

3555
03:06:56,895 --> 03:06:57,663
Deep down he actually

3556
03:06:57,919 --> 03:06:58,431
We Believe

3557
03:06:58,687 --> 03:06:59,967
Matt is that the globalist

3558
03:07:00,479 --> 03:07:00,991
Are a bunch of

3559
03:07:01,247 --> 03:07:02,015
Pedophiles

3560
03:07:02,271 --> 03:07:03,295
And they believe in trans

3561
03:07:03,807 --> 03:07:04,319
National being

3562
03:07:04,831 --> 03:07:06,111
And he believes in that too

3563
03:07:06,367 --> 03:07:07,135
And he has to fight it

3564
03:07:08,415 --> 03:07:08,927
The passion does

3565
03:07:09,183 --> 03:07:09,951
Come from the

3566
03:07:10,463 --> 03:07:10,975
Trump want

3567
03:07:11,231 --> 03:07:11,999
What's to lower your taxes

3568
03:07:12,255 --> 03:07:14,303
Depression comes from the b*******

3569
03:07:15,327 --> 03:07:17,119
Yeah the passion comes from the

3570
03:07:17,631 --> 03:07:18,655
Fantasy world

3571
03:07:19,167 --> 03:07:19,679
Make them up

3572
03:07:21,471 --> 03:07:21,983
And Heat

3573
03:07:23,007 --> 03:07:24,799
Yu-Gi-Oh how to make those

3574
03:07:25,055 --> 03:07:29,407
Threads intertwined Rags actual show all he can talk about

3575
03:07:29,663 --> 03:07:30,943
Is the taxes

3576
03:07:31,199 --> 03:07:32,479
And all that stuff

3577
03:07:34,271 --> 03:07:35,039
Of the other

3578
03:07:35,295 --> 03:07:35,807
Horseshit

3579
03:07:37,855 --> 03:07:38,367
He's not that.

3580
03:07:39,135 --> 03:07:41,439
He knows that if he brings up all this other

3581
03:07:41,951 --> 03:07:43,231
Dimensional b*******

3582
03:07:43,487 --> 03:07:45,791
On his Infowars show

3583
03:07:46,559 --> 03:07:47,071
Game over

3584
03:07:48,095 --> 03:07:51,679
So he brings it up on Rogaine where it's like

3585
03:07:52,703 --> 03:07:53,215
No one

3586
03:07:53,727 --> 03:07:54,495
Who hate

3587
03:07:54,751 --> 03:07:56,031
Pam is going to listen in

3588
03:07:56,287 --> 03:07:57,055
Call it out

3589
03:07:57,311 --> 03:07:59,615
Right

3590
03:08:03,455 --> 03:08:08,575
Going to be like that was hilarious

3591
03:08:08,831 --> 03:08:10,111
The two

3592
03:08:10,367 --> 03:08:10,879
Stop listening

3593
03:08:11,391 --> 03:08:11,903
Kenny Bravo's

3594
03:08:12,159 --> 03:08:15,743
That's what them Safe Harbor and

3595
03:08:16,767 --> 03:08:17,535
He lets out a little

3596
03:08:18,559 --> 03:08:19,327
From my purse

3597
03:08:19,583 --> 03:08:20,095
Perspective

3598
03:08:20,863 --> 03:08:21,631
I really think

3599
03:08:23,679 --> 03:08:24,703
Do a much better job

3600
03:08:26,239 --> 03:08:27,007
The internet

3601
03:08:27,263 --> 03:08:28,287
Communities where

3602
03:08:28,543 --> 03:08:30,847
Crazy how

3603
03:08:32,127 --> 03:08:32,639
That in

3604
03:08:32,895 --> 03:08:34,175
Same person that we just

3605
03:08:35,199 --> 03:08:36,223
Dementia

3606
03:08:36,479 --> 03:08:36,991
National beans

3607
