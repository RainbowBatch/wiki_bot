11
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,896
I'm really afraid if you

12
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:56,576
I'm incredibly scared of intro Warriors

13
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:00,672
And you don't know anything about a goddamn the show fine

14
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,696

00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,744
Discussing our relative

These before this is an apple soda

More sugar in it

20
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,824
I love apple juice

21
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,360
Is it delicious

22
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,152
I don't mind it I love it

23
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,480
Are novelty beverage game has gone more towards the comfy

24
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
Icarus we flew too close to the Sun with that coconut trees.

25
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,024
Is not going to be a good way to go back up to really bizarre eventually but for now let's stay with the soda game

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,792
Absolute

27
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,584

Hardware or good for a while.

34
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,584
News

35
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:17,216
Very unsupportive with a crowd the other very supportive and nobody ever showed up

36
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,360
What it's like to be a comedian in Chicago 90% of it is running bad

37
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,688
But bonding through bad show

38
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:29,248
Running Sancho's and bad roads

39
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
Nevermind

40
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,064
Oh yeah

41
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,648
Today we're going to be doing another investigation

42
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
Installment

43
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
Because I hate the present

44
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,488
I don't want to talk about

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,584
I was excited I was I was really hoping walking over Heroes

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,656
I do not

47
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:51,776
September 2nd 2015

48
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,800
Through

49
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
September

50
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
Fort

51
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,664
To the pretty short. There's a very interesting narrative Arc

52
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
2 plays out

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,528
We'll get to it is about

54
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,600
But I wanted to spend my position that I'm staying

55
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,672
Cardiologist

56
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:13,280
I have two things I want to talk about up a sort of General business up top

57
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,608
The first thing is I read an interesting article today

58
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,144
Distinction

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,424
Between the alt right

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,448
And the alt light

61
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,776
I don't know if you're aware that the stadium

62
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:28,128
The alt-right is people like the most famous 12b Richard Spence

63
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
Out-and-out nausea

64
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,784
Yeah white supremacist neo-Nazi

65
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,392
Official position of the show everybody gets

66
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,952
Not just one

67
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,232
Not

68
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,768
So the alt light

69
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,352
Is like Mike cernovich jakpus Gavin McInnes

70
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,656
All these people that are sort of in our

71
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:54,240
Sphere that come up on Alex's show and we talked about

72
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,568
And I think that is one thing I want to say

73
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,872
Isn't it we call those dudes alright

74
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
And there's

75
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,712
They make the argument that they're not alright

76
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,760
And they split from the alt right

77
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
Because they

78
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
Don't

79
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,344
Want to be associated with the whites

80
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
Soupremacy

81
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
Of the alt-right

82
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
So they're the alt-right

83
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
And they want to be treated differently

84
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Skin color

85
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:24,447
Does that I say exactly

86
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,751
Rhymes doesn't mean you get to

87
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,615
Would not owe you if you're in a barn

88
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,639
The out and

89
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
They took their hood off

90
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,551
F*** you

91
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,343
I hope the barn burned down

92
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,183
With all of you inside

93
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:51,839
Implied version of that

94
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
Spin version of

95
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
Racism

96
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,287
Did you don't want to be any version of racism possible

97
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:04,383
So I don't think I don't think that's a really great defense

98
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,943
Weird

99
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
The healthier version

100
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
First of all

101
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,391
Second of all I've done enough looking into these p

102
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:19,231
People threw their appearances and the prism of Alex Jones

103
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,071
Call me into our natural sphere

104
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,143
Watch a bunch of his bulshit videos online

105
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,959
Ejecta sobiech I've spent a lot of time with

106
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,495
Mike cernovich certainly

107
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,567
You have just described hell you realize that

108
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,943
Myself which is bizarre

109
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,015
What I want to say we all created

110
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,743
The people who are listed in this

111
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
Then the alt-right

112
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
Section of it

113
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,351
Real f*****-up rapist

114
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
They are some

115
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
Out-and-out

116
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,935
You like dangerous

117
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,983
White supremacist Nazi type

118
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
I think their problem

119
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,847
I don't want to do a show about them

120
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
Very conscious

121
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,919
I don't want about them

122
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
I want

123
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,503
Am I focus on these

124
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
Alt Lite

125
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
People

126
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,319
Who are all right

127
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
Whatever they want to call

128
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
Indulge

129
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
Rebranding

130
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
Don't allow them

131
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:27,583
To Bellflower

132
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
Think that it's

133
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,655
Possibly even more important

134
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,447
To focus on these people

135
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
As opposed to the

136
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,263
Admittedly more dangerous

137
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,055
People in the alt right

138
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Section

139
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
Is because

140
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,407
They are how people get radicalized

141
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
To the all right

142
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
They're like the

143
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Yes

144
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
No one is going

145
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:50,623
To find the wild baby a couple people but it's a very small minority of people are going to

146
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
Find the heroin first

147
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951
And go to

148
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,767
There's any sort of

149
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,559
And started doing some coke

150
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
You didn't work at that it's not

151
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,215
You get what I'm saying

152
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,263
As are we all by the old

153
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,359
People start with like Gavin McInnes and maybe they become a proud boy

154
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,407
Is it seems like a fun fraternal organization

155
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,479
And then as they go along to become one of the all tonight

156
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,551
They become part of the army version of the

157
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,319
Proud boys

158
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:25,951
I'm a little bit later it's not enough for them and they find ohmygod look at all these other people there

159
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
Some real s***

160
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
It is a progression

161
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,559
And people like Alex Jones

162
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,839
Everyone

163
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,887
Who talks about him online positive

164
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
Says like crazy

165
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,495
You stopped without him my eyes never would have been open

166
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
They are

167
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,663
The intermediaries to really f***** up radicalization online

168
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,711
And if you cut that off

169
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,015
The people who are really extreme

170
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,831
Will not have access to

171
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
The man like most

172
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,903
Okay I'm going to come

173
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Fine

174
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,839
And I don't

175
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
I do agree with you though

176
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
These people

177
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
To me are far more.

178
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,823
Cuz because they have the air of respectability normal

179
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,151
Afraid of Richards

180
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Richards

181
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
Is laughable

182
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,503
Because every

183
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,599
Can look at that

184
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,623
Can look at that

185
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
So we don't pay attention

186
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,231
Exact

187
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,767
Now they all

188
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
Right

189
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
Hide

190
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
The racism

191
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,679
The ones who you see

192
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,959
People saying

193
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,055
Sometimes

194
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,871
Right there not funneling people in

195
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Into the

196
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
Further right

197
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,943
They're giving people

198
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
Cover

199
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,759
To indulge in there

200
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Proclivity

201
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
Ultra

202
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
Like

203
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
Cernovich

204
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,487
Especially your pulse

205
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
Citgo Fox

206
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,791
Sprite

207
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
Which is my new favorite

208
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
Those guys

209
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
Bar

210
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
Are a way for peace

211
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
Go to argue

212
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,519
That they are not being

213
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
While still legitimized

214
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
Yeah that's

215
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,919
But they are so I'm not afraid of them putting

216
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
People towards

217
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
I'm afraid of

218
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,783
I'm afraid of them making the middle

219
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
The right

220
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,391
Do you see what I'm saying

221
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,511
But the guys that we are looking at

222
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
Tumi are far more days

223
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
Cuz they're not

224
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
These are the

225
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,703
People who are really good at internet radicalization

226
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,239
Yeah

227
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,775
Tumi

228
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Is

229
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
It is transitional

230
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,151
To some extent

231
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
Into a more extreme

232
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
Headspace

233
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,015
I believe

234
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
For the most

235
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,367
I don't even know how to put this because like

236
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:06,207
Be really extreme people are a problem and that they might hurt somebody

237
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
But there

238
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
Uniform thing

239
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,399
F*** all of them

240
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Do not

241
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,959
Allow anybody to

242
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,983
Polis

243
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,799
They are the same thing

244
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,335
Just like we've

245
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
Just like we've covered

246
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,639
Alex and David

247
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,199
Yeah even Alex

248
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
He has to

249
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
Publicly disagree with.

250
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,551
Or not

251
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,623
Well

252
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Because

253
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,951
V if you put it to a large majority

254
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,255
Even people on the right

255
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,559
That these guys are out

256
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
Bigot

257
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,375
They know in their head

258
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
Approve out in

259
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,519
This is going to ruin

260
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,079
I don't care what color you are

261
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
Costco

262
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,223
Yeah I only talked about

263
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,135
Or hiding your or hiding your

264
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,671
Racist and bigoted views

265
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
Behind

266
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,743
One black Pastor who said so

267
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
Similar

268
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,351
Specifically

269
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,911
Exactly the same thing

270
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
Bright and the other thing

271
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,263
To keep in mind is that these Alt

272
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,079
People right

273
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,615
I'm just trying to use that

274
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
For the sake of clarity

275
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,687
I am in the descriptions

276
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,479
Spell

277
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,015
Still are

278
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,599
Super motivated by anti globalist ideas

279
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
That there

280
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,951
Is based on a

281
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
Semitism

282
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
And bigotry

283
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
So

284
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,535
Just like we

285
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,815
Revealed

286
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
They're big

287
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
Get tree is

288
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911
Of the

289
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
Hiding behind.

290
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
Globalist

291
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,287
If you are

292
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,383
I would say 100% of the time if you

293
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
Are blaming globalist

294
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
First off

295
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,967
You're hiding

296
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
Let's move on

297
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
And let me

298
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
Defend myself

299
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,647
Again

300
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,695
About why I don't want to be in the bread

301
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
I listen to the show

302
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,351

303
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,679
Complaining about robots

304
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,215

Then Tuesday

308
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
On the 18th

309
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,695
How to make this argument all the f****** time

310
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
Even recently

311
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
I've made it

312
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
In response to tweet

313
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,375
The people have sent me and messages when they

314
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911

I've made the argument

317
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
Feels good

318
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
But you're helping him

319
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,383
Whenever you play into these things that make him a joke

320
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,919
And make him funny

321
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
You are not

322
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
Doing anybody any good

323
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
Now listen to this clip

324
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,063

Or they make it look like I'm just making stuff up

339
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,303
That was a real article I was reading

340
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,167
For the police chief

341
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:41,919

345
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,335
Play this game with Alex

346
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
He is

347
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,407

To his advantage

351
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,783
You just

352
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
Give him ammo

353
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,111
It's not good

354
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
I get it

In a perfect world we could all laugh at it

360
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,839
But unfortunately

361
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
Here's the score

362
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655

Do you understand

366
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,079
I agree with you

367
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
I'm curious about

368
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
I am.

369
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,431
This is why because here's the deal

370
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Sound like

371
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,759

Absolutely

373
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,159
He has nothing in this story that he brings up

374
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,743
Go over other than some guy

There's all kinds of possibilities

380
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,983
All he knows is

381
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,519
Is the ethnicity of the person

382
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
And because

383
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
You know there is that

384
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
The refrain in the song

385
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
He gets to use it

386
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:21,247
You guys are making fun of me I'm right and now every time

387
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
That there is

388
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
Some incident that happened

He gets in everybody's face

391
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,743
And it's not it's not

392
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,631
I think our biggest issue with

393
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,911
Meming Alex

394
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
Is that he is

395
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
Complete an

396
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,407
Can you because that's what he's doing

397
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
Every time

398
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,223
There is a murder

399
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
Every single time

400
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,831
He's going to comb through as many murders as a

401
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
Toucan

402
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
The Muslim

403
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
Celebrate that

404
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:07,839
He's right for murder

405
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
Giving him more

406
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,935
To do that and it's not just going to be once

407
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:16,031
Every time there's a murder over whether the show

408
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
Is model of

409
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,063
Story

410
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:35,743
Same story different Swift

411
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
Soap name

412
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,295
Congratulations

413
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
Great work

414
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
Great work

415
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,135
Go fuc yourself

416
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
Everybody

417
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,183
Legitimately

418
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
Not our listeners you guys are great

419
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,511
But I'm serious

420
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,047
We're not taking this seriously

421
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,863
It's it drives me up

422
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,399
We have

423
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,703
A bigot with a massive audience

424
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:21,055
And the best we can do is thousands and thousands of retweets

425
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,127
For this f****** video

426
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:29,247
If 10000 people retweeted that are that episode we did about Dennis Montgomery

427
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,551
Think about the effect that could have

428
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:36,927
If he was drunk is s***

429
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,463
On March 30th

430
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
Of 2017

431
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,791
Do you think what that have

432
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:48,447
We cast a light on this stuff and maybe it's more difficult maybe I'd certainly more difficult to take

433
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
And then

434
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,263
A 2-minute video

435
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,311
Alex Jones plays the Imp

436
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,591
Tire video

437
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,383
The entire Bon Iver video

438
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
Coming in from break

439
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:05,855
And why wouldn't the smart thing to do of course if you're like like you're mad about it

440
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,647
When

441
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,511
Especially in the present

442
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
Where is God

443
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,815
F****** nothing to go on

444
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,631
Nothing out of

445
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,191
He's spiraling into this

446
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
Repetitive

447
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,007
Bulshit

448
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,031
It's far more dangerous

449
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
Just like you said

450
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
Monday

451
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,663
Boring

452
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,455
Now he's got this pizza

453
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,831
We all had a good time but now he's

454
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,111
He gets in on it

455
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:42,463
I don't want him to have fun no I don't ever want him to have one.

456
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:46,047
It doesn't ruin it even have thumbs

457
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:50,911
This day I mean this has been inevitable outcome of pretty much all the time

458
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
Let you try and make these fun meme

459
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
It's it's

460
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,263
Keep going to take it

461
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,311
And use it and you are going to

462
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:01,919
And he's going to use every part of the Buffalo No Doubt

463
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
Itsfunneh

464
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
Play the clip

465
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,527
It's funny to get angry at people

466
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,343
Who's think it's actually doing a good job taking

467
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
And then it

468
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,463
Itsfunneh

469
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,999
Use it as it's

470
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,279
Propaganda

471
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,071
Every time he feels like

472
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,607
It is approved

473
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,495
Time Warner

474
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,311
As opposed to a funny video

475
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:34,175
David just reinforces that I want to put on it

476
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,735
I tweeted something about this then I didn't I didn't

477
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:40,063
I couldn't figure out how to put it the rest of it in 140-character

478
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,135
Alex Jones doesn't have a sense of humor

479
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,439
He doesn't understand how to use humor

480
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
It isn't

481
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,231
Incredibly potent

482
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
Tool

483
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,023
In terms of

484
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,791
Rhetoric

485
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:50,815
In terms of

486
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:51,839
Being

487
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
Persuasive

488
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Humor isn't

489
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
Incredibly important

490
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,191
You see it in any

491
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
Anybody who's giving a speech

492
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,543
If you don't have the kind of charm that elicit laughter

493
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,823
You're going to bore people

494
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
And Alex Jones

495
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,663
Can't get by on his own

496
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
In terms of humor

497
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,991
He needs other people to do it for him

498
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,039
Who is Bon Iver video

499
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,831
And I know it wasn't

500
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,855
But like

501
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,903
Disparities video

502
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
Does it for him

503
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,488
He doesn't have to be funny

504
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,536
You're doing the hard part for him

505
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,816
When you make videos

506
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
Set reminder

507
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
To go f****** fly a kite

508
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,168
That's it

509
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,800
Little pretty funny videos very funny

510
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,336
The smart idea is well

511
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,128
Computed Bon Iver has a very

512
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,152
Sound

513
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,968
If if if

514
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,760
Is the consequences

515
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,040
They were

516
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,576
They didn't reinforce

517
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
The

518
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
Uneven

519
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
Dan Dan

520
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,168
Shut up

521
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,704
Dad we want you to be happy

522
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,752
All right let's go back in time

523
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,568
I'll be happier in 2015

524
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Clap their hands

525
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,432
Noting

526
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:14,784
Tinkerbell

527
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,344
SOS

528
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,392
Alex Jones

529
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,464
In 2015 September 1st to Justin out

530
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,792
That he was going to do a 27 hour marathon

531
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,328
For project

532
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,960
Money bomb

533
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,752
My conviction that this

534
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
To the opportunity

535
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,288
34 big money

536
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,312
Coming to his show

537
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,360
Become part of

538
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
Team Trump

539
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,920
That is where we left off last time

540
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,480
We pick up our investigation

541
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,016
On September 2nd

542
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:50,368
He's very weird on September 2nd

543
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
He wants to talk race

544
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,840
To bring that money here is the first clip you want

545
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608
Talk

546
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,400
Murders

547
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,960
And they just got

548
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:11,104
Ariana homicide suspected in off-duty Texas officers death

549
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
Is home

550
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,968
We have another cop shot of course in Houston over the weekend

551
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,528
We have the TV reporter and a cameraman killed

552
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,088
And much of it is black on white

553
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,696
With yesterday

554
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,632
Different radio shows

555
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,424
Better out there

556
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,496
Where folks are calling for

557
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,776
The murder

558
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:46,176
Police officers this is tremendously important he is just tied together all of his narrative that weird

559
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:49,504
Going to be discussing today in 140 second sound bite

560
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
Black people

561
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,344
Black people killing white people and especially cops

562
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,392
Louis Farrakhan has

563
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:00,512
Come out and put out a video Alex play it later in this investigation

564
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:04,096
But just to give you a short version of it it's Louis Farrakhan saying

565
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,632
If we are being

566
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
Killed

567
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,192
And we have no redress

568
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,240
They what we must do is

569
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,032
And kill those who would kill us

570
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
Which is fair

571
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,664
Epic seven

572
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
That I mean

573
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,992
What else do you do it

574
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,528
Mix

575
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,648
And has no other

576
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
Possibility of Jessie

577
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,208
Like none

578
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,256
The system doesn't even

579
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,536
Pretend to work for

580
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
Frankly

581
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,144
People would be happier if

582
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
The cop was

583
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
Even just

584
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,264
If he wasn't even brought

585
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,616
And so if you don't have that

586
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,408
There is nothing else but viola

587
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,200
Facebook

588
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,784
Rioting is the voice of the unheard

589
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:59,904
Alex Jones also wants to bring in a cop was killed and it home off duty

590
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,536
There's no indication of that guy was killed because he was a cop there's no details that Alex Jones has about this

591
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
He's just

592
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,608
Narrative

593
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,632
To give extra

594
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
Then

595
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,288
He brings in these various radio shows

596
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
I want you to remember that

597
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,920
Cuz we're going to get to what he's talkin about a little bit down the line

598
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,016
Various radios various radio shows

599
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,296
Specific

600
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,624
And it's not on the radio

601
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
So

602
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,024
Here we go Alex wants to yell but Farrakhan a bunch

603
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,352
And here we go it has a really great end

604
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:43,936
I got to say

605
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,216
Out of being really mad

606
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,776
And I think you know exactly what type of cavities going to make

607
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,992
FBI

608
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,184
What you said

609
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,976
Maybe you are just crazy

610
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,704
On that subject

611
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:58,432
The loved one of the anchors

612
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,456
Is here with us

613
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:09,440
What's a medium

614
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,352
Hillary for

615
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:21,728
Hillary for prison shirts

616
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,288
Yes but did you notice no reality

617
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,360
That he's selling as opposed to it like you just

618
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:31,456
Stolen ID

619
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,528
Which she admitted on our last episode The back-and-forth

620
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:39,136
Very interested in is this harsh pivot from

621
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,464
Screaming at Louis Farrakhan payroll

622
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,488
To being like

623
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:48,352
I understand it was killing somebody want to kill him

624
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:52,448
Try to get it out

625
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,920
It's all so performative

626
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:06,528
You stupid Louis Farrakhan operation

627
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,576
See this is why I so much better in the past

628
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,136
Now he would just

629
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,184
He would just have spittle

630
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,464
Flying from his mouth week

631
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,768
He's not angry

632
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,792
He's yelling about

633
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,096
He's just angry about all the s*** they

634
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,656
It's going down in life

635
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,448
Choice

636
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,752
Somewhere in this 2015.

637
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,592
And he's paying for it in 2017

638
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,920
I've listened

639
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,200
To a bunch down the road

640
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,248
I'm still convinced that I'm right

641
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,576
Okay. I still don't have concrete evidence

642
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,112
But I'm pretty sure I'm right

643
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,416
And one of the reasons that I'm sure I'm right

644
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
Is that Alex

645
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,720
On this September 22nd

646
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,000
Can show is out of

647
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,280
He is just

648
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,816
Furious and grasping

649
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,840
Distraught

650
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,656
Oh I'm sorry

651
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,704
September 2nd

652
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,312
He's Furious he's just he's just an angry angry man

653
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,848
And doing a ton of race

654
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,176
So I told you to keep in mind I radio show

655
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,968
Come back up

656
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,248
Here in this neck

657
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,832
Tell you a little bit about what this radio show is

658
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:16,416
It is a radio show on

659
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,888
It's basically a app for Matt where you can put out a pot

660
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,192
You're here

661
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,240
The audio of it sounds like a guy

662
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,776
Recorded it through his cell phone

663
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,568
It sounds like an answering

664
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,616
I looked into the guy

665
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,152
His name is King Noble

666
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,968
He is a black supremacist

667
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,248
Black Supremacy

668
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,112
Love you has the 800

00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,904

This guy is hitting obvious

672
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,256
Let you know

673
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,048
Not not

674
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:54,816
To be a dick

675
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,096
We do not have

676
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,120
100 followers

677
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:03,520
I understand that and that's not what I'm saying

678
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,568
Relatively

679
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,152
This dude Alex Jones claims that 20 million listeners a week

680
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,688
He's

681
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,784
Scooping down that far to make an example

682
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,808
Not good

683
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,856
That means you don't have an

684
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:22,208
If you're like oh this guy on SoundCloud

685
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,024

686
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,328
What's the angry about nothing

687
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
How do you say

688
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,400
Klip2save

689

Wilbur

690
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,264
Just combing yes

691
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:43,200
Yes absolutely remember when we went over the Humvee will Lucaya situation

692
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,016
Breitbart

693
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,808
Maybe they have tipsters

694
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,600
To tell them about things they find

695
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,624
Or they're just

696
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,672
Trolling for race-baiting stories

697
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
Right there just

698
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,488
Trying to find anything

699
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,024
How did you

700
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,560
Find out about

701
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,376
A child on child sexual assault

702
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,424
It is small town in Idaho

703
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,448
Idaho White

704
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,216
Supremacist

705
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,240
Sent that little

706
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
Too bright

707
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,032
Exactly

708
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,080
It's always going to be the same story

709
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,104
That's how these things

710
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,872
Get traction

711
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
I mean that's it

712
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,480
And it's pathetic

713
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,040
What's what's the

714
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,320
What would you say

715
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:24,928
We're going to listen to Alex Jones going to give it a little bit of an introduction first

716
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:28,000
He's going to play play that super.

717
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,560
Xvideo it just

718
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,352
The time traveler

719
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,984
They're probably working for the feds

720
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:42,336
They got screwed over something by the cops that are some racist

721
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,320
I was sophisticated enough to not hate all cops are all black people

722
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,904
Describe a group of people

723
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:56,928
And then

724
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,464
Said that he experienced

725
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
That exempts

726
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,072
Yeah but he's evolved enough

727
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
Dinos

728
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,120
He knows that

729
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,144
It's new.

730
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,776
And he also said that those people work for the FBI

731
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:16,128
Is this his way of trying to subtly say that he works for the FBI

732
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,968
By the way I'm not saying that does not work for the FBI

733
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,784
Probably you think we do

734
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,648
Find out about it's probably going to like these guys are federales

735
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,416
Followers

736
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,976
We will be taking shower others No Doubt

737
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:37,376
I guarantee we have more listeners that much love talk radio show

738
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,144
You don't have listeners

739
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:44,288
And so it's really just a bunch of babies that like to play the part of victims

740
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,848
I think they're going to be big tough honchos

741
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:53,248
What cures for what is a real racehorse starts in this country it's not in either side

742
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,832
Historical lines and

743
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,000
Play at the game going picking people off

744
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,584
Go pick you off one at a time

745
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,120
Fluoxetine

746
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,640
Water buffaloes water buffaloes kill more people

747
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,224
That's not

748
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,272
I just shows disguise ignorance

749
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:30,368
He called himself for the lord it's all part of this narcissistic

750
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,904
Hip hop culture

751
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,256
T-Mobile

752
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:39,072
Black Supremacy and I want to talk about the shooting

753
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:43,936
Of the white deputy sheriff in Houston Texas

754
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,752
I Shot the Sheriff tell me what the Houston Texas

755
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,520
Brutal

756
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:52,128
Execution before the public represents to me if it's open season

757
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,152
Killing whites

758
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,688
And white police officers

759
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:57,760
And probably killing cops. It's open season

760
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,552
Towards the police department

761
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,832
Anna police

762
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,112
So now you got some

763
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
Black

764
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
Military

765
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,184
Awesome angry black man

766
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
Wok Shop

767
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744
And executes

768
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,768
A cracker car

769
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,560
In broad daylight

770
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,584
This is real

771
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,912
Is open season on killing white people and cops

772
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,936
It's unavoidable

773
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,960
Escapable

774
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
Itsfunneh

775
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,520
Then I will move into a Time

776
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,568
Become the prey

777
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,848
Yes they said

778
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,128
It'll be a race war

779
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,944
And that we cannot win a race war we can't win

780
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
We're outnumbered

781
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,272
They got weapons they got drones they got this they got that

782
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,576
But I remind you of the Buffalo

783
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
Who outnumber the lion

784
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
They're bigger than lion

785
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,696
Any moving larger her but get picked off

786
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,720
Alliance

787
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,488
1

788
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,024
By one by one

789
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,560
Picking them off

790
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:48,960
Today we live in a time where the white man will be picked off and it's just if he can do it.

791
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:54,080
White people, can we ever have before

792
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,616
We see Whitney Houston

793
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,640
Texas shooting

794
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,664
And we see

795
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,456
Weber news reporting shooting

796
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,224
Virginia

797
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,504
It's about

798
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,272
To go

799
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,040
Down

800
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,320
Is open

801
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,856
Season of killing wife

802
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,136
People in crime

803
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,952
Gravity the black lives matter movement

804
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,024
We try to appeal to them

805
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,144
Let them know that this type of thing would comment would happen they thought they were indestructible and invincible

806
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,032
Because they took advantage of the weakness of black people for too long with all this police brutality and now they

807
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:32,736
Challenge

808
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,232
You're a grand jackasses what you are capable

809
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:47,584
I want to challenge this this guy uses real name and come on this show

810
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,632
Is Rihanna

811
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,896
Fluoride water is going on dummy

812
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:15,232
The cause a race war

813
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,888
Internet

814
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,168
So Alex

815
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,472
Is mad at him and the media

816
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,032
A few small exam

817
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,336
And then he uses

818
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:35,200
A very small example example

819
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:41,344
I wanted to let that play realize I felt it as we were listening to

820
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,160
But the reason I wanted to play it is

821
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,208
Alex barely interrupt

822
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,256
And there's a reason for that

823
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,792
He wants to paint

824
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,584
Black people

825
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,888
So he wants the audience

826
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,424
To fully hear everything

827
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,960
Memphis black supremacist

828
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,800
The saying because it feeds into the fear that he wants them to feel

829
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:06,688
So relax

830
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:11,296
It was anybody who doesn't respect as much as David Duke

831
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:15,904
He allowed David to have parameters

832
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:23,072
Any other time he has someone on who's contentious

833
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,400
Especially if you like we both had that episode where we played

834
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,192
Is Keith Olbermann analysis

835
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,520
Yeah.

836
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,016
Work

837
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,856
Do is make a mockery of consultant

838
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,880
Exactly

839
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,416
It serves his purposes to

840
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,440
You fully play this

841
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,840
I don't think it's like he sat down and thought about that I think it's just an intrinsic

842
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,864
Decision

843
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,984
You played this guy

844
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,776
Again a very small audience

845
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,824
On BlogTalkRadio

846
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,360
And conflated that

847
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,896
With Louis Farrakhan

848
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,456
Two of them are making very different state

849
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,248
Lose

850
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:14,784
Weed

851
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,344
If we have no recourse for being killed by cops

852
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,648
Why we should kill the cops

853
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Kill us

854
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,696
Sleeping pretty specific

855
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:26,304
Think about it there's some room for interpretation or have you but I want to make it clear

856
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,376
That this is what's going on at the beginning of September 2nd

857
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,168
What route is that

858
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,984
For about the first 40-minute

859
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,544
What happens after that

860
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,872
Higher rest of the show

861
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,408
Until the 4th hour

862
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,712
I think it's Rob Duo

863
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
Fourth hour

864
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,504
But then

865
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,272
The next

866
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,320
Hour and 20 minutes or so

867
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,112
Is an interview with dr. group

868
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,160
About how people need to buy their

869
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
It becomes

870
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,000
We've already started

871
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
It becomes a

872
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,048
The straight-up infomercial

873
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,840
They're just talking about

874
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,864
Shilajit

875
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,192
And various other things

876
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:08,288
I've actually talked to my doctor friend doctor gums about some of their

877
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,640
Full of s*** most of them are

878
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,200
Like I want to get him on so you can break down like this

879
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,224
Specifics of it

880
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:16,992
But man

881
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:21,088
Meadowlands people who fall for this stuff are a real special breed

882
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,392
Especially cuz these bottles of pills cost

883
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,672
Second epoch

884
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,464
Various

885
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,744
Spencer

886
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,096
Nothing because those pills

887
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,376
Cost 30

888
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:40,032
Max and once you start taking them you feel bad when you don't take it what you may or may not be psychosomatic

889
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,360
No it can't really be

890
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,152
There's really nothing

891
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,416
120 % of your iodine in

892
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,976
Everyday

893
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
Have to adapt

894
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,512
To having

895
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,328
And so of course whenever you

896
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,864
Completely remove it

897
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
Instead of

898
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,448
You know it's just like getting rid of any Medicaid

899
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:15,360
Slowly go off in the more metal

900
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,664
Like when we got off the gold standard

901
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,968
Paper off metal

902
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,272
So

903
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,600
Coming on to talk about the biggest

904
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,136
Nothing to be afraid of

905
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
Not

906
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,440
Vaccines

907
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,256
Not fluoride in the water

908
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,792
Dr. group

909
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,608
The biggest thing to be worried about

910
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,168
Now it's nanoparticles

911
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:42,496
Nanoparticles

912
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,800
Very observant that's good for you

913
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:52,992
I think they're over selling it just a little bit and being very specific

914
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,320
Then the thing Alex is pimping

915
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:04,256
Building up as we talked about going broke

916
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,752
You can see it and all I want to do is try to have peace

917
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,568
Prosperity

918
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,152
But there is a force out of Evil's activate

919
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,968
Evils making its move that's the big event

920
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,136
That's right

921
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,048
I got out of Beyond

922
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,496
End tables making it smooth I mean

923
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:50,848
With this Collider

924
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:55,967
I mean we're talking about opening up another dimensional we're opening a portal

925
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,599
And we don't know what

926
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,367
That's right

927
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,415
That's right

928
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,023
Very

929
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,071
Very

930
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:11,839
Check out

931
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,863
Could be a portal

932
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,655
Yeah could be a portal

933
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,679
Maybe we're looking

934
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:18,751
Looking for the gravitational particle

935
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:25,151
Maybe we're inviting Cthulhu into the who knows

936
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:29,759
Yeah I mean with these sort of hypothetical things

937
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,063
Outside possibility

938
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,087
Portals

939
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,647
But not the way they're saying

940
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,439
Portal what they're like what

941
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,767
Yes

942
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:46,399
Also I love the idea

943
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,423
Rosen Bridge

944
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:53,823
I loved the idea that it's just like this door is going to open up in front of your life

945
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,527
I need to remind everybody that doctor group

946
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,063
Is a chiropractor

947
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:11,743
Doctor and who else

948
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:16,095
Netflix

949
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,399
Right

950
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,727
Completely nuts

951
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:24,799
Question

952
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,847
I'd love to answer the question

953
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,871
If we've ever really

954
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,639
Talked about

955
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,455
Either chiropractor Williams

956
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:35,551
PW chiropractor does

957
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:42,207
Portals

958
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,023
Prosperity mean

959
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
No

960
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,095
Not really free market

961
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:51,167
I want Prosperity what is that actually look

962
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,239
You know how

963
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:57,823
Whenever Trump says America First it means whatever it means to you

964
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,847
It's just a nice

965
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,383
Sort of catchphrase

966
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,687
But that's what he's talking about you know

967
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:08,063
I hear it and I guess what he means is

968
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:11,391
Like how does the textbook definition Wright

969
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,415
I suppose

970
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,975
Plenty plenty

971
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,279
So he wants communism

972
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:21,119
No he certainly doesn't

973
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:32,639
It's not real

974
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,663
A free market

975
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,687
Lives on

976
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,991
Cannibalizing its poor

977
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:37,759
Absolutely

978
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,575
What's it wait what's your point

979
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,111
My tab I was just asking

980
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:42,879
What it is

981
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:45,951
That he's our weather and I could never describe his prosperity

982
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,535
No I just want prosperity

983
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,607
I think it's just a nice word

984
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,399
You get to bring your bag

985
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:57,471
And whatever positive things

986
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,871
Think it's great

987
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,455
Things upon everybody

988
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,479

Group a sit-down

994
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,071
And they get down to business

995
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,887
Sing that song

996
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,423

Alex starts by reading review

1002
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,927
And then

1003
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:52,255
He accidentally reveals a negative side effect of his Medicaid

1004

Fix my temperature but

00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:30,143
Operation

1013
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:36,543
Therapist analyzing Alex Jones

1014
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,823
After his bigoted

1015
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,871
His temper is his worst problem

1016
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:46,527
That might actually feed into a lot of his bigotry

1017
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,855
Those sorts of impulses

1018
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,391
Are we

1019
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:55,231
So maybe you should stop taking super female vitality

1020
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,327
Sojourn

1021
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,607
This goes on

1022
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,887
Forever

1023
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:05,215
Homosexual

1024
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:05,983
Getting another man's

1025
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,031
Absolutely

1026
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:13,407
Unless you're a little bit light in the loafers

1027
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,199
So

1028
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,991
This goes on

1029
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:17,759
For a long time

1030
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,831
The doctor group interview trying to push that product real heart

1031
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:24,415
Feed them to my narrative that I believe is the truth

1032
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:27,231
But he is trying to make money before the fiscal year end

1033
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:30,815
Texas

1034
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,607
Episode I made it clear

1035
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,655
It was just mentioning taxes

1036
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,959
I should have been more clear there's a lot of reasons

1037
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,519
To try and boost your

1038
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,799
Your numbers before the end

1039
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:41,567
Fiscal year

1040
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,615
One of them is if you have loans

1041
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,919
Orleans

1042
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,967
If your credit limit is

1043
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:52,063
Contingent on how much you bring in by the end of fiscal year

1044
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,391
He could be in a situation where the bank will give him any money

1045
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,671
Unless he gets

1046
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,487
2 x amount of dollars

1047
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,279
Bad financial reason

1048
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,839
If your if your company is doing well

1049
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
You don't really need

1050
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,167
The Panic at the end of the fiscal year

1051
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:10,239
If you only really need to do that if you're cooking book

1052
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,031
Or you're in trouble

1053
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,591
So

1054
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,359
Any real books

1055
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,895
I don't think

1056
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:20,735
Bread

1057
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,015
But beyond that

1058
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,575
So I want to just make that clarification

1059
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,111
Might not totally be tax

1060
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,671
Cuz it could be some other credit issue something like that

1061
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,951
But whatever it is it's

1062
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,719
Think Financial

1063
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,815
The time push product before this

1064
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,583
I forgot to mention

1065
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,375
That's

1066
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,399
A shooting

1067
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,679
Of a police officer

1068
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,471
Lake Illinois

1069
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,263
Suburb of Chicago

1070
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,311
Yeah cuz this was only two years ago

1071
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,871
Hahaha

1072
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,175
So

1073
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:55,039
Let me feel Joy at remember to let me ask you if you were mine

1074
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,855

1075
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,135

Alex Jones Joe Biggs out to Fox Lake

1077
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,231
Remember that

1078
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,023
Biggs comes out

1079
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,815
Shooting some remotes

1080
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,351
And their atrocious

1081
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:11,679
I really don't have a good camera system

1082
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,239
So like he's on his cell phone

This is not

1092
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,703
Boring interview

1093
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,311

00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,455
Is in a weird hats

1098
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:59,039
He's always been weird

1099
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,831
We're talking about which

1100
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,367
Which type of

1101
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,951
Today's episode September 3rd

1102
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,231
Incredibly f*****-up

1103
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:07,999
Never forget

1104
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:08,767
8

1105
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,839
He does

1106
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,887
Some stuff that is unconscious

1107
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,167
He says

1108
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,447
Incredibly expensive

1109
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,519
It did the way the show end

1110
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,055
Is unpredictable

1111
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,847
Oops

1112
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,687
In one of the most wild flameouts I've ever seen in my life

1113
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,991
It's going to be really bad

1114
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:31,295
He's going to make you scream

1115
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,855
But just know at the end of it he doesn't feel great

1116
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:40,511
Is about other things

1117
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,583
He suffers he starts the show off talking about

1118
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,863
Alien

1119
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,399
But

1120
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,751
General Public

1121
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,031
Rogers

1122
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:59,199
Turn on front

1123
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,503
Now they're cool

1124
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,783
How they got money

1125
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,831
All of it's just like

1126
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,903
Colors showing off to each other

1127
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,327
I Can See Clearly what happened

1128
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,239
Very poor

1129
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,263
Poorly constructed

1130
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,823
It's just crazy town

1131
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:31,199
In the beginning of a

1132
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:35,295
Tired of complaining

1133
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,095
It's a UFO

1134
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,423
I'm not into aliens

1135
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:56,031
I love the best Millions idiot

1136
00:51:56,287 --> 00:52:01,407
The devil I like that rationality

1137
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,967
It's not this

1138
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,343
Also my mom told me never

1139
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,111
Into a UFO

1140
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,415
Absolutely not very smart

1141
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,975
Whenever you get a chance

1142
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,279
Like UFO

1143
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:21,119
Brett Uber

1144
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,655
If you're going to get into a planet

1145
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:28,287
You know you you want to make sure that you order the planets

1146
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,823
Galaxy Spanish

1147
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,847
Alright I'm about

1148
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:33,151
About how you gas

1149
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:37,247
So are you going to come back on the 3rd he's back already

1150
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,087
Maybe they did get some tips

1151
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,367
In the Infowars

1152
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,903
Sublime that weren't good

1153
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:49,535
And it's also possible

1154
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,863
Was related to Alex Jones

1155
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,399
But somebody saw something

1156
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,167
Reported it

1157
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,215
The police acted on it they jumped

1158
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:00,799
And it turned out it was not the suspect

1159
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:01,567
And the shooting

1160
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,359
Joe Biggs

1161
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,151
Is furious about this bad

1162
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,687
So

1163
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,479
He complains about it a bit

1164
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,015
And then Alex Jones

1165
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,599
Worst shoot

1166
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,391
I think I've ever heard

1167
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,695
And you're going to have to put your mic.

1168
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,303
Looking for difficult

1169
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,095
We talked to the credible threat

1170
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,655
And the next thing you know you start getting

1171
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:30,239
People calling a hater suspicious people walking to our yard

1172
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:34,079
Another was just wild goose chase going on

1173
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,223
It was all because the lady lied because she wanted attention

1174
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:42,527
She wasn't looking for attention

1175
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,831
From a family that she was working for

1176
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:52,255
Through the entire State because of a lodge

1177
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,279
Cross burning

1178
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:59,679
In modern times where it wasn't people doing

1179
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:06,079
Clan murders but not really crossword

1180
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:08,639
Where the swastika put on it as been fake

1181
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:12,479
Every time a dorm gets a swastika put on it has been fake

1182
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:16,063
I mean it's almost

1183
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,111
Is almost always a false flag

1184
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:28,607
Iora black lady

1185
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,143
There is a pension

1186
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:33,215
Criminology

1187
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,775
Most of the making stuff up

1188
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:39,103
To get attention it's just bizarre look when they're all the time

1189
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:45,247
The police don't believe a woman when she's crying

1190
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:50,111
Because many women alive

1191
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,159
I don't get your psychology Alex

1192
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:55,743
A couple things the first thing is

1193
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,023
That he uses

1194
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,815
Specific instances like the Duke

1195
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,095
Lacrosse situation

1196
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,167
Situation

1197
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,703
Ladies

1198
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:07,263
About getting cut off

1199
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,287
Turned out you did do it to her

1200
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,079
There are a couple

1201
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:11,871
Minority

1202
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,687
Situation

1203
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,247
Ben tries to generalize them to pretend

1204
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,319
That most women are lying about being sexually assaulted

1205
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,207
To find

1206
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:30,303
The fact that it's so very rare

1207
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:34,399
Never ever reported in the news that some

1208
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,679
Anytime somebody is

1209
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:37,983
Lies about being raped

1210
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,007
It is

1211
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,823
One reason

1212
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:42,847
Never happen

1213
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,639
Publicized

1214
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,455
Because it never happened

1215
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:48,991
Because that

1216
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,527
Not a real argument

1217
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:53,599
Why do so many women lie about being raped

1218
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:57,951
Is the thing that you say before I explode

1219
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:06,399
This is real f****** think this is a real f****** thing whatever the causeway Alex

1220
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,167
Locations

1221
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,983
First started coming out whenever there was 10 women

1222
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:13,567
Women that he raped or whatever

1223
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,359
Whatever that happen

1224
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:16,895
To go

1225
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,919
Home2 thanks

1226
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,687
Giving

1227
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:19,711
With my

1228
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,271
Wearing my little sister

1229
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,575
And my mom both said

1230
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,343
You know

1231
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,415
Maybe we believe these ladies if so many women didn't

1232
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,743
And I was going to burn their house

1233
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,303
I thought it would be a good idea

1234
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,071
Right

1235
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,095
Now I did

1236
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,375
Because the

1237
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,911
Giant Cross burning

1238
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,703
Didn't go well the last

1239
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:47,359
Everything every hate every hate crime

1240
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:50,431
Everything purple

1241
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,455
Perpetrated on somebody

1242
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:56,575
Report on somebody Global all lies

1243
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,623
But anytime

1244
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,743
Yep

1245
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:06,303
Hit the nail on the head my friend

1246
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:11,679
One of his big pieces of evidence that he's been using a Blog Talk Radio Show

1247
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,543
Women should kill 40% of all men

1248
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:21,407
Today when we make the argument at least I don't have to deal with Trump

1249
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,967
When we make the argument that Alex Jones

1250
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,015
His primary objective

1251
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,039
Is

1252
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,575
White Christian

1253
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,599
Bale

1254
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,647
This is

1255
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,671
Evidence

1256
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,583
Saying something's are faking something

1257
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,167
That's your

1258
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:43,935
Light

1259
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,727
That's your old white guy

1260
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:51,103
Remember they're fine with

1261
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:55,199
Rape and when you guys make Bon Iver memes

1262
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:57,759
Remember that this guy is way worse

1263
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,807
Then you're

1264
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,903
He's a horrible horrible person who's leading thousand

1265
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:04,671
The people

1266
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,207
Into essentially erase

1267
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,791
Congratulations to make him

1268
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,071
Palatable and funny

1269
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,095
Anyway

1270
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:16,191
Now we get to go on

1271
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:17,983
10

1272
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,263
Stillmatic

1273
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:25,151
I understand maybe this is all of our audience clapping their hands you would feel better

1274
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,175
Never clap

1275
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:32,575
I'd like to go policy won't stop right now

1276
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:40,255
This next clip will get you right out of that funk monster

1277
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,023
But

1278
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:43,071
You get the call from a guy who asked

1279
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,095
Somebody's car

1280
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,655
To talk about

1281
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:47,935
His car for about

1282
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,703
10 minutes

1283
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:52,287
Alright a selection of the end

1284
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,591
And I want you to hear like

1285
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,359
Victor

1286
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,151
I'm going to give you a sign

1287
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:59,199
Absolutely don't talk over there

1288
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,479
Cuz the end

1289
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,759
Is f****** banana

1290
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:02,527
Alright I'll just

1291
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,575
No you don't have to

1292
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,367
Maybe

1293
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,647
Playing with fire.

1294
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:10,463
Alright

1295
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:22,495
Legally sell it

1296
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:26,847
For the price listed by.

1297
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,735
I am so

1298
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:36,063
Now they're coming out with more than be a lot more

1299
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:39,903
But it's just a piece of Americana I kind of treated myself

1300
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:43,231
But I think I might actually sell it because

1301
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:50,143
For somebody like me Miss got so much riding on what I'm doing

1302
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,679
People counting on me

1303
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:58,079
So I just want to take a break there to say I mean

1304
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,383
Two years later he saying the exact same thing

1305
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,199
Who's playing the I got to be humble I should

1306
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,015
Wait to get the humble points

1307
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:09,855
Without actually do it making an action

1308
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,647
So many people are relying

1309
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,415
Me

1310
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:13,951
Fake ID

1311
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:14,975
I need to get rid of this help

1312
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:16,511
I just need to

1313
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,535
I just

1314
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,327
I just get out it's like

1315
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,607
It's like when Jesus

1316
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,631
Kick to the money

1317
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:22,911
Out of the church

1318
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,679
Right

1319
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,959
Then he wrote often.

1320
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:27,007
Americana

1321
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:32,127
But the other thing I want to point out is that Alex is so desperately like doing an hour and a half

1322
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,175
Infomercial on yesterday's show

1323
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:37,503
Doing a million-dollar Marathon a week and a half later

1324
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,319
He's talking about just randomly buying a sports car

1325
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:43,903
So I mean there is a disconnect between his personal life

1326
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,695
Of the business

1327
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,975
He clearly isn't

1328
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:48,767
Suffering at all for his

1329
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:51,327
We're suffering at all for the cause

1330
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,679
Like most rich

1331
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,471
People anytime there's layoffs at

1332
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:59,263
Well like when they laid off

1333
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,287
100 copy editor

1334
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,335
At no point

1335
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,359
Did any of the

1336
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,127
The CEOs

1337
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,919
High-level manager say

1338
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,479
Pay cut

1339
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,247
Keep 30

1340
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:13,087
If you guys give

1341
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:17,695
Yeah I put 40 hours a week at least

1342
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,719
Sons of b******

1343
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,767
I mean

1344
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,559
Alex

1345
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:25,631
Nada.

1346
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,655
No

1347
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,751
Can all go f*** them

1348
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:31,519
Sure

1349
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,543
F*** you

1350
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,871
Also Alex himself or how much longer he talks about his car

1351
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:41,759
A woman

1352
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:44,063
The problem is

1353
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,647
Is there a ditch absolutely mate

1354
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,695
It doesn't look like anything's

1355
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,351
I don't like super fancy stuff

1356
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:00,703
I got love Ferraris but I even had the money I wouldn't spend it on that but

1357
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,983
It's just too flashy

1358
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:05,823
The understated stealth nature of it

1359
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:09,663
And the fact that 780 horsepower

1360
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,855
Gordon the car driver and others

1361
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:21,183
So you're sitting in a 780 horsepower car

1362
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,975
It's just sex

1363
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:27,839
And it's even sexier cuz it's more than meets the eye

1364
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,911
I really like that I really like

1365
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:34,239
Does it also transport on the highway on 37

1366
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:40,383
And I was coming back from the base kids with my parents

1367
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:43,455
When I got to go buy 1,000 miles on it

1368
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,991
The first two games.

1369
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:49,343
Why is this Uncle Joe

1370
01:02:54,719 --> 01:03:00,863
I shouldn't have done

1371
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:07,263
So

1372
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:11,871
I'll stay there

1373
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:20,319
What you doing

1374
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,999
What the f***

1375
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:32,351
He just said he was going to let like he was implying that he's letting up a smoke after

1376
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:38,751
Tax write-off movies

1377
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:46,431
I'd like to thank God for all his grace

1378
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,879
Just have like a

1379
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,415
Car radio show

1380
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,719
Click-and-collect

1381
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:04,351
We'd be so much better off as a country possibly or if he was literate and he could just become like a y a author

1382
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,679
Or something like that

1383
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,471
Infection like you already have

1384
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,007
Right but

1385
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:12,799
F******

1386
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:13,567
Look like

1387
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,127
There's those moments of unintentional,

1388
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:16,895
TV

1389
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:19,455
Pivoting to unlock

1390
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,991
Right is going after break

1391
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,783
There's moments like that that are like

1392
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,831
That's how that's f****** hilarious

1393
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:32,511
I just said I f***** the car

1394
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:41,727
Guarantee that guy

1395
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:42,751
Yeah

1396
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:47,615
I'm going to go with the ladder

1397
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:50,431
Also I screamed over but likes point out that Alex

1398
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,967
You can f*** yourself for not liking fast

1399
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,015
Furious and reference

1400
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:58,111
He might have like the first ones though cuz those were

1401
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:01,183
Those ones were more street racing better off

1402
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:01,951
If we had a car

1403
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,119
Paul Walker

1404
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,911
Call Joseph

1405
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:14,495
So you heard at the end

1406
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,287
Alex Jones saying

1407
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:20,127
I was in a really bad mood which we heard

1408
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:20,895
Two days now

1409
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:27,295
Guy calls when I can talk

1410
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,319
Car for 10 minutes

1411
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:30,367
And now I feel great

1412
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:33,183
This next to it

1413
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:35,743
Listen next clip is 6 minutes later

1414
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,279
6 minutes later

1415
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,303
Going to talk about it

1416
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,095
6 minutes later

1417
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:51,871
I love doing this radio show and I just really enjoy it and

1418
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,943
Elephant ears but

1419
01:05:56,735 --> 01:06:00,063
Some days

1420
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:03,647
Gardasil shot having convulsions

1421
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,743
I can't be on it

1422
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,559
I just told him during the break

1423
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,351
Don't get robbed

1424
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:18,751
About the police in studio

1425
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:24,127
Animaker the old fourth hour late

1426
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:31,295
I think it's really just gotten to that point where the evil is so over-the-top

1427
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:36,927
For a few hours and I just need to really

1428
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:42,303
Get my head screwed on straight because

1429
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,839
So Alex Jones

1430
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:47,423
6 minutes earlier

1431
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:48,959
He's a rapid cycler

1432
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:49,983
Gears like

1433
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,775
On top of the world

1434
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:54,591
Talking talking about the car

1435
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,871
F***** my car

1436
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:56,895
Now I'm

1437
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,991
Ladies on Gardasil

1438
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,063
After I fed

1439
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:04,831
Finished jerking off

1440
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,599
Course

1441
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:11,487
Refractory. Don't want to scream anymore

1442
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:14,559
How am I supposed to be a propagandist Photoshop my wad

1443
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,631
Cuz he doesn't

1444
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,935
Late were

1445
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,663
Go get me Rob do he's in the news off

1446
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:33,759
For Studios

1447
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,551
There's a bunch of office

1448
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,343
And all of them have a gun safe

1449
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,135
Now I'm very

1450
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:49,887
Videos online you can find of Alex given a tour of the studio

1451
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,167
Massive building

1452
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:53,215
To the point where it's absurd

1453
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,239
Considering the offer

1454
01:07:55,007 --> 01:08:01,151
How much renting out this Warehouse buying it would be

1455
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,991
Utilities

1456
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,783
Standing Lehigh

1457
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:07,807
Expenses

1458
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,391
That's why he's against government control

1459
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,439
Taxes

1460
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,975
Must be really high on it

1461
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:15,743
Is Warehouse

1462
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:17,535
They're probably

1463
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:19,839
He doesn't leave at least not for the next

1464
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,119
Half hour or so

1465
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,703
In the next half hour

1466
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,983
He gets a caller

1467
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,263
That

1468
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,543
Makes him wish

1469
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,919
I know that I was making a pretty big point

1470
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:34,687
Of this

1471
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,223
Race war narrative

1472
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,759
And the fact that Alex is

1473
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,807
Conflating a Blog Talk radio host

1474
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,575
With no listeners

1475
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,111
Lewes Ferry

1476
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:43,903
And I did so

1477
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,183
Because

1478
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,463
First of all it's

1479
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,743
Manipulative and wrong

1480
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,071
Because it leads up to this caller

1481
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:54,911
The patio in South Carolina you're on the air

1482
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:02,335
Questioning

1483
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:03,359
With myself

1484
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:10,783
How do they think they're going to get away with

1485
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:14,367
George Bush Morgan a million Muslim you know

1486
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:18,463
And Donald Rumsfeld

1487
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:22,303
Daniel

1488
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:26,911
Cocaine

1489
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:42,783
The reason I called

1490
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:15,039
Clearly

1491
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:19,391
Police in general

1492
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,559
I think that rhetoric

1493
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:29,119
Perspective perspective

1494
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:32,191
I don't think he's calling for as much as

1495
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,727
Cobbs

1496
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:35,775
But

1497
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:38,335
Houston General

1498
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:40,639
Are white cops

1499
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:44,991
So here we go first point I'm going to make is

1500
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,527
Daniel is awesome

1501
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,319
You will end up saying couple

1502
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,719
Can't handle it

1503
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,999
Interrupt

1504
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,535
No no no

1505
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,583
What do you want

1506
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,655
The all white people

1507
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,447
I've asked you out

1508
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,263
That's what you're bringing to the table

1509
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,311
Because that's what you're afraid of

1510
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,871
I could hear Louis Farrakhan say that and I don't

1511
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:12,895
Think I'm

1512
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,687
Going to be Target

1513
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:15,967
I don't care black

1514
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:20,063
Don't look at me like that

1515
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:26,463
I get what Louis Farrakhan is saying and I'm not here to say that everything Louis Farrakhan says

1516
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:28,511
Sensible or right

1517
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,583
I am so

1518
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,631
Really the conversation would it needs

1519
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,655
To be unfortunately

1520
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:36,191
Daniel doesn't really

1521
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,471

1524
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,615
It's not dealing with

1525
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:45,407
The Source material is bringing

1526
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,199
Imperial

1527
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:50,783
He does make some other grateful

1528
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:53,087
Analysis tone

1529
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:55,903
Listen to how much more deferential

1530
01:11:59,231 --> 01:11:59,999
He's he's very

1531
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:00,767
Conciliatory

1532
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,071
But also condescend

1533
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,351
Well that's absolutely

1534
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:06,143
Play true as well

1535
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:09,983
He has conciliatory because I think he senses this guy knows

1536
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,311
He's going

1537
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,079
To destroy me

1538
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,383
If I disagree with him forcefully

1539
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:18,943
A knot in just a patronizing

1540
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:19,711
Waited

1541
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:24,063
A lot of white people treat black people

1542
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,855
Sort of push

1543
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,391
He's going to come back at

1544
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,695
Alex knows that

1545
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,463
Oh wow

1546
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:36,351
He has his guard up quite a bit

1547
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,399
I don't want to talk about it

1548
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,423
I think I I think

1549
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,775
Never listen to like Freeway Rick Ross talk

1551
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:49,151
For sure like

1552
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:52,223
If I believe him if I don't but his story is basically

1553
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:55,039
That he was getting cocaine and crack

1554
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,575
From the government

1555
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:57,599
Excelling at

1556
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:00,671
Like he was the funnel through which

1557
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,439

1558
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:04,767

Totally

1560
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,327
Supposed to be impossible

1561
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,863
It seems like it's possible

1562
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:12,191
I don't know

1563
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:13,983
You might as well introduce

1564
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,007
Crack to the black

1565
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:20,895
Conspiracies

1566
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:21,663
I think

1567
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,431
Possible

1568
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,223
Maybe even likely

1569
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:26,271

1573
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,727
Would be able to get away with that

1574
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:51,103
Unless he's either intimidated the government

1575
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:53,407
Mama

1576
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,735
That was absolutely true

1577
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:04,927
Is just

1578
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:06,719
What shocking up

1579
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:13,887

1588

01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,839
So let's get back to the scholar who is

1592
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,375

To get out of class

1659
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:36,512
That's the level of

1660
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:37,792
That's like

1661
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:42,912
He's in a bad mood that day earlier he's like I got to go

My boss at like 11 that I don't feel great and I might need to leave

1663
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:51,104

1664
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,688

1667
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:59,296
Point and personal experience that Alex

1668
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,088
Does not have a good argument for

1669
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:04,160
He's making these points for the hold button on

1670
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:07,488
Loses the argument pretends he didn't

1671
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,048
Alex takes the next day off

1672
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,328
He takes Friday off

1673
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,864
Take a long weekend

1674
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:14,912
A good idea

1675
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:15,680
I don't think

1676
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:19,264
He had to leave I don't think you had low blood sugar

1677
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,824
Haven't got a plane to catch

1678
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,640
I think that's a steal this is bulshit

1679
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,176
No no

1680
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,736
Would be able to

1681
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:32,832
I think any longer of a conversation

1682
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:36,160
A little bit more so than he already

1683
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:38,976
I think a lot of his listeners are probably just like yeah

1684
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,000
Alex is right

1685
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:40,768
This guy does like

1686
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:44,352
Isaac

1687
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,632
That Alex Jones

1688
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,168
Might have gone to take

1689
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:47,936
A meeting

1690
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:48,704
Or something like that

1691
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,264
I think that there's some sort of business

1692
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,032
He's doing behind

1693
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,664
He's gone for Friday comes back

1694
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:59,712
That's what I

1695
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,992
That's my that's my

1696
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:01,760
Catch

1697
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,040
I don't know that to be

1698
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,576
Exactly

1699
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:06,624
But that's what I that's what I feel like

1700
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,416
You know that took a vacation

1701
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:09,952
That's entirely

1702
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,256
Either way

1703
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:15,072
Pretty wild oceans

1704
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:17,632
Take a lot of vacation

1705
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:18,656
That's good.

1706
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:20,960

01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:30,944
I support

1711
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,480
Even Alex Jones

1712
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:33,760
Having labor right

1713
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:37,088
If you agree but if he screams about like

1714
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:38,624
How

1715
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,928
He eats sleeps and breathes this

1716
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:43,488
Revolution in fighting globalist

1717
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:46,560
You don't have a competent team back home

1718
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,912
You can't have anybody Gucci already hosts a whole show what he does

1719
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:51,936
Friday

1720
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:52,960
Disaster

1721
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:58,848
I like I said that's what happens on Friday but the Thursday show that we're going over here this September 3rd

1722
01:23:59,104 --> 01:23:59,616
Quite done

1723
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,152
They go to break

1724
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,480
Studio

1725
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,528
And Rob do

1726
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:08,320
Clean up

1727
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,344
With this collar

1728
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:13,440
They've kept him over

1729
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,208
The break

1730
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:17,792
No chill

1731
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:24,192
What basically what happened to his yet Rob do just have to let this guy to make a whole bunch of

1732
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:25,472
Disregard

1733
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,432
And then

1734
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,760
Rob do loses the argue

1735
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:38,784
Very

1736
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,064
Ungrateful

1737
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:46,208
He just loses it in a very boring fashion

1738
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:53,376
Sort of his style is a boring man in my office

1739
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:58,240
Yo-zuri Justified why he's angry

1740
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:00,288
I just want to say this for a go back to him

1741
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:06,688
If you start shooting more with the police it's on either side we have to defeat this

1742
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,968
With the infowar

1743
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:09,248
Using cameras

1744
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:11,040
Putting this stuff out and just

1745
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:15,648
Inching forward it's not going to change overnight I can tell you that

1746
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:17,440
I want to be clear up top

1747
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:20,000
The Infowars video on Pole

1748
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:22,560
I think they're really going to help

1749
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:30,496
That is hit the black

1750
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:32,800
Community

1751
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:39,200
Police horse videos but it's always about how

1752
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,480
White people are being oppressed

1753
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:44,832
The police aren't doing anything about it or white people are also bothered by police

1754
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:47,648
Top shotta

1755
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,416
So it's great

1756
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,184
It's good stuff

1757
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:53,280
Isn't saying

1758
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,072
We should have a shooting war with Apple

1759
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,400
So even in setting up going back to

1760
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,680
Call is misrepresenting

1761
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:01,984
The position of the car

1762
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,008
After this point

1763
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:03,776
Pretty sensitive

1764
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:04,800
Yeah

1765
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:05,568
So

1766
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:06,592
That's not fair

1767
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:08,384
Finished with what you were talking about

1768
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:14,528
Black lives matter

1769
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:17,344
BlogTalkRadio shooting probably

1770
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:26,560
Are Airway Veneno millions of people here I got a question

1771
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:35,776
Hell yeah

1772
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,832
No way to get Justice

1773
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:53,696
Understand

1774
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:12,384
I was joking

1775
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:16,992
Mainstream media

1776
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:22,624
There's the only point of me to take issue with him

1777
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,632
Media narrative

1778
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:38,752
That's not good I don't appreciate

1779
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:40,288
I still think I could hang out with him

1780
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:42,592
Yeah we could probably

1781
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:44,128
Bruno argue about that

1782
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,920
Rationally and civilly

1783
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,576
At least until things have a pretty good head on his shoulders in terms of

1784
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,112
These not willfully Missy

1785
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:19,712
Theater Snellville

1786
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,040
Okay

1787
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:29,440
Rally

1788
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:44,032
Unconcerned

1789
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:50,432
Minister Farrakhan

1790
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:57,344
Completely

1791
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:10,656
I understand

1792
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:27,040
This

1793
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:29,344
Ourselves

1794
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:36,768
The same thing

1795
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:50,080
Open Season

1796
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:59,040
This is why we

1797
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:02,880
Nihilism

1798
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:08,000
What someone talk for a really long time make some good points

1799
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:10,048
You're wrong

1800
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:13,120
I appreciate your perspective you just don't know

1801
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:15,168
Also I want to do things

1802
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:17,728
1

1803
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,008
King Noble

1804
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:22,080
Is not necessarily associated with black lives matter

1805
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:27,456
The only evidence that we have from the clip

1806
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,992
The black lives matter what

1807
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:31,040
Didn't get it done it wasn't enough

1808
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,832
Like

1809
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,880
The black community tried to give

1810
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:39,744
Understanding a chance blacklivesmatter

1811
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,768
Albert

1812
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:43,072
Alternative to what you would like

1813
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:47,424
Being deeply involved with black lives matter at all

1814
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,960
Does using

1815
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:49,984
Like that

1816
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,008
As a conflation

1817
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:52,288
Shinola

1818
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,824
Complacent

1819
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:57,152
I would argue

1820
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:59,200
That ever grew

1821
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:00,480
Is protest

1822
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,272
And they're changing oink oink

1823
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,040
Mukbang

1824
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:04,832
It's possible

1825
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:07,392
To be interpreted as but true cop

1826
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:08,672
It's also possible

1827
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:11,488
Play the cops keep shooting people

1828
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,864
So I don't think that's necessarily

1829
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,656
A call to violence I don't think that

1830
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:19,680
Certainly

1831
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:22,240
That's certainly very well within the free speech

1832
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,264
Alex

1833
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,288
Care-A-Lot about

1834
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:26,592
Oldest stuff

1835
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:27,872
Exactly how lunatic

1836
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:34,784
Oh so close

1837
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,576
I know I run to bed

1838
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:42,976
Investigation

1839
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:46,304
I think it was all the pretty embarrassing show

1840
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,352
On Alex's part

1841
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:50,656
You know you start with him

1842
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:53,984
Building up this black narrative is white

1843
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:55,008
Cops

1844
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:57,056
Are going to be targeted by black people

1845
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:57,824
Begets

1846
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:59,616
Incredibly intelligent

1847
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:01,664
Collared with a lot of fact

1848
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,456
A lot of perspective on his side

1849
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:05,248
Alex let me bail

1850
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:08,832
Lisa Rob do to take the brunt of it

1851
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:11,136
The guy

1852
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:13,440
Make all those points on the show

1853
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:15,232
But that's just because

1854
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:16,512
I don't know why they

1855
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:17,792
Let's very weird

1856
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:22,400
I think much about the races

1857
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:23,168
The caller

1858
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,728
Probably

1859
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:26,496
They would

1860
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:28,544
Even they are aware of the optic

1861
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:32,128
Alex Jones

1862
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:34,432
Maybe or the

1863
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,200
Re-up

1864
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,624
I think you're probably right I think they were I think they are aware of that which is

1865
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,392
She's why

1866
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,976
Which is why they dismiss him at

1867
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,256
End of every

1868
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:50,816
Never engaged with what

1869
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:51,840
Says just go

1870
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:56,960
You know what where you're coming from

1871
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:57,984
Like

1872
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,520
Yeah I think you're probably right

1873
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:02,336
His usual tactic of harassing

1874
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:07,712
Erupting would be like

1875
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,480
Yeah exactly

1876
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:14,368
The other point I'd like to make at the end of this is I think we've heard a couple of things in this episode that are substantially worse

1877
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:17,440
Any meme you can possibly make about Alex Jones

1878
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:22,816
I think one of the big issues that I always

1879
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:23,584
We have with you

1880
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:25,120
Is that

1881
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:27,168
It always

1882
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,960
It's like they're always giving

1883
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:30,752
They're always at like

1884
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:33,056
Farrakhan shouldn't be saying those

1885
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:34,848
There's a better way to say that

1886
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:38,176
You should black

1887
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:40,736
It doesn't look like they're reaching out

1888
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:43,040
Well it looks like they're doing all of this stuff

1889
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:44,320
And it's always

1890
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,856
Is always this b*******

1891
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:47,136
It's on black live

1892
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:49,184
Is matter

1893
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:54,816
It's always on them like black people haven't been trying it the right way

1894
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:56,608
Quote-unquote right way

1895
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:58,400
All of the

1896
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:05,056
Smaller-scale

1897
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:07,360
I blame the fact they haven't called me

1898
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:09,152
I could call them

1899
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:15,040
Analogy there that's

1900
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:21,440
The great one but I blame the other party for not reaching out to the other one not reaching out themselves

1901
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:24,768
Especially when you're

1902
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:26,560
Contacts

1903
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,096
When it is

1904
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:30,912
300 f******

1905
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:35,776
Always trying to reach out of

1906
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:38,080
This is how you're going to get white

1907
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:39,616
This is

1908
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:41,152
You're going to be able to

1909
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,456
Never actually engaged

1910
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,784
Never saying you know what this is

1911
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:48,832
Listen to you

1912
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:51,648
To listen to you

1913
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:53,184
But the right way

1914
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:57,280
What the f****** do every time

1915
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:03,168
And I don't think he I don't think even Farrakhan his things

1916
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,472
No I don't think

1917
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:07,776
Even in the context with

1918
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,544
Within which

1919
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,336
She said it know where Andy said

1920
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:11,360
This Vista

1921
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,384
What should

1922
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,200
Exactly

1923
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:19,040
Making the correct point

1924
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:19,808
The right way

1925
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:25,696
What are you saying is

1926
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:28,256
We may have to

1927
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,072
Prevent violence

1928
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,096
To get people

1929
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:37,984
To do the thing they should be doing in the first place

1930
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:43,104
As much as everybody wants to say Martin Luther King Jr did everything by Nonpoint

1931
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,920
I will be goddamned if there weren't plenty of people

1932
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,992
Put out a real physical

1933
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:50,528
Ghetto

1934
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:51,808
Don't f*** with it

1935
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:54,880
Revolution revolutions need two prongs

1936
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:57,184
Yeah that's what the proud boys

1937
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:01,792
Understand that's why they have their normal military branch

1938
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:04,352
Wright Giants

1939
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:08,704
Absolutely

1940
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,776
So I want to reiterate again

1941
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,824
I am sorry that I keep harping on this

1942
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:14,592
But

1943
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:18,944
These memes are ineffective in battling Alex Jones is better ways to do it

1944
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:23,808
I do agree with you in that

1945
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:25,344
I mean

1946
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:27,904
There has to be a middle grounds over

1947
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,952
Between a 3-hour

1948
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,000
Investigate

1949
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:34,048
Nation bright

1950
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:35,328
Bon Iver

1951
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:37,888
Strike

1952
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:41,472
Do you think we could put out a clip of Alex Jones

1953
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:43,520
That clip of Alex Jones being drunk

1954
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:47,104
I put that without on YouTube

1955
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,640
Yeah I mean would that be

1956
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:55,296
I was drunk drunk on his show

1957
01:36:56,320 --> 01:37:01,952
We don't have Time Warner behind as it's not a hit piece by Time Warner

1958
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:03,232
Text Jones drunk on air

1959
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,000
Right

1960
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:10,400
I don't know man I don't know what the answer is but at the end of the day I'm really excited and thankful that we do have

1961
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:14,752
The people listening that we do that is really awesome I really appreciate people who have reached out

1962
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:23,200
All that stuff does keep help me keep moving even though I have to be inundated with everybody f****** setting between

1963
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:26,784
That I know a week later

1964
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:33,184
You're so resentful I'm not resentful it's I'm not mad at them I get it I get the like I'm mad

1965
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,208
The fact is that

1966
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:40,608
I know from my experience Val Jones when someone treats me these means a week later they're going to be on his show in a positive

1967
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:42,912
Extra

1968
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:47,776
Jeff

1969
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:50,336
You follow along with his narrative it just becomes

1970
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:52,896
Part of it and it is neutralized amongst

1971
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:54,944
His people

1972
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:56,480
It's very import

1973
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,272
I am it's not

1974
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,040
Dislike

1975
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:02,880
It's not Super Deluxe his job to I don't even know if they're really interested

1976
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:05,696
Actually working against Alex jump

1977
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:09,536
I'm not sure what their goal is probably just make it quick

1978
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,656
Something that I

1979
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:15,680
Would disagree

1980
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:18,240
Hoosier I don't either accepted them.

1981
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:20,032
It is

1982
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,640
Because it's actually you're creating a tool that this propagandist will use

1983
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:26,432
It's not Huber four humors

1984
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,760
Be a result of it is outside

1985
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:30,528
Control

1986
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:33,088
You've created something that will be repurposed

1987
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,368
By someone

1988
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:37,952
Who believes that almost all rape accusations are fake

1989
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:40,000
Racism is a false flag

1990
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:46,400
And globalist control the world so whatever bigotry that lies in his heart is inconsequential and everybody should pay attention

1991
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:49,216
Dumb veiled anti-semitism

1992
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:51,520
So what you're doing is you're helping him

1993
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:56,128
And I don't know if people who are making these things don't realize that ahead of time

1994
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:57,408
But I wish they would

1995
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:59,200
I wish people would understand

1996
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:00,224
That they

1997
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,272
The best oven temp

1998
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,040
Since I'm sure

1999
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:04,576
Are there being a tool

2000
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:05,856
Their tool for Alex Jones

2001
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:07,904
Although

2002
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:10,464
When you when you say that though like

2003
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,256
We can't control how

2004
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,280
People take this up

2005
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:16,352
No

2006
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:20,192
Right if it's out there I'm sure there's a way

2007
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:21,472
To find something

2008
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:23,776
But like I said like I said in the beginning

2009
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:24,800
If he wants

2010
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:27,616
Clip of me saying some s*** out of context

2011
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:28,640
Right

2012
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:29,920
That's in his narrative

2013
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,968
Breitbart

2014
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,344
Cuz I'll tell you what

2015
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,904
Play without me dad I know Jordan

2016
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:42,464
You're you have it completely back

2017
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:45,024
Okay because of Alex Jones.

2018
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,304
And took you out of con

2019
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:50,912
Then we get to play The Alex Jones game with him making fun of us

2020
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:52,704
You understand

2021
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,752
Your flip-flops

2022
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:55,776
Okay

2023
01:39:58,336 --> 01:40:02,176
We are taking him in context and engaging with what he's saying

2024
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:03,712
So

2025
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:04,480
Any attack

2026
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:06,784
Would have to be taking us out of context

2027
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,088
Or debating the merits of what we're saying

2028
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:09,856
Wichita

2029
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:10,624
Right

2030
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:13,440
So there isn't really a way to use this

2031
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:15,744
Propaganda Stickley for him

2032
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,328
REI

2033
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:22,144
He's already called himself the meme machine

2034
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,424
The king of memes

2035
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:25,472
Really you're just reinforcing the

2036
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:28,032
I know I know is aware of it

2037
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:28,800
He knows that he can

2038
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:30,080
Of course

2039
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:32,896
And I know that I'm a crank and I don't like fun

2040
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:33,920
And all that I get

2041
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:36,736
I get that that's my personality

2042
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:37,760
But

2043
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:39,040
This is

2044
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:40,320
More than just that

2045
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:41,344
This is

2046
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,624
Sincerely I believe

2047
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,904
It is

2048
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:45,696
A moral imperative

2049
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,488
To not help

2050
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:50,048
I agree

2051
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:51,328
Good

2052
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:55,168
If you don't want to help him you can go to our website

2053
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,520
Dollartree.com

2054
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:04,128
Poor male vitality

2055
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:08,224
Sublingual

2056
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:08,992
And then

2057
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:14,112
Immediately exactly calm

2058
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:16,672
Although we're on Twitter at knowledge underscore fight

2059
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:21,536
Look us up we still don't have a picture nope

2060
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:28,960
Open Facebook I just now it's right on Facebook

2061
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,080
Nowhere

2062
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:42,272
To everybody who's become

2063
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,040

We have more and more people

01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:52,768
Finding the show Westworld truly amazing

2068
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:55,328
Started many of those what's that f****** mean though

2069
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,912
Ambetter

2070
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:04,288
Better grateful for what we have

40 million people listening to the show every week

2072
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,944
Then why was one reason why

2073
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:11,968
Cuz there's one man

2074
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:12,992
Who still exist

2075
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:13,760
In this world

2076
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:16,064
What network is curious about this guy

2077
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,112
I don't understand

2078
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:24,768
I was trying to figure out cuz I was also trying to figure out how to

2079
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:30,144
