You can really cook chicken breasts on top of the stove

32
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,816
I can't do this

33
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
It's for someone else

34
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:48,704

It's unclear who will now represent

142
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
Most likely is

143
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,727
Continue representing him until

00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,031
Case begins jury selection

00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,103
And then proceeds for however long it's going to end up going on

00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,455

That's not good I mean that's one of the big possibility

He doesn't want to represent

00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
I think it's unlikely

00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,911
Considering how much of a

00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,503
Is it normal to realize that that case was going to end

179
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,343
How do you know that would be bad for his particular brand

180
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:46,719
It's fun and profitable to be the Firebrand Rebel lawyers supporting Alex Ruiz free speech

181
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,535
Until you have to make

182
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
It's really good

00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,423
Postponing things

184
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,335
Make the argument

185
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:09,247
If your lawyer like Titus

186
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,783
I think this might just be

187
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:21,535
I'm going to end up seeing the inside and I can't do that

188
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:26,143
Again if I'm the guy who's trying to defend Alex on this shaky ass crowd

189
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:30,751
So I think those are the most likely hasn't commented on it so there's a

190
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,847
There's an entirely other explanation

191
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,639
By Alex

192
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
I'm going to say that

193
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,527
I'm not saying it's just saying that people are talking

194
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:48,927
Here in the minimoys voices all around

195
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,231

196
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:59,679
Lawyer to represent him

197
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,703
And his options on

198
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,615
Completely give them up to speed

199
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,895
It's a huge

200
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,783
Being as well

201
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,599
Because like he has Barnes and Norm

202
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
I was like I said.

203
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
Tag team of lawyers

204
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:25,023
Celebrity lawyers say they was there

205
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:32,447
Who is Hozier

206
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,239
The guy who hates Rodger Stone

207
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:46,783
Brown bar we can go to Alexandra

208
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,623
Going to happen

209
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,511
Inclination

210
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,559
Steak on outer case

211
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
The most likely thing

212
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,935
Is probably a combination of

213
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,007
The money and the we're going to lose

214
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
This isn't worth

215
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
It for me anymore

216
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,103
That's just my sense of it who knows

217
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:17,759
Also you can't be thrilled with Rob dues deposition deposition

218
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,087
Probably like

219
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,135
The money is part of it

220
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,927
In such a way that

221
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,511
The money now allows him to do what he's always wanted to do which is

222
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,279
Kick Alex to the car

223
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:34,911
He's always hated Alex but the money was too good now that the money might be even shaky it's like

224
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Finally

225
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
F*** you man

226
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
Wobbly

227
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,759
The New World Order is going

228
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,063
To bring in this absolute

229
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
It's going to happen

230
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
There's some people who aren't

231
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
Going to go along with

232
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,487
The plan man

233
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:03,327
Now the problem is there is a large minority of Americans

234
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,375
Along with this

235
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,495
Unless there is a giant Awakening now

236
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,799
Total understanding of this fraud

237
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
We don't have a

238
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383

Verity

241
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,063
We were turning the tide the Chinese spies were being arrested

242
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,647
And then the Deep state that I can set up account in Chinese

243
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
Rockefeller

00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439

Before boarding

250
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Years ago

251
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:13,727
It's too pretty early on

252
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,799
Stone something actually real

253
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,103
I saw ABC News

254
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
I'll need an atom has 5 eyes

255
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,711

Avalon lab

00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:46,239
Concord

261
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
The same thing

262
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
How to steal

263
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,895
Consistently doing we developed

264
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,527
Adopted supposed to be inverse

265
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,111
This is honestly one of the most scary roads

266
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,671
I've traveled

267
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:09,791
Talking about something real

268
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,327
Pierce

269
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,351
2B is tariff

270
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
Over the weekend

271
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,471
Fox News reported on a

272
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,775
Intelligence Alliance

273
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,151
Chinese actions over the course of

274
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,343
There's a good amount of discussion of

275
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
The theory that the virus accident

276
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
Escape from

277
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
But it's also clear

278
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
Presented to definitively point

279
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
Scenario

280
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
Sources who spoke

281
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,191
The Fox News say it's being

282
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
About how the alpha

283
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:55,871
The article is pretty explicit that no matter what theory is being believed or natural origin Siri

284
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,919
Scenarios are attributable to

285
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
2 mistakes

286
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,735
There's no malicious intent behind it

287
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
In the Box

288
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
Snooze story

Daily Telegraph

A tablet out of Australia

291
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:14,303
The Daily Telegraph is owned by News Corp Australia score on Fox News

292
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,655
Echoes of the same operation

293
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
Velox

294
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,703
Step if you will

295
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:26,079
The Daily Telegraph article claims actual size report

296
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:31,199
The information they claim it is absolutely terrifying

297
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,759
Reading over the telegraph article there's some

298
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:39,391
2015 UNC Chapel Hill

299
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,279
Origin of the virus

300
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,863
Covid-19

301
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:55,263
The idea is that it's a part of it

302
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,383
In foreign policy made me feel more worried

303
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,967
Read as it discussed this supposed intelligence report that was

304
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,879
Australia

305
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:19,071
That leaves us and Zealand as member states

306
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
Tried to dispute

307
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:24,447
This intelligence.

308
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,775
Making an argument that a majority of countries

309
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,799
Do not support

310
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,639
Keep in mind specifically reporting animus

311
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
Which it is not

312
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,807
And the distance just gently saying Iraq

313
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:40,831
Iraq

314
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,135
Iraq all over again

315
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,695
Let's make up a reason

316
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,255
The foreign policy article points out that everything

317
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:52,863
The telegraph article

318
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
Source until a

319
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,679
Meaning it's readily available online

320
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,959
There's nothing

321
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,519
That's new or would be indicative of an intelligence

322
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,079
Product or some sort of secret

323
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,895
Compilation of things you can find out

324
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,943
Which socks it's a bunch of

325
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,735
Papers from Alex's death

326
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
Facebook

327
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,391
Intelligence service

328
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,416
From the article

329
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,584
Davis

330
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
Is Intuit

331
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,936
Canadian former colleagues

332
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,728
The White House

333
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008
Position is bad

334
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,312
As for the other five I Centre she said

335
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,688
Stand is also being used

336
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
American politicization

337
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,272
It's almost like they did that on purpose

338
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,088
I can't sleep

339
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,976
Using crowdsourced theories about the origins of the Coronavirus

340
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:57,376
This is just unfortunate misreporting by the telegraph

341
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
But how this all could

342
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
Play out

343
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:02,240
It represent the first time I can think of that Infowars

344
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,288
Conspiracy theories made their way into a couple

345
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
Intelligence

346
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:05,824
Report

347
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
Which makes me shudder

348
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:13,248
National

349
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
The following

350
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,344
Where do you have any evidence in the answer was

351
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,696
But somehow

352
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,304
People who read headlines

353
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,328
The way to go

354
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,656
Is definitely Mike Pompeo

355
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,448
Mike Pompeo lies who are f******

356
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
Places with no information

357
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,056
That's the way to go

358
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,360
Real serious proof about

359
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
This conversation

360
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,176
A happening at this level and like

361
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
You're absolutely

362
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,016
Are you are you ready

363
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,064
Just getting involved in situations

364
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
Greenway over on

365
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,672
The ramifications of a could be

366
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,720
Ridiculous

367
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,768
Complain to the next clip but he's been right

368
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,304
About fauci

369
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
And because of that

370
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,704
He's got a tail on

371
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,520
Exactly

372
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,080
Play

373
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,456
She's involved

374
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,504
We saw the exact virus to chimera

375
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,040
Show me the white papers

376
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
It doesn't look shows on it

377
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
Let me not start

378
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,792
That's what goes on in this country

379
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,608
Get ready to General phlegmy that's fine

380
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
All American

381
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:39,520
Getting ready to General Flynn

382
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:42,080
I mean I think what you have here is

383
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:46,432
Continuation of Legend building

384
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,248
Comes to pass whenever

385
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,112
Private investigator

386
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,256
Gator on his current wife

387
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:12,544
It's not they wouldn't be the first time that a lawyer's hired a private investigator so yeah

388
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,312
Why not

389
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,360
Yeah that's a possibility

390
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,640
Concretely say that

391
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:20,480
It's a Tesla

392
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:25,344
To create the narrative that allows the end of his career

393
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
Tubi

394
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,904
A noble thing or something

395
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,208
Is an FBI agent

396
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:38,400
Alex take something

397
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,448
Reported as news

398
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
We've got

399
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,056
The Prado articles for there just

400
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,016
That's what he

401
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:58,880
CDC

402
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
Did instead of over

403
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
60000

404
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,952
United States Coronavirus

405
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,000
7000

406
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:04,768
308

407
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,120
This claim was taken and repeat it over and over again

408
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,400
Booking Twitter

409
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,192
Check the data where it came from

410
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,496
From the cdc's

411
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,312
Provisional Council covid-19 tracker

412
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:23,968
And it's something real

413
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,320
The cdc's website is not the most epic

414
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
Today tour

415
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
Apple website

416
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,904
That's not necessarily

417
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,976
Process doesn't cater to up-to-the-minute reporting

418
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:41,120
These claims are taken from says very clearly

419
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,168
Provisional death counts may not match

420
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:46,752
Cancel other sources such as

421
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:51,616
Arkansas

422
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
The reasons listed are quote

423
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,200
Steak timer

424
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,968
Completed

425
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,504
State States reported

426
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
It takes extra

427
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,832
Time to code covid-19

428
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
And other reports

429
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,416
Systems use different definitions or methods

430
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,440
Workout

431
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,488
They further go on to say that

432
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:10,816
Exchange

433
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,608
From the very

434
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,888
It's being used as a source

435
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:17,728
The claim is that the numbers

436
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,264
Picture of what

437
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
Possibly glimpse

438
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,104
Hindu how things look

439
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,128
22 weeks ago

440
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,944
If you look at other trackers like world

441
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,992
You can check with the total death count was

442
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,016
2 weeks ago

443
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,808
Pretty close to 37th

444
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,088
So that kind of makes sense

445
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,160
In 2 weeks on the cdc's

446
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,792
For now this isn't

447
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,072
Is Alex's recording

448
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,888
Decided to report it without

449
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,936
Consulting the CDC page himself to get any

450
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
Further information on the subject

451
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:53,824
He doesn't care about the stories he's reporting only about advancing the narrative

452
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,128
Regardless of how much she has to make up along the way

453
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,920
Naive listener

454
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,224
Alex is reporting on hard research news

455
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,112
Any idea about the subject he's covering

456
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
It's factually inaccurate

457
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,928
Has ever done

458
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,976
It used to be drug chat line

459
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
Turn sound on for

460
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
Channel Twitter

461
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,888
That's what his show is in terms of information

462
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,936
Yeah yeah it's a war

463
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,616
The war on information

464
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,664
Reality is nothing

465
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,504
Sitting in a nap

466
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,552
Another article

467
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
This one's about

468
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
The election

469
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,136
Very exciting

470
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,672
We got that

471
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,976
You didn't just hear this year

472
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,000
If you heard this year

473
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,072
The Hillary

474
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,120
Oh here we go

475
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:53,216
Officially

476
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,264
That they are considering the plan

477
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,288
For Hillary

478
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,848
Run but Obama to be her VP

479
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,640
Groudon

480
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,664
God

481
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,992
Conversation

482
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,552
Your stone was saying This Is the End

483
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,320
Or you got arrested

484
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
Call Metallica

485
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:14,208
It literally has his header

486
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,232
The views expressed by

487
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,792
Contributors are there

488
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:22,144
Hillary Clinton Barack Obama tickets

489
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,936
Is it even possible

490
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,472
It's a fantastic

491
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:29,824
Suggest

492
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:34,176
Doesn't seem to be in primaries this election

493
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,992
Can seasoning

494
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,016
Reconsider

495
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,440
Idea of Hillary and Obama

496
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:49,792
And then the discussion president

497
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:55,680
There's literally nothing to be at other than one person's fantasy booking of the elect

498
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,032
So this was written by Douglas MacKinnon

499
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,312
Inconsiderate

500
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,336
Concluded

501
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,664
Communications

502
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,272
Consultant was a writer in the white house for president

503
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,368
It also be good to know a little bit

504
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,160
Without a grain of salt

505
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,512
Don't need to know anything more than right

506
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
Got it all

507
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:27,424
Bit of a resume for him to be spouting nonsense about the Democratic

508
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,472
I really do think

509
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:33,824
The time for us to listen to what Republicans have to say about what

510
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
They've got a great track

511
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:40,992
Yourself

512
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,784
A2014 McKinnon published

513
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,856
The book titled the secessionist States of America

514
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,136
The blueprints for creating a

515
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,440
Country...

516
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,720
Now

517
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:57,120
His book was legitimately call for the South Teresa seed

518
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:00,192
And created new country

519
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,216
Just right principle

520
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,752
Basically Fundamentalist

521
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
Caliphate

522
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,080
A proposed name for the new country

523
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
Reagan

524
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
Would make sense

525
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
Name

526
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,224
Country Reagan

527
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:16,832
I really think somebody with ideas that bad needs to be kept

528
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,856
Kept somewhere safe

529
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:21,440
Apparently this country

530
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:25,024
Georgia and South Carolina

531
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
Get on board

532
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,840
To be disappointed to learn

533
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,376
But he specifically left

534
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,912
Texas out because quote

535
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:35,008
Incursions into Texas and other places from Subway

536
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,600
Los Angeles

537
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,648
And Broward County number 10

538
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,952
What is playing

539
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,256
Tolerance

540
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:04,960
I was thinking of another name

541
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:11,360
I think they tried it one time

542
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,248
What was the name of that Dan

543
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:21,856
Heard about this that's probably right

544
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:25,952
Promoted his book on a right-wing radio show

545
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,536
Confederacy

546
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:35,424
In response to

547
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,192
A Tribune

548
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,800
Conservative writer for places that have low standards like Tucker Carlson

549
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,592
Trash rag Daily Caller

550
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,872
350

551
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:50,272
Jeep 2020

552
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,112
This dude is a trump loving columnist is largely

553
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,536
Suggested democratic

554
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:08,960
It's because they really like yelling about Hillary and Obama

555
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,776
Absolutely

556
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
Should not have done

557
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,408
Thanks but whether or not it was

558
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:20,480
Potentially possible for Obama to run as a vice president

559
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,528
It's another thing to publish this b*******

560
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,576
6 years ago

561
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,856
Was writing a book

562
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:29,184
States to secede from the country because he was mad about lgbtq

563
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,280
Acceptance

564
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:39,168
Seriously

565
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,448
Is there

566
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,472
Coming out

567
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,384
Pics of this work for his narrative so whatever

568
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,200
Controlled opposition for alley

569
00:32:54,272 --> 00:33:00,416
Mad about it it really does seem like they're working together

570
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,792
Actually working together

571
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,144
Together

572
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,448
Together like Lego blocks

573
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,240
Very stupid

574
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,568
Has episode Alex decide

575
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,896
He needs to

576
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:21,920
Discuss the fact

577
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,944
But everybody

578
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,224
About him

579
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,552
Here in this

580
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,880
Return I'm going to respond

581
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:37,792
What are the biggest stories Friday and Saturday for 2 days

582
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,584
Number one on

583
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,216
Thanks everybody by the way

584
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,568
It was a shame

585
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
A modest proposal

586
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,832
Sure

587
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,096
I misrepresented exactly as I thought they would

588
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,400
They beautifully on that

589
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,704
Until now I've been able to

590
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,800
That millions of millions of years on other videos we put out

591
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,640
Where we talked about a modest proposal

592
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,712
Now we could

593
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,760
Suppose the absurdity of eating children

594
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,064
Opposed

595
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:43,328
Cannibalism

596
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
Free Press

597
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,040
Given the circumstances

598
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:07,392
Yeah I agree

599
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:11,488
All the time to get attention after on Tuesday and Wednesday

600
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,792
This is why it's really important

601
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,816
Do you have outburst

602
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,840
Ludacris prison

603
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,192
A failure and a waste of time

604
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,984
He didn't get what he wanted out of

605
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:27,104
Now we can pretend that what he wanted

606
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,712
It was always about getting himself attention

607
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,272
More people

608
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,808
Exactly what he got

609
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,368
I am so mad he said that Direct

610
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,672
Likely to us

611
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,048
Because we

612
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,608
Google I mean

613
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,888
The exact

614
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,448
The exact thing of how it happened

615
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,496
At least trying

616
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:01,152
Exactly how I hoped it was

617
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,176
Man

618
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:05,504
Not fair that in the moment he was like

619
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,040
Really like

620
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,832
I'm going to get press out of this

621
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,392
As soon as he went to commercial use like

622
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,440
Cover that

623
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,464
Get take a clip and

624
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,304
Attempt to take out contacts

625
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,096
Because that's just money on the table

626
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,168
So Alex talks a little bit about

627
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
This rant

628
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,240
Not to talk about this more

629
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,080
The more frustrated I got

630
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
Google

631
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,384
Yeah you'll see you'll see why

632
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:43,136
Virginia

633
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,256
Really does that

634
00:36:56,192 --> 00:37:00,288
He didn't say instead of killing babies

635
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,080
Piece of equation

636
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:06,176
Completely new element

637
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,968
What he was saying

638
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,504
Make some sort

639
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,600
Sixth Sense

640
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,368
The ad

641
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,672
Literary layers to it

642
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,952
In hindsight

643
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:23,072
He was saying is out of food

644
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:28,448
To trick my daughters into eating a human be

645
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:39,712
Alex

646
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,992
And he starts talking

647
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,528
The actual

648
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,552
Press

649
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,320
Because of this

650
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,344
Lichen

651
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,024
Why what Alex Jones said is so dangerous

652
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,048
You think I want to say

653
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:57,120
He is commanding the people in Michigan

654
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,168
Who stormed the capital they make star

655
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:04,544
You talk about satire but they're writing this as serious

656
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,104
Does not say

657
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,200
The pieces could probably be summed up

658
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,480
This paragraph from the art

659
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:21,440
The consequences from

660
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,976
Taking words literally

661
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:29,632
Millions of Americans have reason to be concerned about their economic well-being

662
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,216
And suggesting that violence might be necessary for cell survival

663
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,800
We're living in days when openly armed protesters are storming

664
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,592
So it's not

665
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,712
Further provoke towards

666
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
Spirit violin

667
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:51,136
Apps they might not see their neighbors as recently see them as adversaries in the world of accelerating scarce

668
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,232
News articles

669
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,816
Dependence is being in this together

670
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:03,680
Neighbors to feed your children is the sort of thing that's based on the opposite

671
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:08,800
Mentality on their own

672
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,568
And at worst

673
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,592
The threat to myself

674
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:17,504
The author of the article is really clear about this dangerous

675
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:21,344
Does free speech by necessity be

676
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,368
Constitutionally protected

677
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,232
Is dangerous messages of distrust and division need to be combated with

678
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,512
4

679
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,304
Solidarity and common cause

680
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,608
Alex

681
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,400
Does these publicity stunts

682
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,192
Responding

683
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:41,056
Irresponsible

684
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,872
Sources of information

685
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,664
I think the Sports Basement

686
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
Tickets in importance

687
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,224
Remember

688
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,504
That's crucial to look at

689
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,528
People around

690
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,552
Collaborators knocking

691
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,576
Competitors are food

692
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,856
Ultimately

693
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,672
Make an appointment response to Alex's ran is probably

694
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,440
Counterproductive

695
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:05,120
What's going to happen coverage of a stop in order to

696
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,144
Do the mold

697
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,936
In order to further insulate izadi

698
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
And

699
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,520
Gaslight people who are coming

700
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,568
Going to check him out based on

701
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,360
Yep

702
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,968
Talk about a modest proposal

703
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,248
I'm not sure he's ready

704
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:23,808
Proposal

705
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,392
Was Jonathan Swift

706
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,208
Irish

707
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:30,976
Cleric

708
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:39,168
And the English

709
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
Describe

710
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,336
Butcher them

711
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,872
I did

712
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,664
The most famous pizza

713
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:54,528
Proposals from 7029 not 1730

714
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,296
Small difference

715
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,952
It seems

716
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:06,560
Proposed

717
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,328
Text

718
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,096
But it does make sense

719
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,216
GPS John Birch Society book

720
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,032
I mean like he's talking about

721
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,056
Beggars

722
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,360
Institute for

723
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:23,712
Text primary

724
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,480
Concern

725
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:28,576
Modest Proposal from the academics

726
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,648
Determining if Swift himself is the speaker in the tech

727
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,184
Disconnected

728
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,232
Persona he's created for the pamphlet

729
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,768
Elizabeth Hedrick

730
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:40,352
Explores this question under piece for the journal Stetson philology

731
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,888
Fall 2017

732
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,936
This is irrelevant

733
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,776
The suggestion of

734
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,312
If it's understood

735
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,848
Swift himself is the one making

736
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
Proposal

737
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,663
There's a problem with the irony

738
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,431
Neighborhood

739
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:58,015
Is well-documented is absolutely

740
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,343
His writings and sermons have been shown to include

741
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,183
The distresses of the Irish pour on their moral failing

742
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,535
Is this is a person

743
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,583
His proposal

744
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,143
And thus be more widely accepted

745
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,959
The character speaking in the pamphlet

746
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,983
But fully detached

747
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,007
Trump

748
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:19,775
Open Swift

749
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,871
Persona

750
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,151
Consider Swift

751
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
Other writing

752
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,687
Secluded

753
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,455
In particular

754
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,503
Particular

755
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:34,111
Better understanding of exactly what the target of a modest proposal

756
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,951
I need directions

757
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:40,255
Taken in the context of his body work

758
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,815
Hedrick argues that the main thing being attacked in a modest

759
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,607
Proposal

760
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,167
Andy wig assumption

761
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,239
The good manners were innocent transparent

762
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,007
Performative

763
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,591
Goodness rather than

764
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,639
Pleasing front for malice or a gresh

765
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,295
Ethically simple-minded and politically dishonest

766
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,367
Narrator of The Proposal is perfectly polite

767
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,415
Juxtaposition would be barbaric suggest

768
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:12,255
Seen himself as the savior of the country for proposing

769
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,279
Solutions

770
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,303
The problem of poverty

771
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,863
This was the equally stupid

772
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,399
Delivered

773
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,191
People were making at

774
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:23,775
What time have you considered

775
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,823
It's pretty clear that this is the large

776
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,359
Or just part of what do you attach Rising

777
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,407
So essentially

778
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,431
He's

779
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,479
He's talking almost about

780
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,759
Like the difference

781
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,063
Between Obama and Trump bombing people

782
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,855
Obama's

783
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:44,255
Is putting a very calm and polite Cesar atrocities

784
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,143
Position

785
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
Exact

786
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,239
Veb polite

787
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,287
Is more important

788
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,567
Myself

789
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,943
Who's the head been suggested

790
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:07,295
Help with the problem of poverty

791
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:10,367
Working Solutions

792
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,159
Delivered politely

793
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,183
For the sake

794
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,975
Putting a mask on your own

795
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,935
He wrote screeds against

796
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,983
1737

797
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,079
Parishes of Dublin

798
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,871
That piece was very much

799
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,199
This description

800
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,247
Lazy to work

801
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,551
They're not afraid to steal Norris

802
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,855
To be seen with a badge

803
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,647
His many of them has confessed to me

804
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,815
Until I see better regulation

805
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:56,191
To persuade brother Walker

806
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:59,519
For if Bakery be able to beat out Pride

807
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,055
It cannot deserve charity

808
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,407
Swift did not care about the well-being of the poor

809
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,175
Sweet polite

810
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,247
Which solution to the problem

811
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,015
Propertyware

812
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:10,783
Suggestive

813
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,807
Ultimately

814
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,111
Effective bushing

815
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,903
Miraculous Solutions

816
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,207
Primary concern

817
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,815
How does this relate to Alex on his Ranch

818
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,351
Simply put it does

819
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,399
Because nothing Alex did had a point

820
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,423
He's trying to

821
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,959
To claim that he was making a modest

822
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:33,311
Proposal

823
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,359
Completely apps

824
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,639
From his actual rent

825
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:40,223
He was just talking about being willing to eat his neighbors so that his children don't

826
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:40,991
Starve

827
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,527
Is there's any word

828
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,063
Connection to people starving

829
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,135
Could possibly claim

830
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:52,255
Is it is worth or condemnation of people

831
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:55,071
Don't kill their neighbors who feed their children

832
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,143
That doesn't seem like

833
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:58,911
Kinda

834
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,679
That is a

835
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:02,239
I could read it that way

836
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,031
You couldn't

837
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,079
No I'm traffic I will

838
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,871
I think I have your welcome

839
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:13,759
Actually you can make that was a brilliant piece of satire on Alex's part I don't think I've done stink

840
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,063
People in countries

841
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,231
Indigent

842
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,559
Just be pleasing facade that his people's real cruelty would it be possible

843
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,095
How to connect

844
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,375
I still say

845
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:33,215
If you are covering the people starving the developing World in

846
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,495
Suggested we eat them

847
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,519
Connection

848
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,543
Would be really clear

849
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:41,151
Track that yelling about you your neighbors to feed your child if so how

850
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,431
Suggestion that lamp

851
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,223
The politeness of people offer

852
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,247
Suggestions on how to help

853
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,063
But don't actually care

854
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:53,695
Could reasonably be

855
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,999
Purposeful

856
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,535
And everything I can come

857
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:00,095
Fails to satisfy basic

858
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:00,863
Applications

859
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,399
Also let's not

860
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,679
Forget that

861
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:08,799
Campbell after like 14 15 days with no food all the time

862
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,639
It's something that I'm concerned with four and hunger

863
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:16,479
And his disgusting of his willingness to eat people isn't even really knew

864
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,527
Body show from December 16th

865
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,831
2019

866
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,879
If people were coming to eat him he would

867
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,191
I wouldn't go out and grab

868
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,615
I'm just being honest

869
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,895
What's a trading party

870
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:47,967
You haven't eaten

871
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,159
Self-defense

872
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,767
Use these fantasies a bit

873
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:05,631
It's a long way to go

874
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,167
You know

875
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,983
Care about people in the developing world that he never has

876
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:16,639
He supported Ron Paul for most of his career which is disqualifying when you try to protect

877
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:24,831
Seems to care now because he believes businesses easier

878
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:27,647
He thinks his trump card you can play

879
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,719
People going hungry

880
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,791
If we do get through this virus crisis and things go back to

881
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,559
Someone normal

882
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,375
Without completely forgets

883
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,703
People having food in Africa or South America

884
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:47,359
He's just a sick f*** who sits around and pretty regularly thinks about how

885
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,919
And what are you doing now is just

886
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,687
Pretend to take

887
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,967
A moral High Ground

888
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:53,503
After getting a ton of Free Press

889
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:57,599
He's trying to make his unhindered outbursts seem like it was some brilliant piece of art

890
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,135
Also fun fact

891
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,231
Proposal Swift has an imaginary America

892
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,255
Looking for his proposal

893
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,351
Knowing American

894
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,119
Things in London

895
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,935
Young healthy child well nursed

896
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:15,775
Most delicious nourishing and wholesome food Weatherspoon roasted

897
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,799
Baked or boiled

898
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:20,895
And I make a note

899
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,455
I guess this outlandish idea

900
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:27,807
Better

901
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:34,463
She probably was at that if he's ever read it if he's doing 1720

902
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:37,023
Imagine that the other implication there is that

903
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:42,399
People who live in America are all Savages along with the Native Americans

904
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,447
That's why

905
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:50,079
Z

906
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:54,943
Grade my friend

907
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:01,343
We had to read a modest proposal and do a creative thing on it

908
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,623
Sada baby it was delicious

909
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,647
Is very

910
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,183
It wasn't an actual

911
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,935
What you do in 11th grade

912
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:20,287
Alex's 46

913
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,615
This was this

914
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:29,503
Swiftian satire and all that in the media

915
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,183
Was shot

916
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:40,255
People starving in covid-19 lockdown

917
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:49,215
National file

918
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:56,639
Basically my run propaganda associate and probably

919
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,343
It's a swift reference

920
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:10,719
People starving in covid-19 lockdown

921
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,583
Quote

922
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,607
Explanation

923
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,399
Article

924
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:21,471
At least twice calls into question about word

925
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,751
We're really satire

926
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,287
Is directly in this

927
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,383
Notably Swift essay is largely about class

928
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,663
Send the poor being used as

929
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:32,223
Commodities in society with little regard for

930
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,503
And not about a viral

931
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,271
Pandemic

932
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:39,391
Jones insists that the covid-19 lockdown

933
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,159
Third world

934
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,695
And causing billions of poor people

935
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
Starbucks

936
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,511
This is not about our teeth

937
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:49,631
It's an article covering out to the temp to explain himself actually sound like

938
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,191
Alex

939
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:52,959
Music

940
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:56,799
These people get in

941
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
They're not

942
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,335
There

943
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,127
They don't buy his argument at all

944
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,687
However it is very expedient to put the

945
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,735
The headline up there that makes it look like

946
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,527
He's got a defense for himself

947
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,343
That would make the most sense to me

948
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:15,743
You said his piece about the great respite he's getting and

949
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,047
Sure he gets to just ranting about

950
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,863
Stanford ask coronavirus nonsense

951
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,471
Even harder on me

952
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:28,031
All the doctors are partying

953
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:32,639
Medical workers

954
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:35,199
Most of them are partying their asses off

955
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,479
Hospitals are empty

956
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,623
Because Lily I get $39,000 for covid patients

957
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,415
Lookout you coming down with a cold

958
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:45,695
They're going to snake

959
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,511
Kill your ass

960
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,559
Can I collect the money on your dead ass

961
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,351
What's Isis

962
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:59,775
Dangerous rhetoric

963
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:06,175
Do not go see a medical professional help

964
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,527
Understands how a medical work work

965
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,623
These hospitals

966
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,647
Even if they're getting

967
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:18,207
$39,000 for these patients

968
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,255
Do you think that's more than

969
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:25,631
Normally operating hospitals

970
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:30,495
Everybody's everybody's everybody's pretty f****** ridiculous

971
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,287
Alex

972
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,151
Defending his

973
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,455
Really actually

974
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,735
Because

975
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,015
You get some too

976
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:46,623
Begging people to write

977
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,927
Total collapse and everything

978
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,975
You're right I won't I won't eat

979
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,767
They're good

980
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:55,583
I won't go out with the lamp

981
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,399
Governor Northam

982
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:08,383
Alex Jones wants to buy aborted babies and eat them no

983
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:13,247
Text Oregon because it's real

984
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,063
Because

985
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,647
I'm the bad guy

986
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,719
For the corporate media

987
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:28,863
Continues

988
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,967
Available again

989
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,135
If you can't turn it into an ad

990
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,631
Francis Boyle on

991
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,471
It's mostly pretty standard stuff

992
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,775
I do think of this clip

993
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:08,543
Is pretty interesting

994
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:12,895
About how Alex was saying

995
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,687
The CDC admitted that there's

996
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,015
The number of death

997
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,575
Very different

998
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,879
We have to understand

999
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,815
Come to grips with that we are at war with

1000
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,631
Existentially dangerous

1001
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,703
Figures we're being given

1002
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,471
Casualties

1003
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:38,751
Completely bogus

1004
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,287
Financial

1005
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,567
Times last week

1006
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:42,847
Ran

1007
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,871
An article

1008
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,175
Casualty

1009
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,455
Get the real

1010
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,479
Figures here

1011
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,503
Are not the one

1012
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,039
Casualties

1013
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,623
Play one country by

1014
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:55,391
Country

1015
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,159
And the extra

1016
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:56,927
Casualties

1017
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,743
40 casualties

1018
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,023
So icy

1019
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,559
Probably

1020
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,607
What is happened to your the United

1021
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:05,631
Santa today

1022
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,935
We're being told it's only 6

1023
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,727
4000 people who are dead

1024
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:13,311
Casualties no one's given us

1025
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,103
My guess is

1026
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,663
Icewarp what we are being told

1027
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,735
And these officials at

1028
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,295
CDC many the

1029
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,063
Fathers

1030
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,087
Largest Dow

1031
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,135
I'm playing what we are released

1032
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:35,839
Situation with Coronavirus

1033
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,631
Actual number of

1034
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:46,079
It's worth pointing out that what you saying

1035
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,359
Claim to know

1036
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,639
For a fact earlier

1037
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,367
Opposite

1038
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,951
The factor of 2 let's not worry about how they're using the math

1039
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,767
It's twice as much it's the same basic

1040
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,839
What is referencing

1041
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:12,959
Statistics of how many more deaths have been reported in the week ending April 17th

1042
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,495
Show me articles

1043
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,287
22000

1044
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:19,359
351 registered in England

1045
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:21,919
According to the office for National statistics

1046
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:29,343
Comparable weekly data started in 1993

1047
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,367
The past 50 years

1048
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,647
The average

1049
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,695
Comparable week from 20

1050
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,743
15 to 2019 with 10,000

1051
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,023
497

1052
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:40,607
The conversation

1053
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:44,959
Is being recorded in England and Wales

1054
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:47,007
The total of 27000

1055
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,079
Average bean

1056
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,615
Between

1057
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,151
April 7th

1058
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,967
It's too premature to draw too many conclusions

1059
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:56,991
The state up but it's

1060
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,015
It's definitely notable

1061
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:00,319
Further exploration

1062
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,647
This article doesn't country-by-country

1063
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:04,671
Just about to describe

1064
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:12,351
Pineapple Times article the overall fatalities

1065
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,887
During March and April across

1066
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,655
14.

1067
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423
Foreign countries

1068
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,335
Excess deaths in these countries

1069
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:24,383
As compared to the average number of

1070
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,663
That's during that time for

1071
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:29,247
It was compared to the approximately 77,000

1072
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,551
Unreported covid-19

1073
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:32,575
Which they suggest

1074
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,111
Good memes

1075
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,135
Pretty low

1076
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:42,047
They go on to suggest that if the same pattern of under-reported

1077
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,583
18000 unreported covid

1078
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,351
19.

1079
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,887
So we're not capturing

1080
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,655
Statistics

1081
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,959
This again is something to eat

1082
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,727
Further study

1083
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:53,311
It's definitely hard to look at some of the day

1084
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:56,895
Much higher number of deaths are in various places than the normal average

1085
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:59,199
Numbers and even higher

1086
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,503
Plus the official covid-19 count

1087
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,783
And thick

1088
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,319
Something's being mister

1089
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,111
It's tough to explain

1090
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,927
Requires further explanation

1091
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:13,023
Account for the

1092
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,303
Extreme

1093
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,327
Politico

1094
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,119
Desire that people would have her

1095
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:17,887
For under report

1096
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,311
A report

1097
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,591
It does seem like

1098
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,151
China food

1099
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:32,479
Withholding information about that end

1100
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,527
To downplay the severity of the threat

1101
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,343
As though that isn't exactly

1102
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,111
Prompted

1103
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,135
At the same time

1104
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,671
Sure

1105
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,719
So the idea that these

1106
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:44,511
These two battles

1107
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:49,887
They I do these two governments are going to report things honestly

1108
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,935
Utterly you can't believe it

1109
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,471
It's simply not possible to

1110
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:57,311
Maybe it is true maybe they are reporting it but

1111
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,591
Believing it without

1112
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,615
Absolute

1113
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,151
Information seems

1114
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:04,479
Ridiculous

1115
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:14,463
Glass globe from May 3rd and it's Alex talking about

1116
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,999
What is

1117
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:16,767
The comments

1118
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:19,327
More in this one really set me off

1119
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,375
John Deere

1120
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:25,215
I don't try to get up here and say Sensational things just to say it

1121
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:28,543
Serious news

1122
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,567
Like

1123
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,639
Today's

1124
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:35,199
I said I'm not going to eat people's children during class

1125
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,223
Dominate my neighbors

1126
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,271
Then I went on to explain on diapers

1127
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,807
Dwayne Johnson

1128
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:41,087
Swift

1129
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,111
Allegory

1130
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:49,023
People that came and found

1131
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,303
Sojourn I'm sorry

1132
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:56,703
What's an advance

1133
01:00:56,959 --> 01:01:00,287
Appointment

1134
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:04,127
They were about to embark on today

1135
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,407
And completely

1136
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:08,735
Listen to the entire cannibalism

1137
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:12,063
Neighbors

1138
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,087
Instead of eating

1139
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:18,463
Also at no point did he say you was doing a Swiss

1140
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:21,535
Whatever he's pretending

1141
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:25,631
In fact multiple times

1142
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,543
So I was listening to

1143
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:36,895
And I kind of realize that if we accept

1144
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,943
It's essentially impossible to discern

1145
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:43,551
Approximately

1146
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,319
Total shift

1147
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,927
We we different standpoint

1148
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:53,023
It starts with him talking about how the Great Depression

1149
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:55,583
Sufficient

1150
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,863
Alex believes that face

1151
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,423
Statistic about 7 million people starving in the Great

1152
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,495
What is cleanliness

1153
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:10,943
Declaration

1154
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:11,711
3DS

1155
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:15,295
There's clearly nothing more to the conversation of the beginning from this

1156
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:19,391
He's cleared this is about his children not starving and whatnot

1157
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,695
I'll kill humans to survive

1158
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:26,047
It's conversation about how you

1159
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:28,607
His neighbors and wondering if he would kill and eat them

1160
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,631
And he's decided

1161
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,399
He will

1162
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:35,007
Possibly

1163
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:35,775
A r

1164
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,895
As opposed to realistic

1165
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,687
Scenarios that may come to pass

1166
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:45,759
Zerochan

1167
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,831
Interpreted as any other kind of satire

1168
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,599
There's just nothing

1169
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:52,415
Nothing going on there other than

1170
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,975
This goes on for about a minute and a half

1171
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:00,607
That's why I want you

1172
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,191
Dissection

1173
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,751
Completely abandoned his hungry children

1174
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,823
People is becoming specifically violent

1175
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:12,895
Murder fantasies

1176
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,455
Sprouts

1177
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:17,247
Because they didn't accept

1178
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,015
Christ

1179
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,551
Clearly cannibalism

1180
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,575
It's meant as a punishment

1181
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,879
The instrument of punishment

1182
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:26,719
During the section people for sustenance is

1183
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,999
Wheatley forgot

1184
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,535
He did forget that

1185
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,095
From defensive to offensive

1186
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:32,863
Very quickly

1187
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:39,519
40 seconds later is children starving

1188
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:44,383
He's eating his neighbor to feed his children and also

1189
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,151
Just punishment

1190
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,967
Says you

1191
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:50,527
Physical

1192
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,575
But it's not really

1193
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,879
To get over the gym

1194
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:59,231
So metaphysical hypothetical

1195
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:01,279
Probably just means hypothetical

1196
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:03,327
He's expressing that this is not

1197
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,095
Pathetical

1198
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,679
There was a modest proposal

1199
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,727
It sounds like satire but it's not

1200
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,567
Back brakes

1201
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:16,127
Put this in a society like

1202
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,919
David Foster Wallace

1203
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,015
Somebody the performance

1204
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,575
Considerably if he actually has some kind of attempt

1205
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:31,743
Serious as everyone kills for food

1206
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:32,511
14 most

1207
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,279
Super cannibals

1208
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,631
Something

1209
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,655
Alex's world

1210
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:42,239
He's using sources that are real to him and his audience to just

1211
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,775
Society active

1212
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:52,735
Place has kids

1213
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:58,111
The entire section has to show them they're wrong about God is supposed to be

1214
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,391
Which is not the mark of the master

1215
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,671
Craftsman

1216
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:03,487
30 seconds later Alex gets back

1217
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,767
Punishment cannibalism

1218
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,559
The spirit

1219
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,583
Hookers out there drink

1220
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,423
He said they will cut them into

1221
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,239
Before watching his daughters

1222
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:16,031
Which is weird because now

1223
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,311
These two different

1224
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,847
Context of eating people

1225
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:22,431
Are getting mingle together weather

1226
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,735
From this point

1227
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:25,759
Nothing makes sense

1228
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,295
Because it's two different

1229
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,575
Discrete ideas that are being

1230
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,343
Combine

1231
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,903
Because neighbor for survival

1232
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,999
These are not the same ideas

1233
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,023
But they're being combined

1234
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:41,375
So you think he'll barbecue your leftist ass so the kids won't start

1235
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,959
This kind of only makes sense if his neighbor is

1236
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:53,407
That's another Point as to why this isn't satire

1237
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:56,991
Explicitly says that

1238
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,783
Because you have a lot of storable food

1239
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:03,135
If This truly was something that was meant to be swiftian satire

1240
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,927
How does that element factor into it

1241
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:17,471
They don't all have storage

1242
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,495
Crisis

1243
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,031
Talking about is already

1244
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:25,407
Man in 2 years

1245
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,175
Connected

1246
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:30,015
A couple years down the road neighborhood

1247
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,295
Nothing

1248
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,135
Yeah that.

1249
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,439
To help out people

1250
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,279
Oh thank God

1251
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:46,655
Understand them it's just like Bruce Lee Angie

1252
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,679
Do you have

1253
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:50,495
To attack while defending and defend well attack

1254
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:54,847
That's the trick you're saving your daughter's life and you're punishing the global Assault

1255
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,127
The same time

1256
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:08,927
He realizes in the middle of his violent rant he smells storable food

1257
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,207
So he needs a caveat

1258
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:13,279
Call from my Patriot Supply

1259
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:16,095
Disaster nutritional plan

1260
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:17,887
What is a page field for them

1261
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,679
You can kind of tell

1262
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,703
What's going on

1263
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,055
Closest to being what

1264
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,127
Eastside

1265
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:34,271
Before I leave I'm starving Africans

1266
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,295
Before doing

1267
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,319
Commercial Bank

1268
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:39,135
Performance artist

1269
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,743
Taken in the context of the show

1270
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,023
Is MattyB a signifier that

1271
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,047
He's not perform

1272
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:46,815
Sardis

1273
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:51,935
It began custody hearing a few years

1274
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,959
Determined

1275
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,495
Because

1276
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,287
Alex got mad about that

1277
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,311
And since then

1278
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,591
You got really defensive

1279
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,127
Some people say he's a performance artist

1280
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:02,431
So when he goes to break saying something like that

1281
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,551
Regular listeners know exactly what

1282
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:13,951
About starving people in the developing World in Africa

1283
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,863
Unrelated

1284
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,399
Subway

1285
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,263
Also what is living off starving Africans

1286
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:31,871
Be interesting to hear that concept

1287
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:35,455
Wrestle with

1288
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,527
Fiscal arguments

1289
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,831
Italo's nutritional assistance program

1290
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:45,183
This a little bit more

1291
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:51,839
People from developing nations he just wants them to starve on their own two feet

1292
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:54,911
Cannibalism is really all about

1293
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:04,383
I just realized when I listen to it as well

1294
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,015
The speech

1295
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:15,903
Is it really important

1296
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,975
Pamphlet arguing

1297
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:22,303
Politely that people should eat for children

1298
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:29,215
No

1299
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:33,567
Is intensely difficult because it requires a Precision that most people aren't

1300
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,335
Capable of

1301
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:37,151
And you can definitely count Alex

1302
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,711
Serious

1303
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:44,063
Set the right-wing even knows the word satire because they are incapable of it

1304
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:44,831
And yet they

1305
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:47,391
I keep trying to use it as they know it is

1306
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,159
Memes

1307
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,439
You guys don't have any

1308
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,463
F****** clue

1309
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,487
Satire is

1310
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:57,887
It's fascinating

1311
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:01,471
Bodies thing that you are incapable of understanding

1312
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,263
In theory

1313
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:07,103
If I wrote

1314
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,127
Alex's ribs

1315
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:11,199
As a satire of what

1316
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,479
That would make sense

1317
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:18,879
Because I would try to

1318
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:21,439
Probably

1319
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,975
I really do

1320
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,279
Sit with us for a long time

1321
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,559
Really trying to

1322
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,583
Figure out a way to

1323
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:32,703
Jason punch-up I really

1324
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:33,983
Come up with

1325
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,287
Coherent

1326
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,567
That you Bridges

1327
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,871
The Gap what he's trying to say

1328
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:46,015
He's trying to say something

1329
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,295
As aspect

1330
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:56,255
He's talking about

1331
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:01,631
He's trying to say that it's really just

1332
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,519
Disingenuous opportunist

1333
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:09,823
Satire

1334
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,359
The 4th

1335
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,639
Monday comes around

1336
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:20,831
For however you crazy

1337
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,623
It really bad

1338
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:25,951
We start in familiar territory

1339
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,231
Now let me get into this

1340
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,511
Do this right now

1341
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,583
Controversy

1342
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,887
When I came out last Tuesday and I

1343
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,191
Was going on with a fat tire

1344
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,311
Irish children

1345
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,847
Because the Irish were subhuman

1346
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:48,991
Taking care of the Irish it was overtaxing another regulating they were starving to death

1347
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,271
She said

1348
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,319
How about we just start

1349
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:58,463
Publish it like it was serious and it's the most famous in the world

1350
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:06,399
30 + million starving to death right now 135 million

1351
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:15,615
Then I shovel time once all the food runs out I'll just eat my liberal Neighbors

1352
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,663
Pick it up

1353
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,711
But they edited one minute

1354
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,759
Attention to

1355
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:24,319
Starvation

1356
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,903
That's a catchphrase that Alex is trying

1357
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,183
Episode

1358
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:29,951
Pretty Clear Lake

1359
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:37,375
Gyros

1360
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:40,191
Proposals give badges

1361
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:46,591
Is specifically control regulations as he was asking for the mark of the beast

1362
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:48,639
Toradol

1363
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,919
Proposal

1364
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:57,599
As part of our public miseries

1365
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:00,671
Tina

1366
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:03,231
In 20 of those starving condition

1367
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:08,095
Call the work of God either

1368
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:10,143
But merely from their Oneida list

1369
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,751
Yes. Cheating

1370
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,543
Distain

1371
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:20,639
For the poor

1372
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,431
There's a really good book auntie Tracy

1373
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,735
Violence and fancy suits

1374
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:28,831
And one of the one of my favorite lines is when the main character just says

1375
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:31,647
The rich always think they can starve

1376
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,927
To the behavior

1377
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:33,695
They want

1378
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,231
And it's just such that

1379
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,511
That kind of s***

1380
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:37,791
If we just

1381
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,839
F*** them over enough still do what

1382
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:42,655
We say it

1383
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,679
For whatever

1384
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:48,799
Lakers

1385
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:55,199
Recalls evil infestation suggest

1386
01:13:55,455 --> 01:14:00,831
British Aristocrat and 1729 or no 1737 or whatever

1387
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:06,719
That was 70-37 from here

1388
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:18,239
Silverline Toronto

1389
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:21,823
Understand the underlying satire

1390
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,663
Presentation

1391
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:26,943
This is all just a

1392
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,759
Pathetic Act of gaslighting

1393
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:31,295
You can't keep the story alive

1394
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,855
You saw good returns from it so you just begging

1395
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:36,159
People to keep giving him that attention that he needs

1396
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,695
Yep

1397
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,999
Defensive about it

1398
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:40,767
His attempt

1399
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:43,071
To use this in some way

1400
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,095
2

1401
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:47,423
The developing world

1402
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,959
The prop for his own purposes

1403
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:49,983
He's cheaper

1404
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:50,751
That

1405
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,031
By virtue of

1406
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,823
The way he's incorporating it is

1407
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:56,127
Is pretend motivation behind

1408
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:59,455
So very sensitive really when you get down to it

1409
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:01,247
Before

1410
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:06,879
Comes out and says we need to reopen the economy in order to help other countries I would give it a week

1411
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,439
It's the way you make that

1412
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:13,279
Cuz I really care but

1413
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:15,071
Keys on the hook for like an hour

1414
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,607
And he's kind of

1415
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:19,167
You started making that same sort of

1416
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,191
Yes we are

1417
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:20,959
Spine

1418
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:22,495
With distancing in clothes

1419
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,263
Businesses

1420
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,031
Because

1421
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:26,335
We don't want to hurt other people

1422
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:30,175
We're not scared we don't want to hurt other people

1423
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:32,479
Make the argument

1424
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,271
And getting sick

1425
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,039
Is

1426
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:38,111
For everyone

1427
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,135
He kind of has that

1428
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:39,903
$0.30

1429
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,951
Because it's really

1430
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,487
Boring and I don't really like

1431
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:44,511
Alan Keyes

1432
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,815
There's a sense of

1433
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:47,839
Throughout

1434
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,887
Interview

1435
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,911
The first

1436
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,215
There's very much

1437
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,519
We got to get back

1438
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,823
Got to go back to work

1439
01:15:59,103 --> 01:15:59,615
I think

1440
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,687
Expressed is a real desire for this

1441
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:03,455
To be over

1442
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:04,735
And I think there is a

1443
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:05,503
This feeling

1444
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:08,831
That Alex and his gaster presenting

1445
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,623
They seem to think

1446
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,279
I don't know who those people are

1447
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,071
Everybody

1448
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,351
Wants this

1449
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,119
2

1450
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:24,959
Feel like this is

1451
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,495
Basically like a bad

1452
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,591
Acid when I was younger

1453
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:33,407
Play some people have

1454
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,431
What is pretty bad

1455
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,735
Things that allowed

1456
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,015
To not be so bad

1457
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:41,343
And I talked to other people who done far more psychedelics and I have

1458
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:44,671
Rings true with a number people I've spoken to

1459
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:45,439
Is that

1460
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,231
I recognize

1461
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,767
But I taking a drug

1462
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:49,791
And I accept

1463
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:53,119
The terrible things that I was

1464
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:56,191
And that this is going to end

1465
01:16:56,959 --> 01:17:00,543
Do you get into more trouble in situations like that

1466
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:02,079
If you feel the need to

1467
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,407
Argue and try and site

1468
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:07,199
The ghosts that are

1469
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:11,551
So what's going on is I think

1470
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:13,599
You see these differ

1471
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:15,903
Reactions to what is essentially

1472
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,719
Inconvenience

1473
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:22,047
Is an overwhelming inconvenience

1474
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,327
Control

1475
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,351
That's right out

1476
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,375
It will

1477
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,655
You can make it worse

1478
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,447
Maybe

1479
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:30,495
I don't know I don't know

1480
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:32,287
Pharmacology

1481
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:35,871
The same thing with the circumstances we find ourselves in

1482
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,151
Everybody is having

1483
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,687
Metaphorical

1484
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:41,247
And you can either choose

1485
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,015
2

1486
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:45,343
This is

1487
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,879
Just something

1488
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:47,903
Is there is it

1489
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:50,207
Through this

1490
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:51,743
B

1491
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,023
If you

1492
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:54,815
The people who are fighting against

1493
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,095
All of this like Alex

1494
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,631
Existing we need to go back to

1495
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,423
Work prematurely and all this

1496
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:06,335
People who are fighting at are going to make are all worse

1497
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:07,871
Inconvenience

1498
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,503
B

1499
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:14,527
Their problems

1500
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,087
Are being sought

1501
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,623
By actions people like our

1502
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,927
Just thought that I had

1503
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,487
I couldn't shake it

1504
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:27,071
I think we're in a situation where we have

1505
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,095
To recognize that

1506
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:30,655
Height has nothing to do with whether or not you're an

1507
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:35,263
We continue to treat these people as though they're adult

1508
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,543
And they are not

1509
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,591
We we do not want

1510
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:42,431
You don't want to argue with these people you would do they need a daycare

1511
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:45,759
They need somebody who knows how to

1512
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:46,527
Deal with children

1513
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:51,135
Because I also need to eliminate Financial incentives

1514
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,671
I mean it's it's just so

1515
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:55,743
So take this

1516
01:18:56,255 --> 01:19:01,119
Necessary for it to be over

1517
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,143
King ants

1518
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:09,311
I got some magical thinking that we're dealing with

1519
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:10,591
It's just like

1520
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:12,895
If we say it's over that it will be over

1521
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:17,503
Recognize that

1522
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:23,135
Cooperates and goes along with things measures that we've been

1523
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:27,231
That there's a good chance

1524
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:29,535
That eventually we will get through this

1525
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,839
The doctors will make some break

1526
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:35,167
A cruise that are able to maybe it is a vaccine

1527
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:38,495
And that is a nightmare for them

1528
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,519
Because

1529
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,823
The possibility that doctors

1530
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:45,151
The evil people in there

1531
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:47,711
End up being able to

1532
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,783
Return to more of a normal State of Affairs

1533
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,575
Totally against

1534
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:54,879
Everything

1535
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,159
So I think there's

1536
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,743
Hoping to Sabbath

1537
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:01,791
Yeah if the government

1538
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:05,119
Is the solution than that the reputation of everything they've ever believe

1539
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:07,167
Sprite

1540
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,495
Even if it's the worst government in history

1541
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,543
Even if it's a government

1542
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,848
Is the reason that we get through that job

1543
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,896
And everything that I ever believed about

1544
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:17,664
F******

1545
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:20,992
Whatever

1546
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:25,088
Yep and they would rather die

1547
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:30,720
Exactly the case

1548
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,768
Noticed

1549
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:36,096
Because I thought it was maybe a little bit ghost

1550
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:41,472
Abet on-air and

1551
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:43,008
Alex

1552
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,800
And it's interesting

1553
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,080
His interpretation

1554
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:46,848
This is

1555
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,664
Covid-19

1556
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,016
When I'm in this new studio

1557
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,112
Because

1558
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:01,440
Watching the show last night Sunday shows you like

1559
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:07,328
When I come in here baby

1560
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,632
But it just makes my

1561
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,704
Bixby coffee

1562
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:15,520
Condition

1563
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:16,800
For lookup

1564
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,080
Something something going on

1565
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:22,688
Is trying to put in place

1566
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,968
Possible

1567
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:27,296
In case he ends up getting covid-19

1568
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:33,184
Because certainly

1569
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,232
Pics of it

1570
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:38,048
Open everything up rallies and then

1571
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,120
Ends up getting sick

1572
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:41,888
No no

1573
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,680
Put something in the air

1574
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,728
Or whatever

1575
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,360
Cuz he brought it up

1576
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:55,456
And from my understanding

1577
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,248
That feels to me like

1578
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,016
Preemptive

1579
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:00,064
Just in case

1580
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:08,768
Astorian place in KC

1581
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:11,072
Maybe they should call it mole

1582
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:19,264
Okay go on are sure he's hospitalized for a few days

1583
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:24,896
So he gets to talkin about

1584
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:30,528
To get surgery about it but he can't because I need be off air

1585
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,320
Couldn't talk for a few days

1586
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:36,416
There's not a plug there's a plug

1587
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,792
121 Clinton

1588
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:51,776
Website last night

1589
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:52,544
How much you got

1590
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,104
I guarantee you got to get that check

1591
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,408
Do you have protein

1592
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,736
No I have not had a checkup since I was

1593
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:01,504
42

1594
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:05,088
And I definitely got a lot of

1595
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,696
Very very cheap

1596
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:13,280
This is my voice and it does need a good rest

1597
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,304
Some point

1598
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:17,376
But I told him I do apologize

1599
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:19,680
4

1600
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:23,008
Able to talk

1601
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:27,104
I had two polyps removed and then my voice would be a lot better

1602
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:28,896
But I do think I do a check

1603
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:31,456
Got the guys eat is going from Hobby birthday

1604
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:33,248
Weather tone

1605
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:35,808
The Shining like rocks being put into a blender

1606
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:38,368
Tramadol

1607
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,928
Lot of folks like my voice I

1608
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:41,952
Proceed

1609
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,776
Exacerbated

1610
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,592
With whatever is in this room

1611
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:08,576
Palate cleanser while I'm here

1612
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:09,600
This

1613
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:15,488
Just a plug for his lungs

1614
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:20,096
Cleanse

1615
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:28,800
Nobody's probably worried that they'll call it covid-19 and kill it for Sunday

1616
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:30,336
Infowars website

1617
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:32,640
That's wolf

1618
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:34,944
Yeah probably I don't want to go to that hospital

1619
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,016
What is an interview

1620
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,552
Monkeys

1621
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,832
Important

1622
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:43,136
Also the second hour of the show

1623
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:45,440
Is almost entirely and it's

1624
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:49,280
Tower of David Icke being interviewed on that London real show

1625
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:52,352
They did their third interview series or whatever

1626
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:54,144
Stupid

1627
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:11,296
Simultaneously which is literally

1628
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:25,632
Those dudes got to get those clicks doesn't matter

1629
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:28,448
Expressing

1630
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,216
Enough

1631
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:31,520
Prophet

1632
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:36,896
Again this is an interviewer is arguing that there actually is norovirus

1633
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:37,920
Which is an absolute

1634
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,224
Everything

1635
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,504
Claiming to know just

1636
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:45,856
Promoted

1637
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:48,160
Issue with the things David

1638
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,440
Deconstructing how

1639
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,208
He's wrong

1640
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:55,584
If you're listening to Alex's show

1641
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:03,008
The virus is completely made up

1642
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,824
Alex tries to get around this glaring problem

1643
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,104
Stuff like this

1644
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,664
Ninety-nine percent of what he saying

1645
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:12,992
Other than just any virus at all know they

1646
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,552
Viruses

1647
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:29,632
Opinion

1648
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:35,008
Exclaims that all the things he's covered about the coronavirus are proven

1649
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:37,568
Position should be that Ike is

1650
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:38,336
Raw

1651
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:44,224
Tony Show recently

1652
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,248
About this

1653
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:47,040
Concepta

1654
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:48,320
About the virus

1655
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:49,856
That hasn't happened

1656
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,648
Another good reason as to why

1657
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,184
Alex isn't concerned with

1658
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:58,048
Because if he was

1659
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:01,632
Either convince Dyke

1660
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:03,168
It would.

1661
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,472
To convince

1662
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:06,240
Which weather

1663
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:17,504
Really

1664
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:19,552
Neither of these outcomes are good for business

1665
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,304
His position in the market

1666
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,840
It's because he's staked

1667
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:34,400
Demonstrable

1668
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,568
Conversely if Alex

1669
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:42,848
To convince

1670
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:48,224
Delusional

1671
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:50,784
Alex can't Co-op the attention David Icke

1672
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,832
Is getting for making these insane claim

1673
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:02,560
Each of these possibilities

1674
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:12,032
Whether or not there is a virus should be a foundational primary disagreement between them

1675
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:12,800
Wichita

1676
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:14,848
To be resolved before you can get into anything

1677
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:18,176
Coronavirus

1678
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:20,224
Conspiracy Alex

1679
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,760
Immediately

1680
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,696
It's not disagreement

1681
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:32,000
It should be things that Alex knows

1682
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:33,024
David Icke is wrong

1683
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:35,840
If you cared at all that convey information

1684
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:38,656
He would have corrected like about this when he was on the show

1685
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:40,960
That blows up again

1686
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:41,984
Punt

1687
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:44,288
And gives lip service to disagree about that

1688
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:47,104
Phrases

1689
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,384
All the negative attention

1690
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,152
Disabled

1691
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:49,920
Getting right now

1692
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,480
Call Max

1693
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,760
Somebody's are outcomes

1694
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:58,112
And not do anything that ruins one of our ability

1695
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:58,880
The grit

1696
01:28:59,136 --> 01:28:59,904
Yep

1697
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:00,672
Steve

1698
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:04,256
Ultimate side effect of that is also

1699
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:07,840
Beneficial to them witches destroying

1700
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:09,376
Any trust in anything

1701
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:11,424
Islam even the p

1702
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,192
People you trust

1703
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:13,216
Have

1704
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:15,520
A completely fundamental disagreement

1705
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:17,056
Did nothing matter

1706
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:20,128
Lee conference

1707
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:23,456
Francis Boyle on the show on Sunday

1708
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:30,880
Report on Monday Alex

1709
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:36,000
Has David virus

1710
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:37,536
I disagree with that little

1711
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,800
It's just the shows dumb

1712
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:55,200
The level of Groundhog Day

1713
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:57,504
It happened yesterday has any effect on today

1714
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,528
There's no narrative

1715
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:02,880
Consistent something every single day there's a new thing that is like

1716
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:04,160
That's probably not

1717
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:17,472
Because Trump is president

1718
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,824
And so it is

1719
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,104
It can impact

1720
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,128
Morbid

1721
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:26,176
Yeah I think it's

1722
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,712
Stop and

1723
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,600
Disappointed

1724
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:36,416
An hour of David Icke an hour of Alan Keyes

1725
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:37,696
That's like nothing

1726
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:39,488
For me I don't I don't care at all

1727
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,352
It seems like he's

1728
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,120
Really trying

1729
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:47,168
To keep the cannibalism story alive

1730
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,192
Because

1731
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:49,472
It's his best play

1732
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:56,128
It's not the only reason

1733
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:59,712
Isn't doing anything

1734
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,760
It's because everybody saw that Clipper more like

1735
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:02,528
That is a

1736
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:05,856
Genuine moment of a man saying that he's going to eat

1737
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,392
And so everything

1738
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:10,976
Manufacturer

1739
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:24,544
Assuage

1740
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,592
Watch

1741
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:31,968
Else you can do like I keep saying as whatever he does stuff like this like I don't know what the

1742
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:32,992
Outburst

1743
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:36,064
Yes

1744
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:37,856
Public's attention

1745
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:41,184
Is now at the level of our neighbors

1746
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,976
If you said something like

1747
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:44,512
I'll beat up a stranger

1748
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:47,072
Nothing I just got to buy a rocket

1749
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:51,424
Something like that something big something stupid

1750
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,192
Flash

1751
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,728
Because you can't

1752
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,264
I know he bought a tank but that was

1753
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:06,784
I don't know the strategy for attention is moving forward

1754
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,320
Actually eat his neighbor

1755
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:12,672
Maybe try and settle the Sandy Hook lawsuit

1756
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:14,464
Actually eating your neighbor at this

1757
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,512
Rightmove

1758
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:18,560
Decided

1759
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:19,584
Represent himself

1760
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,888
In the Sandy Hook case

1761
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,656
To do

1762
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:23,424
God

1763
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,752
Disaster

1764
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:28,800
Absolutely

1765
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:29,568
I guess

1766
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:33,408
Next episode from firework

1767
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,432
Because

1768
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:37,248
Point that Monday's episode

1769
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:41,600
At least the news has broken that Norm had left

1770
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,136
So the

1771
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:44,672
Some of that stuff

1772
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,696
Precinct 4

1773
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:48,256
Frustration towards the middle of the

1774
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,024
This week

1775
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,816
Probably going to end up seeing

1776
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:51,840
Some Mass

1777
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:52,864
So I'm

1778
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,632
Sticking around

1779
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,264
Cannibalism

1780
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,032
Cuz I am

1781
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:02,592
Brings it up again

1782
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:05,152
I'm not going to discuss it I said

1783
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:08,224
And I'm sorry if anybody

1784
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:09,760
Is is

1785
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:12,832
You've said everything that needed to be said in a little bit more

1786
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:13,856
For good measure

1787
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:30,496
We are also on Facebook

1788
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:35,872
That would be very

1789
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:42,016
Until then

1790
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:44,320
Nope

1791
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:47,136
Trying to make a pond of Taylor Jonathan Swift

1792
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:49,184
Jonathan Taylor Thomas

1793
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:49,952
I can't do it

1794
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,232
Hey why what

1795
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,864
Alex

1796
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,680
First-time caller message saying I love your work
