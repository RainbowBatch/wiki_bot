00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,824

22
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,272
But that Kevin

23
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
Kevin the bird

24
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,856
Expand this even to literature

25
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,952
Including literature

26
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,536

Tell my dad feels about the minions

38
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,976
What's your bright spot

39
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,000
I bought a knife

40
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,376
So we were it's a kitchell bread magnetic kitchen knife

41
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,936
We had lunch one day and I was walking back

42
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:52,032
And there was this little boutique store that had a

43
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
I like cookie

44
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,616
A cooking tray and it would have the oven

45
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:00,224
These things right about so I went in to take a look at it and

46
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,272
Immediately realized I didn't want it

47
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:09,440
The only the guy who ran the store in there until he came over immediately and I felt this pressure that I could

48
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:14,048
Not leave without I bought this

49
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
Japanese

50
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352
Nice

51
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
Begin to

52
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
It is

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,544
So sharp so sharp I told you that I chopped of chunk of my finger off you can see that's not as big as I thought

54
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,664
Giant Band-Aid on your hand that made me think that you might have lost

55
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:35,808
Oh I'm sure it bled everywhere that's why I had to have the check bandaid otherwise they would have

56
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,880
It would have melted was either that or like supermax tampon

57
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:43,488
Monster level we were talking about impression of what it was based on

58
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,768
How you described it as like

59
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,096
I don't know maybe part of the mail it's gone

60
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,936
Yeah yeah it's good that it's not

61
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
Is it that is

62
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,264
It's sharks not thumb shape altering

63
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,176
So smooth

64
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
Some stuff in it

65
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480
It's just like you know you should do

66
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:11,136
Chopping broccoli okay

67
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,952
Oh man that's great

Homophobic

73
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:31,615

00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:41,855
It's very weird to hate Harry Potter and the lgbtq community at the same

76
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,415
Time right you have to like you know

77

Alright

00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,631
Yes sir we are here in the past

94
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
How do you feel being

95
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
I feel like

96
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,263
Maybe it's actually Shaggy 2 Dope

97
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
Who gave us like

98
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,079
In a $0.50 or whatever

99
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,615
And it's very funny.

100
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,407
What if it's the real

101
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,063
I hope it is I hope so too have some respect for the Juggalos

102
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,879
How to get a hatchet man tattoo but enough

103
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,951
Think very seriously back onto the Gathering

104
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:28,351
Oh yeah we'll be there

105
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,983
I don't I don't like how long how much

106
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,055
More homophobic

107
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,847
Especially during this

108
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,175
Little.

109
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,223
Consistently right in your face

110
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,527
Throughout some of this 2003. Like

111
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
Jejune

112
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,391
I don't know what's going on now he's just in a mood

113
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
It doesn't get

114
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,743
Quite as much blood libel as the gays are stealing your

115
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,303
You know like that's pretty intense

116
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:04,191
Well they're stealing them to raise them as their own not to because it was so little

117
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
I guess

118
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,287
Contacts dropped from Today Show

119
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,391
You have a great day

120
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:29,535
It doesn't get much more obvious how serious your show is

121
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,399
I love the juxtaposition of that

122
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
That is

123
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:39,775
That is so beautiful

124
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,359
Just cuz it's Hades doesn't mean we can't be polite

125
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
Yeah okay

126
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:48,735
Steptoe Alex is concerned at the beginning of this July 2nd episode

127
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,783
Tom Ridge

128
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
Homeland Security secretary

129
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,647
And makes a little bit of a prediction of what

130
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
The command

131
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,511
Don't know but I don't think that Alex's predict

132
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,543
I have a job

133
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
Credit

134
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
A fuse

135
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,007
So we

136
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,615
It is so over-the-top

137
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,735
So yeah we don't have four layers of security clearance to have jobs smells

138
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
.

139
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
Curfews

140
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,135
True I guess they're all have been sort of circumstantial curfews

141
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,439
Like when there were protests

142
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,255
There are curfews enacted in

143
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
Furts

144
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,839
Beginning of covid-19 resurging

145
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:12,703
There was a business is closed earlier I mean coupon

146
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,031
Place that I worked at I had a key fob to get in

147
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
That's a level of security clearance

148
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,919
That's not what he's talking about

149
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:27,551
This is one of the predictions that Alex is conveniently forgets that he was pushing

150
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
He's right about everything

151
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,927
Of the things that he remembers like this represents a hundred

152
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:39,327
100% accurate is also pretty good at is faking being emotional and he doesn't bit of

153
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,631
At the beginning of this

154
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,911
This show it's just

155
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
Tacky

156
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
Medical training

157
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
Feel great day

158
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,831
Did he just have a

159
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:10,975
Fake rage has specially with me.

160
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,607
Meant to say very false

161
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,983
You get that get that sense of like this is where the real opposition to

162
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,311
Yeah I'll be like George W bush comes from he thinks that they are liberals

163
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:31,967
Secret liberals not above the tube to the right of it

164
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,319
Yes everything else is to destroy Conservative Christian

165
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:42,719
Because I'm above the two parts of the left-right Paradigm as much as I am the broken if I going

166
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:47,071
Proven horseshoe Theory by the way

167
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
Cool

168
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,911
Glad lot of people fell for that

169
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,727
So Alex has a new story that he is

170
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,311
Drastically misreporting on this episode

171
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,607
Hello crime rate because their whole population is armed

172
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
And the government

173
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,495
Linda people in many cases even when they do

174
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,943
Ianthe I want Street Journal has document

175
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
This is weird

176
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,759
Point of order

177
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,831
I'm looking for point of you cannot

178
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,903
Both have an entirely armed population

179
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,487
And still tell me that the government is just murdering them

180
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:53,375
Yeah that seems like it should be the thing that protects people

181
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:59,775
And if it were true which is not

182
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,335
Then you have to

183
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,639
Call into question

184
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:11,039
Is that leading to a higher rate of suicide you would have to ask a lot of questions that

185
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,343
She is specifically glossing over

186
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,391
But I mean

187
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Bring the story

188
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,207
From the coverage that you're hearing here

189
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,023
You would think of the news story that he's talking about this

190
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
Half of the deaths

191
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:28,191
Switzerland of the result of suicide assisted suicide which people may or may not want

192
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,215
Sure

193
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,751
R-Truth

194
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,775
Statistic

195
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,311
Huge but it's not okay

196
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,127
The reality of the story is that there was a university of Zurich

197
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,711
Study that was conducted on Swiss attitudes towards euthanasia

198
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,271
The report reflected that there was a white

199
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:46,879
Spread permissive stance in the country that the practice has early

200
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,927
As long as it's done within altruistic

201
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
Motive

202
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:55,583
Also a February 2003 article in the British Journal of British medical journal found these numbers

203
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:00,703
According to the president of one of the Swiss right-to-die societies

204
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
Around 8

205
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,543
1800 request for assisted suicide are made each year

206
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,103
Two-thirds are rejected after screening

207
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:12,479
Half of the remaining people die of other causes leaving about 300 suicide assisted

208
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,783
Society's annual

209
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,087
This constitutes around

210
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,671
For 5% of the deaths in Switzerland

211
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
So

212
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,839
2003 survey written up in the Lancet sought to find some data on these cysts

213
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
Suicide rates

214
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,703
In the countries of Belgium Denmark Italy the Netherlands Sweden and Switzerland

215
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,823
This found a 1% or less rates in Denmark Italy Sweden and Switzerland

216
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,639
The data from Belgium and the Netherlands

217
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:45,247
The little more complicated and it's not really relevant to our discussion here so I'm not even going to get into it

218
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
Anyway

219
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:52,671
The point here is that multiple studies at come out around this time that

220
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,719
Does datura side in Switzerland it under one

221
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,279
Percent less than half a percent

222
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,351
So where's Alex getting that number from you

223
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,959
Possibility you were responding to

224
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
I think

225
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:10,591
It's also possible that he just didn't read the article that he's covering and he's just skimmed this part

226
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
The study examined

227
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,431
3350 deaths

228
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:19,039
In German speak in Switzerland and found that half of them involve some form of euthanasia

229
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,111
Half of this

230
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
That these deaths

231
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
German

232
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,511
If you were just outside german-speaking Switzerland

233
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,815
If you just read that

234
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,863
You might get an idea of it but

235
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:37,727
This was specifically a subset of terminally ill patients in German speak in Switzerland

236
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
The study was considering

237
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,847
So it's naturally population we expect expect the rate to be higher and it isn't

238
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,871
Indicative of all the

239
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
All the deaths in sweat

240
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:51,039
Who does outlandishly sloppy work on Alex's part and serves as yet another example of why people who listen to him

241
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:56,671
I think they're getting any kind of real information or the things that they're saying is it's based on an ounce of study

242
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
You're all being

243
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,743
If you believe these things out

244
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
What is getting into

245
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,791
Your

246
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Beautiful

247
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,583
Yeah I mean

248
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
Come on man

249
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:11,263
Harold and Maude came out 30 years before this movie this this s*** right here we should all be fine with somebody with

250
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,055
Terminal illness just going

251
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
F*** off

252
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
I think

253
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,919
I think it's a tough issue for some especially like

254
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
Make a discussion of it

255
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,503
I don't

256
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,039
No why you would

257
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
Let someone

258
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:29,183
Who's terminally ill not before 7 p.m. pain

259
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
God says

260
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,511
So for another eight months a tough

261
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
It's a tough

262
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,095
Line for me to think make sense

263
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,631
I'm so Alex gets

264
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,935
Some calls oh my God what

265
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,959
More homophobia

266
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,799
Hey I wanted to give you more bad news about Walmart

267
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
Have you heard

268
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,127
The story that came out today on Walmart

269
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,687
About the gay right

270
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,759
Yeah I just thought it was very in

271
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,831
Interesting in that they were they were saying here are there at there's

272
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
Moto Williams

273
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,255
The times are the most important factor with

274
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
For the letter

275
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,607
Several gay employees apparently there was a

276
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
What's the name of this

277
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,703
Let's see here

278
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,031
The Pride Foundation a Seattle gay rights organization

279
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
They invest

280
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
City Walmart

281
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,847
Policy change

282
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,175
And they were saying here that

283
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
Basically that

284
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:28,831
Williams was saying we want all of our Associates feel they are valued and treated with respect

285
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
Yes custom

286
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
At their job

287
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,863
Well I'm going to I'm going to tell you something I used to work for Walmart

288
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
Okay

289
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
From Walmart

290
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
Are you ready for the reason that I was fired

291
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,519
From Walmart

292
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,615
Because a customer said that she didn't like the way I looked at her

293
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:58,271
I'm absolutely certain that's not with that guy got fired.

294
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:04,671
If a man says it's cuz a woman didn't like the way I looked at her

295
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:09,279
Is going to be a more detailed guess what according to Alex on this guy's

296
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:14,143
Resume political beliefs he should have no problem with the company firing him for any reason

297
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,983
Employment is an aggressively voluntary agreement for Alex and his audience

298
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,311
Freedom of Association and all that you shouldn't be complaining

299
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:28,223
This is a story about Walmart releasing a statement that they would expand their nondiscrimination rules to include gay and lesbian

300
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Employees

301
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:33,087
This was hot on the heels of the Supreme Court decision Lawrence versus Texas

302
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,391
Criminal sodomy laws

303
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671
He's on Constitution

304
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,743
Don't believe that that's where things were in 2003

305
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,583
Walmart still was very clear that they weren't going to extend benefit

306
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,423
It's to same-sex couples but this decision that they made was still pretty impact

307
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:54,335
Now if you were fired because you were gay or your bully by co-workers for your sexual orientation

308
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
Recourse

309
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:59,199
New York Times article about this is remarkable as a poinsettia

310
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,783
This made it so nine of the 10 largest Fortune 500 companies

311
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,855
Had implemented rules against sexual orientation

312
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
Discrimination

313
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,695
The only one that didn't was ExxonMobil

314
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:15,071
And even more remarkable after Exxon acquired Mobile in 1999 they quote

315
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:19,679
Revoked mobile policy that provided medical benefits to Partners of gay employees

316
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:25,055
As well as a policy that included sexual orientation as a category of prohibited discrimination

317
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,103
The actor who's got rid of

318
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
ExxonMobil

319
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,943
We're actually evil

320
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:36,831
I've never seen this real strong homophobia on Alex's part here in 2003 which is

321
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
Troubling

322
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,671
It's gross

323
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,695
So gross

324
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,255
It's gross

325
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,791
Will you bring you f******

326
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,095
You did this all happened

327
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,887
20 years ago

328
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,703
And now it's just being

329
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,519
Like transposon to trans people

330
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
Sure it's just

331
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:03,455
It's the same s*** I think you're absolutely right that a lot of that attention is going there just being real

332
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,783
Package in that direction

333
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,319
Some of it is just

334
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,343
Playing the exact

335
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,623
Same song over and over again

336
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,975
Like for instance we recently had a bunch of people trying to do

337
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,255
Straight right

338
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,583
Parade

339
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,375
Hooray

340
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:26,239
Yeah I just think it's quite interesting though that they're going to give give all these extra rights

341
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:30,591
But what about the heterosexual heterosexual right

342
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
The manual

343
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:54,911
It's just to put in a plug just to put in a plug for the competition on their target or somewhere else

344
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:58,751
I do know what you're saying

345
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,567
Hey Dan.

346
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,591
Please take a s*** head

347
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,175
I can't handle when they say things like what about straight rights

348
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:10,015
Complain the gay people are getting extra rights when anti-discrimination rules

349
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
Are put in place

350
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,575
They're so privileged

351
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:18,976
The disconnected from the actual reality of Oppression that they don't even realize that any discrimination laws that protect gave

352
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,512
People predict straight people

353
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,096
If a company doesn't hire you because you're gay

354
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,144
Violated anti-discrimination laws

355
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,544
And if they specifically don't hire you because you're straight they violated the exact same anti-discrimination law

356
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,944
These rules are often looked at as being extra rights for gay or lesbian employees but it's a broader idea of non-discrimination

357
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,992
Nation applied equally for all

358
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:47,648
Books like this call or just don't understand or care about that because he's a giant homophobe because the very idea of people

359
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,952
Not getting a job or being harassed by co-workers

360
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,256
For being straight is unimaginable to him

361
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,560
It so it's not even a reality in his world

362
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
Yeah I mean it's

363
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,120
It's so simple

364
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:01,216
To be like okay let's look at this anti-discrimination policy

365
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,776
Does it protect me as well

366
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,568
So it protects everybody

367
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,640
So let's say there was a situation where I become

368
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:12,480
The minority this protects me from the majority

369
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,016
It's very simple

370
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,576
It's so simple but that idea of

371
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,368
Eventually I will be the one

372
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
Without power

373
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,744
Unreal to them it's just such as bizarre

374
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,792
Interpretation of things to be like

375
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,864
This is specifically to

376
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
Make it so you can't

377
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,960
Make fun of gay people at work anymore

378
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,240
Reality is

379
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:39,104
Sexual orientation as a class of things that you can't discriminate

380
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
Sprite

381
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,200
Do the same things that protect

382
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:49,088
People of ethnic minorities also protect white people from discrimination

383
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
Instagram

384
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
Such nonsense

385
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,464
Anyway JonBenet Ramsey

386
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,488
Died

387
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
A while back

388
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,792
Good for him

389
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:01,120
Cheaper

390
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,960
So this color is an interesting theory about

391
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:11,872
They're killing children in NFL

392
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,664
Another name

393
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
Give me a call

394
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,760
John

395
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,320
Take a look at JonBenet Ramsey

396
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,488
Jacobite

397
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,728
Community threads

398
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,288
Okay

399
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,312
JonBenet that's

400
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:44,384
The devil.

401
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,504
I think I can hammer out a minute

402
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,040
It's a cliche

403
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:55,648
Playing the comedian say like this

404
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:03,840
What kind of Association that is required to create a VIP

405
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,376
Yikes is very

406
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,936
Not thoughtful listeners

407
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,240
That sounds like something

408
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:15,104
The Oz another big story that he's promoting on this day first half of

409
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,920
The people who died in Switzerland are assisted suicides

410
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,200
It is not true

411
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,992
And the other one is that

412
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,552
Women are becoming a more pro-life

413
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,832
Turning against

414
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,856
Abortion

415
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,880
And this

416
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,696
A warning that is a gross

417
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,560
Women and women who

418
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,448
Bobby Knight Roofing in the majority in the debates

419
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,520
According to

420
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:50,688
Really

421
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,160
Not even bigger crime

422
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,488
Wow that's a barbaric s*** Alex's on here

423
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,768
I mean

424
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,424
I honestly don't think that I've ever heard him get into the specifics of his anti-abortion believe so I was actually a little surprised that

425
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,216
But he would have that hard of a stats

426
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:17,312
Express that publicly that even in cases of rape people should be forced

427
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
Sicario

428
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,152
That's wild

429
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,224
If somebody can understand why explaining it isn't going to

430
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,528
So good move along I mean

431
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:30,624
The type of when you read stories where it's like that happens and then

432
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,928
They get visitation rights

433
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
The rapist

434
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,512
Gets visitation rights to the kid is like

435
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,792
I mean

436
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
Just

437
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,584
F****** unconscionable

438
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,656
That's horrifying and that's

439
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:49,056
Low on the scale of the abuse has better it couldn't

440
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:55,456
Took me forever to track down the article he's reading but I finally did and it's from the Washington Times covering a survey

441
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,760
Conducted by the center for the advancement of women

442
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:01,088
The survey found that 51% of women surveyed

443
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:07,488
Say abortion should be outlawed or severely restricted their shifting toward the pro-life side group into the

444
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,792
The majority in the debate over Reproductive Rights

445
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,864
There's no link to the survey and I can't

446
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,264
Find it so I really can't discuss too many of the specifics but does say that there's a 3% margin of error so

447
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,056
He knows that this is actually representative of

448
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
Majority

449
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,128
Either way this is supposed to be up

450
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:27,968
From 45% on the bedside in 2001 so

451
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,528
Even if I'm being a little iffy on the specifics

452
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,576
Because I don't have access to them it does

453
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,368
Seemed to show a trend of lowering

454
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,648
Support for abortion

455
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,976
It does appear that this trend has turned around

456
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:42,560
As a Pew research study in May 2021 found the 50

457
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,608
9% of respondents said that abortion

458
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,168
To be legal in all or most

459
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,472
Cases just in time for it to be over

460
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:55,616
The numbers look even worse for Alex if you just include women does 62% of people who

461
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,920
Where the women were surveyed side of origin

462
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,200
To be legal in all or most

463
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
If you look at

464
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:07,136
Gallup's data on abortion attitudes quiktrak with the results of the survey cuz it just Oracle data

465
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,184
Far back on that question

466
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,304
I can find I'm going to guess that this survey that's being reported on to watch

467
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,608
Good times is an outlier in the data

468
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:20,704
Or possibly the results came from a poorly worded question or Ops

469
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,752
The people could try robbery

470
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,544
Either way the public opinion was fairly

471
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,592
The proportion access at the most

472
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,176
Including in 2003

473
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,712
Yeah I don't

474
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
I think that this is

475
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,528
Reflective of a tide

476
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,856
Turn it says Trump is up 40 points

477
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,160
Where's my crazy that is interesting

478
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:43,744
So Alex is talking about this

479
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,536
Assisted suicide thing

480
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
I'm going to come up

481
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,168
I'm going to need a citation on that

482
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
This isn't about

483
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,696
This is Al.

484
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:20,608
The implication here is that Doctor Kevorkian was f****** dead bodies and that's why he lost his medical license

485
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,168
I can find no evidence

486
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:27,776
If you can't find any evidence that he lost his medical license

487
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:34,176
Kevorkian was licensed to practice in Michigan in California and his license in Michigan was suspended in 1991

488
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:40,832
The Michigan Board of Medicine made this decision because he they tried to file charges against them for assisting in suicide

489
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,136
But it turned up there's actually no log

490
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:43,904
Against that admission

491
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
The time

492
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:50,304
So the board claimed it had quote acted under a state law that gives it the power to withdraw the license

493
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,608
Any Doctor Who acted a negligent

494
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
Or

495
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,656
Set Manor

496
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:57,216
Sisters drugs for other than lawful diagnostic

497
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,496
Or therapeutic purposes

498
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,800
Some of kevorkian's patients

499
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,104
Had I have lethal medication

500
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
Right

501
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,408
Administered

502
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:08,480
And because of that people would claim the authority to take

503
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,248
Insurance license

504
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,624
He lost his license in California 1993 and this only happened because one of his patients was from

505
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,904
From California

506
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,976
He didn't actually leave apparently ever go to California

507
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,000
And so

508
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,560
Sure she did prior to go

509
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:27,680
Come to Michigan his lawyers said that like he was even been there in years

510
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:32,544
Alex Consuela Ridge it like as all he wants but you can't prove any of this

511
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,568
And it's just

512
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
Disgusting

513
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,456
Yeah it did the family show seem like

514
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,368
Kevorkian had at the very least the idea that there was an altruistic motive behind his ass

515
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,464
I've seen a documentary or two

516
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,024
At no point in time

517
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,560
Did they mention him f***

518
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
Walking dead bodies

519
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,704
Smell I tried so many search-term

520
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,104
Trying to find at least even like necrophilia

521
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,920
Something that would give me a foothold in order to

522
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,504
Define like this is what's being talked about I couldn't find

523
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,576
Anyway Alex has an exciting gas coming up

524
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,424
Underwear

525
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,496
Got some I canceled coming back to Keller

526
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,032
We're going to come back on

527
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,336
Imaginative

528
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,616
Carson had

529
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:46,528
The same person on on the same week I make no mistake

530
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,344
Exact same story

531
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,368
It's true that I guess

532
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,392
You think

533
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,952
It's true

534
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:58,816
So Alex get the call here towards the end of the show after Mike's interview

535
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,888
A particular

536
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,680
Audio peace

537
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:08,544
Has played in the past because they Jello Biafra spoken word

538
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,104
Exchange is so

539
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,128
F****** funny

540
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,664
How It Ends is

541
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
The best

542
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
Next week or something

543
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,344
I appreciate it

544
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,816
I don't care about that

545
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,888
Okay

546
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,688
But that's one

547
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,832
Go out and find

548
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,168
Door

549
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
Well if I can play

550

Okay well

551
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,112
Are you doing everything going okay

552
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,904
Oh yeah

553
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:33,536
Doing alright I just

554
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,264
Worried about it check it in Salina this CD stuff going

555
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,312
Right now it feels like a big mess

556
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,104
Like that's not right

557
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,152
Deep into the cold it's not like

558
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:54,528
This is open opening pleasantries it's kind of like

559
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,320
I like that

560
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,880
His collars at this point in history

561
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,184
Are split down the middle of

562
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,744
Horrifying monsters

563
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,048
And people who have like

564
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09,632
Real Pleasant conversation

565
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,168
You seem up

566
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:14,240
Certainly nice you doing man Hey listen

567
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,776
I hear that song

568
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:22,688
How you doing so we get to the 3rd July 3rd

569
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,224
Before July 4th

570
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,112
Alex singing a song that we can tell a lot

571
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:30,880
In the present

572
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,864
Mall

573
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,736
I mean

574
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,832
So I think first of all the emotions are fake

575
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,648
So interesting

576
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,928
See he's

577
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,696
Ben

578
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,976
Just overworked

579
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:12,096
Is entire career there's just been too much to cover

580
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,376
Never been

581
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,448
There's never been a single day where is like list

582
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:20,288
Against All Odds today is kind of a light show

583
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
I've only got a couple of

584
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:27,968
Stacks here I think I'm going to talk to that guy he asked me how I was doing earlier

585
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,808
You know what let's have a fun story

586
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,576
Today

587
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:36,160
Never so we get to some of the news and

588
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,440
Smurf a commotion

589
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:38,976
A real

590
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:39,744
Troubling

591
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,024
Point

592
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,752
Believable

593
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:28,128
Got all these different with me

594
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,200
American

595
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,904
It's really embarrassing that Alex doesn't seem to know the difference between Karzai and Ahmad

596
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,768
Jalopy they are very different people different pronunciations

597
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,536
The same name

598
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:48,608
Karzai was the president of Afghanistan

599
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,376
A 2000

600
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
The 2014

601
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:54,752
Conversely Ahmad shalaby was Rocky politician who would go on to

602
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,312
To become the president of the governing Council of Iraq in

603
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,336
In September

604
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,152
2300 via Rocky National

605
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,432
Congress political party

606
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,296
The headline that Alex's reading is about Ahmad chalabi who played a large role in

607
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,832
In the lead-up to the Iraq War

608
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:12,160
Fairly quickly was found out to be a bit of a con man

609
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:18,816
True relationship to cultivated with a group of Republican politicians over the years from the first Iraq War

610
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:24,704
Political party the Inc was the recipient of over 100 million dollars from our

611
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,264
Matcha tea bad intelligence that was used

612
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,384
Convince the public that a war in Iraq was necessary like the ideas of mass

613
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,408
The best destruction

614
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:37,504
An saddam's connections to terrorism a people associated with shalaby

615
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
Nbimc

616
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,808
Yeah but

617
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:46,464
Bye 2004 he'd fallen out of Grace with us intelligence services

618
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,024
That he was sharing closely-held information with Ron

619
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:54,144
The CIA had actually voiced misgivings about him and his information all along

620
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,448
And suspicious connections to a Ron

621
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,496
But folks like Dick Cheney

622
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:05,152
We want to start a war none of this is to say that the war going to Iraq was all because of shalaby

623
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,688
Most of the members of Bush's

624
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:10,272
Just gotten it where more than willing to accept whatever rationale was put in front of them

625
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,296
To get rid of Saddam

626
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,856
It probably would have found someone else saying what they want

627
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,160
Gearhead chalabi not filled that role

628
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:19,488
All this being said it's really f***** up that Alex doesn't seem to know that

629
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,792
The Karzai until out of your two different people

630
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,608
Are you presenting himself as the only person who can

631
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,424
Decode the secret messages behind the news

632
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,704
The man won't tell you

633
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,544
It's clear that he doesn't even know Elementary details about the topics he's discussing

634
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,848
If I were Steve pieczenik

635
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,408
Definitely see how Alex would be a perfect March

636
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,736
Like exactly the sort of person that you'd be

637
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,760
Can use the sky

638
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,624
I was thinking about things one

639
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,648
I'm really curious

640
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,672
Where's Steve's at

641
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:55,328
Cuz I know this time. For the first time in 2002

642
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,352
Each other

643
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,376
And have talked

644
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,656
But he's not

645
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,704
You been on in the time that I've listened yet

646
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,496
Eagerly awaiting that threat

647
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,544
Steve pops up FIFA comment

648
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
He's not in the Solar

649
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,896
It doesn't appear that

650
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,432
Regular rotation

651
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,736
And the second thing

652
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,784
I've been thinking about is like

653
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,576
This guy isn't a star

654
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:17,856
Alex

655
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,416
You know to use more Celestial terms

656
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,952
Like he's not

657
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,768
In 2003

658
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,792
Does not ask

659
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,840
Don't have like he's got the

660
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,144
These skills that are just intrinsic

661
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
Definitely

662
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,192
Yeah but

663
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,216
He doesn't have the

664
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:33,984
DeSoto

665
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,544
Showmanship but he does

666
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,568
Later on

667
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,336
Right

668
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,360
I can see why he was

669
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,128
And Famous

670
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,664
It wasn't like super famous

671
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:46,016
It wasn't 911 that necessarily rocketed him he's kind of boring

672
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:46,784
It is

673
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,064
It is interesting

674
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,088
To see him in

675
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
What you would

676
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,624
Reconsider

677
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:51,904
Infancy

678
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
Progression

679
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,024
They have all these different ways

680
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,096
That idea of like

681
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,376
No no I didn't

682
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
Fuk up

683
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,168
It's that this

684
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,192
Human being

685
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,216
Has been like

686
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,752
Hey I'm going to trick

687
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
People with a bunch of

688
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:14,432
Different ways to pronounce my name and not trying to cover up that you f*****

689
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,736
It actually reveals

690
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,760
YouTube much

691
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,296
Larger

692
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,088
Aaron Esser

693
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,136
Ignorance

694
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,440
So Alex is a guest

695
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,744
Other than Mike Hanson who

696
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,280
Tell the same story again

697
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:32,864
Answer

698
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,656
The old

699
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:39,776
No no no the race no he wanted it off with the robbers

700
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,848
Mother Gaston Sky name red Beckman

701
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,640
We've talked about him in the past

702
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,920
He is a weirdo

703
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,968
Doesn't believe people pay taxes

704
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:54,368
He also is on here because he has interesting Theory

705
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,904
About juries

706
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:01,024
And how is your on the jury and you don't agree with the law

707
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,816
Even if you think a person's guilty

708
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,352
You should just vote them not guilty

709
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,656
Jury nullification of laws

710
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,680
Essentially is the

711
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,960
Is the push

712
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,984
Stitch a redback

713
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,264
Yeah

714
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,056
I can't imagine somebody

715
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,104
From Texas thinking that

716
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,664
Certainly

717
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:21,760
Red Bread got an interesting take on freedom of religion

718
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,296
In the First Amendment

719
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,576
I think I disagree with

720
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:30,976
They told us that we have free speech that you can criticize the government we have Free Press

721
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:31,744
The Press

722
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,304
Criticize

723
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,608
Is the government without the government

724
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,680
Laughing out loud

725
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,728
The same thing

726
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,008
The same

727
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,288
Perfect

728
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,312
The freedom of religion

729
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,640
The minister was to be

730
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:52,224
Condemned

731
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,040
Servants

732
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,344
Outside of the wall

733
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,416
They have changed that completely

734
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,696
Until now

735
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:05,024
If the freedom of the Muslims the freedom of the Buddhist

736
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,560
The freedom of everybody else

737
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,424
They're just ask

738
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,192
Absolutely

739
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,472
Running roughshod

740
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,520
Over the principles

741
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,288
The first

742
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,944
So I would guess that red Beckman would have a slightly different position if the conversation we're about like an Imam telling their Moscow.

743
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,224
Vote for who to vote against

744
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,552
As a prediction but I think he's very can

745
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,600
Across all religious idea

746
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:35,488
Posters can do exactly what red wants them to do and they could be as political as they want they just have to pay the tax

747
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
Axis then

748
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:40,608
Advocating for against specific politicians or policies as a violation of their tax

749
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,376
Exempt status

750
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,704
There's no law against preachers doing targeted political organizer

751
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,984
Have to pay taxes

752
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,752
That they do

753
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,824
To be able to use churches as political organizing

754
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,872
Entities because of course he does

755
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:57,503
The political project these folks are engaged 2003 is a Christian nationalist

756
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,271
State

757
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:03,135
I want a store that is associating certain way with following your religion

758
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,671
Is what redwood like

759
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,719
People to be forced

760
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,743
Into

761
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,791
Cool

762
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,327
That is

763
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,863
That is so funny

764
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,399
That did they rewrite

765
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,679
The First Amendment

766
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,775
I mean how can you

767
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,055
He said

768
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,335
But they changed it

769
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:25,151
Like the first amendment was supposed to be this

770
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,175
But they changed it

771
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:34,111
Well the interpretation of it is no longer that the freedom of religion is about

772
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:38,207
Like I originally the interpretation that the founders wanted right

773
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,255
Religious

774
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,047
L can

775
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,583
Leave campaign

776
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
Politician

777
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,631
That's what it was

778
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,167
Protect

779
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,447
Written that one in there

780
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,471
Cut up

781
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,007
Yeah I think

782
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:54,591
He's just talking about like the interpretation of it is changed to include like a separation

783
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,127
Church and state being

784
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,431
Very clear

785
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,295
The government shall make no law restricting

786
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,343
Editas religion

787
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,927
It doesn't take Christianity and others that

788
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,951
And then second it doesn't

789
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:16,351
Say like the government shall not stop religious leaders from talkingshit

790
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:22,751
So Alex gets a call while red Beckman is on

791
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,567
Through most of the show together

792
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,359
And this call herbally

793
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,639
Leave that his phone is being

794
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,199
He can hear noises

795
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,735
The phone

796
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:35,295
I am here is pretty insistent about this

797
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,087
Yes a Alex has to say

798
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,391
Call Bill Thompson

799
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:50,911
Call

800
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:53,983
Another

801
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,103
Hope

802
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
My phone tap

803
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:33,919
Because

804
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
It's probably

805
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,247
So true that they're going

806
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:40,063
Define

807
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,487
Talk to somebody else

808
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,327
What's going on

809
00:44:55,423 --> 00:45:01,567
So this is fascinating like generally nowadays whenever one of Alex's listeners causing with a stupid

810
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,335
Paranoid Theory

811
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:06,943
Alex does absolutely nothing to reassure them that they're fine and this is

812
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,223
That is not happening

813
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:12,319
He actively encourages their paranoia and lends credibility to their fears

814
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:17,439
Here in 2003 though this caller Hank is worried that the man is listening in on his phone calls but

815
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,743
Set up saying that that's probably true Alex

816
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,047
Argues with him about how it's not happening

817
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,327
It's probably not possible

818
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,095
Anyway

819
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:29,983
It's also interesting to me to hear that Alex has articulating this review about government surveillance programs

820
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,287
You don't actually think there's a wife

821
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,567
Pittsburgh spine going on

822
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,871
The government's just revealing the day of spying

823
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,639
Capabilities

824
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:42,271
In order to scare Patriots into thinking that their calls could be listened to at any point so there's a chilling effect

825
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,855
Remind me of his other comments particularly more recent ones

826
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,879
I don't think that this is

827
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,647
Position.

828
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,927
Consisted on at all

829
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:53,023
Also as The Story Goes Judas betrayed Jesus for thirty pieces

830
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,815
Is the silver so either Alex got that

831
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:57,375
Very well-known biblical detail wrong

832
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:01,727
Hypothetical Feds that are listening into red beckman's phone or working at a rate

833
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:02,751
One of the two

834
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,799
I do like that

835
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:11,199
You know cuz that's evolution of that you know I don't mind if they listen to my calls I've either got

836
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,735
Say or they're going to hear

837
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,503
Engrossed

838
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,039
Hahaha that kind of big

839
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,831
This is elevating it to

840
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,135
I hope they're listening to my calls so I can get that

841
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:19,903
Truthout

842
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,695
Write to the NSA

843
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,743
Teach them a little lesson

844
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:28,863
Can you imagine surveilling somebody and then eventually being like you know what

845
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,399
They're right

846
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:35,007
What about it think is going on

847
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,823
Bellingham

848
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,127
The conclusion

849
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,943
Because when they listen

850
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,223
Conversate

851
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,527
Wow

852
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:51,135
Only have to do is look around them and

853
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,927
See what's going on

854
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,207
And they know that were

855
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,231
Telling the truth

856
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:58,559
Realize that it's now

857
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,375
A good idea to put people on monitoring

858
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,423
The Patriots phones because

859
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,191
They just like

860
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,239
That's

861
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,263
That is

862
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
A

863
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,359
Perfect encapsulation of the shot Chaser meme

864
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,383
Where I go

865
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,431
It would be crazy to think this

866
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,735
I think this

867
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:19,807
Okay alright

868
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,831
Yeah

869
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,599
Yep

870
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:25,951
The guy who famously has the dock

871
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,279
Catchphrase and a joke

872
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,559
Because he

873
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:34,911
The often times he doesn't provide these documents

874
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:41,311
This next clip is actually an interesting incidents where he's offering to give the audio

875
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,359
A document

876
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
Like down for this because

877
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,687
There's a little bit of a cat

878
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,783
Article

879
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,623
How long will it

880
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:48,639
That's fascinating I was blown away by

881
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,991
Aren't you the tip of the spear

882
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:59,647
Yeah in order to get this document you have to buy a couple silver dollars for Ted Anderson

883
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,183
You trying to get the truth out

884
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,975
Well yeah but you got to buy some silver

885
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:06,047
Why is there a pay wall behind

886
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,071
Because

887
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,887
Do you want to go to buy

888
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,167
What document is it

889
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,703
Wow that I'm glad you asked

890
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,543
Of course why would I why would I be so stupid

891
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:19,103
Here is what it is

892
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,199
Here

893
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,623
More days

894
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:52,127
So Alex is like he's full of s*** about this and it's really pathetic though he's playing this game it's

895
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,919
Clearly designed to get people

896
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,687
The order things

897
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:59,295
Anderson in Midas resources and hopefully get them into the on the phone with somebody who can

898
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:02,879
Tell them all about how important it is to buy precious metals

899
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,903
The game between times

900
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:06,719
The document is the thing that's being

901
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,255
Lower its luring them in

902
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:12,095
So sad the Declassified report

903
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,887
From DARPA is nothing of the sort

904
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:19,519
He reads off a document identification number and that alone is a huge clue about how poorly he's covering this

905
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,847
A b a is a broad agency announced

906
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,895
Not a board agency enough

907
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:25,663
Announcement

908
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,967
The Army's website defines them as quote

909
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:33,087
A competitive solicitation procedure used to obtain proposals for basic and applied research

910
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,623
Part of developing

911
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:38,463
Not related to the development of a specific system or Hardware procurement

912
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:44,351
Very vast the document that Alex is selling his audience as a Declassified DARPA report is

913
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,887
Actually just a posting

914
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:49,471
At a certain government agency is taking pictures for research proposal

915
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,239
Yeah

916
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:55,359
Various government agencies utilize Bas to find people to conduct research

917
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:59,711
Princeton Steve defense Logistics agency currently has one open to quote

918
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:03,039
Identify domestically-produced materials from

919
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:09,439
From possibly reliable sources to substitute for materials produced by Foreign sources or sole source

920
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,231
That's all

921
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:15,071
It's DARPA posting a help wanted ad for a project that they called

922
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,863
Combat zone that c

923
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:19,423

924
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,959
2003 wood close

925
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,727
What year later

926
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,263
On the project

927
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:26,847
Here's how they describe it it's it's a project that quote

928
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,383
Explorers Concepts

929
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,663
Develop algorithms

930
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:32,991
Deliver systems for utilizing large numbers thousand

931
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:37,343
Oh camera is to provide the clothes in sensing demand

932
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,647
For military operations in Urban Terrain

933
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,695
The reason for wanting to do this

934
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:45,279
Explore this research is spelled out in the VA

935
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:48,607
Quote military operations in Urban Terrain

936
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,375
Fraught with Dan

937
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,655
Urban Canyon

938
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:57,055
Yield standoff sensing from airborne and space born Platforms in effect

939
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,639
Short lines of sight neutralize much of the standoff

940
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:04,479
Fan situation awareness advantages currently rendered by US forces

941
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:10,367
Large civilian populations of the ever-present risk of collateral damage preclude the use of overwhelming Force

942
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:14,207
As a result combat Insidious has long been viewed as something

943
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:14,975
Thing to avoid

944
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,023
However modern asymmetric

945
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:20,863
Threats to capitalize on these limitations by hiding in urban areas

946
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,423
Enforcing US forces to engage in cities

947
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:26,751
We can no longer avoid the need to be prepared to fight

948
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:27,519
Insidious

949
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,823
I read over this and I hate it

950
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,407
But they also understand the rationale for exploring this kind of research

951
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:39,807
It's very specifically aimed at targeting a Deployable network of sensors and cameras that can track specific Vehicles Over Law

952
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,831
Long distances

953
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,367
Including within Urban Air

954
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:49,535
I get why it would be a valuable thing to for the government to have during the Iraq War

955
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:53,887
And I think that the risk associated with the potential misuse of a program like this

956
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:56,191
It's not something that's worth the benefit that you get

957
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:58,239
Creating it so I would be opposed

958
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,335
I read a bunch of this

959
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:08,223
Proposal of the documents that are on the DARPA website I've decided that I'm against it

960
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:11,039
However I think of the way Alex misreport

961
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:14,111
On this proposal actually does a disservice to oppose

962
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,647
Because it's disconnect

963
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,415
Dude from reality

964
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:22,815
If you want to take this proposal and warn people that they sort of thing has the potential to be Gravely misused in the wrong hands

965
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:26,655
And its implementation of US Cities would almost certainly violate people's

966
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,935
Personal privacy

967
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:31,775
That would be a fine thing to do and I think it's a fine conversation

968
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:37,919
It's just dumb to take this information and use it to insist that this is a classified document approved darpa's doing the

969
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:41,503
Because the provided evidence fails embarrassing

970
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,551
Simile short of a proven that

971
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,623
It's counterproductive to report information this way but

972
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:49,439
It's probably deeply on ethical and exploitative

973
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,463
Use this kind of

974
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:54,815
Misreporting of this information to get people into your gold sales revenue stream

975
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
Also

976
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,143
I can find a ton of speculation about this

977
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,679
Program on blogs

978
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,447
For the life of me

979
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:05,055
I can't find anyone that provide specific details about what happened

980
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,359
Past the posting of this ba

981
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:11,967
I was able to actually fine though the project manager Thomas Strat

982
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,759
I found his LinkedIn page

983
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:17,855
And weirdly combat zones Betsy that project is listed in his resume

984
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:20,927
It's probably real secret stuff

985
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:24,255
I wouldn't put that in your CV if it if it was

986
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,279
Classify

987
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
Waltz

988
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,327
Yeah it's it's

989
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,351
It's strange

990
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,911
Obviously I think that

991
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:31,935
This

992
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,727
Serta program

993
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:35,519
I think

994
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:38,335
But the capabilities that you might be able to develop

995
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,359
Through it

996
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,127
Aren't good

997
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:43,199
The mayor definitely things that could be abused

998
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,479
Yes

999
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:48,831
There's a valid conversation to have around that but I think the way Alex is doing this

1000
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:49,855
Justice cartoon

1001
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,671
I want to know what it is

1002
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,463
So I'm ordering silver

1003
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,999
I'm ordering silver

1004
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,279
In order to

1005
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,303
To get this free.

1006
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:02,143
Well and you're getting an AP story about

1007
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:05,471
The document that proves that it's a real thing or something

1008
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:10,847
And you're also going to get like red beckman's weird pamphlet

1009
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,615
Totally

1010
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,663
What am I supposed to do with this.

1011
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:21,087
Do I use this to win arguments in with my family that's what it is

1012
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:21,855
Hey listen

1013
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:27,743
Guess what you think I'm crazy I bought this document from Alex

1014
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:33,375
It was $25 but I also got silver

1015
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,679
Sober and honestly while I was on the phone I bought it

1016
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:39,263
Bunch more silver

1017
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:43,615
That's what it's for right now it's the trick people into buying more metal from

1018
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:48,223
I know I know but from a consumer side that's what they must be thinking

1019
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,527
You have the documents you can make copies of it

1020
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:53,343
Distributed I'm tired of looking like I'm crazy

1021
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,439
Tell people that I bought silver and an innocuous

1022
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,975
From DARPA

1023
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,743
Great

1024
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,023
Weird

1025
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:06,399
But transparent in terms of the intent on Alex's part and it's just like

1026
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,751
If you were trying to abused your audience this is how you have been

1027
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:17,151
Yeah I know the Home Shopping Network is like we have to put a clock on this because everybody doesn't buy it is going to die tomorrow he don't like

1028
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:21,247
Jerky

1029
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,015
Worldwide

1030
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,295
Conspiracy trying to kill you

1031
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,855
What I'm saying that if at the end of their clock

1032
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:31,231
You were going to die right there's a bomb that's unless you spell August

1033
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,279
That's the problem

1034
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:37,631
So red Beckman has some ideas about the USSR that I don't think

1035
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:40,191
Now they're great I don't think this is

1036
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,983
And people just do not

1037
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,007
Understand what

1038
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:45,055
USSR

1039
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,383
Great world powers

1040
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,943
The point where they were dissolved overnight

1041
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:55,807
They were considered one or two world powers and they were dissolved overnight

1042
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,135
People don't understand why

1043
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,439
Simple

1044
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,743
It was a

1045
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,511
God

1046
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:10,655
Point where it should be no longer answer the prayers of those who pray

1047
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:14,751
Something that's really interesting about that

1048
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:17,823
Is that if you were speaking metaphorically

1049
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,871
I think there's something to that

1050
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,919
You know I think that there are

1051
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,455
The government's can collapse

1052
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:26,783
Because of inability to provide for the needs

1053
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:29,087
Of the population

1054
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:31,647
I think if you're really generous with the metaphor

1055
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:32,927
I'm

1056
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,975
Fairly fine with what red sang

1057
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:40,095
Because I listen to this yeah I know that he's being literal he's being very literal

1058
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:46,495
Yeah if you want her to say that our government worships the false god of productivity and and capital

1059
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,287
Totally fine

1060
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:54,175
But if you want to say that the USSR broke up overnight cuz they were worshipping a false god

1061
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,711
Literally like f***

1062
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,735
Ball

1063
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,503
Or something

1064
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,807
Then you might be right back

1065
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,087
You might be you might be

1066
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,159
Yeah that that was a little bit strange

1067
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:09,535
Has another take on this and that isn't like

1068
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:13,119
The false god of the USSR fell trying to do it again

1069
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,783
Before 911

1070
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,927
New World Order

1071
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:44,095
So there doesn't none of this is real

1072
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:47,167
It was a report released by the project for The New American Century

1073
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,703
In September 2000

1074
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:52,543
It's one of the disappointing Smokin Guns that 911 truth folks

1075
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,335
Spell out to prove the bush did 9/11

1076
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:56,895
Appears in the tack

1077
00:58:57,407 --> 00:59:02,783
Process of transformation even if it brings revolutionary change is likely to be a long one

1078
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,367
Absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new Pearl Harbor

1079
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:09,439
This doesn't prove anything but it's super fun to Sapient

1080
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,743
Picture the word

1081
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:14,559
Imperial mobilization don't appear anywhere the

1082
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,583
Pinac document

1083
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,375
A together and

1084
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:20,191
Each word doesn't even appear in the text on its own

1085
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:26,591
Alex is mixing the peanut document up with zbigniew Brzezinski book The Great the grand chessboard

1086
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,895
Would you use as an optimal lined Passage

1087
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,663
Including the words

1088
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,943
Imperial mobilization

1089
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,223
The first time

1090
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,783
The term is used it's used three times in the tax

1091
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:41,439
The second time is sort of a rephrasing of what we're going to talk about a second time was just saying that if we Russia

1092
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,975
That was more decentralized

1093
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,255
It would be less likely to

1094
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,791
Engage in a remobilization

1095
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,607
The first

1096
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:49,631
Time is

1097
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,655
The one that is

1098
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:51,423
Often

1099
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,447
Cited like

1100
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:54,239
Conspiracy theorist and is misused

1101
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:59,103
So it's in the section about the geopolitical situation in Eurasia or the Eurasia

1102
00:59:59,359 --> 00:59:59,871
Chess board

1103
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,407
He calls it

1104
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:04,735
It's argued that US influence in Eurasia is it

1105
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,527
Exceedingly important to world stability

1106
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:09,087
Possibly more to the point in more realistic

1107
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:12,159
Stickley holding the most sway in that region is critically important

1108
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,695
The US strategic interest

1109
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:17,279
And the prospect of a hostile country having more sway is really Gretna

1110
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,303
Link to our

1111
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:23,167
Text envisions Eurasia is split into four segments on a boar

1112
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,703
There's the west witch

1113
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,727
Includes most of Europe

1114
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:29,055
Where the u.s. is said to have a pulled on the chessboard

1115
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:33,919
There's the East which is basically China Japan North and South Korea as well as Southeast Asia

1116
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:40,063
There's the middle space which is the former USSR and then there's the South which is mostly the middle

1117
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:45,439
According to brzezinski's analysis a situation that could be seen as a win for us interest

1118
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:47,743
Is one where the former USSR comes

1119
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,791
Closer to the US's orbit

1120
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:53,119
Where the East doesn't outright expel the United States

1121
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,655
I'd wear the South section dozen

1122
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,423
End up quotes

1123
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,471
Subjected to Domination by a single play

1124
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,751
Player

1125
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:01,823
You can kind of see the point that's being made

1126
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,895
There's an interesting analysis of the sort of

1127
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,663
Tension

1128
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,967
Between these actor

1129
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:10,015
Bruzdzinski points out that quote

1130
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:15,391
The scope of American global hegemony is admittedly great but it's death is shallow

1131
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:16,927
That's an interesting point

1132
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,487
ABC's this

1133
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:24,607
Kind of dynamic as an inevitability particularly in the Eurasian chessboard

1134
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:31,263
Very scale and diversity of Eurasia as well as the power of some of its states limits the depth of America

1135
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,031
Can influence

1136
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,335
And the scope of control over the course of events

1137
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,383
That Mega continent is just

1138
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:39,199
Too large to populous culturally to varied

1139
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:39,967
And composed

1140
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:43,551
Too many historically ambitious and politically energetic state

1141
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,599
To be compliant towards even the most

1142
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:50,719
Economically successful and politically preeminent Global power

1143
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:56,863
Before they don't just like rollover hard to hold

1144
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,167
What do large reasons this is

1145
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:05,055
The case is because American influence is not based on the primary tool that has been used by empires in the past

1146
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,079
Which is correct

1147
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:06,847
Control

1148
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:12,735
Bruzdzinski isn't saying that not taking over countries is a bad thing and it's Vicky we should change it or something

1149
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,503
That's not

1150
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:17,087
Here's the passage where Imperial mobilization

1151
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:17,855
Comes out

1152
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:23,231
Quote it's also a fact that America is too Democratic at home to be autocratic abroad

1153
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:28,351
This limits the use of America's power especially its capacity for military intimidation

1154
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:32,191
Never before has a populist democracy attained International Supremacy

1155
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:36,543
But the pursuit of power is not a goal of the commands popular passion

1156
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:41,151
Accepting conditions of sudden threat or challenge to the public sense of domestic well-being

1157
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,455
The economic self-denial that is

1158
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:45,759
Is defense spending and human sacrifice

1159
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,295
Casualties even among

1160
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,575
Professional Soldier

1161
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:52,415
Required in the effort are uncongenial to democratic enter

1162
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,207
Democracy is

1163
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:54,975
Inimical

1164
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,767
To Imperial mobilization

1165
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,047
Anyway

1166
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:03,167
Alex will often misrepresent the grand chessboard and I guess in this case he got his primary sources can

1167
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:03,935
Confused

1168
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:07,007
It's basically the the Imperial mobilization

1169
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,287
In the context of that quote is

1170
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,055
Something I did

1171
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:11,103
He sang with this isn't something

1172
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,639
That

1173
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,943
Did our democratic system is really

1174
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,223
Compatible

1175
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,015
Which is why it required

1176
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:22,623
Far more authoritarian leading 30 years after that to do exactly what he said a populist

1177
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:27,487
I couldn't even so I would I would save

1178
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,255
That

1179
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:32,863
The version of Imperial mobilization

1180
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,399
That's being discussed

1181
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:36,191
Is not what we have

1182
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,519
But still fair enough

1183
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,591
Also this is important George W bush never wrote

1184
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:46,175
Anything that was released by the project for a new American Center Roatan

1185
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,223
Because he was also never a member

1186
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:53,599
Future members of his administration were among the 25 initial founding members of the group

1187
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,903
It also that group did include Jeb Bush

1188
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,439
But not George W

1189
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:02,047
The group did hold heavy influence in the bush years but the way Alex is talking about the

1190
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,071
This is just cartoon

1191
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:09,727
Also the peanut document ends with a list of people who quote participated in at least one project meeting orchid

1192
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:11,263
Tribute to the paper for discussion

1193
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,079
That list does not include Dick Cheney

1194
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:16,639
What is direct attribution really matter

1195
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:23,807
Much like the case of the DARPA document Alex does the subject he's talking about a disservice by having no grass

1196
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,087
The basic details

1197
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,367
And making up so much

1198
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,415
Extraneous stuff as to make his stories

1199
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,695
Just more interesting

1200
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:33,535
He's just trying to sort of flavor

1201
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,583
It's changing things

1202
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,863
Past the point of

1203
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:37,631
It even

1204
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,167
Resembling reality

1205
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:41,727
Opposition to the project for The New American

1206
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,751
Can century is

1207
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:46,335
It's based on an understanding of the group that you get from listening to Alex

1208
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:49,407
Cuz it's just Bluster and anger leading you down a dead-end

1209
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:52,479
Infowars as we're healthy distrust goes

1210
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,247
Todai

1211
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,271
And that's

1212
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,295
Really unfortunate

1213
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:57,343
Yeah it seems to me that's so many

1214
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,367
Conspiracies

1215
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:00,415
Like boiled down to just

1216
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:02,719
Reacting to having an error stock

1217
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:03,999
You know like

1218
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:07,327
Of course all of these people know each other there in the aristocra

1219
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,607
They're connected

1220
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,655
In the same way that with World War

1221
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,983
All the countries were run by the same fam

1222
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:17,567
You know like it's that kind of don't you have an aristocracy you can

1223
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,847
Easily draw

1224
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:19,615
Parallelism

1225
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,639
Connections to him

1226
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,175
Cuz they f****** went to school together

1227
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:24,479
Yeah but you're not there an actual Criminal

1228
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,503
Conspiracy working

1229
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:26,783
Together

1230
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:30,367
It's another thing to wear

1231
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,903
Do you have a greater

1232
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,439
Possibility

1233
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,975
Need to make persuasive

1234
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,023
Appearing conspiracy theories

1235
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,303
The great Earth

1236
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,583
The difference is

1237
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,607
The gap between

1238
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:44,447
Glasses website

1239
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,727
Is the number at the top

1240
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,263
Decrease and

1241
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,799
Distance

1242
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:49,823
Between them

1243
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,871
Increases to a point where

1244
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,431
People are just completely out of touch

1245
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:57,247
People in different social strata

1246
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,527
And the ability to

1247
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,295
To believe

1248
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,599
Various things about people

1249
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:03,391
Right you're so disconnected from

1250
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,671
Comes much easier

1251
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,951
You could believe that there

1252
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:09,023
Eating people or whatever

1253
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,559
In a certain sense

1254
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:11,839
The same

1255
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,863
Impetus that gets

1256
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,655
Rich people in trouble for saying like

1257
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,703
A milk milk is what

1258
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:23,103
How many is it $1,000 per gallon or for how much is a milk

1259
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,383
Ask for what

1260
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:28,223
Exactly the same as being like a Billionaire's obviously drink blood

1261
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,759
Otherwise why would they be built

1262
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,039
Right2know

1263
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,343
Next

1264
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,415
Beckman has some thoughts about 9/11

1265
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,951
Let Her Go

1266
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,023
For the American people

1267
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:41,791
Go to

1268
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,351
911

1269
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,679
Were controlled by remote

1270
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,703
Controlling

1271
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,495
It wasn't

1272
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:02,271
They didn't find the hijackers live and

1273
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,575
I find this really interesting

1274
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,855
The wave

1275
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:09,183
This theory of the remote-controlled planes

1276
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,207
It seems

1277
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,767
Very popular on Infowars at this point

1278
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,583
Which I don't think of something that

1279
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,399
Hugh Allison want

1280
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:22,495
20 yeah present I don't think he would like that

1281
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,519
Because it's

1282
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:24,799
Silly

1283
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,823
And they changed

1284
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,127
Didn't they change the main like that one

1285
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,919
Is gone from even the most

1286
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:36,319
I think we think so yeah they let that one go after while cuz they were like really hard for me to know

1287
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,343
Know what is like

1288
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:41,695
Still within the 9/11 conspiracy Cannon cuz a lot of stuff came and went

1289
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:47,583
I think that's the thing that's probably about it

1290
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,631
See one last clip here and I think

1291
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,935
One of the things that's really really challenging

1292
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:56,799
When your we are listening to this stuff is like earlier in this episode we were talking about

1293
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:57,823
Alex

1294
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,407
Trying to tell this collar

1295
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:05,759
But at the same time he's really trying to scare them

1296
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:08,063
Like this is how the show end

1297
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,087
This is

1298
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,111
This is a response

1299
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:10,879
Possible

1300
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:11,903
Liquid half

1301
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,695
Iroquois

1302
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,983
Well I think it'll be

1303
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,007
Be bigger than the last

1304
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:29,567
You go back

1305
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,335
Menu

1306
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,127
Progression

1307
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,407
Ruby Ridge

1308
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:39,551
Everyone

1309
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:56,703
Maybe tomorrow on the 4th of July maybe they're lying or something

1310
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:58,495
Something bigger than 911 that happened

1311
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,847
You got to be paying attention

1312
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:04,383
Maybe not all that close late

1313
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,151
But

1314
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:09,759
You might notice how this caller asked what would happen if New York was nuked and Alex

1315
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:12,831
Immediately Rican text realized that as the globalist

1316
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,111
Attacking us

1317
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:16,671
He doesn't even leave room

1318
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:19,231
Ferrer couldn't even be an actual terrorists

1319
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:23,583
Possibility is not even in the consideration

1320
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,607
Right

1321
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,887
That's interesting

1322
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,703
It kind of speaks to his

1323
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,983
Unwillingness

1324
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,263
To recognize

1325
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:33,311
Aventus actually haven't happened

1326
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,359
It certainly has been

1327
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:37,151
In the behind

1328
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,199
Much like Kevin the bird mite

1329
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,735
He likes to

1330
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,295
Eating the chocolate out of the out of the bush

1331
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,343
Because little beef

1332
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,647
Kevin so great

1333
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,671
I think

1334
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,207
That's Alex

1335
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,487
Has gotten into trouble

1336
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,279
Obviously with the Sandy Hook

1337
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:55,839
Reaction to picking out this much

1338
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:56,607
Must be fake

1339
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:59,167
It's just super consistent with him the whole time

1340
01:09:59,423 --> 01:09:59,935
Must

1341
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,471
Fit into

1342
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:04,799
The storyline of the overarching narrative that he believed

1343
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:07,103
You can see red reinforcing that with

1344
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,895
Putting everything on ascertain

1345
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:14,015
Trajectory Ruby Ridge the bombing of the World Trade Center Oklahoma City 9/11

1346
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:15,551
It's all

1347
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:18,879
Part of a progression to him as as a like

1348
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:21,951
All of these things are being done by the globalist

1349
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,999
Against bright the Patriots

1350
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,047
And more specifically

1351
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,839
Yes because he is the

1352
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,119
Yes

1353
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,399
And that's

1354
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,679
Dumb

1355
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:34,495
But it's it's definitely

1356
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:39,103
Indicative of their their worldview that all of this s*** is an intrinsically connected

1357
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:41,407
As opposed to like Wyler's a bunch of

1358
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,455
Separate incidents of

1359
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:45,247
Bad stuff

1360
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,783
You know what's weird I almost

1361
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:47,807
I don't

1362
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,599
Understand being afraid of a new

1363
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:54,207
I almost in the same way that I don't understand really being afraid of an asteroid

1364
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,999
In a in a like

1365
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,023
Pearson

1366
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:59,327
It's like obviously like the reason is

1367
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,351
Because the neck

1368
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,631
Nuuk is the last one

1369
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:05,215
You know like it for everything it's for the world

1370
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:07,007
The human race is over

1371
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,567
Maybe just like if we get hit by a meteor

1372
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:13,663
The human race is over like why worry about an Extinction event

1373
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:19,295
You know you got s*** to where I would I'm worried about a cruise missile hitting

1374
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:21,087
Chicago

1375
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:21,855
Deal with

1376
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:24,671
People are going to have to fall there going to be a whole fall out

1377
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,975
Chicago in autumn

1378
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:28,767
Automated system happen

1379
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,047
And everyone's dead

1380
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,839
Maybe you know maybe

1381
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,911
I think that in the past there have been discussing

1382
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
Of

1383
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:40,031
Absorbing a nuclear attack or something because of this very

1384
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:40,799
Concern

1385
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:43,359
How's it just turning into the end of the world

1386
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:47,711
Situation even if an asteroid hit necessarily die immediately

1387
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:53,855
You might have some stuff to deal with what I'm saying what I'm saying is if that happened

1388
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:57,439
I'm not dealing with any of that I'm calling dr. Kevorkian baby I'm

1389
01:11:57,695 --> 01:12:03,327
Done for assisted suicide all over I'm not going to melt from radiation poisoning well alright

1390
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:06,655
Personally I don't understand why people Fear the Reaper

1391
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,519
Never bothered me

1392
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,591
Yeah we get to the end of this and I think

1393
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,615
Galaxies

1394
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:24,319
Trend of homophobia is really troubling

1395
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,599
Yeah

1396
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,367
It's

1397
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,415
Intensely moreover

1398
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:29,951
Then it has been at other pee

1399
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:30,719
. the pass

1400
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,767
I'm having

1401
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,559
I'm having very serious

1402
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,583
Like

1403
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:39,423
Immediate flashbacks to cuz 2003 was when I was

1404
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,447
In high school

1405
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,983
Sophomore and Junior and

1406
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,263
School in my

1407
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,031
Small Christie

1408
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,311
Conservative town

1409
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:48,127
And the homophobia I remember is

1410
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:48,895
So

1411
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,431
Intense

1412
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,967
And then to think about

1413
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:54,271
Like my little sister is a

1414
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,295
For now

1415
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:57,087
And the Next Generation

1416
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,111
The kids that she's

1417
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:02,207
She's almost resentful of them like how dare you be

1418
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:04,511
Septic of people

1419
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:05,791
And it's like

1420
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,327
I cannot believe

1421
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:10,655
How f*****-up it was just that

1422
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,703
Just a short time ago

1423
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:18,335
Probably true lot of times turns with generational

1424
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,359
Gaps in

1425
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:22,175
You just hope that the progress

1426
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,967
It's being made as progress in the right direction

1427
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:25,759
It seems like

1428
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,039
On that front

1429
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,087
It's been a little better

1430
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,903
But yeah

1431
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,463
I think it just sticks out to me is like these

1432
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,487
Collars are

1433
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:42,655
How are you doing an arm MB you take care

1434
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,703
Just

1435
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:51,103
Absurdly so to the point where it sticks out something to be said about how polite Society

1436
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,919
Indian enjoyed their hatred

1437
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,943
But they were still polite

1438
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:58,527
What about it what what the people who were calling in and we're polite that's true

1439
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:01,599
People who are at work

1440
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:06,975
I just wanted to Jello Biafra a clip

1441
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,255
Right right

1442
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,559
Yeah hopefully they found greener pastures

1443
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,351
How do I will be back

1444
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,887
But until that we have left

1445
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,423
We do it now

1446
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:20,031
Twitter

1447
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:24,639
Will be back but until then I'm needle I'm Leon dzx Clark

1448
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:26,943
The sex robot

1449
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,247
Holding

1450
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:34,879
Alexandra Thurston color
