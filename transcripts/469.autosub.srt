1
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

2
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

3
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

4
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:07,072
Vicks around your knowledge about Alex Jones

5
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,376
Jordan Jordan

6
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:22,432
I don't know who to give a thank you too I'm just

7
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:27,296
Is it did not come with a Sodastream machine

8
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:33,696
So I can make my own Seltzer's when it is going to happen someday

9
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:39,072
Target a number of times in the past and I walked

10
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
But I could never get my

11
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
Myself to make the

12
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:43,936
The jump

13
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,176
Waffle makers in the past

14
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
I couldn't commit to the idea of a purchase of a

15
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,536
And then I'll test it out in Clio

16
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
I wouldn't

17
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,144
Can you just like put anything in there and see what happens

18
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,544
Think you could

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,384
You turn into a zelter worried about those sorts of thoughts

20
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,200
Because they inevitably lead to like

21
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,992
Fizzy milk

22
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:34,112
And these sorts of things and dangerous

23
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,416
It's possible that's why we got you a soda

24
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,232
Inevitable

25
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:46,400
Please send me an email so I can give you a proper thank you very much

26
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,936
And I look forward to

27
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:54,592
Going crazy

28
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,432
Text electric shelter form

29
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,808
This is sad

30
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,880
You may feel like it's insignificant and small

31
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
But

32
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,696
I've rediscovered

33
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,488
My other Joy with

34
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:22,752
My partner is a peanut allergy

35
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,848
Peanut butter and now at this point in time she's like

36
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,896
If you're going to die without peanut butter

37
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
I can't live with you

38
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Covid

39
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
Etc

40
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,272
And so here we are

41
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:39,136
Drastically altered by nausea

42
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
Ketchup

43
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,232
Months without ketchup

44
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,792
Lasso

45
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,096
Greece

46
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,680
There wasn't around

47
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:59,616
Was he missing some amino acid or something

48
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,736
You can't go further

49
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,040
Cookie butter

50
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,624
Another butter

51
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,416
Reviews okay alright

52
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:16,768
Just trying to figure out a way to help a domestic situation

53
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
Several hundred

54
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,351
Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in the past week

55
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:26,751
What's that grocery store PB&J B

56
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,591
Seafood that I found

57
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,455
This was a little bit weird but it I really I found it

58
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
Enjoyable

59
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,319
It's a little bit of like a shells or 20 that's covered in like

60
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,135
Basically a dusting of peanut flour

61
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,439
And then strawberry jam on the inside

62
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:51,839
That's fantastic

63
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,655
Do you remember the uncrustable

64
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
What's up

65
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,031
We cut

66
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:05,407
And I went to the kitchen snacks

67
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,711
Accorded

68
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Earlier

69
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,511
I'm sorry that wasn't crunchy

70
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,279
Fantastic

71
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:25,631
Alex Jones

72
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,191
Not

73
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:34,847
Time. Of August 12th

74
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
This is 20/20

75
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,223
Here is the part of the show where I will copy and paste

76
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,551
My lecture from the last time

77
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:53,023
Everybody that went around the couch

78
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,863
12 million

79
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:03,263
Timer

80
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
Number one

81
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,151
We're talkin about it on Mondays episode

82
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,223
Seems like it's a joke it has to maybe it was

83
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,463
Use the tiny Boulevard no right front of you that much craft involved

84
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
I feel like it's just like so

85
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,727
Goldie and not really what I feel like

86
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,775
Reduce as much to the conversation is like

87
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,335
You all love this

88
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
And I do too

89
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
It's very funny

90
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,455
The tiny bullhorn

91
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:50,111
You want to shame him for interested at the Barton Springs or the Green Bay

92
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,695
You will not shame him

93
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,375
The ultimate goal isn't going to end up being

94
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:07,263
A more productive use of people's time right now if you want to have that are getting

95
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,799
Thousands of retweets

96
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:14,431
Is making everyone aware that right now Alex is dancing around saying the covid deaths are fake

97
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,015
Something like that

98
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
That has implications

99
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,415
That is implications in terms of his life

100
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,231
Yetis dangerous

101
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,023
And

102
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:35,423
He's in the middle of a lawsuit with Sandy Hook for saying that

103
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
And all that

104
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,799
His ability to try and pretend that

105
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,359
He's learned his lesson

106
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,895
Cuz that's something he's going to have to

107
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,575
Wolfgang halbig

108
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,415
Diminishes

109
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:00,767
When you recognize

110
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,351
Without the influence of people like Jim Fetzer

111
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,959
You can do this all on his own and defend himself

112
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,031
From those sorts of things

113
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,895
It seems like honestly that's something that they could the families could add right now

114
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:23,551
To their to their deal is just really like hay as a as an other piece of evidence were tossing in this fact

115
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,879
Right now we haven't even gone to trial yet

116
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
So guess what

117
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:32,255
He's doing it now in 2020 I think

118
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,071
Showing

119
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,863
Any kind of

120
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:43,775
Remorse remorse

121
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,359
South Butler

122
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,919
It's it's

123
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
It's damning in terms of

124
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,503
Is is claims that like

125
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,159
Or whatever

126
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,463
Fault or whatever

127
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:10,399
I think that would be a more productive thing for everybody to be pushing out on social

128
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
Video that's

129
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
Exciting

130
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,783
It's a bit embarrassing

131
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,415
This is very unsatisfying but that's

132
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Maybe the

133
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,487
Tagline of our show

134
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,583
I get white

135
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,983
And I'm not mad at anybody I'm not shaming anybody for

136
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,799
Asanti bullhorn Makarov

137
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:55,967
If people really want to dress the problem we need to get a little bit smarter about these things

138
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,367
Probably don't know

139
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,023
Doesn't matter it's not going to hurt him in any way

140
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
Not listen to our show.

141
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,703
That does not mean we are one step removed for patent

142
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
We are

143
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,823
Come on man

144
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,639
Different

145
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,735
Are there two types of responses that I have to like social

146
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:34,367
Like with this I get it I understand no no no sour

147
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:39,743
On anybody better ways to go about this

148
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,535
That people should know right now

149
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:46,399
The flipside of this is the accusations about Alex burning that homeless person

150
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,423
Mattress

151
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
Mattress

152
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
That was bad

153
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,823
That is just like while you're you're giving him

154
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
You done f***** up

155
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,919
Is an unforced error

156
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,223
Is just

157
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,831
It's free promotion for in an opportunity

158
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,903
It is bright right

159
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
I think

160
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
Okay here's what we do

161
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:16,607
We we create our own Chinese firewall around Alex

162
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
Jones's entire operation

163
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,703
Any information that gets out through the rest

164
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
The world

165
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
Filtered through our prison

166
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,663
Another way to start actually tweeting things

167
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
How to resist

168
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,831
Primarily motivated

169
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,879
Attention Gathering

170
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,511
Perspective that I want people to take more seriously maybe that's something I should

171
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,607
Get over to I don't know

172
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,847
Does Alex

173
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,247
Supposed to sign up and recording the show

174
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,575
Do first mate bees want

175
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
I'm a policy wonk

176
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,303
Policy

177
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,447
Srk love

178
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,519
Is the best dog

179
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:38,783
Just wear diaper

180
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
She's fine

181
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
Text Michelle

182
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,463
Thanks Michelle

183
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
What's your name

184
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279

186
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:03,359
Appreciate that very much

187

Rico CD

188
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
You are now a technocrat

189
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,303
Heroin

190
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,143

315
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687

00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455

326
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,423
Repeatedly screwed it up

348
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,232
It was actually

349
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
Trump

350
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:27,584
4 years ago who said the wrong day of

351
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,984

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,800
Go vote for me on the wrong day

353
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,248
Okay and

354
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,784
This this episode

355
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,344
Something unintentionally hilarious have

356
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,392
I'm super glad

357
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,232
Kind of stupid does he slip on a banana

358
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,024
I feel like before the end

359
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,424
We have to see him slip on a banana peel

360
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,824
Peso de pie perhaps the flowers spiritually the equivalent

361
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,872
Banana peel

362
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,152
Not literally how

363
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,480
Courses that Trump is going to win

364
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,504
The election

365
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,904
There's going to be

366
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,488
And so Alex is picking up a narrative

367
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,816
How much fraud

368
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,376
There's about to be a giant landslide

369
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
Top professors

Kamala Harris she is absolutely reviled 1%

376
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,936

They know they're going to lose the strategy is to contested election have a woman they can claim as part black

383
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,744
Criticism harlequin

I've no idea who these top people Alex's referring to her all unanimously saying the Trump is going to win in a landslide

388
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:53,248
Satan

389
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,784
Simple look

390
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,160
2020 predictions I can't really find any reputable sources that even say the Trump is a likely winner

391
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:06,816
The Economist forecasts project is looking at an eighty-nine percent chance of Biden winning the Electoral College and a better than 98

392
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,632
8% chance he'll win the popular vote

393
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
Winning Florida

394
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:21,408
Some other predictions are closer but I can't really find anything that matches up with what Alex is saying

395
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:28,064
Now he's response to the announcement of Kamala Harris is entirely predict

396
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:34,976
She's a woman of color so is ankle is doing since that you was chosen as vice-president because now he criticized her you'll be called a race

397
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:41,888
This is super boring and is itself a racist position because it's very easy to see how Alex Wood

398
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,960
About any potential non-whites President Day

399
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,544
Cory Booker

400
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,104
Is Joyce exact same thing

401
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,152
And this works for any sort of bigotry

402
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,736
If I'm the chosen Elizabeth Warren Alex

403
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,528
You criticized

404
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,320
If you chosen people

405
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:10,304
Achieved by engaging in this kind of argumentation is to make the argument that

406
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,888
Are not on the ballot because of their qualifications

407
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
Because they earned it

408
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,448
They're just there to make

409
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,264
Criticized

410
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:24,896
There's a very passive and cowardly way of arguing the only people who look like you deserve to be in leadership

411
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,664
Positions

412
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,224
Also in a much more concrete weigh

413
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:32,064
Trying to preemptively excuse

414
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,624
He's going to be saying about calling

415
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,000
Possible to criticize her record and not be racist

416
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
For Alex to do that

417
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:47,936
Try saying that all criticisms of her be called racist

418
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
To dismiss valid complaint

419
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,752
His criticism

420
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,824
And those people in his sector are in track racing

421
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,848
Sister's house

422
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:00,224
Yeah

423
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,784
Irresponsible

424
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,832
Why do you people were criticizing

425
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,856
Harris

426
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,672
And are not being used because they're not doing

427
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:13,280
Oasis fashion

428
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,072
Sebastian if you are a race

429
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,656
Like that's one of the fundamental things they don't understand

430
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,960
The idea of somebody criticizing them

431
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:24,544
Without a racial component makes no sense to erase

432
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
It's because everything

433
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,640
Yeah you might you might be onto something

434
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:32,224
Harris is going to be the VP pick

435
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,528
The primaries

436
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,440
You can see the preparation I said

437
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
Cheer

438
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,768
That would be Kamala Harris

439
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,072
Jeff Zucker

440
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,424
Abby's house

441
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,704
Check

442
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
Course

443
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:58,848
They're just lying

444
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,872
Joe Biden

445
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,688
It's no longer om4 Wars

446
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,504
Exactly predicted

447
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,784
They were all admitting

448
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:13,696
Alex spent way more time talking about Bloomberg

449
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:20,096
Bloomberg eat something weird

450
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,168
PNP also like

451
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,104
Kamala Harris is going to be talking about Hillary was the shadow candidate Michelle Obama

452
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:38,784
Just about everything in the course of

453
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
Democratic debate

454
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,440
The primaries

455
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,768
Is top-tier of

456
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:55,168
Baby for a minute maybe maybe for a minute but that wasn't is consistently doesn't matter

457
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
Absolute

458
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,776
So now

459
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,056
NFL stupid Alex's

460
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,080
And why I like

461
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,360
Legitimately

462
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,432
If anybody takes Alex's show seriously

463
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,456
They need to wake up

464
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,392
Eclipse

465
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,720
I will find

466
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,096
We got a

467
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:27,680
Supporters and Outlaw Women on them down

468
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:31,520
Level on men destroy them in demolishing immediately

469
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
Dawn

470
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,320
Endorses actions because

471
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,904
He will feel those

472
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,976
No stone will be left Unturned

473
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
As we speak

474
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,512
Wow

475
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,792
In every corner this right now

476
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
This is a fake

477
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,752
From a satirical website called

478
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:09,152
Troll. Org reporting on it

479
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:15,808
Sure this is just embarrassing levels of sloppiness

480
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,648
But there's no chance

481
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,672
Ethereal quotes

482
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,536
Actively lying like he just doesn't care

483
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,584
How could you say those words

484
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,888
I think they were real quick

485
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,448
According to that websites about

486
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,008
Everything on this website is fiction

487
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,664
It's not a lie and it's not fake news because it's not real if you believe that it's real you should have your head

488
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,432
Examine

489
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,552
It seems that the mission of this website is to create big things

490
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Conservative

491
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,368
Particularly scared old white men

492
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,672
Will believe these lies to be true

493
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,000
After they've accepted these fake stories it's been revealed that the

494
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,280
The stories are made up

495
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
At which point

496
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,352
These trick people will feel shame

497
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:07,520
Which is what they do right this is basically laid out in there about

498
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,800
And works pretty well

499
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,848
And we see working with Alex

500
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,128
Second part is

501
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:12,896
Flawed

502
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,688
There is no shame

503
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,224
There's no recognition of getting

504
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,040
Trick the response to something like this is

505
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,344
Denial and rationalization

506
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:28,000
The intentions of this site may be good but I don't think it's a side is going to have the effect that it wants and it Mayo

507
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,560
Part of the problem

508
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:34,144
The expectation that you would feel ashamed if it was revealed

509
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,264
You believe something that was fake doesn't translate the folks who have made a habit of accepting false information

510
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,312
Based on appeals to emotion

511
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:45,664
Mates accepting false information part of their core identity

512
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,480
In this case literal truth maybe the

513
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,248
Is fake as hell

514
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
But what's more

515
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:54,112
Powerful is it it feels true to the scared old white dudes

516
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:01,536
It resonates with them and it accurately what they're afraid of it must be real

517
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:07,680
Even if you reveal that it's from an explicitly satirical site don't just say that the word themselves maybe fake

518
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,216
But the sentiment behind them

519
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,032
Alright on it

520
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:15,872
You're not actually what Harris believes they're fake

521
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,664
What yeah

522
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,944
And the worst part is

523
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,760
I kind of wish that was actually what she

524
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,064
Now you know

525
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
That would be bad

526
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:29,440
So is just an outrageous

527
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
Alex

528
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,024
So sloppy

529
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:41,472
About King George

530
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,288
Lusive Stan

531
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:53,504
It's true you would have to have

532
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,528
Tightened in either direction

533
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,576
Yeah

534
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
Of Harris

535
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,184
Something

536
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,792
Something entirely different

537
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,096
Kamala Harris

538
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
Eclipse

539
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,192
Same as she will have executive action to take your semi-autos

540
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,056
Let's look at the center

541
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,016
By gunfire and sold by Amazon

542
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:32,672
Colleges in the United States

543
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,256
Would you forgive me for divorcing before lunch

544
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,328
Somalia.

545
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:48,032
To take it exactly back

546
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,896
That clip doesn't say what Alex said that it was going

547
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,688
But she was going

548
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:57,760
Going to take executive action

549
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:01,600
Yeah they're saying that she would be in favor of

550
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,880
Executive action

551
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,416
To ban Imports

552
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,952
Semi-automatic

553
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,768
It's almost like a nationalist

554
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,584
Protectionist enough idea for Alex to be like

555
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:17,984
American-made assault rifle well

556
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,480
America

557
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,624
The

558
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,488
You're at the clipping something completely different

559
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,768
And we're not going to dress

560
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,328
So

561
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,632
It's calls on the show

562
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,424
And

563
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,472
One of these calls

564
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,496
Is the funniest

565
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,800
Thing I've heard in a really long time

566
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:56,384
Probably the audio version of a tiny bullhorn

567
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,688
It's really good

568
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,736
But it doesn't come until later

569
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:04,064
Call this guy

570
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,880
Either part of

571
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,696
Alex does not know what it is

572
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,792
Robert and Florida Robert Curran the are welcome

573
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,864
Hello sir how are you doing is an honor

574
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
Alex Jones

575
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448

Operation equal

628
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,944
So he all right

629
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,224
Paper

630
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,576
We write request

631
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,624
Representative

632
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:25,792
Give me like a letter-writing

633
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,864
Just discovered the most basic version

634
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:33,984
Let me tell you something about this change.org

635
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,288
Petition in their predicted for them to stop

636
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,312
.

637
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,736
Stealing this idea

638
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,272
Decides

639
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:51,136
Do an operation flag drop rally at the Capitol

640
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,440
Yeah I just filled everything

641
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:57,536
Country is under siege

642
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,584
Got to complain

643
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
The

644
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,888
Re-stuff

645
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,192
This nation is under siege

646
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,520
Today

647
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,312
Normalcy bias where we just

648
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
Play Danger

649
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,200
Broken broken

650
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,160
Expected to take care of

651
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,072
Landslide

652
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,192
Secede

653
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:41,056
Floyd

654
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:46,432
Do you for videos that came out

655
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,504
White people being executed just because they're white

656
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,672
Good

657
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
Don't

658
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,256
I will because we have to

659
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,632
Mom on murder of boy

660
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,288
Because he rode his bike

661
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,568
To the edge

662
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,176
Sisters

663
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,992
Father

664
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,272
Thought it was a joke

665
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,040
Sonic

666
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,088
It wasn't

667
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,136
0 coverage in the mainstream media

668
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,744
45 days ago only

669
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:40,960
Nothing I'm going to say here should be taken to imply that I think this story is anything less than a tragedy and a horrific crime

670
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:47,616
Instances like this we find ourselves in a position where we have to take the story that Alex is telling and I

671
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,384
Exaggerated or

672
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,920
Deceitful narrative

673
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:55,552
And when we push back against that it can sometimes feel like we're minimizing the reality of the underlying story

674
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,832
We're just not my intention

675
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,392
Ultimately it should never be ignored

676
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,440
That there is a child who died

677
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,232
And there is no reason but that

678
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,000
Needed to happen

679
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:09,632
There's no indication from the news that I can sign with his five-year-old child was killed because the child was white

680
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:16,288
This is Alex's editorial position

681
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
Racial motive

682
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,224
I know that Alex isn't saying

683
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,088
Explicitly that this child was executed because they were white

684
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:35,488
Heavily heavily heavily implying it's the only story that he gets to after the preface of

685
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:41,888
I have these people who were executed because there were

686
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,656
InStyle

687
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:46,240
Linguistically the link is there to make that connection

688
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:50,080
And there's nothing in the story that I can find at this point

689
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,872
That would support that reporting

690
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,943
Ikea movie for story on this says quote

691
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:01,343
No details about a possible motive for the shooting have been released WRAL the shooting wasn't Rand

692
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,879
Sessoms

693
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:05,439
The Shooter Jennings father

694
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:12,095
A neighbor said that the two men had dinner together Saturday night and that sessoms was at cannons father's home earlier

695
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,119
Sunday the day of the

696
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:13,887
Shooting

697
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,935
So there's something to this story

698
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:24,127
What has happened

699
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:28,991
The refrain of media's ignoring the story because the victim

700
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:33,343
This is a way of indirectly attempting to invalidate the stories

701
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,415
You do hear about violence perpetrated against non-white people

702
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:40,511
Would you must only be hearing about because the media's agenda to tell you those stories

703
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:46,399
Raymond history this way is a disservice to the public and further it's kind of insulting to the victim and his family

704
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,447
It's not clear what the situation

705
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:52,543
Is here

706
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,079
Seems kind of important

707
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:57,151
And in terms of what is different

708
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:00,479
Response to this

709
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:01,759
It's that

710
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,807
Good guy got arrested

711
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,879
It's a horrible murder

712
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,463
He is going to face consequences for it

713
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,511
Obviously

714
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:15,839
The ideal situation would be nobody is murdered

715
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,143
Seeing as we don't live in a perfect

716
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:18,911
The world

717
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,191
It would be good

718
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,983
If Justice was dealt

719
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,031
Appropriately

720
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,567
You have

721
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,103
Things like

722
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,407
The cases of Ahmad Arbury or Brianna Taylor

723
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:33,247
These cases are really resident for people

724
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,807
Because there is an action that's being taken

725
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,599
Against the people who committed

726
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,135
These crimes

727
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,695
Yes

728
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:45,279
And presumably you'd have a similar response

729
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:49,887
Carlos

730
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,167
Victim

731
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,215
This case with a child is horrifying

732
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,239
Because of the child

733
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,847
Require as much

734
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,151
Maybe outrage

735
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,199
From people because

736
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,247
The system is working as it's

737
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,015
Supposed to

738
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,551
The guy got arrested

739
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,623
We'll figure out what the details of the story are as

740
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,671
That information becomes available

741
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:18,559
I don't understand why that's so complicated

742
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,607
If you

743
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,167
Here's a here's what I was

744
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,191
Alright

745
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,495
If you say to me

746
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,567
That they're going to want to try and start a race war

747
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,127
Quote on the back of George Floyd

748
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,151
I'm going to swing

749
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,431
I'm going to swing

750
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:38,271
Like if we were in public and he said that out loud I would have taken the swing immediate

751
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,551
I almost took a swing

752
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,831
You

753
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,367
I feel like

754
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,135
2

755
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,159
Locked up

756
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,487
Or something

757
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,511
Because

758
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,143
Franklin

759
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:58,495
You mostly listen to it when I'm the only person within swing

760
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:04,895
Set reminder

761
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,199
Never hurt your plants by preciate that

762
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,015
My guy still very sensitive

763
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,343
Oh yeah I understand

764
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,623
That instinct

765
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,647
That that response

766
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,463
That you have to me

767
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,815
Just think it's a very tired game of misrepresenting cases

768
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,375
In order to be like the media isn't covering

769
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,447
Plenty of stories

770
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,471
Outlets

771
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,751
Going to go by call name

772
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,031
Mainstream media

773
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,335
Is there

774
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,919
4

775
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:38,687
Kill people

776
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,135
Needs to be

777
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,671
I mean not nothing

778
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,535
Social ill

779
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,559
Yeah that people

780
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,607
Galvanized around like

781
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,239
Cops shouldn't put their knees on people's necks

782
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,263
No-knock warrant

783
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:07,359
You shouldn't shoot somebody that you're chasing down because you suspect

784
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:16,319
Social issues that we can get involved with and have a conversation about the

785
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,111
Possibly lead to some good

786
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:22,207
If you want me to have a large conversation about don't

787
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,231
Shoot a child

788
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,511
Okay

789
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,047
Don't

790
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,863
Good conversation

791
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,399
We did it

792
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:35,519
Anyway I'm so grateful

793
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,079
Figure out what's really going on because at this point

794
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,127
Time I'm beyond bad faith argument

795
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,503
I'd say that's a tragedy you don't care

796
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:50,879
Let's move on

797
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,767
He's got to go fund me there

798
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,423
Given to him if he was black

799
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,263
Kamala Harris

800
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,799
What black folks shopping

801
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:14,431
Here's here's the two indications that you have

802
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:18,783
My cameraman actually donated to GoFundMe

803
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,623
A Man donated

804
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:27,743
Exactly

805
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:31,071
Knows about this there's that could give money to this GoFundMe

806
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,399
GoFundMe that I found

807
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,191
Was way over its

808
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:40,287
Obviously I think

809
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,311
Very difficult

810
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,359
Think about you

811
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,919
Trauma

812
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:50,271
There's no possibility of putting a monetary value on any of that

813
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,111
Nothing

814
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,903
Two things that I think

815
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,463
Are indicative of him not caring or one

816
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,511
He obviously didn't give any of his own money

817
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:06,143
Realizes

818
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:13,567
That's his that's his little out, I'm going to say this in a dramatic way no one will ever know

819
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:18,943
He doesn't know anybody

820
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,711
Whatever

821
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,783
Anyway I will try to pretend it is not racist

822
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:29,951
When he starts looking at like a picture of the traitor or the alleged perpetrator

823
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,231
Because he has gone to trial

824
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,071
He's just talking about how he looks

825
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:38,911
They can't even.

826
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,679
What they are

827
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:46,847
Demon problem folks not a racial problem

828
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,127
Some groups

829
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,687
Infestation

830
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,783
Are you doing

831
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,855
Very nice ass

832
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:02,463
Zoomer more susceptible to Demons

833
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,743
Look Hey listen

Humans meme

836

840
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:30,111
How do you say something

841
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:34,463
More susceptible to

842
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:39,071
Some races

843
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:45,983
I think I think you're making a very good points that I believe everybody is wonderful

844
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:49,567
The system wherein I blame demons

845
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:59,295
All the races that I think are gross and scary

846
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:04,671
It's not my fault it's just that after studying all of these heavy until

847
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:08,767
Certain shape of your cranium is acceptable

848
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,535
Demon

849
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,559

He is complaining

958
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,127
He's complaining about

959
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,919
This college

960
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,455
Kennesaw State

961
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,991
In Georgia

962
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,063
You have to get like a

963
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,879
Temperature reading band or something like that

964
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:35,743
I don't know if this is true or not but whatever that might happen

965
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,023
This is very fun

966
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,815
I'll talk about that with RJ

967
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:41,119
What do you make the New Jersey governor

968
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:43,679
The temperature

969
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:46,239
College in Georgia

970
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,479
Bigger wife

971
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,831
Dijon

972
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,367
Deanna Lorraine is here

973
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:05,695
We're flying or Austin exit tell us

974
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,047
Don't think that was that guy's wife

975
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,583
Mom

976
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,519
I'm just I go through this chronologically

977
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:24,127
The show

978
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:30,783
Yeah you get off this like really weird self-contradicting interview with Deanna Lorraine

979
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:34,111
And then someone tells me something

980
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:42,303
Used to hear that a lot on a lot of the time

981
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,095
Made more sense cuz it was like

982
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,631
Late at night

983
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,799
Is your wife

984
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,383
This guy is like a freshman in college

985
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:03,295
It's not impossible context clues

986
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:08,927
One of them is that he said he's from Georgia to ks in Georgia

987
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,951
Presumably

988
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,719
Living with

989
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:14,303
You know that's in state situation

990
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,351
Yeah

991
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,375
I don't know

992
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:19,679
Damn I can't imagine so funny

993
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:21,983
At what about

994
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,007
Let's hope

995
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:27,871
So he does get Gianna back on and have a stupid interview that I don't think it's worth

996
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,407
Listening to

997
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:32,735
So are we get to the 13th here on Thursday

998
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,039
And Alex

999
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,319
Super excited

1000
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,623
That the trending on Twitter has continued

1001
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,159
And he continues just

1002
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,439
To say that they're taking them out of con

1003
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,535
Has been number one on Twitter

1004
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,815
Most of the day

1005
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,191
Video

1006
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:57,567
10 minutes what doesn't make sense

1007
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,383
You showed up at

1008
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,431
And started

1009
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,199
Yelling

1010
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,271
Nothing wrong

1011
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:11,391
That sucks right now that sounds right

1012
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:16,511
Although innocent it is still read them because it's just

1013
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:20,095
That his wife was

1014
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,655
Yeah I mean I think I would replace random

1015
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,447
Pointless

1016
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,471
Workout

1017
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:30,335
Evolution

1018
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:31,871
Ally

1019
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,991
There was a Rockefeller record

1020
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:37,759
About

1021
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:42,623
Various situations that could come up in the world

1022
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,391
Technology

1023
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:48,767
Scenarios

1024
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:51,071
Of course the word door Ford scenarios

1025
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,607
That they laid out and try to

1026
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:55,423
Conceptualize challenges

1027
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,447
In the world

1028
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,215
Alex

1029
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:59,007
You took this

1030
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:04,383
A bunch of scenarios but in fact it's

1031
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,967
Similar in some superficial

1032
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:10,271
Cuz there's an outbreak in it and

1033
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,575
Step one

1034
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,927
First volley was ignoring

1035
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,463
The context of a document

1036
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:21,023
Second evolution of

1037
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,047
To say that it was a

1038
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:22,815
Plan

1039
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,839
Lockstep was

1040
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:29,983
The plan document

1041
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:33,055
Now there's the third evolution of it

1042
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,591
He's just making up quotes

1043
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,711
2010

1044
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:42,527
Quote under the guise of

1045
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:45,599
We will create a prison state

1046
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,903
A planetary scale

1047
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,743
He's not in there

1048
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:56,095
David ickes website

1049
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:59,679
Original content. David Icke website

1050
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:06,079
Yeah that's someone else's editorial discussion document as opposed to be

1051
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,103
Actually from it

1052
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,639
This is just made up s***

1053
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,919
This is this is

1054
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:12,735
I wish more I wish more

1055
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:15,039
Does simulations on what

1056
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,575
Could happen just included like

1057
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,879
Well obviously if this happens we're going

1058
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,903
Integrated police state

1059
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,327
This is underwhelming

1060
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:33,727
Whenever you start off by saying

1061
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,079
Where is going to be

1062
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,615
Well-known

1063
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,223
Sam Hyde

1064
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:48,831
Popover

1065
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:52,927
Do somebody who worked in comedy a bit

1066
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:57,535
Upper echelon

1067
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:00,095
You know wanted to do stand-up

1068
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:05,215
Familiarize yourself with the topic

1069
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:11,615
Certainly doing stand-up all the time you end up like I was on the festival circuit about her I went around

1070
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,663
Metal lot of comics

1071
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,943
Talk to famous people

1072
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:17,759
Someone

1073
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:22,367
By the name of Sam Hyde well let me put it to you this

1074
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:26,207
Alright it took me a good seven years before I go

1075
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:30,559
The bottom level of the food chain is where I was

1076
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:33,631
And I think I knew just about everybody there

1077
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:34,911
He wasn't even there

1078
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:42,079
Vampire along the lines of sketching prank

1079
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:48,479
His picture is used often on like 4chan

1080
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:52,831
Do you the picture of him as like fake identifying

1081
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,855
Of the shooter

1082
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,415
He's like he's like

1083
01:03:56,671 --> 01:04:02,815
Facebook looking has become a meme that used to try and trick people into thinking

1084
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,095
Scooter

1085
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,887
So awesome

1086
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:10,495
So that's how we got here

1087
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,055
We're not going to listen I just thought it was funny

1088
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:14,591
Me too

1089
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:21,503
Analysis

1090
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,783
Johnny Estrada

1091
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,807
Kamala Harris

1092
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,343
Natalia evil she is

1093
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,903
That's really exciting

1094
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:35,583
Not going to learn that from Alexander

1095
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,911
To remind you that he was the third wheel

1096
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,703
On the

1097
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,983
Tricycle

1098
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:54,527
Documentary where they tried to prove that I was married to her brother

1099
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,319
It was a real embarrassment

1100
01:04:56,575 --> 01:05:02,719
But somehow Alexander's world

1101
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,255
Move forward

1102
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,655
I mean the pictures I'm going to pitch Laura Loomer

1103
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,423
Alright

1104
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,703
Everybody knows about

1105
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,495
That's the trick

1106
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,263
You got to get up

1107
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,823
A good name you got to get some good Brandy

1108
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,175
Call yourself The Luminaries

1109
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,199
Done

1110
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,223
That's not bad

1111
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,527
1.what every election

1112
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,319
Political party

1113
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,367
Deanna Lorraine

1114
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,351
Before Sunrise

1115
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:43,167
For sunset

1116
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:49,055
A big

1117
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,847
I think he's done great work

1118
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,175
Maybe I'm a little bit itchy on

1119
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:58,271
I didn't Boyhood could have been better but I respect what he was trying to do

1120
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,063
Coffee and cigarettes

1121
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,487
Scanner Darkly

1122
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:10,559
Sounds good

1123
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:17,727
Unfortunately movies include Alex cameos

1124
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,799
Is crazy guy with bullhorn

1125
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,359
We got a

1126
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:26,175
Glitter isn't working

1127
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:26,943
Right now

1128
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:34,111
Doing anyway I don't know what the f*** is a boy

1129
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,135
Scope

1130
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:38,719
You can do it you can totally do totally do it go in there

1131
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:41,023
Director's cut only change

1132
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,327
Slader

1133
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:55,871
If You Don't Know About Us by request

1134
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:59,711
Time Alex brings up linklater I always liked

1135
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,015
To try in like it's worth

1136
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:05,855
This

1137
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:08,671
This created such an awesome mental picture

1138
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,487
Rick linklater was at my office

1139
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,607
Richtofen

1140
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,567
Did you read what he said

1141
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,615
Shut up

1142
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:30,943
Rick Blackwell

1143
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:46,047
Bringing some bangers

1144
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:50,143
Today

1145
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,471
It's not really me

1146
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,287
What is Bluff and I love it

1147
01:07:56,543 --> 01:08:02,687
Later and now he's being that you know

1148
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:09,087
Did you really into Zelda genocide

1149
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:15,487
I kind of think he's accidentally like later just accurately

1150
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:21,887
You know Alex is on this is an honest accurate representation of what happened

1151
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:22,911
Just changing the tone

1152
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,447
Because here's how it sounds to me

1153
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:27,519
He says all that s*** to linklater

1154
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,567
Yeah you know I've heard some of that stuff

1155
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,359
I'm going to have to go

1156
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:38,015
I shouldn't have kept you in my boobs leave now I thought you were a fun weirdo

1157
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,295
Now you're a dick

1158
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:43,135
So Alex is a free-speech absolutist

1159
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:52,351
Medium

1160
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,887
Alex is upset

1161
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,167
About Bill Burr

1162
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:00,287
Call sure

1163
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,223
Scary thing

1164
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,015
And when the people fairly.

1165
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:17,951
On Netflix

1166
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,487
She got into depopulation

1167
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,071
We need to depopulate the Earth

1168
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,351
I swear

1169
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:30,751
Alex complains about comedians jokes

1170
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:33,311
Use yells bad were apparently have to kill the first memory

1171
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:36,127
Make a joke about getting an abortion

1172
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,407
Alex wants her damn to

1173
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:42,527
Sahel Bill Maher jokes about basically anything and the official Democratic Party

1174
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,807
Platform reveal

1175
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,135
And now I guess Bill Burr said something Alex doesn't like

1176
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,415
I don't care

1177
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:51,487
That is a fake Thomas Jefferson

1178
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:55,583
I was going to say I already knew that

1179
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:58,911
Monticello

1180
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,679
Serious quote

1181
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:03,519
They're often attributed to Jefferson but there's no evidence he ever said or wrote that

1182
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:09,919
They concluded that this quote is actually from the 1914 debate against socialism delivered by John Basile Barnhill

1183
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:14,271
That is attached to Jefferson as well as

1184
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:16,319
Samuel Adams

1185
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,343
I would assume

1186
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:20,159
Because no one cares about.

1187
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,463
They want this to sound

1188
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:28,863
Yeah I don't

1189
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:32,959
In Baltimore is that what happened

1190
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:35,775
So then he would not like my Jordan

1191
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,311
Jordan

1192
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,639
Jordans

1193
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:44,479
You said that I've been bringing bangers you have

1194
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:50,879
Pretty good that I thought was going to be

1195
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,647
Do you like

1196
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,927
Really the most fun

1197
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:55,231
And now I'm really self-conscious about it

1198
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:57,535
This I think is incredibly funny

1199
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,167
Promote his upcoming rally

1200
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,191
And things

1201
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:04,959
Fall Apart

1202
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,775
Flag Old Glory

1203
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:08,543
Texas flag

1204
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,591
Tomorrow

1205
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,479
When I went down there this Sunday

1206
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,527
What song is this

1207
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,551
Three quarters

1208
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,855
Saturday

1209
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,159
Quarter mile hill

1210
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:30,815
Cutting a promo

1211
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:35,423
Mother doing stuff I am Tennessee

1212
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,015
For the next segment

1213
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,295
Please print me the address

1214
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,831
Because

1215
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,111
See you on the screen

1216
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,911
Sometimes

1217
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:08,703
Miles show

1218
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:13,823
Something I can't

1219
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:18,687
I'm going to get that

1220
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:23,039
And then we're just going to

1221
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:25,343
Dennis Rodman

1222
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:28,159
Also shooting promos

1223
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,255
Cuz I I just

1224
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,559
Refocus I need to get reset

1225
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:36,863
I was going to say

1226
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:37,887
I was going to do

1227
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,983
Dominic bilderberg's

1228
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:47,615
Alright

1229
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,919
I mean

1230
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:55,807
Not good at it

1231
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:56,831
You buddy

1232
01:12:57,087 --> 01:13:00,927
It seems like it

1233
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:05,279
You thought that the funny part was in couldn't remember what day you went to after the pill

1234
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:09,375
No I knew that was fun

1235
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:12,959
But that really added that snowball into something

1236
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:13,727
Real grade

1237
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,495
Yeah

1238
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:18,079
Dude just f****** recorded

1239
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:24,479
After your show is everything

1240
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:28,831
Just doing this show to record

1241
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:33,695
Yes promo

1242
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:40,095
People to come to the rally on so he can double down on the time because someone didn't give him the

1243
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:44,447
F****** address or whatever

1244
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:51,359
Wait a half-hour of his show because this because he's got to use the next segment

1245
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:57,247
Haven't you heard that old saying you got to miss two birds with one stone Dan Wild

1246
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:59,295
Having so much of the show

1247
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,063
This

1248
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,087
FA Cup

1249
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:03,647
I am talking about how everyone

1250
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:06,207
Making a contact

1251
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:09,535
And then he he

1252
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,071
Coming back from break

1253
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:14,399
And you get a different song that is really into

1254
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,935
What is the whole song

1255
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,039
Do Bonanza

1256
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:41,279
I think your chattel

1257
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:43,327
Come on you missed it

1258
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:49,471
I want to go and you with her

1259
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,007
Inoculation

1260
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:30,687
And that

1261
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:40,927
The UN world government must be number one on Twitter of the deception around

1262
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:44,511
The family

1263
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,863
Do your job

1264
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:55,263
I love her

1265
01:15:55,519 --> 01:16:01,663
But I ran out of time to get to the news karaoke version of Rawhide

1266
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:08,063
F***** up the promoter rally to do you have the address

1267
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:11,135
Alicia Alicia

1268
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:20,351
Baby that'll be next time when I do this Wonderland

1269
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:26,239
I know be somewhere tomorrow no more time for news though cuz we got to get Allie Alexander

1270
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,031
Actually I mean

1271
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,311
This this guy

1272
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,639
Who directed

1273
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:35,455
Please use the director he was at least a third wheel

1274
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:37,759
Goodnight documentary

1275
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:39,039
Ann Woll

1276
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,831
I can't stress this enough

1277
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:45,951
Amazing never be able to recover some kind of embarrassment

1278
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,279
Actually I think he's there

1279
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,303
The danger to him

1280
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:53,375
We ought to be really nervous and that's why I'm so passionate

1281
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:56,703
15 Trump needs to collapse

1282
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:58,495
The ticket on the other side

1283
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:00,287
Tell the progressives and

1284
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,055
Tell the weather

1285
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,079
The truth

1286
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:06,687
Mass incarceration war on drug

1287
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:09,247
He's corporatist on the west

1288
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,039
And we need the right and the left

1289
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:11,807
Become together

1290
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:15,903
Behind either a president Kanye West or present.

1291
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:22,303
Infinity trillion Infinity agree with you

1292
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:28,959
Xander is expressing here the real viable strategy Trump has to win

1293
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:32,799
Service which everybody

1294
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:34,591
Should be very worried.

1295
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,639
You can just turn off the mail that's good

1296
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,663
Not good

1297
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:40,991
In order for Trump to increase his share of votes

1298
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:43,807
To convince anyone

1299
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:54,047
That's the best use of effort is to focus on making sure the other side has a

1300
01:17:54,559 --> 01:18:00,703
And as Alexander various

1301
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:04,543
Progressive and further like contingents of the country

1302
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:05,567
Democrat

1303
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:09,663
Well it's a real issue that the Democratic ticket is going to have to face

1304
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:15,039
And it would be an issue with or without any

1305
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:21,695
Of course strategy that Alexander is laying out is to exacerbate those feelings of disenchantment or disappointment

1306
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:25,023
In hopes of suppressing the vote enough to put Trump over the top

1307
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:29,119
The real telling there's that he considers Kanye a serious candidate

1308
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:36,543
I've been coming out about that whole farce of a campaign is starting to look

1309
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,567
Real Shady

1310
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:41,663
And even though I know if the talk about him beating with Kushner is overblown

1311
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:45,503
You still kind of have to look at his idea of running as an attempt to f*** with the election

1312
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:52,159
Be able to get on enough State ballots to actually win soviak

1313
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,439
Redirecting some vote

1314
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:54,719
Big huge publicity

1315
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,999
Restart for Kanye on cell

1316
01:18:56,255 --> 01:19:02,399
Very smart series political commentators

1317
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,167
They're f****** idiot

1318
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,983
Which is a description of Ali Alexander

1319
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:09,311
Jacob bloomer

1320
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,359
They're either showing their cards

1321
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:13,407
They're an idiot or they're showing their cards

1322
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,943
Said they need some

1323
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,527
I do want the

1324
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:19,551
So take

1325
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:21,087
Display

1326
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:24,671
I just want the entertainment of Kanye West

1327
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,231
Like that's the only way

1328
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:30,815
Terms

1329
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:31,839
You know the

1330
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:35,679
Progressives on the left

1331
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:41,567
That is a conversation that is valid on the left

1332
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:47,455
It's not coming from the right because there is much worse

1333
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:50,527
Yeah disenchant

1334
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:51,295
With

1335
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,063
The Democratic

1336
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:52,831
The date

1337
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:55,135
Is to suppress

1338
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:57,695
The Democratic vote

1339
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:02,303
Conversations about you know Harris's record o Biden's record on the left

1340
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:08,703
I think you can have conversations about them. But if you want

1341
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:10,239
Which you can hopefully

1342
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:12,543
Who's closer to being

1343
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:14,592
In line with

1344
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:15,872
Social priority

1345
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:16,896
Things that you have

1346
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,432
And the policy priorities

1347
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:21,504
Conversation

1348
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,856
Democratic party going to have

1349
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:26,624
In this election

1350
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,440
Open Season

1351
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,720
It's not something

1352
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:37,888
No I agree with you that it's not insurmountable challenge presented from someone like Allie Alex

1353
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:43,008
Because that is solely to be disrupted

1354
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:46,592
And I think that there is a really important difference

1355
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:49,664
Between those two because sometimes they can look similar

1356
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,456
I think as

1357
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:54,272
Electric gets closer people have to

1358
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,296
Keep a pretty

1359
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,136
Good sensor keep an eye on that

1360
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:02,464
More than anything else to

1361
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:07,840
Differentiate between people who are stirring and people who are having good faith

1362
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:08,864
Conversation

1363
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,888
And that's

1364
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:12,960
That's due entirely to the Democratic party being s***

1365
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:16,544
Like I'd entirely

1366
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:17,568
That is it

1367
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:21,920
They earned those conversations and they don't seem to be doing anyting

1368
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:22,944
2

1369
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:23,712
Do otherwise

1370
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,552
So it's one of those it's one of those circumstances where

1371
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:29,088
It is very easy

1372
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:31,392
22 Jump in as a shitzu

1373
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,696
Because you can just

1374
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,720
You can walk in

1375
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:37,792
What's that expression

1376
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:41,120
Perfect is the enemy of good

1377
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,192
The expectation

1378
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:48,800
Being Framed from the right

1379
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:50,592
Is the enemy of

1380
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:53,408
Better than Trump

1381
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:57,248
I hate I hate even having conversations about this because

1382
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:59,040
I don't want to ever be a voice

1383
01:21:59,296 --> 01:21:59,808
It's saying

1384
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,600
Like hey if you have

1385
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:08,000
Concerns about XYZ

1386
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,024
Don't agree with.

1387
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,072
At the same time I think that

1388
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:12,096
Realistically

1389
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:14,912
There are only two possible winners

1390
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:16,192
The next election

1391
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,008
And one of them is nightmarish

1392
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,056
And the other is

1393
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:23,872
Not as good as we want

1394
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:26,432
Ideally and hopefully

1395
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:28,224
Someone who'll be receptive

1396
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:28,992
2

1397
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,088
Protest

1398
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,672
It's complicated

1399
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:39,488
I don't know

1400
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,792
About the

1401
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:42,560
You know

1402
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:44,864
Repeat very difficult to differentiate

1403
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,144
Petit pot stirrer

1404
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:50,496
And people who are making good arguments

1405
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:55,616
Say okay are you somebody who is stirring

1406
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:56,896
Totally

1407
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,664
Completely diss

1408
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,200
Discount

1409
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:01,248
Argument

1410
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:03,808
Like if Mike cernovich has something

1411
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,856
To say about the Democratic ticket

1412
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:09,952
It's not coming from a place of concern

1413
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:11,744
About keeping people on it

1414
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,072
I'm trying to sew problems

1415
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:17,376
And you know it

1416
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,656
Vain

1417
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:25,568
Alexander somebody who maybe you don't know who that guy is

1418
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,688
Socks the White House all the time

1419
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:35,040
There's one thing that's missing

1420
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:38,112
Alexander

1421
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:40,160
I'm not talking about the documentary

1422
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:44,512
It turns out that Alexander didn't always go by that name

1423
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:46,816
He was formerly known as Ali Akbar

1424
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:50,400
According to an investigation conducted by Breitbart on cover

1425
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:55,264
Hollywood Court convicted in 2007 of charges of credit card fraud

1426
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:58,848
$20,000

1427
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:03,712
Send

1428
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:07,296
Where he began to blog

1429
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:08,576
Get off the phone

1430
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:14,464
He started an organization called license Victory group called The National bloggers

1431
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,232
Club

1432
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:21,632
According to a 2012 article in Yahoo news the national bloggers Club was started with seed money provided by right-wing

1433
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:25,728
Foster Freeze

1434
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:32,384
According to an article in the examiner from July 2012 National

1435
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:38,784
501 c 3 status until this organization

1436
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,344
Such status

1437
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,648
Somebody to spec look

1438
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,184
Super Shady

1439
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,792
Hollywood be associated with

1440
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,840
Egyptians claiming tax-exempt status

1441
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:54,400
He was associated with the American Liberty Alliance

1442
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:57,216
Who does a tea party website back 2008

1443
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:00,800
Here's a little bit from an article about this in Crooks and Liars

1444
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,128
Starting off as a LA's technology

1445
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:10,528
Consultant

1446
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:11,296
Donations

1447
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:16,672
Yes despite claiming to be in the application process for 501 C 4 status

1448
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:18,464
In August 2000

1449
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:23,328
Yahweh eventually was embarrassed into posting the following caveat on their website

1450
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:25,120
Do not On Their donation

1451
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:32,032
American Liberty Alliance is not a 501 c 3 501 C 4 or political action committee

1452
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:35,872
We are not registered as a non-profit and we do not respond to such

1453
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:42,528
Yet they'll Incorporated under the name American Liberty Alliance a nonprofit corporation

1454
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:45,344
Name

1455
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:49,696
Circles of tea-party groups

1456
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,816
Trump

1457
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,960
Maybe he advises got from Robert Mercer

1458
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:02,240
Brandy run up to D20

1459
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:03,264
16 election

1460
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:07,104
Also getting tons of money from the Mercers around this time was Milo yiannopoulos

1461
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:10,176
Probably would still be on that scroll is Buzzfeed having

1462
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:13,504
Indisposed

1463
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,296
And that whole thing about his

1464
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,832
Distasteful appearance on Joe Rogan

1465
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:17,600
Star cast

1466
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:24,256
My point is that I don't see much substance being a convicted felon whose crime involved

1467
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,024
Defraud

1468
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,352
Whose career

1469
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,888
Republican political circles

1470
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:35,776
Which seems exceedingly easy what are you just going to not look I feel like once you get

1471
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:41,152
If you join the Republican party at a certain level of Fame

1472
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,432
You know like

1473
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:48,832
If you're if you're there if you do not grow manufacturing some kind of purse

1474
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:51,904
Section of bars people will fall for it

1475
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,440
Teach the graph I think

1476
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,464
I think that

1477
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,512
That seems to be

1478
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:59,072
What the picture I've been able to gather

1479
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:02,400
No I mean like if you're at is if you exist

1480
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,936
In a place where like

1481
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:10,592
You can hang out with Laura Loomer Jacob Wohl and Alex Jones and you don't worry about shooting your credibility of the foot

1482
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:12,896
Credibility

1483
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:16,480
Is not irrelevant concern for you

1484
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:17,760
The bullet that

1485
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:21,088
I'm a straight white male with a

1486
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:22,368
Spell comedy

1487
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,696
Nutella

1488
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:27,744
After dark or whatever when you break

1489
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,376
I should be grifting right now

1490
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:36,448
Terrible idea

1491
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:41,056
Continue some conspiracies here

1492
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:44,640
Coherent nonsense

1493
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:48,992
I was trying to make sense of it in the context that he was providing

1494
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:49,760
And I just

1495
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:51,040
This is just

1496
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,064
Lunacy

1497
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:54,880
I got to tell you you just can't help

1498
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,440
Reconcile political Theory with the Bible

1499
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:59,232
And come to these conclusions

1500
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:03,584
Oh my gosh you know it really is a deep State oh my gosh

1501
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:04,864
Clinton's

1502
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,936
And the bushes have a relationship

1503
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:10,752
Oh my gosh

1504
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,568
Missing what is it

1505
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:14,592
Oh my gosh

1506
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:17,152
When Biden look like he was going to pick

1507
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,944
Witmer equipment

1508
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,736
The BLM Ryan starter

1509
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:24,320
Biden and Kamala Harris

1510
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,344
I got to tell you

1511
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,648
It's not it's not lunacy

1512
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,672
The point owl

1513
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:31,744
Looks inevitable unless

1514
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,768
We wake up

1515
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:35,328
People

1516
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,120
Do not be reactionary

1517
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,912
Do not just save the oil

1518
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:40,192
Opposite of a

1519
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:44,288
Believe in something believe in order align yourself with God

1520
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,568
And then fight

1521
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,592
Because

1522
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:49,920
People need to understand

1523
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,712
Is it the Marxist

1524
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,528
It's a spiritual thing for them

1525
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,552
What

1526
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:59,904
I sincerely don't really even understand

1527
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:00,672
What

1528
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:01,952
The goal or

1529
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:02,976
Queen of that was

1530
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:07,328
I mean

1531
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,864
Conspiracies about stop

1532
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:15,264
I guess the only thing that I can pull from the Bible that you might be talking about is

1533
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,312
Obviously revelation

1534
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:23,968
Right it has to be before it has to be

1535
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:27,296
Christianity

1536
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:28,576
Almost all revelation

1537
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:31,136
They just don't understand that

1538
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:33,696
Book of Revelation wasn't optional

1539
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:38,816
You know like at no point in time was God in the Book of Revelation just been like

1540
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:45,216
But if you guys work really hard to avoid this huh we're going to do it

1541
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:48,288
Revelation right now

1542
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,080
Wake people up

1543
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:53,152
Need to worry about that hole

1544
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,968
I guess that is an inherent

1545
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:56,736
Said I weird

1546
01:29:56,992 --> 01:30:01,600
I don't understand I don't understand the point that he's trying to make outside

1547
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:05,440
Across which is all these people are evil

1548
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:07,744
Something to do with the Bible

1549
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,048
Wright's dearest Dearest

1550
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:14,144
Fritos this religious zealotry that's underlying is politics

1551
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,168
Clearly

1552
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:15,936
Which

1553
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,216
I think

1554
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,496
Is bad

1555
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:22,592
Your religion involves saying don't look into it

1556
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:23,616
I'm not cool

1557
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:26,432
Well

1558
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,040
Witches

1559
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:35,392
We must ask for God's intervention we must walk blindly and faith

1560
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:38,976
You said you wanted to wake people up

1561
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:45,376
Think about this

1562
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,912
Keeping in this from

1563
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,496
Have we ever seen this many

1564
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:52,288
Witch covens

1565
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:57,920
Trey and cursing hexa gether no never seen

1566
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:02,528
Sacrifices

1567
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:08,672
You people are

1568
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:09,696
Streaming

1569
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:14,816
All these goddamn boys

1570
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:27,104
Secret blood rituals might be close to the bloodline

1571
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:31,712
It's definitely not lunacy specifically suggest

1572
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:32,480
Oven

1573
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:34,016
Generally speaking

1574
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:36,320
Go to the forest under the full moon

1575
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:38,624
And I drink blood

1576
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,184
Play that's a definition

1577
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:46,304
Also Ali says that he's been in this for 13 years which would be what to 2,000

1578
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,584
3

1579
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,008
Credit card fraud

1580
01:31:57,056 --> 01:32:01,408
Is the last year and people are just

1581
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,456
Like it is

1582
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:04,736
Wework soda

1583
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:06,528
Sensitizer this

1584
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:09,088
Just in a vacuum you be like this

1585
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:10,368
Sensational

1586
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,928
Outrageous political beliefs

1587
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,304
Maybe yeah

1588
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:24,960
Political beliefs

1589
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:27,264
Designs

1590
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,032
With

1591
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:31,616
Our enemies are witches again jewels in the forest

1592
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:35,200
We must call on God to Vanquish them

1593
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:46,464
To take someone at

1594
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:50,304
Ready

1595
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,328
Eminem

1596
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,376
Infiltrated even the good

1597
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:55,168
Create

1598
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:55,936
A contract

1599
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:57,472
But that they must infiltrate us

1600
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:01,056
Write in order to deceive our believers

1601
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,944
Almost

1602
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,552
Thank you so much

1603
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:13,088
Very impressed

1604
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,160
I was not you say something like

1605
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:18,976
Have you ever seen this many witch covens around

1606
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:20,512
And then somebody's like

1607
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:23,328
Hey listen we got to have you back on to talk about the election

1608
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:24,096
Listen

1609
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:26,144
Those are some political opinions I want to

1610
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:38,432
You kind of got out of pocket and I don't want to talk

1611
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:42,528
We got over that just got embarrassing

1612
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,064
I do I want

1613
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:49,440
You fill that hole

1614
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:55,328
1 800 wish I would have got

1615
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:58,656
Wish I would have got that number

1616
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:03,520
This was a bit more humorous than I expected

1617
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:09,408
And there has been a little bit of stagnation with Alex

1618
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:12,224
But I want

1619
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:16,320
And let them know that we have present day stuff

1620
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,600
But we have some

1621
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:18,368
Some plans

1622
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:20,416

So excited

1628
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:34,752
