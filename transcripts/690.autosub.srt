1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important I sweat it

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for this knowledge B

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,560
Alex

6
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,568
My rights Jordan is actually there's good become a little bit of an issue with the

7
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
Dreamy creamy summer summer as we all know is the. Of time to 420 + 9

8
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,528
911

9
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:34,720
Famous famous leaders

10
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,000
But there's an issue

11
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,536
What's up

12
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:43,936
Well Nightmare on Elm Street issue with the dreamy creamy part child

13
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:47,520
No

14
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,056
That is not the problem right

15
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,080
The problem is revoked

16
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,104
A lot of the cremate

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,992
Because I got the ice cream ice cream going in than others but

18
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,552
I feel like the dreaming it has not been

19
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,832
Like fully

20
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
Accounted

21
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,648
So you can start reading the Sandman,

22
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,416
I'm not

23
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
I'm not going to do that okay

24
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
Guy that sounds like a

25
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,256
Schedule

26
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,376
I'm going to get a bunch more

27
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
Clothes

28
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:18,752
I am not alright I'm going to get myself looking dreamy

29
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
Okay

30
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:23,104
I have spent no time on

31
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
In your life

32
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,432
Ever ever not what I have had a car

33
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
Constant

34
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
Aversion

35
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
The clothes shop

36
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,064
And I think a large portion of it has to do with like growing up weed go to

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,624
Target to get clothes and wear

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,672
Felt a little bud

39
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,464
Hassle of like

40
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
Trying stuff on to be rushed by my parents and

41
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,376
Didn't want to buy name brands at the make fun of my pants right

42
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,400
I think

43
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
I had

44
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,216
The beginning of the week

45
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,520
Week let's say

46
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
Other than like a teacher

47
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:59,712
Shirts that I could wear

48
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,504
I like this is no good

49
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,576
And so I have

50
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:10,976
From where one of the new shirts here I was I wasn't going to say Dan is that a new shirt I should have sought my floor

51
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,000
Floral print

52
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:17,120
Pseudo Hawaiian shirt but I don't get to say stuff like that because I'm famously the most

53
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:23,520
An observational person that famously famously

54
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:29,920
Is that a new shirt and everybody's like I've worn this to your wedding and it's like okay well you're right that's a good point yeah

55
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
This is one of the new ones

56
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,016
It looks great thank you we're going to see

57
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,296
See how Gary should get

58
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
How garesche

59
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,904
What's your garishness

60
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,232
Level I'm interested to find out what you believe gerrish

61
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:49,632
Old buddy Nikki gift

62
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:54,752
Could give you some insight

63
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
We didn't really become friends

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,128
Central High School junior high together

65
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,432
And so you could tell you some stories

66
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,272
Days where I would wear shiny shirts

67
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
There was one

68
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,856
Or just a fluorescent

69
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
Snot fluorescent

70
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:16,256
They're the kind of things that with the light would catch stuff on it

71
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,327
One of them was

72
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,607
Flaming dice

73
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
Headwear that the school that's a garish wow wow I will not be going that far as to descend

74
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,895
Is that when I think of you in junior high

75
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
I think of a slight

76
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
A smaller version of you wearing

77
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,623
Dice on your shirt and that is almost exactly what you looks like in junior high it's a smaller

78
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,903
Version of you so

79
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:50,047
Yeah you would already started to grow that beard in junior high it's true

80
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,607
But yeah just

81
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,679
Weather

82
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
Saturday

83
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:02,847
We'll see we'll see where the road goes

84
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,431
This is a turn that I'm not in my wildest dreams

85
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,759
I think a lot of people when they hear there's an issue with dream creamy summer

86
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
Play some iPad

87
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:18,207
No it is just adding a new wrinkle

88
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:24,607
My bright spot Dan is you know what I'm going to go ahead and say that it is

89
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:31,007
Your parents are behind the bastards this week and Sophie for having us

90
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:36,639
Enjoyable is nice to have that come out finally I just while ago

91
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663

93
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,463
Yeah I've not had a chance to listen to the second episode

94
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,535
But we recorded a tiny little bit of a disclaimer

95
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,631
Because we recorded that at different time

96
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,447
It was in April when he recorded it and like

97
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,983
Like we were

98
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
Like app

99
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:09,151
Trials coming along the whole episode supposed to be about what's going on in Alex's

100
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,687
Update to the up

101
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,551
Longer than the update I felt very

102
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:21,951
Self-conscious about that but I'm glad that it's turned out well

103
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,535
Remember outside of our sphere that most people have no idea that

104
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
Is going on

105
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
So is there any

106
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,631
Yeah yeah for sure

107
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:36,287

109
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639

Through the Uvalde shooting coverage

We now know that

187
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
We have been lied to

188
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Zedge

189
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,303
Women forcing their way through police lines to go get their children

190
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
Total disaster

191
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:21,471
So first quickpoint Alex is absolutely not been judicious in his coverage of the shooting

192
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,543
Do you want people to give him a trophy for not saying it was fake

193
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,615
Because he really wanted to and he resisted for a few days

194
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,783
Say no trophy to that that is that is very transparent and likes

195
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,111
Wondercide

196
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
Judaism

197
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:42,719
In reality you've been wrong on a plethora of different things

198
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
Different directions

199
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
He's been wrong in a lot of ways already

200
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:52,191
I suspect that he doesn't even realize how much of his narrative has changed since Monday and how each time it changed it was because something

201
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,495
He made up or misreported fell apart

202
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,847
But it's true that the official story around the shooting was definitely collapse

203
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
And at this point on

204
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
On the 27th

205
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,223
But it's important to keep a close eye on Whose official story

206
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,783
Alex is going to take game at and who he's going to blame

207
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
Right right

208
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,623
They're two big points at Alex touches on here about the

209
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,671
The story so I wanted to get to them one at a time

210
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,231
The first is about police for knowledge

211
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:19,071
Alex insists that the police or the FBI always knows about the

212
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
The shooters ahead of time and let's

213
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
The shootings happened

214
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,983
So it's no surprise for him say that about this one it connected to all the other ones

215
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
That he's made up in the past

216
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,359
For instance just recently Alex misreported that the Buffalo shooter

217
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,151
Been red-flagged by the FBI but that's

218
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,199
That's not something you could demonstrate at all

219
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
But it's been accepted as truth

220
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:41,087
Within the infos world because I was his repeated enough

221
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,439
In this case Alice is operating on an interesting space where it's

222
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,999
Easy to see the Optics I'm just assume that he's right

223
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
Do Uvalde School

224
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,863
When using the social media tool called social Sentinel

225
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,911
Which is meant to scour social media

226
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
And identify threats

227
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
The teachers or schools

228
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
Based on this

229
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
Detail Alex

230
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:04,895
Is making a leaf that a lot of people made which is that this software must have found Ramos

231
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,943
And no nobody's threatening

232
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,503
Hence providing for knowledge of the shooting

233
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,111
That that is ignored people left to that I think

234
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
That's amazing

235
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,927
CU lot of people leave it better

236
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
The conclusion on Twitter

237
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,535
Amazing maybe not the people who

238
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,559
Like I would

239
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:28,447
I wouldn't give that to like the media saying that

240
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,055
No that's amazing because the moment I found out about that I was like

241
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,615
Oh obviously that doesn't work

242
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:42,271
Well I mean I don't know if anything good more obviously a bit of scam well it may or may not be

243
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:46,879
I don't know enough about the software to say but I do know

244
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,903
Why

245
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,951
It did it wouldn't have worked in this case

246
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:56,607
And that is only works on their threats made to the school or they're made publicly by people associated with

247
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
The school

248
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,215
DP Golbat who is the CEO of social Sentinel

249
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
Company

250
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
Publication

251
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:09,407
Recode quote we are not currently aware of any specific links connecting the gunman to the Uvalde

252
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,687
Consolidated independent

253
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,783
School District or Raab Elementary on any public social media sites

254
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:19,903
Ramos was somebody who you could identify the danger online

255
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,719
But this software wouldn't notice because it's not

256
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,767
Designed to just flag every sketchy

257
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
Turn around

258
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,887
The threat that Ramos had made to shoot up a school was done in a private message

259
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
To a wooden

260
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
Anti-vax it

261
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,983
Of course there were plenty of Warren

262
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
Zion's online for in

263
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
Census

264
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
Threatening women concert

265
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
Delete

266
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,871
That's not what Alex is talking about

267
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,223
He's talking about direct for knowledge on the part of the authorities which is not established

268
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,295
Just another one that'll go on the pile of things that

269
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Repeat

270
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
Yep

271
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,951
The second Point Alex brings up is that the police went in to get their children will not allow others

272
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
To do the same

273
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,815
I'm not sure exactly what Alex was referring to her or if he has any

274
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,583
Specifics

275
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,399
But the person who did go in and get their kids

276
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
We Gomez

277
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,959
Who

278
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,775
Does mention as the woman who forced her way past

279
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
Wait right

280
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:14,943
Is a totally f*****-up situation as the police had cost her for being uncooperative and then let her lose it

281
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
Which one's your rain

282
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
Into the school

283
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
It's just horrifying

284
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,599
To imagine being left with no other viable option

285
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,903
Haven't been more less abandoned by the people who are

286
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Mental Health

287
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
Just terrified

288
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:32,351
Her kids were into different classrooms and neither of which were the two classrooms which Ramos was holed up in

289
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,399
Doesn't make anything any different

290
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:43,359
There were rumors going around social media that police went in to get their kids but there is nothing really solid evidence

291
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,175
Miss recorded details

292
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:50,783
For instance there was a border patrol officer who aided in the evacuation of students

293
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,599
Whose daughter was hiding in the bathroom in the school

294
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:59,487
So obviously he hoped to get his child out but that was part of the larger goal of getting out as many kids

295
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:04,351
If possible there's some miscommunication surround stuff like that right that I

296
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
Leave being

297
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,911
Extrapolated further

298
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,727
At least with the information they know now

299
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:15,103
Yeah I know I mean I heard that the cops went in and got their kids but I found it

300
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,151
Just at least a little bit like

301
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
I'm going to need

302
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,479
Evidence of that before

303
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
2

304
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
That's too good

305
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,087
That is one of those Rogan moments where you go

306
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,623
That's too on the nose

307
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Right maybe

308
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
Take a step back

309
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
From that one

310
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
It's um

311
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,511
Understand

312
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
The kernel of that

313
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,095
Basically the Snopes

314
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
Article

315
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,399
Let's say

316
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:45,055
Traces that to a Shaun King tweet that you

317
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:49,663
From a local news person interviewing a police representative

318
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
And they said

319
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,015
That the police were trying to get their kids out

320
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
Sure

321
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,087
And that could refer to things

322
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,111
Like

323
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Parents

324
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,463
Who happened to be police who were helping with the evacuation

325
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,535
Not necessarily like I'm going solo on the

326
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,839
Like

327
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
Like Miss Gomez

328
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,215
FYI I kind of didn't buy it

329
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:13,983
Is because

330
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,823
I don't think any of the cops have the courage that this woman

331
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
So there are some

332
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,967
Some details that Alex has that are a bit off

333
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
12

334
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,319
Minutes out

335
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
Body armor

336
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
But I mean

337
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
Umami

338
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,495
The police

339
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,799
Program to wait for orders

340
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,359
That more and more you see this time

341
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Crap

342
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,175
This is definitely not accurate

343
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,247
But there's no reason for Alex to know that on the 27

344
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:04,159
There was a Wall Street Journal article with the headline quote Uvalde shooter fired outside school for 12 minutes before

345
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
For entering

346
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,255
Ramos Center Beast

347
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,303
The school at 11:28 a.m.

348
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,655
And on May 26th the Texas Department of Public Safety

349
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,983
Had claimed that he entered the school itself at 11:40

350
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,567
A more detailed timeline was presented the next day with the

351
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
The time Android

352
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,615
The school being 11:30

353
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
30k

354
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,199
Details will come out the letter x

355
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,527
Seems accurate but by the time out to officially announce

356
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,575
Information would lead someone to think

357
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,879
But he was outside the school shooting for 12

358
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
Right

359
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,999
That's embellishing the detail the police were in a 12-minute shootout with Rama

360
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,351
Part isn't backed up by the inaccurate reporting that he's operating off of

361
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
But the

362
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,191
The basis of this you can kind of understand

363
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,471
Where his mistake is

364
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
You know

365
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,335
That would be a very simple thing to follow up on

366
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
Cops have turkey

367
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
Keep track of how many guns

368
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
How many bullets

369
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,759
That is true so if there was a shootout we would know almost immediate

370
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,599
Do you know based on

371
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,927
Surveillance information and stuff like that

372
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,743
Something that is not super difficult

373
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:16,607
It was inaccurate as of the 26

374
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,167
The 27th is when that

375
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,959
Colonel from the Texas

376
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
Department Public Safety

377
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
I gave

378
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,799
The press conference

379
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,359
That laid out a lot more of the information

380
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,943
And that has not happened as Alex's beginning

381
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,711
The show

382
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
So

383
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,015
That's what I'm trying to be

384
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:40,671
Is overly Fair we decided to throw that out episode

385
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,975
Zion giving inside info

386
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,255
You know what are going to

387
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,303
I've been accused many times and will

388
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
Again of being

389
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
To Fair

390
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,375
Are too generous

391
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,935
What's the point if you do

392
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,263
Anyway Alex doesn't think this is a false flag

393
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
Good

394
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,103
Sort of you has changed his mind.

395
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:21,887
Telephone number of Stand Down possibilities

396
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,191
Study apps

397
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,215
Consistently sentence

398
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,495
Monday's labs

399
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
There's not a thing

400
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
First

401
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:35,199
Hero cop who went in and took care of business right away

402
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,991
I love that didn't work out

403
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,551
Until you had it was a hostage

404
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
Situation

405
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
So there's not

406
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,927
There's not a stand down until now

407
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:55,167
Cuz I didn't get it before because I like believes that they do not have the social media monitoring they would have known

408
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,703
Amanda

409
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
Further

410
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,799
Alameda to sand down which

411
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,359
He doesn't he doesn't go too hard on but he does

412
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,151
Touch on a couple times in this episode

413
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:09,503
And that is the bit of information about a school shooting being threatened

414
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:15,903
Years ago in Uvalde

415
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:23,072
Yeah well actually I had already by this point and said it is not

416
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,448
Alex is using the sort of image of that

417
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:34,848
Opportunity to know about this band share the social media they refuse to do something

418
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,944
There was a standout who is he

419
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,480
I mean how is it

420
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:44,832
That he's straddling the line between incompetence and pre-plan

421
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,368
You know like

422
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,672
If they know about him in advance

423
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,208
If they

424
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,488
Where is there

425
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,024
And didn't stop

426
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
And then

427
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,888
Continued until he is murdered a bunch of people

428
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,704
Then that can't be anything other than consent

429
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:01,984
Right

430
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,776
Are the cops

431
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
Incompetent

432
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:09,664
I think incompetents might be where he lands but sir like a benevolent

433
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,200
Incompetent

434
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,992
Hey this is this

435
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,320
Wil Wheaton

436
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:20,672
Seems to be a bit where he lands as we go through this episode

437
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:24,256
Straight to your question like from a like a normal per

438
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,280
Perspectives

439
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,328
Difficult to understand how it

440
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,352
That would not be

441
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,632
Complicity

442
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,192
If you believe the things that Alex is saying

443
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:36,288
And that's usually gets around that

444
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,616
Is that

445
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,384
The feds

446
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,688
Are the ones who are who know

447
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:49,088
Where is the local folk right oh no

448
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,624
Is the higher-ups

449
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,024
Trying to protect them from getting and also the do stop that

450
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,072
Lower down and local Folk

451
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
Not to act

452
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,168
When they would act normally because the higher-ups

453
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,216
Sure and they're the feds are

454
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
Protecting these

455
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:13,152
Asset drone killers they have

456
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,712
The point the finger and be mad at somebody

457
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,272
In the form of the feds brightness

458
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,808
I am and not being like

459
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,624
All cops are malevolent

460
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,672
Alex could be like they've been

461
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,256
They've been so conditioned to Stand Down by the

462
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,816
The feds over and over and over again letting these

463
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
These things happen

464
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,752
It's basically Alex's fault

465
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
Interesting

466
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:44,128
I'm not following your total train of logic

467
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,176
Hey man

468
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,224
Look we can't dwell too long on this because

469
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,552
The nuge is going to be on later I'll leave that

470
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,320
Again

471
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,600
So much Nugent

472
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:59,744
Man discussion about

473
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,656
Board member

474
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,496
Odyssey icon of American freedom

475
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
Reminding me

476
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,176
Psychologist and psychiatrist

477
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
You were going to do it

478
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,504
Police who they were going to do it at

479
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,040
Show me times

480
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,320
It turns out there are

481
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,928
Globalist left disconnected groups that are

482
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,488
You know that's going on

483
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,632
Buffalo News Fox News

484
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,520
Buffalo mass shooting

485
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,592
Digitally

486
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
Online

487
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,664
And the reports are

488
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,928
Talking to the eighteen-year-old.

489
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
Autistic

490
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,840
Vine on top of it

491
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,520
There's a real a real easy answer what is this

492
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,568
Retired federal agent

493
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,848
Braces kid

494
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,616
Is a racist

495
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:28,064
That's the important detail that Alex seems to be missing

496
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,136
The things I say

497
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:34,464
Tired to his capacity as a federal agent

498
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,584
Wasn't investigating this get use engaging in racist forum

499
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,888
Yeah uncle

500
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:45,216
Former federal agent but you wouldn't say that you was acting in an official

501
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,752
Is going to like

502
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,776
Wolfgang halbig

503
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,336
Big seminars and helping enforce braid Sandy Hook in

504
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,152
When did at the same Dynamic here

505
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:59,808
According to law enforcement sources a racist retired federal agent was an individual who interacted with the shooter online

506
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
Sharing racist s***

507
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,744
Allegedly he became one of the people who was given access to the shooter's plans and Target 30 minutes prior to the

508
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:11,584
But even according to the reporting on this in the Buffalo News

509
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
The news

510
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,168
Determine if the retired agent

511
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,448
Accepted the invitation

512
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,312
There was a racist retired agent who was invited to know about the shooting at Advance

513
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
But there's no proof yet

514
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,872
But he accepted the invitation

515
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,432
So he might not even known in advance

516
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
Simself chair

517
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:33,856
Basically the solid details we have here so far revolve around the existence of a retired federal agent

518
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,904
Hang out on racist websites a whole lot

519
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:40,512
That's f***** up but it doesn't really prove for knowledge on the part of the authorities before the shooting

520
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,560
Which Alex is trying to use this

521
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,096
To bolster credibility

522
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:48,960
Before I like what is that I would love for him to give these examples of

523
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,264
Of psychiatrist and psychologist or

524
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,568
Leftist globalist groups having

525
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,848
The foreknowledge

526
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,872
Prodding cuz

527
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,408
I don't think

528
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:01,248
Most cases stand up to that I mean I don't even know

529
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
So

530
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,576
But how does that relate

531
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,880
To what's going on here is the

532
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,160
I mean I know it's

533
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,976
I guess parallel but like

534
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,280
Why are you throwing that into this

535
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,560
For the Valdese

536
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,328
Situation

537
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,144
Because he's trying to say that

538
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,192
There was this

539
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
Fluent

540
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,544
I like the FBI was basically

541
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,592
The federal agent let's assume FBI

542
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,408
Plant who was

543
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,968
Encouraging this guy to do the shooting use coaxing

544
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:38,368
Robbie half of the FED globalist mean that there is somebody in the background we having

545
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,160
Undiscovered in Uvalde case

546
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,952
That's the vehicle

547
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:46,560
But again that comes down to eventually like they were in on it right

548
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,632
Like sooner or later you all get back to

549
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
They were in on it

550
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,448
Whoever they may be

551
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,752
You know in this kind of situation right

552
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
I think

553
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:59,360
One of the things that we need to maybe do a better job of

554
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,384
Is

555
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,688
Understanding that yes that is always

556
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:09,600
And when my bad my bad I was getting to into the tens place of keys

557
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:13,440
This isn't a false flag so we have to treat it like he's saying that but it honesty

558
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,720
Steven saying it's false

559
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
To write

560
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,888
Right and eventually when there's enough pieces of information for him

561
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,912
To craft that

562
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,960
He will

563
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:29,056
Pivoting towards that on this app

564
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
Episode more the

565
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,592
Then you have

566
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,664
In the episode asking you these questions is because

567
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,272
It does seem like The Logical endpoint of everything you saying is that this was either or

568
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,064
Castrated by the feds or it was fake

569
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,088
Yeah

570
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:41,856
It's so

571
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:47,744
Yeah he was like if something gets

572
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,792
Attention from the media then

573
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,816
It's not real

574
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,096
Because

575
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:55,424
Yeah you don't give media coverage to real terrorize

576
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,984
Brightright inspires more terrorism

577
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,432
If they are covering something and paying attention to it

578
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,224
That it must either be fake

579
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,504
Or they

580
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,296
Made it happen through

581
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,088
Once

582
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,392
Again there they're all in on it

583
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,672
Everyone

584
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,464
But Alex

585
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,024
And the good cops on the ground

586
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,816
Another narcissistic about that

587
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,400
So Alex says this is District

588
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,192
This just hit me wrong

589
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,360
Roses of Texas school shooting Memorial

590
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,128
What am I

591
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
Opportunistic pay

592
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
Okay

593
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,712
Wow

594
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,992
Seems

595
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,528
Probably because

596
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,808
She's the Royal Family

597
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,112
It's cuz he doesn't like the royal family specific

598
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,392
That's a sure it's

599
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:52,256
Royalty that is his main issue he doesn't like the royalty but I

600
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:58,656
Victor little seem a little

601
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
I think that

602
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,448
I don't know

603
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,472
I didn't follow

604
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,240
Megan

605
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,776
Adventure 2

606
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,312
Too closely

607
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,848
From what I was looking at

608
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,640
It seemed like she was trying to keep it real low-key

609
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:12,736
Volunteer for a day

610
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:17,088
The fact that I had no idea about it kind of says good things about that

611
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:23,488
You know what I think I think that Alex's wife

612
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:27,072
Tennis partner is just really interested

613
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,888
He's annoyed by suits

614
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:33,728
Yeah I could be a dozen

615
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,288
If that's just a dick thing to say for no

616
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
Yeah

617
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,360
So and then I hate royalty

618
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,384
So we're there

619
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
Sure

620
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:47,552
Well are they technically royalty anymore I think they accept

621
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:52,416
Alex isn't even on the houses on the side of royalty you shiting all over Mega

622
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,440
So there's that

623
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,256
So yeah that's true he's back he's back to the wall

624
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,352
Maybe I'll just wants more seasons of Suits could be

625
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,912
Maybe it goes back to suit maybe the tennis partners

626
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,264
One of the big points

627
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,360
Let's being spread is that the police didn't go in because they were afraid

628
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
Need to get shot

629
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,528
And Silas talked about this and honestly I feel like this is one of the few instances where his anger feels real

630
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,088
Yeah there's a difference

631
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,392
Police what's in it

632
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,184
Chaz cops

633
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,048
This is what truly disgusting

634
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,912
Police spokesperson

635
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,192
Makes

636
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,728
True

637
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,152
So you're scared to get shot

638
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,136
Vermont

639
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,608
When there's children

640
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,192
You are sworn to protect

641
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,800
D2 you have a duty as a man

642
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,824
Go in there

643
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Surprise

644
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,296
Almost on the building

645
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,064
Didn't

646
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,368
And I'm glad they didn't

647
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,904
This is going too far

648
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:56,320
Come back with all of it in the end of Stand Down video

649
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:04,256
I think I was just constantly full of s*** so I never really want to scribes and Siri

650
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,048
But that kind of felt

651
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,096
A little realer than other times he's

652
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,656
The album I mean the real lesson of that

653
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,680
Is just

654
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,960
How shity

655
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,776
Situation is

656
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,592
That even Alex will say reasonable

657
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:23,968
Yeah it's something really remarkable about

658
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,504
What he saying that's

659
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,528
Kind of right

660
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:31,136
He's trying to derail things down like his auntie public

661
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:36,000
School Road in this like they want your guns but have armed security kind of talking points yet

662
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,048
Overall I don't know if I disagree with

663
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:38,816
Is that much

664
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,096
About what he saying

665
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,656
The issue is that Alex's Larry solution

666
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,448
These problems that underlie the

667
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,264
The problems that Keys touching on that kind of

668
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,288
I have some accuracy

669
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,104
If you try to investigate the police department

670
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,640
That's a globalist plot

671
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,408
Federalized

672
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,736
Any attempt to address poverty that might help

673
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
People who

674
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,552
Can't afford it station or whatever

675
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,880
That's just the globalist attempt to make everyone

676
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,928
So we can kill everyone off

677
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:08,256
The only Concrete Solutions Alex's come up with scent

678
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,328
The shooting are to arm teachers and Vanquish the devil

679
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,888
Has the second one is meaningless

680
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,680
Teachers is kind of all he's got here

681
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,240
You just keep everything the same

682
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,264
But arm the teacher

683
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,592
So we're left living in exactly the same unpleasant

684
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,128
World is no solution

685
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,664
But when things go bad

686
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,432
Teachers will have

687
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
Kill people

688
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,736
This isn't a solution

689
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,296
This is dumb it's just more Deadpool

690
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
Right but

691
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,832
Even

692
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:36,160
Slightly fewer dead people is not an Optimum out

693
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,440
Yeah it it's

694
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,048
It's just bizarre that yeah there are those moments week

695
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,072
Kind of feel like

696
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
Yeah you're touching

697
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,680
You touching on something real here and your anger seems

698
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
Come from

699
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
A place of

700
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,520
Like sincere passion about like

701
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,824
How's it going out wrong V

702
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,848
Did the

703
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,152
Did the situation people find themselves in Arabic

704
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
You got nothing

705
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,456
But yeah I mean

706
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
Okay

707
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,808
So I agree with you that is genuine

708
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,416
And I'll it was reasonable

709
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
I just

710
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
Don't

711
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,024
F****** care

712
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,584
If you get angry enough at the problem

713
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:22,240
That it's genuine and real and then at the end of the day you go home and you say well I love guns more than I love my kids so f***

714
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,312
Part of the problem

715
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:31,712
I mean the exit sound the overarching unreasonable Leti within the reasonable

716
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,576
Kind of difficult to ever really swallow too much of the alike

717
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,136
Well it feels like he's coming from a real place

718
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,160
Because

719
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:45,024
Define spit Dave that tomorrow he's going to save I'll kill anybody who gets in the way of my guns

720
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,304
Including my own kid

721
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
It doesn't matter

722
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:51,168
Well you know who's who's going to become a consolator

723
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:58,080
Mitch McConnell but we'll get to that in a minute do you know at I'm going to tell you this I'll tell you this one thing cuz it just popped in my head finally

724
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,360
About Ted

725
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:05,760
Is in the 90s

726
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,784
There's like this Flash

727
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,344
Game where you play as a reindeer

728
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:15,488
Right and it was a reverse of them to escape Nugent you know you'd have a

729
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,560
Person call so that the reindeer would be hunting people

730
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,632
Okay and one of the like

731
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,960
Hunter calls you know like a deer call like that thing

732
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,496
Would just be some guy going

733
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,264
Who wants

734
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,056
To meet the news

735
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:33,152
And it is finally reappeared in my brain

736
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
That that

737
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,736
20 years ago

738
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,784
It's now a thorn in my f***

739
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,576
King side until I die

740
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,368
There we go

741
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,000
If you're trying to get in that game in your reindeer trying to lure the newgen self

742
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,816
You can just yell I'm under a

743
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,680
Alex

744
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,448
Play the clip

745
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
Pier

746
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:57,984
The cop

747
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
Discussing like

748
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,288
Some of the tactics

749
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,104
This is this just goes on a weirdo

750
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,736
Here is the DPS spokesperson

751
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,272
Nerf

752
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,624
They do not know where the gunman is

753
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:18,208
Hearing gunshots they are receiving gunshots

754
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,488
Point

755
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,304
They proceeded any further not knowing where this sucks

756
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,960
Kill other people inside.

757
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
The kids are dead

758
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,896
They're overthinking all this

759
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,736
I just

760
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,784
Cowards

761
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,832
Not going with their instincts

762
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,880
You're not going

763
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,448
Politically culturally

764
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,032
Space

765
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,736
Send

766
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:17,088
50 something billion dollars to Ukraine now eligible 60 billion

767
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:21,440
What does that have to do with anything I have no idea just throw that it doesn't make sense

768
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,232
What's what it what what's happened

769
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,280
Yeah

770
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,840
Asphalt and they're sending money to Ukraine but it

771
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:31,168
It's not going to manly enough

772
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,704
Still harming elephants in

773
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,776
Circuses you know it's just one of those things where the

774
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,336
It's just wonder One the same exact

775
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,872
Situation yeah yeah

776
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,152
So

777
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,176
I told you earlier

778
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:47,808
There's a rogue gun-grabber on the list remember I said Mitch McConnell that's right

779
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,368
McConnell pushes gun control with gems

780
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
Authorhouse Republic

781
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,232
Unbelievable

782
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,304
Every time

783
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,680
We don't have

784
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,704
Mental institute

785
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,240
Ladies and gentlemen

786
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,776
Only got a bunch of money

787
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,432
But if you don't you're going to be on the street

788
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,480
Which has more of the argument for

789
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:23,136
Scooby arm McConnell is up to his old man Mitch McConnell

790
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,440
A+ ranking from the NRA

791
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,024
I don't know I didn't there should be a higher rank

792
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,584
He just gets to own the NRA

793
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:35,680
Part-owner of support number

794
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:41,056
Talk about mental health career it's remarkable how Alex again can identify a problem

795
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,592
Express that problem thanks

796
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,896
Suggested completely idiotic solution

797
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:51,296
There are Mental Hospitals but you can only afford them if you have a lot of money because Insurance often doesn't cover that kind of care

798
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,088
And US everyone needs gun

799
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,368
Yep that's all

800
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,160
Essentially what Alex is doing is

801
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:00,256
Accepting that there's nothing that could be done to make the world better the only solution

802
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,584
Must be able to protect yourself from Violence by enabling yourself

803
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,120
To commit defensive viola

804
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:12,288
It's taken for granted that insurance doesn't cover much mental health care and that these sorts of inpatient centers are Out Of Reach

805
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,056
For most people

806
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,080
Which is nonsense

807
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,360
We can do better

808
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:20,736
The government has the ability to change regulations on the insurance industry to cover these kinds of things

809
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,808
We have the ability to allocate public funds

810
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,832
Do the creation

811
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,880
For affordable Mental Health Care Center

812
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:32,512
There's so many things we can do that are just get a gun and get ready to kill people who come to hurt you

813
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,536
That's not

814
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,608
What Alex's ideology does here's basic

815
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:40,704
We condemn anyone who needs access to mental health care to not getting it

816
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,544
He's the crying how there's a crisis in mental health care in the country so he does

817
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,592
I have to talk about guns for when the rubber

818
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,664
The road and he needs a suggestion of how to address the crisis

819
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,688
It's just

820
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
This is stupid

821
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,600
Painfully

822
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
Blind

823
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,952
Blinds two possibilities

824
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
I mean

825
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,744
It's it's

826
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,072
Unfortunately the most common point of view pessimistic

827
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,096
It's

828
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:14,240
I mean what is that what it is what is it in quarters on nihilism what it doesn't matter way I mean that's

829
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:20,640
The problem is it said that was the whole thing it doesn't matter what governmental officials are responding to this with because their Solutions

830
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,944
They're just avoid the actual problem

831
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:27,296
What every single f****** people are every single person who studies

832
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,576
Is this s*** in Spencer

833
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,904
All of their time doing this is like if you want to reduce crime

834
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,952
Invest in the neighborhood

835
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,000
Improve people's lives

836
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,304
Don't murder them

837
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,864
And every time it's like here's what we do

838
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,168
What we do is we hire more murderers

839
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,728
Here's the thing

840
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,496
Like

841
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:50,080
Those people who are saying these these experts in

842
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,104
You know like

843
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,151
What's nice about their position

844
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,687
Yeah is that there is

845
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,223
A possibility of

846
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,503
Improve

847
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,551
It's nice yes

848
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,831
Courtesan

849
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:04,415
This is the thing that is essential to me about Alex's point

850
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:08,767
There is no point in doing anything other than arming yourself to the teeth

851
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,303
Do defend yourself from

852
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,583
The people

853
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,655
Who aren't getting the care that they need and end up

854
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,679
I guess her.

855
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,983
That's useless

856
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,567
Not that

857
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,895
Somebody who's already gone

858
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,943
Yes it's somebody who's already like Lissa

859
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:33,599
I don't care that I can go to the grocery store I'm going to steal your oil fill up my murder car

860
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,391
And drive a thousand miles to get away from the

861
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,183
This world yeah it's giving up

862
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,719
Cosby

863
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,279
Philosophical and political positions that Alex

864
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,047
Carrie's

865
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,583
End up

866
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,863
In that place anyway

867
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,167
It's against

868
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,959
It's against my own rules

869
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,263
The problems that I'm so mad about

870
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,287
So I can

871
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,079
And it's pathetic

872
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,359
It is real sad

873
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,639
Satyr

874
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,687
AutoZone this coin

875
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,711
Right

876
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:01,247
Gun coin

877
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,039
Oh my God the Gun theme coin

878
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,575
Good day

879
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,599
Yeah but look

880
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,135
It's not related it's a

881
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,023
Thousands of us attorneys in the

882
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:16,351
Arashi January Sixers

883
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,399
Border

884
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,543
Imma go ahead and tell you about something very important

885
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,591
We did not have this planned

886
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,623
Parallel that's happening right now

887
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,415
Subway

888
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,719
Designed over 6 months ago

889
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,999
Three weeks ago

890
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,791
Blue Door offices

891
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:47,839
Monday

892
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,143
What was going on

893
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,167
Bulls the truck

894
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,543
Did we learn anything from this

895
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:01,151
And it's it's I believe it's a coincidence

896
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,943
Are you sure I mean

897
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,967
How do you get that money

898
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,575
Maybe

899
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
Maybe

900
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,367
Just maybe

901
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,415
If this coincidence

902
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,183
Happened

903
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:13,951
2

904
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,743
You know you're like oh my God this

905
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,767
Truck has come in

906
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,047
With these gun

907
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,071
Coins

908
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,887
On the day of a horrific shooting at a school

909
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:25,471
Yeah maybe you hold off on selling those

910
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,519
They show movies for like

911
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,847
A long time if it's going to be released on the wrong

912
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:34,175
Time trouble was supposed to come out around 9:11

913
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:38,527
Did not come out did they re-release

914
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,807
Big Trouble in Little China

915
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:44,927
I also the Dave Barry version of Big Trouble in Little China

916
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:49,023
Yeah I think you I think you sit on these coins for a bit

917
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:55,679
You got eight million dollars coming in from Bitcoin you don't need to price gouge your f****** people with these

918
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,959
Dumb silver coins

919
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,775
Like if this is so distasteful

920
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,055
And memory

921
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,359
It's like

922
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,919
He has to stress this over and over again like

923
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,455
Hey look it was not

924
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,479
Supposed to be

925
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,039
Play we did time this week either bad

926
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,575
Great

927
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,111
You're still doing it though

928
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,135
You could not

929
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,439
Do I choose to not

930
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,487
Yeah you're doing the thing that is a fair

931
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,023
I mean it because

932
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,071
The other answer if you're saying that I

933
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,375
Then what you're saying

934
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:29,471
It is more important for my bottom line

935
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,495
That I do this

936
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,519
Horrific monster

937
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,567
First thing I think about like

938
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,847
After a shooting

939
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,871
Probably

940
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,943
More eyes on me and more sales of a

941
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:45,343
The gun Second Amendment themed coin cuz I don't feel like the Second Amendment under attack if if somebody murder

942
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,879
There's a lot of people that's in Port

943
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,927
Need to buy a coin commemorating the weapon

944
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,695
And they did it with

945
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:52,767
F****** sucks and he should

946
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,559
I get I mean yeah

947
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,607
Any weights or else who sucks Ted Nugent

948
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,655
Is on and he has

949
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:01,215
Jamaica news

950
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,519
Suspicious American

951
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,615
Careers 2022

952
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,383
Uncle Sam

953
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,039
Legislator

954
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,087
Judicial branch

955
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,671
Against the American dream

956
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:25,279
Your friends have control over all of them

957
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
America

958
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:38,335
If anyone is a suspicious American it said f****** news suspect him of Ally

959
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,175
That stupid assholes forget about the

960
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:46,527
Decade of him saying that the government was the enemy of America during Obama's presidency

961
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:52,927
I can't believe that Uncle Sam

962
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:56,511
We wanted to murder and explicitly said I would like to

963
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:02,911
Multiple presidential candidates / President Obama suck on my rifle I can't believe that

964
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:07,775
This dark day would come when I

965
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,823
Shining City on the hill

966
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,103
So much

967
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,895
Ted 2

968
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,663
Get to that

969
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,687
Lace man

970
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,247
Really minimizing it Indiana

971
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,783
I can't believe we would

972
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,319
Really

973
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,087
Undercut

974
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,367
His is strong

975
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,135
Feelings about

976
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:26,975
What's that guy also the they'll spend money on Invaders gofucker

977
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,255
Yourself

978
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,535
Ted

979
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,071
Anyway

980
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,631
Ted wants people to learn from what happened

981
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,191
I would be fine if they glowed

982
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,775
I would be happier in fact I would be happier if the right

983
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,799
Gloated about

984
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,079
Controlling every aspect

985
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,615
To the government

986
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,151
But they're still

987
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,199
Teaching about it it's so infuriating

988
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:50,783
Part of the gang and retaining the title

989
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:57,183
I know how you have to do it

990
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,583
Anyway Ted wants people to learn

991
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,287
Regarding Uvalde

992
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,359
Information

993
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,383
Discount

994
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,919
There's all kinds of

995
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,223
The past that we seem to be

996
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,015
Ignoring and discounting

997
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,439
Conscientious citizen of America's only goal

998
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,487
What's wrong

999
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,559
Do anything wrong again

1000
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,119
Let's have quality control

1001
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,655
Instead of scrambling

1002
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,447
Damage control

1003
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:46,591
The ultimate irony here is that what time is doing on Alex's show is 100% in effort at damage control

1004
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:51,455
They're two things he's trying to cover which are guns and inappropriate police

1005
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:54,271
He doesn't want to talk about those things too much be

1006
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,575
Because he's a gun fetishist and because

1007
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:02,975
Reviewing the police response won't end up providing ammunition for him to use against the federal government

1008
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,535
He wants to attack because he sees them as a threat to the gun

1009
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,559
For Richie the fetish

1010
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,631
Also 90% of the audience that Ed has if his

1011
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:13,983
This point has some strong connections to law enforcement so turn it on that would be death

1012
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,031
For whatever career he has left

1013
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:19,103
Anybody who still wants to go here Wango Tango at

1014
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,127
That's a cop

1015
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:26,783
The effort to construct a narrative where the feds or the FBI it for knowledge of the attack which is

1016
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,063
Is what tide is touching on

1017
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,855
Here is an attempt to carry out damaged

1018
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,879
Control but it's

1019
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,415
Being presented as some kind of an

1020
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,439
Exercising critical

1021
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:37,791
Pathetic creep and honestly have nothing to say that's worthless

1022
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,815
Something to them guys

1023
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:39,839
A f****** worse

1024
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,607
Yeah

1025
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:46,239
I think that's why that distinction of like the feds had this knowledge in the people on the ground are good

1026
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,263
Is important

1027
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,799
Because Dad's got to keep his audience

1028
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,591
How to get turn on Cops course

1029
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:56,991
You can turn on these you never know again

1030
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,295
People who will never exist

1031
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,087
Those are the people whose fault it

1032
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,623
That way we don't have to

1033
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
To deal with the

1034
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:06,719
If you thought for a second that as anything

1035
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,767
You need to hear him say

1036
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,327
This is kind of fun

1037
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,655
Well that's cuz you've known I've always been

1038
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,471
The world

1039
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,751
Halsey

1040
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,031
Freedom

1041
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:20,799
Debate

1042
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,591
In the world

1043
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
Because they have

1044
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,383
Take the devil's

1045
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,175
View2

1046
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,223
Michael the

1047
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,551
Just support

1048
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,319
Everything I say

1049
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,855
For everything I believe

1050
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,927
Yeah

1051
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,743
He's Michael the Archangel of logic and Truth

1052
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,511
Wow

1053
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:44,607
You know that's like at my bad my Peak

1054
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,887
I could touch

1055
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,703
Weather in Annandale

1056
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,495
Going to have to train for a long time

1057
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,543
But when I get back there I hope to me

1058
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,567
Meet Ted Nugent

1059
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,431
If he is not on

1060
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,455
Coke

1061
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:02,527
Someone's got to distill his blood cuz it'll be a new drug

1062
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,575
Batman I don't know

1063
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,343
How

1064
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:08,415
JJ's at mean the delusion doesn't even

1065
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,695
Close to the words

1066
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,487
Yeah even sane

1067
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,839
There's a just a outrageous level of narcissism

1068
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,631
Delusion of self

1069
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:21,983
German word that is a paragraph long that explains head new

1070
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:29,663
I was listening to Ted's interview here and what I really came away with was

1071
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,735
He seems like he's

1072
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,783
So much matter

1073
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,319
Hey people like Beto

1074
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,367
He is at the shooter

1075
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,671
The police

1076
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,231
Not mad at them nearly as much as he is it

1077
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,559
Beto and Michael Moore

1078
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,095
Los Magueyes

1079
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:53,983
The Deep

1080
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,775
Viewing of the sacred

1081
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,663
Use that guy

1082
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,527
Perfect

1083
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:15,487
You got an animated Miss to his anger at them

1084
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,279
That does not seem to be present

1085
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,351
But it didn't even talk about the

1086
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,375
Person who just

1087
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,911
Killed 21 people

1088
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,215
You know that

1089
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:25,983
Bat

1090
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,775
You are angry

1091
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,823
At the documentarian

1092
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,663
Who made a movie about the most famous school shooting

1093
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,967
20 years ago

1094
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,247
You're wrong

1095
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,783
VA

1096
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,319
You're wrong

1097
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:43,391
If you wanted and I would be mad at him

1098
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:46,975
It would be reasonable for Ted Nugent be mad at him

1099
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,023
If that documentary

1100
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,815
Had led to gun control

1101
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:56,191
Then I could see oh yeah we should be mad at Michael Moore I mean from his point of view I reserved

1102
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:06,431
That's a totally good point like Michael Moore did everything he could

1103
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,991
He shot his shot

1104
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:09,759
F******

1105
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:14,879
It did not end up in the orwellian totalitarian and

1106
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:18,975
Douglas state that he imagines

1107
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:24,095
Him you like murdered Michael Moore's dream of being valuable to society

1108
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,423
Ted Nugent doesn't have much else to be

1109
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,215
Maddox outside

1110
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,519
Hehehe

1111
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,823
He's talking about France

1112
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:36,895
Whether or not they have a Kalashnikov

1113
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,455
Here's what I bring up on these

1114
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,647
Paris France

1115
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,207
France

1116
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,743
Gun

1117
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:52,767
Do you think

1118
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,303
Banning of guns

1119
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,351
French citizens

1120
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,239
847

1121
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,775
Were used in Paris

1122
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,871
How

1123
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,639
That

1124
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,919
Band workout

1125
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:16,575
Following that logic bring this up because he's the Archangel Michael and champion

1126
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,671
He's allowing AK-47 that all his shows

1127
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:24,255
If banning guns didn't do anything to stop this one shooting in France then

1128
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,303
Certainly on probation

1129
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,327
Does being useless

1130
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:34,751
Yeah I think it should actually be a requirement based on his belief to have a gun

1131
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:40,639
H-E-B requirement that he only plays venues that allow you to bring.

1132
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:47,039
Go on his first date is at the Beth Deckard Hall in Florida and they have a blanket prohibition against

1133
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,319
Any kind of weapon

1134
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,135
But not even knives getting pregnant

1135
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:57,535
Fans should boycott totally

1136
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:02,143
Anchor Kalashnikov doesn't

1137
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,167
Oh man

1138
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:09,567
Probably got guns on stage

1139
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:12,895
Probably draw 200 people at this point probably

1140
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:19,295
You want to have 200 people with machine guns at your show safest way to perform

1141
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:24,671
Next date is at the Florida theater in Jacksonville which also prohibits be carrying firearms

1142
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:25,951
Inola

1143
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:26,975
It's also again

1144
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:34,143
That's crazy really the case from 2018 tells you all need to know where he is

1145
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,703
Management specifically told the venue in Virginia

1146
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,239
Not to allow guns in

1147
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:41,567
He's a malicious creep doesn't live by any of the prescription

1148
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,359
Humane Society take

1149
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,407
Because he knows that he's really rich

1150
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:50,271
He can afford to protect himself from the threats that his ideal Society implies

1151
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,039
He sucks

1152
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:51,807
Yep

1153
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:55,391
I can hate this dude

1154
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,415
It is

1155
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,183
The

1156
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,463
I mean

1157
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,743
There's no other way to

1158
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,791
To look at it now other than to say

1159
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:05,375
Ted Nugent would prefer you live in a

1160
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,423
Murder filled hellhole

1161
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,215
And he gets to live on his

1162
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,751
Compound was really nice guns

1163
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,823
They would if he got to live on his compound really nice guns

1164
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,591
And you got

1165
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:20,991
Duluth you get to live on his compound with all the guns and everything and all that stuff and you don't live in a murder house

1166
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,039
Hellscape what you live in

1167
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:29,183
Is a world where everyone is armed to the teeth never feel safe

1168
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:32,511
Right we all basically just live with guns to each other's head

1169
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:35,327
It really does feel like sure safety

1170
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:41,471
By never letting your gun down just feel like that's the direction the states are headed

1171
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:44,287
Right like we could go the gun-control route

1172
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,847
Or we could go to mandatory gun wrap

1173
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:49,407
Even talked about like

1174
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:52,991
How he misinterprets the Switzerland rule of people having

1175
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:59,391
Having to have a gun

1176
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,415
It's a prescription

1177
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:06,815
Everybody

1178
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:12,447
Teachers get groceries

1179
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:14,495
Some bad guy with a gun shows up there

1180
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:20,895
The teacher can't do anything he gets shot along with it what are you do you arm groceries or aren't on the Armadale

1181
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:24,479
Exactly then you go from there until eventually everyone is armed

1182
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:30,623
Teacher with a guy with a gun

1183
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:37,023
With a gun you got on the student every single one of those student start teaching critical race Theory

1184
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,303
Boy you got all kinds

1185
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,351
To save your day

1186
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,423
Rrb class how do we arm the pets

1187
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,959
We give them gun mount

1188
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:51,359
But Dino Riders

1189
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:55,199
Anyway so we hired at Michael Moore

1190
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,479
Beto O'Rourke

1191
00:57:57,247 --> 00:58:00,319
But someone else is getting a little flag

1192
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:04,927
Obvious way

1193
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,487
Great great

1194
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,023
What

1195
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,143
Grassroots

1196
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,959
Civil rights organization

1197
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:21,823
Because of a shooting

1198
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:28,479
Set the civil rights organization

1199
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:32,575
Country was founded when the Brits came to take the gun

1200
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:35,647
He knows that I love what I'm sorry what

1201
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,975
NRA

1202
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,511
Event this is disgusting

1203
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:41,791
Disgusting

1204
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,167
Suicide

1205
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:51,263
Political correctness that's politically correct Lee Greenwood

1206
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:56,383
Can you hear yourself use no longer proud to be American

1207
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,943
I can't believe it after a shooting

1208
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:01,759
He would abandon the NRA

1209
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:07,647
It's my understanding that the reason that he canceled was because of the shooting but also like

1210
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:14,815
He had agreed to sing I think it was at a past year but the NRA convention be cancelled for 2 years right

1211
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:19,423
Contractually was still going to be sitting at this one

1212
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:25,823
I'm not doing that

1213
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,895
Why would you

1214
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,199
You think it's bad it's bad idea.

1215
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:33,759
Don't Go sing at the NRA

1216
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,551
Right that's not enough

1217
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,087
You're done

1218
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,879
He will not gladly stand up

1219
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:42,463
The music is dyed all over it

1220
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,231
Working man

1221
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,535
What is things that I think is the most

1222
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:46,815
Sad

1223
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,631
Thing that you ever hear from people is like

1224
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:53,983
You know the Ben Shapiro debate me AOC Huntsville

1225
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:57,311
And that's why we're making a joke out of it with the demanding

1226
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,359
Rampaul to pay you

1227
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:07,039
Baby I was in that joke like 2 weeks into it every now and then I get there

1228
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:12,415
I was like okay that's why it's really fun when we were actually able to keep track of the days

1229
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,023
I always find that to be a sign of

1230
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,815
Someone I looked

1231
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,095
I think less of

1232
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,631
When people are like

1233
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,911
Demanding someone to pay

1234
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,007
Possible for me to think less

1235
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,031
So Ted

1236
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,055
Beto O'Rourke

1237
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,591
Baitme you

1238
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,639
Michael Moore

1239
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,455
Supply

1240
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,295
Michael Moore

1241
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:43,391
Work is a storm skateboarding

1242
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:47,743
They represent the anti-gun side

1243
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,655
Go back to challenging people

1244
01:00:54,911 --> 01:01:01,055
Fist fights at least then you have an equal shot or I'll see you at the Town Square and said Don

1245
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:03,615
Absolutely will do a charity boxing event or something

1246
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:10,015
Play more appropriate on brand new Dodge

1247
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,807
Two people

1248
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:14,111
Talk like the idiots you are

1249
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:20,511
I can't imagine anyone wanting to debate someone like Ted Nugent either like

1250
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:23,071
Want to get yelled at about a bunch of nonsense

1251
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:26,143
Imagine everything I say to be taken

1252
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:28,191
Completely Iraq

1253
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:31,775
You don't know who that is

1254
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:33,823
You just signed on to this debate

1255
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,383
Thing right and they're just bringing random guess

1256
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,151
For YouTube

1257
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,735
Like the chase

1258
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,271
High-end

1259
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,831
And then Ted Nugent gives his open

1260
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:47,135
Opening statement and you listen to that man talk

1261
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,695
Find a reason to continue staying there

1262
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:52,767
You want to put you in

1263
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:58,655
The Archangel Michael of truth I would listen to him talk I don't like what you're saying

1264
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:01,471
And your whole like you seem unwell

1265
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:06,079
Absolutely your adjectives are all over the f****** place I'm out of here

1266
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:11,455
You seem like Gary Busey who didn't have head trauma and aren't a recovering addict

1267
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:15,551
Which means you're worse than Gary Busey at least he has a reason

1268
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:20,671
I also said I would say that I think the Ted just wants to do a bait

1269
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:23,231
These people because of clout chasing

1270
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:23,999
I would like a tattoo

1271
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:27,327
Because there's a ton of people who are maybe more

1272
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,375
Skewer in the mainstream who are like

1273
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,143
You know twitch

1274
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:33,215
Debaters whatever

1275
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:38,847
They would be clout chasing for exactly

1276
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:42,431
If you really want somebody

1277
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:47,807
It is it is a little bit watching

1278
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:52,159
Doing Infowars it being a different varying levels of entertainment

1279
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,463
Clout Chaser evilities is like

1280
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,255
Just Siri

1281
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,047
But minor like

1282
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,631
Scaling up

1283
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:04,959
Doesn't matter how high you go there's somebody to cut Chase

1284
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:05,727
Even higher

1285
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,519
Like it just never ends

1286
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,055
Yep stop chasing clout

1287
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:13,151
So Alex Goes To Break here and he's got some big news breaking news

1288
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,991
Because I'm

1289
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:21,087
Dispassionate

Monday for full hour we love you

1291
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,999
Five more minutes

1292
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,791
From Uvalde huge news

1293
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:37,983
So we got a confirmation that the standout has ordered and Alex knows who it isn't working

1294
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,263
The break that f******

1295
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:41,311
Okay big news does he know

1296
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:46,687
Weather Uvalde School District Chief of Police

1297
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,735
Has admitted that they

1298
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,527
I ordered the stand down

1299
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,575
Jurisdiction

1300
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:55,135
Call the State Police border patrol

1301
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:58,719
Call the police not to go in

1302
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:02,815
Disgusting

1303
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:09,471
So the police chief Alex is referring to here is Pete Arredondo who was the commander on the scene at the shooting

1304
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:16,127
The clip with Alex is so excited about is the press conference that the head of the Department of Public Safety Colonel Stephen

1305
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,663
McCraw is holding

1306
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,431
Amazon air

1307
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,991
Where he explains that Arredondo believe that

1308
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:24,319
The situation to change from an active shooting to a barricaded suspect

1309
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,343
Which is why the play

1310
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,367
Didn't storm in

1311
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:30,719
This isn't really the same thing as ordering a stand-down it's more a situation of a

1312
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:32,511
Very costly Miss judgment

1313
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:37,631
Announces World involved the feds having knowledge of the facts and ordering

1314
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,399
Please knock

1315
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,191
To stop the thing that they know is happy

1316
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:46,847
The available information in this case doesn't match that at all but there are enough details that look right if you squint

1317
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:49,919
Alex can Bluff his way through labeling this is

1318
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:53,759
Then once the label is caught on that's all the audience is going to remember

1319
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:57,855
Because how that word is used on Alex's show Bell associated with the standard

1320
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:58,879
Stand Down

1321
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:01,183
You'll be able to sort of

1322
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,975
Color this with

1323
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,511
Memories of

1324
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:10,655
Ask narrative when you say little things in the audience has the

1325
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,935
A full image evoke

1326
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:14,239
Didn't their minds so you've got this little self can

1327
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:18,079
Contain kind of thing and all the sudden it goes into a larger diorama

1328
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:24,479
And once you get that thing to apply to something you associate it

1329
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,855
And Alex will just throw that on the pile of

1330
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:32,159
Bulshit associate

1331
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,975
The dude

1332
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:35,999
Got to go

1333
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,535
Good out got to go home

1334
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,583
Until we got another gas

1335
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,399
Rodger

1336
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,935
Single thing we said

1337
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,471
Right here on Infowars

1338
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,263
I turned out to be true

1339
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,823
The entire Russian collusion

1340
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,359
North Korea

1341
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:55,199
That went all the way to Hillary Clinton

1342
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,039
The real question is seems to me

1343
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,879
After the trial in d.c.

1344
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,671
Alicia's bombshell after

1345
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:08,767
Why is mr. Durham going for the low-hanging fruit

1346
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,071
Another words Sussman

1347
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:11,839
Michaels

1348
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,607
Bendy

1349
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:13,631
Attorney

1350
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,167
Appears to me to be

1351
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,447
Patsy

1352
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:17,727
Fall Guy

1353
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:23,103
That's got to sting for Rodger that Durham's low-hanging fruit

1354
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,663
In the form of the Sussman case turned out to be a dud

1355
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,199
That was the Fall Guy in the

1356
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,735
The Patsy and Durham couldn't even see

1357
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:35,135
Secure conviction there man and Sussman got acquitted if that's your Fall Guy that gets acquitted

1358
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:35,903
Suck

1359
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:41,023
It's got a sting even more considering the tough man was acquitted of lying to the FBI which is what Rodger was

1360
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:44,607
Convicted of and would probably still be in jail for if Trump hadn't pardon

1361
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:49,983
I can't imagine caring less about this Durham s*** Rogers on to talk about it is

1362
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:52,031
Is less than irrelevant how to make

1363
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:52,799
How could you

1364
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,823
You actually

1365
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,103
Continue talk

1366
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:55,871
Talking about that

1367
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:56,895
Right

1368
01:06:57,151 --> 01:07:00,479
Like at on the that day you just an hour through

1369
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:06,367
Seems really weird that Alex has confirmed that there was a stand down

1370
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:09,951
And there's this cover at this brick in Newport news story

1371
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,999
You know work

1372
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:14,303
And some stuff out talking angles like

1373
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,071
Uno

1374
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:19,423
He goes to Rodger to talk about how Sussman is low-hanging fruit the Durham case

1375
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,447
Which turns out

1376
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,471
To be too much

1377
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:25,823
Too much for Durham to handle low-hanging fruit Durham really could

1378
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:26,591
Handle

1379
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,383
Bohagon crew

1380
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,151
That's true

1381
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:31,199
So one of the things that I think I need to make

1382
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:31,967
Crystal clear

1383
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:34,527
Is it most of Rogers interview

1384
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,551
Is

1385
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:36,831
You know about

1386
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,367
A lot of it is about

1387
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:41,183
Stuff but not really anything substantial

1388
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:44,511
It's really trying to make sure that people know

1389
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:46,303
But Alex isn't a snitch

1390
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:52,959
They don't want us questioning when they try to steal it again

1391
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:56,287
We got the calls

1392
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,711
Directions all alive

1393
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,343
It is 1

1394
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,135
Hundred percent a fraud

1395
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,159
In a lie

1396
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,463
Help those are saying

1397
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,231
It is

1398
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:21,119
That's precisely why I why I wanted to bring it up

1399
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,143
Clear the air

1400
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:26,495
Okay so he snitched for sure

1401
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:29,311
I think it's

1402
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,103
Still just responding

1403
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,151
To the idea that Alex

1404
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,967
That what's that on his show that he was going to talk

1405
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:40,319
Everybody if they would give him a beer today price

1406
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:44,671
And then people covered him saying that and then he did plead

1407
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,999
The fifth 100 x 24

1408
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:53,887
But then he was like oh everyone saying good I agreed to go and talk to them

1409
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,679
If I got immunity

1410
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,447
Which does

1411
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:58,239
Kind of look like you have something to hide

1412
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:04,895
I mean Mercedes tell you to tell that you want immunity for so you committed a crime and you want to

1413
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:10,527
Tell on the people you committed a crime with clear that he is like I'll only go

1414
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:15,903
And I don't have anything to tell them but I will talk to them if they give me a dirty so they can't set me up in

1415
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:19,743
A perjury trap or something like that

1416
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,279
But I think that he's still just

1417
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:24,095
Responding to stories surrounding that

1418
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:27,935
Because at this point they're you know we're still a ways off from

1419
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,239
Today's

1420
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,287
Coordinate

1421
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,311
The January 6th

1422
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,591
Stop

1423
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,359
Comic

1424
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:39,967
And the proud boys have not been re-indicted again and I at yet

1425
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,759
So I think that this is just like

1426
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:43,551
Dealing with

1427
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,087
Selma

1428
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,623
Segments of Alex's audio

1429
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,415
That thinks

1430
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,695
But he snatched

1431
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:52,511
I think it's reasonable to think that he

1432
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,279
Snatched

1433
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:58,655
I I don't think that he has much to snitch about maybe I think is also a reasonable

1434
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:02,239
Iiii take no position on

1435
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,007
This

1436
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:03,775
At this

1437
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:08,127
Reasonable if you're in Alex's audio

1438
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:11,455
Dance and your you think that everything is a conspiracy or suspicious of everything

1439
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:12,735
Spinning that case

1440
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,527
I think it's reasonable to think that he

1441
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:19,135
How could you not think that he snitched I would be I'm amazed that you could trust her

1442
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:21,951
You know like this is a dude who know s***

1443
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:27,071
His buddies were involved like you've been through a lot with him

1444
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:29,119
Deathstroke

1445
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,423
Be kind of just say built-up safe

1446
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:36,799
Nope sir Rodger is former Infowars

1447
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:39,871
Employee he worked on the room where he hosted

1448
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:43,967
Destroyer Owen Shroyer

1449
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:47,807
Babe

1450
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,087
You know because of this

1451
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:51,135
Political persecution that he went through

1452
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:53,695
He lost his job and Infowars

1453
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:57,535
Ono which I immediately thought like lilacs could easily

1454
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,327
Just give it back

1455
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:01,631
Well Alex has a policy where he doesn't hire

1456
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:02,655
Chicken salads

1457
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:06,239
Set true I don't think so.

1458
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,519
I think

1459
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,311
The first Alex can't afford

1460
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:13,407
Second him back

1461
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,175
Really

1462
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:18,783
Can stand on his own two feet now where is it the beginning of the war room

1463
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:23,647
You're probably not going to be able to get many people interested in another showing for your show

1464
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:25,951
So you dangle the Rodger Stone

1465
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:28,767
Nothing there even though you didn't actually co-host most of the time

1466
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,071
Rogers not coming back there

1467
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,119
Workout buddy has another gig

1468
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:36,191
What is what is Lye

1469

What do they talk about don't know who any of these Maple are

1539
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:53,311
Ivory Hecker

1540
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,847
She was

1541
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,127
I think at The Blaze

1542
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:57,407
Anime be laughed

1543
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:01,247
And then Alex was trying to get her for a while I think

1544
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,527
Who shamaine

1545
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:06,367

I wonder what her numbers are

1549
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,863
I bet she gets like one point

1550
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:17,631
2 billion

1551
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:24,543
I would be surprised if she was stealthily the most famous of all of the people

1552
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,871
Oh okay so

1553
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:28,639

1556
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:43,231
How much money can you spend Pete Santilli

I mean

1561
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,935
I didn't think Mike Lindell was that

1562
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,471
Stewie Peters

1563
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:55,519

Amazon here

1565
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,311
I think that means

1566
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,991
They've got a mixture of like

1567
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:11,391
Original content and it's a player I bet that they can sell their own ads on we got it over here let's talk

1568
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,927
Talk about it with Will Johnson

1569

01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,935
I did not know that it wasn't for a short. Of time before it

1572
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,727
Fell apart

1573
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:28,799
We'll see how long Lyndale one into last

01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,871
I mean who knows but boy there is a

1575
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:32,639
This is a

1576
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:37,503
Full list of winners just a who's who of who s*** me Powell TV

1577
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:43,903

01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,439
Lobero theater

1579
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:48,511
Did the Unabomber have his podcast on there

1580
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:51,071
Does the Unabomber have a podcast

1581
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:54,143
I think he's afraid of

1582
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,679
Technology

1583
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:56,703
The type who's going to get

1584
01:16:57,215 --> 01:17:02,591
Get into our ssb4 track though

1585
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:05,919
That's cuz it's probably an aggregator to

1586
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:11,807
Yeah okay I'm by Frank's beats.com

1587
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:17,183
So Rogers beer it's not really all that impactful at all

1588
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,975
And he's he's

1589
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,279
A little he's got some ideas

1590
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,119
Job

1591
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:27,423
The police

1592
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:32,799
Do you tip 20 years ago

1593
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:37,407
Why

1594
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:39,199
A video about the Federal Reserve

1595
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:41,247
Video about world government

1596
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:45,855
Shadowbanned

1597
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:47,391
That was just

1598
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:49,695
The process

1599
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:52,511
Video showing

1600
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:53,279
Anne koppe

1601
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:55,071
Doing something wrong

1602
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,911
Wooden block

1603
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,575
Cummings our problems

1604
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,767
So I guess what Alex

1605
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:25,791
Might be the

1606
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,559
McKay's

1607
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:29,631
Like early YouTube may have carried out an elaborate plot

1608
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:35,263
The Heidi's videos about weird Fringe conspiracy nonsense and then hype up videos covering police abuse

1609
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:37,055
That could be

1610
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:43,455
Or I would suggest that the more likely scenario is that his videos about the Federal Reserve and all that s*** wasn't very interesting and

1611
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,479
No one really cared

1612
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:47,295
Conversely videos of things like the police attack

1613
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:49,087
Protesters at the G8 Summit

1614
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:51,903
Probably could be more popular and upheaval

1615
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,671
Little bit

1616
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:55,999
There is a really simple explanation for the phenomena that Alex

1617
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,023
Describing

1618
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:57,791
And it

1619
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:58,815
Expect his intricate

1620
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,839
Conspiracy content

1621
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:06,239
Was not really all that popular in the earlier part of his career where is be easy to digest stuff that actually had content

1622
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:09,567
Contact with reality was much more interesting to a wider audience

1623
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:12,383
Seems like he probably learned that lesson

1624
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:18,527
Maybe there's a reason that for years and years as marketing push was as the 9/11 truth guy and the anti

1625
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,295
Bi-State guy

1626
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:23,135
It's because those topics are fairly universally understandable

1627
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:27,231
And things that resonate with people regardless of how invested you are in a

1628
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:27,999
Conspiracy

1629
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:30,815
You can see in this clip how Alex is brainworx

1630
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:37,471
Defines elaborate meaningless explanations for things that are pretty obvious when that obvious thing kind of works

1631
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,495
Against his Center

1632
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,263
Self

1633
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:45,151
He would never want to admit that he should about the Federal Reserve really wasn't that good and didn't interest many people

1634
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,431
It had to been shadowbanned

1635
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:52,319
He couldn't possibly be the people are broadly concerned about police of using civilians and have an interest

1636
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,343
Stories like that

1637
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:55,135
He must be that the globalist are

1638
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:57,439
Pushing those videos they can demonize the

1639
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:58,975
So they can take them over

1640
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:01,791
None of the shoot that he's imagining is real

1641
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:05,887
And when he was a listener of his show engage with any of it as if it is

1642
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:09,215
All you're doing is playing around in his imagination

1643
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,007
He can be exciting at times

1644
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:13,824
But none of that s*** has any validity outside of Alex

1645
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:19,200
Yep I mean it's a point where you could be like oh s***

1646
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,480
You've been shadowbanned

1647
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,248
And and then

1648
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,016
You might

1649
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,296
Think that he's so right

1650
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,064
You won't even check

1651
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,088
And you'll just assume they

1652
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,624
That you've been shadowbanned you don't even

1653
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,416
No right I can't believe that I've been

1654
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:34,816
Shadowbanned I can't possibly have low engagement on things that I put into the world it must be a plot

1655
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:40,704
Are there is one thing I did like I remember whenever I was doing that streaming video games for a while

1656
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,728
I have up

1657
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,264
Words of nine

1658
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:46,336
Butte on some of those videos

1659
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:52,736
Cuz obviously because YouTube shadowban me and not because it's inherently boring to watch me play a dumb game

1660
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:55,552
Time that I was doing stand-up if I tweeted

1661
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:57,856
Things that I thought were really funny

1662
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:58,880
Yeah

1663
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:03,488
Never got any traction on any of those tweets get a laugh on one of my jokes

1664
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:10,144
As the audience shadowban that gently the shadowy and then later on they would laugh at the next joke and that's the one that the

1665
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,168
Liberal media is trying

1666
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:11,936
To push on them

1667
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,704
Totally

1668
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:17,056
So Alex has gotten some information from this Prescott

1669
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:20,128
That the colonel was putting out on

1670
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:31,136
Stay straight on that low but I could

1671
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:33,440
So the timing is still good

1672
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,352
So

1673
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:44,960
Beat the Alex got some of that information part of the information that was put out is

1674
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:47,776
Turtle McGraw McGraw saying

1675
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:50,592
With all the information that they knew

1676
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,640
The decision that was made was wrong

1677
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:56,224
It was a bad decision it was right right making him an enemy of the cops forever

1678
01:21:56,992 --> 01:22:00,064
And Alex has a really interesting way he's process

1679
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,440
Shortcomings

1680
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:07,488
Problems it's not to undermine the place

1681
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:10,048
Um

1682
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,328
Brazen

1683
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,352
Cheerleader

1684
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,400
Who's up there

1685
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:16,448
Attacking you

1686
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,544
No Biden has endorsed the police response

1687
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,592
And Uvalde

1688
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,384
Cuz there's a cover-up

1689
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,480
The crew dead

1690
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:36,928
Car wash

1691
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:37,952
30 minutes ago

1692
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,512
Getting that live press conference

1693
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,048
Heard that Ashley

1694
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,888
20 minutes

1695
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:47,936
She's been on my desk

1696
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:48,704
10 minutes

1697
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:52,032
Haybuster

1698
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,824
Have the Club start

1699
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,664
Of what really

1700
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:59,200
On Monday

1701
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,784
As a system knows is coming out

1702
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:05,600
Incredibly evil

1703
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,048
They admit they're wrong

1704
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,120
What

1705
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:19,680
Wait what weapon place

1706
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,984
What's a Roth IRA

1707
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,336
Perfect

1708
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,616
No no no

1709
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:35,040
There's now no

1710
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,440
You said there was a cover-up

1711
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:47,840
That

1712
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,376
Perfect job

1713
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,680
Yeah that's weird

1714
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:58,336
That's a weird thing for the press conference where McCraw says

1715
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:01,920
All the information they know now that decision on the ground to believe that a transition

1716
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:05,248
From active shooting to a barricaded suspect was the wrong decision

1717
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:09,856
About how the police are usually good

1718
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:13,184
Texas when you do something wrong you on up

1719
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:15,232
Do it so if I understand correctly

1720
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:17,792
It is

1721
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:18,560
A cover-up

1722
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:19,584
And they were ordered

1723
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:25,984
Stand down there covering up that order to stand down and it's not a cover-up but they did lie a lot and now

1724
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,520
Abiding is covering for them

1725
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,056
Trying to cover up their lies

1726
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:31,104
It's not cover up cuz it didn't go long enough

1727
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:33,664
Yeah

1728
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,712
You know Alex singing

1729
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:38,016
Because no taxes you own up to it and stuff but

1730
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:42,112
We know cuz we live in the future that a couple days after this police new Valdese

1731
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:44,928
Stop cooperating with the investigation into the response

1732
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,744
Which is where life without send me another text

1733
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:53,376
Operate will apologize Webber wrong but if you try and investigate the crimes we do

1734
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,912
We will run away and kill you

1735
01:24:55,424 --> 01:25:00,800
Announces bye-bye Miss come out and said that the cops did everything right which is evidence of a cover-up

1736
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:04,896
I hate the police so when he says something positive

1737
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:05,664
Suspicious

1738
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:09,504
The White House Press Secretary

1739
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,600
The president has the utmost respect as you all know for the men and women of lawn for

1740
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:16,160
Just days ago he honored the memory of

1741
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:20,768
The former police officer Aaron Salter in Buffalo was killed

1742
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:21,792
Trying to stop the shooter

1743
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:22,816
At the supermarket

1744
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:25,632
I know that right now authorities are working

1745
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:28,704
How to piece together more details of what happened in Uvalde

1746
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,752
So we won't prejudge the results

1747
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:31,776
From here at this time

1748
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:35,616
Pretty sensible and measured response from the press secretary

1749
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:38,944
It probably would be in overstepping and abusive exactly

1750
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,272
Providing to unilaterally demand investigations order

1751
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:45,344
Declare things to be a certain way before the facts are available

1752
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:52,000
But the storyline is that the Vikings all in favor of the police and what they how they responded and he refuses to question

1753
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:58,912
So in order to support the police and simultaneously be the best way for Alex to thread

1754
01:25:59,424 --> 01:25:59,936
Easter egg

1755
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:01,472
Big knives that the police response

1756
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,496
Wasn't good

1757
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,776
While focusing on the appeal

1758
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,800
Difference of repentance

1759
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,080
On the part of the police

1760
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:08,384
It's kind of brilliant

1761
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:11,456
Really as a way that you can maintain your position

1762
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:14,528
Yeah doesn't hold up

1763
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:20,416
Do absolutely think it'll fall apart very quickly

1764
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,952
But it does sound

1765
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:27,584
To somebody who is inclined to already believe everything that you say is genuine

1766
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:28,608
That

1767
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,376
You are like

1768
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:30,656
Listen

1769
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:32,960
This is when we need to support

1770
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:34,240
The cops more than ever

1771
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:39,104
Supports the cop shows you that the cops are admitting that they're doing wrong and that's

1772
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:39,872
The good thing

1773
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,920
And biting saying that they did right

1774
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:43,968
Yeah yeah

1775
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:48,320
You maintain the positions that are kind of central to what you need to maintain

1776
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:51,904
Lindsey

1777
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:52,672
Stop

1778
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:56,256
No guidance

1779
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,048
So we have

1780
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:59,584
A really bizarre

1781
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,608
Development

1782
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:01,888
I would say with

1783
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:02,912
The

1784
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,192
The shooting coverage

1785
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:04,960
As a whole

1786
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:07,264
I think

1787
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,568
I think that this episode is where we're

1788
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:11,104
Getting closest to like

1789
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,640
I think he's about

1790
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:13,408
You know he

1791
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:14,688
He's Butte dipping

1792
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:17,248
Toes much deeper into the conspiracy water

1793
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:20,576
It's no longer a hostage

1794
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:23,136
Situation apparently there's now the

1795
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:23,904
Standard

1796
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:26,464
Sam down talking points in

1797
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:28,512
Nugent's coming into

1798
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:29,536
Assume that

1799
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:30,304
There's

1800
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:31,840
All kinds of foreknowledge

1801
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:32,608
Totally

1802
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:38,496
So we'll see we'll see what I would come to this but that we've one last clip here and it's

1803
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:42,080
Again but like Rodger coming on to complain about Durham

1804
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,104
What are we even doing

1805
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:46,944
To get on

1806
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:52,064
Prominent scientists

1807
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:52,832
Take over

1808
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:53,600
And the new lock

1809
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:57,952
Work

1810
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:00,000
What's the weather tomorrow

1811
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:02,304
Blockbuster films made about him

1812
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:03,840
Lady from plandemic

1813
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,376
Is on

1814
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:07,936
So

1815
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,728
Still doing covid

1816
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:12,544
I think you might be doing a little monkeypox

1817
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:18,944
Ambulance chasing conspiracy

1818
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,992
It's done so let's what's the next

1819
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:24,320
You know what really would impress me is if these f***

1820
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:26,368
Who are going off on the covid

1821
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,904
Conspiracies and Ivermectin

1822
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:31,232
And stuff a front and center in their coverage is like

1823
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,000
Also

1824
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:34,304
They're weaponizing monkeypox

1825
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:40,704
It was like 2 years ago

1826
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,728
Yep

1827
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:42,496
Yep

1828
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,776
It's weird that wasn't the case

1829
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:46,336
It is 8

1830
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:47,104
It's going to suck

1831
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,640
It's going to suck real hard

1832
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:50,944
Because to maintain their grip

1833
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:53,504
They're now always has to be a panda

1834
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,552
You know

1835
01:28:56,064 --> 01:29:00,928
For a hidden one or the not really because

1836
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:04,000
You do tend to notice

1837
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,024
That

1838
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:07,072
Okay

1839
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:07,840
Here's what I would say

1840
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:11,680
I think the covid pandemic obviously brought a lot of

1841
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:14,240
Maybe new Griffey types into the pool

1842
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:16,800
There is a legacy

1843
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:18,080
Connors

1844
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:21,408
But you do seem to notice

1845
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,944
Atrend

1846
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:23,712
Hey

1847
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:24,736
It's weird

1848
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:29,856
Why do you seem people are floating around to all of the things that everyone's mad about

1849
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:36,256
Kind of transition from this thing to that thing every time Alex introduces

1850
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:42,912
Somebody they've got a new expert label from compared to the last two years they were

1851
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:45,728
All the sudden he knows everything but deep Finance

1852
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:51,872
Yeah they say it's kind of that so I don't think they need to always have

1853
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:53,408
A pandemic going on

1854
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:54,688
But they do

1855
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:59,296
Definitely have a Groove

1856
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,064
Antitussive

1857
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,600
Seem to work to their financial enter

1858
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:02,624
Kristen and Steph

1859
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:03,904
Not good

1860
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:08,256
Yeah I don't care about the plandemic

1861
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,280
Nope

1862
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:11,584
Get the f*** out of here

1863
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:15,680
On Monday

1864
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:18,496
For a rundown

1865
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:21,568
Some of the progression of the shooting

1866
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:23,360
Conspiracy and we'll see

1867
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,640
How that develops

1868
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:26,944
When Alex has a little bit of time on the weekend

1869
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,296
Jamil his thoughts over to rewrite again

1870
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:32,576
Probably

1871
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,880
Back to the register

1872
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:36,160
Black Jordan

1873
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,184
But until then

1874
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:39,744
Bread website

1875
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,024
Brussels

1876
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,840
We aren't fighting

1877
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:49,728
Japan Clark I hope you all have a dreamy creamy summer

1878
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:52,032
The sex robot

1879
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:59,456
Alexandra Thurston color
