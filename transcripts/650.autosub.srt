00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
Does Sonic

51
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:39,648
It is funny it's it's nice you know before I would look at like a PS2 or PS3 and I would say

00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,208

00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,872
Just to kill some time before you can play Horizon

57
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,456
This is all just waiting game for me

58
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:07,552
I kind of thought about it

59
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,088
We would talk about the prez

60
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,392
Too damn much

61
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,416
Ben concert

62
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,720
Rodger Stone okay

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,047
It's been a lot of 2022 episodes

64
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
In a

65
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,399
I need a break so I decided to

66
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
Poke around see what I can

67
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,983
Vines

68
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,287
Does boarding Jim Bakker no good

69
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
So I went

70
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:33,407
2003 fortunately there's a string of episodes

71
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
That are

72
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,455
So boring

73
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,991
Nothing is happening

74
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,039
And it's just a disaster

75
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,343
And so we end up having to skip

76
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,135
To July 17th

77
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
The 11th

78
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,767
Yes to the 17th 2003 before we can find anything

79
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,559
It is worth going over but

80
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,399
It is so worth going over okay and I feel

81
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,423
Excited

82
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
I feel delighted

83
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,287
To have the this episode has fun

84
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,079
There's meaty stories

85
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
There's Alex being an idiot

86
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,711
Accidentally relates to the present day and ways that I did

87
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,991
Back right cuz you're a witch

88
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Right

89
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:16,159
Which by the way is part of my my legendary creature human witch

90
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
According to as magic.

91
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,511
Business on this nonsense

92
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,279
Before we do

93
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,559
Hello

94
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,911
Stephanie UK thank you so much and I'll probably walk

95
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,079
Bikers ocools thank you so much

96
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:39,967
2022 busted

97
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:46,367
Eik

98
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
Good spelling of average

99
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,439
I don't know how else you would spell ever

100
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
I know what your policy want

101
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,815
Guantanamo Bay but it's

102
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,655
Bae bae

103
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:04,031
I'm a policy wonk and also I could have gone I could have seen it being Bay

104
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,823
Which would have been a very different type of

105
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,615
It's true it's true

106
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:12,735
Alex Snowden... No relation thank you so much

107
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:19,391
What's fun about that is it could be no relation to Edward Snowden could be no relation to Alex

108
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,951
Cuz people are sometimes related by first

109
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
Fatty's

110
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:27,071
I've heard him say that Ivan definitely heard them say that

111
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:32,447
So we we sewed

112
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,983
Play Chalisa.

113
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,287
The jump we kind of have something that relates

114
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
The present day

115
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
And that is

116
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
An insistence

117
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,663
That's theirs

118
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
False Flags,

119
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
We'll go off

120
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
And

121
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Military

122
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:55,391
20 years ago prediction

123
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:59,487
Black North Korea nuke in a US city in World War 3

124
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,023
Which of course all happen

125
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:06,399
Yeah just because Alex talked about it and stop the evil globulus plant

126
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935
Well I mean it was good

127
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,215
Because

128
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:15,359
What I've seen is that the yuppies have not yet all woken up so soon

129
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
Alex to stop that

130
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:22,783
And protect the yuppies from the you know that the real

131
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:29,951
Blinding reality TV is bent towards coddling the yuppies so why would we allow them to

132
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,743
You make a good point.

133
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,583
So I would lay aside their there's a real stretch of boring shitt

134
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,911
In 2003 in July

135
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
Cuz it's fun

136
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
To wave through the pass

137
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
But

138
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,823
I heard Alex talk about the World War 3

139
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,615
Nuking of cities and I got

140
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,431
Take that boring to I could leave that aside

141
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
But

142
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:58,623
12

143
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,183
Join

144
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
Degree

145
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:30,111
This is a story that is strange that its existing on Alex Jones Show

146
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:36,511
Eddie's liko there's got to be something here you know whatever details that we are giving currently cannot

147
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:42,911
Not be the entirety of this store who's got to be more I'd be lying if I didn't say this

148
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,471
Spoke to me as somebody who like

149
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:49,823
Yeah I dropped out of high school sure you know there's there's this educational

150
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,919
Used to stuff by in my history

151
00:09:54,687 --> 00:10:00,831
There's a bit alike who lets the dog out here who had a better chance of graduating college if I escaped High School I wouldn't be

152
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,415
I would be surprised about that obviously if she's

153
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,511
This person is taking college classes in high school it does require

154
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,863
Getting a GED or dropping out in Subway

155
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
GDP that makes this

156
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
This something that

157
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,127
The Deep In Me Speak deep in the story

158
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,455
I'm excited to hear about this

159
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,527
But first Alex has to dwell on how

160
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:36,927
This is a person who's too smart of the system. I'll come down details

161
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
Harrison Bergeron

162
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
Why

163
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,287
Nationwide

164
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,991
And from geography bee

165
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
Wasn't

166
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
Vicious

167
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:14,047
I don't know what kind of local spelling bees Alex

168
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
That that's bulshit

169
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,887
Can do is discuss the big National one

170
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:23,007
The largest spelling bee in the one they've seen televised is the Scripps National Spelling Bee

171
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:27,871
The one that the venue in the movie Akeelah and the Bee of course the documentary spelled out

172
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,527
Be started in 1927 and the first home-schooled winner was Rebecca sealfon

173
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
In 1997

174
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:42,719
After her George Stampy. I remember her I'll tell you why because I'm sorry this is

175
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:49,119
Response

176
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,935
The other thing that the spelling bee is great for is

177
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:58,335
It was all of the best episodes of cheap seats starring the sklar brothers and she had a

178
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,359
Just a fantastic

179
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:04,479
Stick appisode she was great on the show she was Graeter's amazing she was the first home-schooled winner

180
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:08,319
Well congratulations 70 years after school are the be started

181
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:14,463
Almost after her George Stampy and Sean Connolly both want is homeschoolers in 2000-2001

182
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:20,863
Then six years later in 2007 Evinrude or anyone homeschooled winners in 82 years

183
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,215
If Alex wants to talk about whoever really dominating the spelling bee game

184
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,239
He's talked about students

185
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
From India

186
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,543
The most

187
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,383
Consistent winners modern time

188
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
The script

189
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:38,783
Homeschool children of beating kids to go to public school and all these glass decapitations ism

190
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,855
True it's just the centerpiece of homeschool propaganda

191
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:47,487
Had to be clear I don't think there's something inherently wrong with making the decision to homeschool your child but

192
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
I do think it's unhealthy for

193
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,815
It's motivated from the sort of place that Alex

194
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
Who's coming from where it's like

195
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,423
The schools are evil and indoctrinated your kids into globalism and multi

196
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,959
Culturalism

197
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,031
I don't think of the healthy impulse

198
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
Or instinct

199
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,871
I understand some people at

200
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
More

201
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:10,015
Rational reasons for homeschooling a PhD in pedagogy

202
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,039
You would be like

203
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,343
Maybe I'm better than this Elementary School

204
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:19,743
I honestly think that might be unhealthy to cuz it's super on head of kale with your narcissism

205
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,815
Are like a PhD in therapy you should also be your own child

206
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,727
But that seems that makes sense to me what is it is not a healthy reason to home

207
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,519
Old school I just know that some

208
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,311
Arnot

209
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,407
So he's got this incredible knows he's got an interview this this way

210
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,967
Kid but first I mean there's just important

211
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Other things

212
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,759
That must be discussed

213
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
Every week

214
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,863
And that

215
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
Well

216
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,847
Come on

217
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,407
Come get me you know where I live

218
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,223
The lack of enthusiasm that Alex has about someone threatened

219
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,783
I need to kill him

220
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
Not the first

221
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,927
It's strange that he feels the need to bring this up like really at the top of the show

222
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,207
But also the lack of

223
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
Conviction and passion

224
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,791
Is a glaring

225
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
I think I want

226
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,887
I'm with Al-Qaeda on a shirt

227
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
A hand pointing

228
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
To the person

229
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,519
That's what I really want to go through

230
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:41,919
Don't put that up armored absolutely and I'm going through airport security tomorrow where that

231
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:48,063
Just to see what kind of stuff I can take out

232
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,343
Also Alex

233
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,647
List of a bunch of nonsense evidence

234
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,743
That's at the globalist have been trying to dumb down the population for the last

235
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
Forever

236
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,351
I am at the proof of it

237
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,631
Is this Angela lipsman

238
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,167
Wizkid

239
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,111
Detroit

240
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,735
Call Angela

241
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
Which one

242
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:18,175
Is lying about the situation with Angela and her diploma

243
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,199
I was nonsense

244
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,991
He was getting into it

245
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,783
These documents and UNESCO

246
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,879
Talked about a lot of that the Passover

247
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Is this

248
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:35,839
Angela has been taking college courses through the borough of Manhattan Community College for the past 3 years

249
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,655
This point since she was 11

250
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,959
Hey cheater earned enough credits to get in

251
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
Associate's

252
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,311
Apparently some interest from Vassar to have her come

253
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,847
Continue her education there but

254
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
Can't because the Community College

255
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
Can't give her

256
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,431
Associate

257
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,295
This is because you can't get a higher-level degree without some form of primary degree

258
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,367
You can graduate high school and get a diploma or you can get

259
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,671
Equivalence like a GED and that work

260
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:07,327
But Most states have rules in place that you can't get a GED until the age you would be when you would graduate high school

261
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,143
Angela's case in New York you have to be 17

262
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:16,287
Is rules in place for a number of reasons but it's primarily because socially a 14 or 15 year old

263
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Is it ready

264
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,335
Need to be in a college setting

265
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
Generally

266
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,687
Even if you're intellectually able to handle the classroom material

267
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
It can be dicey

268
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,783
We've seen the results of

269
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,087
The baron

270
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,207
Brutal the bare minimum for the laces generally 16 years old

271
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
CED

272
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
Issuing

273
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,071
State that's the minimum wage in most States

274
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,631
You can Dropout of high school.

275
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
Do you be allowed to do that

276
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,727
It's generally seen as a preferred pass for student

277
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
To skip a grade

278
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,823
Is there overachieving because the Alternatives don't really

279
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,615
Seem to be super-healthy

280
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,639
Before a child Broadway

281
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:57,247
Plus when children overachieve this aggressively it's often a sign that they might be

282
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,807
Experiencing some unhealthy influence from parent

283
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,367
Like equivalent of an academic States parent

284
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,695
And that's something that you don't necessarily want to

285
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,999
Facilitate

286
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,631
Do you want to have kind of some some guardrails in place

287
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:19,519
Sure sure there are tons of stories you can find a people like Angela who

288
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,079
Studied college-level courses

289
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
And gotten

290
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
Credits

291
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,151
Prior to graduating

292
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,455
From high school but typically you won't be

293
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,247
You won't be awarded your

294
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
Degree

295
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:34,623
Even if you earn all the credits for it until you have an equivalent of high school

296
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
It's just

297
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,951
Pretty consistently across

298
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
The board

299
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
To go

300
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,887
I got in trouble almost every High School also allow has

301
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
Advance place

302
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,471
My class is like AP classes that you can

303
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,007
Translate to college credit

304
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,543
Yeah what happened

305
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,615
The do the test after work but it happened was I finished all of the

306
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,943
Until I had a huge chunk of my schedule that was a

307
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,551
So I convinced them to let me go to the Community College and take courses

308
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
Is there

309
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,623
But I hated those so I found out that you could

310
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,695
Test out of those classes and get credit for them so like

311
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:15,071
Instead of going to collapse like a game-high I just kept taking all these tests and getting grades

312
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:18,143
Good grades of these glasses but I never went so

313
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:24,543
Eventually they found out that I was spending half of my day outside of school doing f*** off and they got real bad

314
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
So I wasn't allowed to keep doing

315
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,943
Yeah

316
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,271
If it's not beneficial to

317
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,855
To facilitate that looks the Eric however we bought a Frazee

318
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:44,255
No I was immediately going to push back on you is like they shouldn't be doing that and I remember my start as life

319
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,911
There's also more to Angela story in this whole thing then Alex is letting on and

320
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
We'll get into that as

321
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,471
As we go along

322
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:57,567
So when we start off we get this interview going

323
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,359
Alex is interviewing

324
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
Her dad

325
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,407
Lips

326
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,967
AMC times in a couple times

327
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
Hobbit it seems like

328
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,271
It's mostly this dude

329
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
Please play

330
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,791
Right off the bat

331
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,071
No real red flag

332
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,607
And then he starts

333
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
Stalking

334
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,399
And I got

335
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
I got some

336
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
Love's problems

337
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,263
Which Curry to purchase

338
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,287
Each requiring

339
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
High School

340
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,383
Irrelevant

341
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,039
Orion

342
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
The guy went to the Lord

343
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
The Bill of Rights

344
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,583
Navigate to Megaplex

345
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,591
Please clearly reading off a script

346
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,639
Like a diatribe

347
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,175
Really interesting to me the way Alex

348
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,455
Try to interject

349
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:12,319
That he just steamrolled I don't know if I've ever heard Alex like

350
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:17,952
Just take a pic and I'll like that yeah and then they started the break music started playing

351
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,488
Very shortly after that

352
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:23,328
Yeah till I I kind of felt weird about that I've never I've never really

353
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,912
See that kind of behavior from someone who's a gastric no calling in

354
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,776
Look at the totality of evidence I have in front of me and all the information I've been able

355
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,592
Find care much for this Daniel lipsman character

356
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:41,248
It's one thing to support your very intelligent child pursuit of appropriate education but it's another thing entirely to do what he

357
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,784
He seems to be involved

358
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:49,184
One thing the whole studying at College at age 11 thing it appears to have been Daniels idea

359
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:53,536
In a 2011 profile on Angela in the borough of Manhattan

360
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
Community College

361
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,120
Just website describes how she got started

362
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,168
Quote my dad admit

363
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:03,264
Makia McDonald who was then assistant to the vice president for student affairs

364
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,080
And broached the idea of enrolling Me In Summer courses

365
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,896
This was just after she graduated 5th

366
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,968
Grade and I don't know how that story doesn't include

367
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:16,832
I told my dad I really wanted to go to college over the summer so he contacted Miss McDonough

368
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,696
Phrase make it makes it really seemed like this was something that he was motivated

369
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,512
My dad said I was going to Community College

370
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
It's

371
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,072
Yeah

372
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,352
I don't I don't

373
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,912
See as much agency of her in the way that

374
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,240
She tells the story in that in that profile it does sound like

375
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,032
My dad went behind my back talk

376
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,312
Go to this muckety-muck

377
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:43,200
Broach the idea and then the next thing I knew he said I've enrolled you in summer courses at the community college

378
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:47,296
Everybody I don't think that you necessarily get the sense that she's

379
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,600
Super opposed to it or anything

380
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,624
But it does seem like

381
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
The Caboose

382
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:59,328
It sounds like if you were give a few were asking me that question about swimming lessons I'd be like well my parents

383
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:03,680
I saw an ad in the paper and then the next thing I knew I was at swimming

384
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:11,616
So when you read this profile that you get a sense that she is an amazingly capable and driven person but also

385
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:15,456
The level of stress and responsibilities that was being put on her at that age

386
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,248
I think is wildly inappropriate

387
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,040
From the profile quote

388
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,344
I went to school everyday like everyone else

389
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,488
She says the two evenings a week I took the Subway downtown to Chambers Street to attend classes at BMCC

390
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,024
When she got home she

391
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,328
First tackle her 6th grade homework

392
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,632
That was the most challenging part she admits

393
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:38,752
But somehow I was able to get enough sleep and wake up refreshed the next day ready to do it all over again

394
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
Pounds

395
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,312
Not great

396
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,592
Oh man

397
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:49,248
This would make me a bit weary but the reality is that this isn't even the first time that Daniel lipsman has used his child to try

398
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,272
Try to bring legal action

399
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
Against the school

400
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:57,952
Hey 1999 lipsman sue the New York City Board of Education because he felt their uniform policy quote

401
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,488
Violated their rights

402
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,072
Free Speech equal protection privacy and Liberty under the first knife

403
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
In 14th

404
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,448
The judge found this case to have no merit so lipsman ask acting

405
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,264
Sing as the lawyer for himself in the case

406
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,056
Did you need to say that

407
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:19,456
Technically

408
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,224
He waved all the

409
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,296
The clams and the judge gave the school board summary judgment

410
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,832
Maidenform lips mandated

411
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,392
If you didn't get an actual lawyer for the case it would be.

412
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:34,560
He felt like he should be able to represent his daughter pro se but it's established law that you can't appear prosafe for someone else

413
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,376
You can only do that if you're representing yourself

414
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,192
So he was in the wrong here couldn't do it

415
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,496
Violate the everybody's entitled to an attorney

416
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,104
And the if you're not a lawyer and you're

417
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,408
Insisting on representing your child

418
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:54,016
Driving them yeah

419
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,344
The lipsman didn't get a lawyer and then decided to appeal the

420
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,624
Case arguing that quote

421
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,648
The District Court

422
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:05,280
The dismissal of Angela's claims on the ground that he lacked an attorney deprived her of her to write to a day in court

423
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,560
Wow

424
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:12,960
Big swinger

425
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
Affirm

426
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:18,848
That this is right around the time that Angela was graduating 5th grade in starting college courses

427
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:25,760
Taken together I can't help but get a little bit of a picture of someone not acting from a place of trying to do what's best for his child

428
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,832
But actually more someone who's acting out and using their child as a prop

429
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,160
Otherwise it's hard to understand how he wouldn't get a lawyer

430
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,952
To try the case about uniforms

431
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:40,352
If that was actually aware this was about like he's underlying claims as opposed to like getting a chance to grandstand in front of a car

432
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:48,032
There is a little seeming of you know oh well you won't let me do this cuz of the dress code fine then I'll put

433
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:52,640
Put my kid into Community College that'll show you I can't wait you know I can't

434
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,968
Ozarks

435
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,784
Seems there

436
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,856
Daniel's issues go back even further than that of course

437
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:08,256
I was able to find a New York Times article from 1993 about how New York schools were delaying in opening

438
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,560
That's who you are because there was a fear about his best

439
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,352
They're doing a thorough

440
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,888
Navigation for letting kids in

441
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,680
Angela was about to begin

442
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
Kindergarten

443
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,032
To this article Daniel and take him to school board to court

444
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,848
To try to force them to open the schools on September 9th

445
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,384
Ultimately losing that

446
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:29,760
You can look at this as having previously been really into schools and then a few years later going

447
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,040
180°

448
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
I actually think that this Behavior track

449
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,368
Perfectly with his later actions

450
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,416
He seems to like to sue people

451
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,952
But particularly the school board

452
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,536
I would guess he is a fairly libertarian-leaning set of politics

453
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,376
So I guess you probably be super opposed to spending money to inspect

454
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,400
SchoolsFirst

455
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:52,800
Absolute money in bureaucracy what the free market should choose whether or not

456
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,592
Asbestos kills my child

457
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:00,480
Stream 93 of him repeatedly suing the school

458
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,016
Things that

459
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:08,928
You seem a little weird imagine this is a guy who has a card ready and waiting at a security checkpoint just like you do

460
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:14,048
Don't have the right to search my car sir thank you very much

461
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,096
Hangover the diploma issue

462
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,144
Is not the first time

463
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
Betty's tried to

464
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,960
To tangle with the school board

465
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,240
On his

466
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:27,360
Presumably on his daughter's behalf

467
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
Troubling

468
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:28,896
Pattern

469
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,200
Yeah I mean you know

470
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,480
I imagine

471
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,832
Every single person involved when he walks in the door when this guy

472
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,136
So that's not a good place to be

473
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
I don't want to be that way

474
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:44,000
Also two pieces of information about Daniel lipsman that I found shocking

475
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,584
One of them I can prove and the other one is a little bit unclear

476
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,400
The uncleared Dead the whole time

477
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,448
The one that's unclear is that

478
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,264
Think he wrote a book in 1972 titled

479
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
The Jewish connection

480
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,432
There's a listing for that book being written by Daniel Jean lipsman

481
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,504
In the library of congress's catalog of copyright entries

482
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,576
But I can't find the actual book and I can't 100%

483
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,624
Confirm that this is the same person

484
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,392
Person

485
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,720
That is definitely his middle name though is it

486
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,488
Pretty good

487
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:21,888
My experience if you title the book The Jewish connection the my eyebrows go up

488
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:28,288
If you are a person multiple suing the school multiple times for Ticketek stuff

489
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,616
You are the type of bush it person who wrote the Jewish

490
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:35,200
I think it's obviously we don't have any access to

491
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:39,296
The book will be making undue assumptions about it I have no idea

492
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,576
Possible but it's train

493
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,856
Take a present look back

494
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:45,184
The finger like a roofing is that in 2020 lips

495
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,768
Smith received exactly one vote in the race for the 13th

496
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,304
House seat in New York

497
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:56,192
It seems like not too far-fetched to assume that he voted for himself it's a little ghost to vote for

498
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:02,080
Which means that he ended up time with such luminaries as Eugene vdubs almost

499
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:02,848
Keith Sweat

500
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,128
And a misspelling of

501
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,152
Katt Williams

502
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:11,552
So Eugene Debs was dead the whole time maybe he's dead the whole time

503
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,368
The 2nd

504
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,280
Accidentally misspelled his own name on his boat

505
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
Keith Sweat

506
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,632
Tied with

507
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:32,032
TV's John Stewart aboveboard

508
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,056
There's a part of me the field

509
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,336
Bad for Angela

510
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,872
No one under eighteen should have

511
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:40,736
Literally any exposure to Infowars particularly not being interviewed on it and being used

512
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,784
Create a public school propaganda

513
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,064
Yeah the wave this

514
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
Is being

515
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,880
Done, Tri-City

516
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,184
Every part of this sucks for her only

517
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,328
Yeah he was boring so we're not going to look into too much but this

518
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,120
Incredibly f*****-up thing

519
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,168
Did end up happening that just baffled

520
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,536
That's good instincts on Angela's Park

521
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:30,912
I can't imagine how Alex couldn't realize the giving out the contact information for a fourteen-year-old on his show

522
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
Might be a

523
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,728
Super inappropriate thing for him to do

524
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,336
But not to be outdone by Alex's completely insane action

525
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,384
Daniel popson and says this

526
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664
Blew my

527
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,688
F****** mind

528
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,992
Well if folks want to get ahold of you

529
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,488
4420 4420

530
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,304
Yes we have them giving out their home address

531
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,864
Complete with apartment number

532
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,448
That's just not f****** cool at all

533
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,728
Wow

534
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,032
Wow I don't know what I don't know what

535
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,312
Kind of like

536
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:14,688
Nobody's listening to this show ass feeling they must have had to be able to like this is safe

537
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,712
I mean

538
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,736
Cheesy

539
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,760
Jesus Christ

540
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,040
I feel like he's got a

541
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,088
Copy of Catcher in the Rye on him at all times

542
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,112
Stackhouse

543
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:28,512
I can't imagine dodging the bullet of like we almost gave out a child's email address

544
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,328
Let her real address

545
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,352
Yeah

546
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,400
Oh my God she doesn't share that with

547
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:40,800
Two other little girl this whole thing got resolved on Angela turns 16 and went to New Jersey where she

548
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,080
She could get a GED at

549
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,640
16 as opposed to waiting until she was 17 in New York

550
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,992
You got her degrees and ended up pursuing a path in law

551
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:55,392
Unfortunately

552
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,208
Unfortunately this fingerprint

553
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:02,816
And still remain so this episode of Alex Jones a show where this story was told

554
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,912
I am glad that she landed on her feet though and see

555
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,216
Seems to be alright is

556
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,032
Absolutely Dynamite at two truths and a lie

557
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,056
Her

558
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:16,128
Her two truths and a lie game must be out of this world

559
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,224
It's just three things better dad to the school board for unwanted made up

560
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
Nuts

561
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
Just like really

562
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,184
Come on

563
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:33,792
Come on wait until you get a 17-16 to get a GED if nonsense

564
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,376
Bernard Malone

565
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,248
Yeah that's not true

566
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:57,088
Because he feels like Texas is a common sense

567
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,368
Freedom state that you can't

568
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:03,232
Dgd whatever you want feels like you're free or in Texas

569
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,792
Then you are in other states yeah but your 360

570
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,584
So you're not at 3

571
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:14,240
It was really interesting and obviously I really enjoy

572
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:17,056
Digging and I'm trying to figure out what the real story is

573
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
You clearly had a great time with

574
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:24,736
Obviously offer a lot more variety terms of those things

575
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,504
Usually

576
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,784
I'm not blessed with

577
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,808
Multiple

578
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:32,928
Instances of this in one episode her dad was one

579
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:35,232
Story and Alex has another guest

580
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,768
Would like holyshit this sound

581
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,560
This sounds like it's going to be amazing

582
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,056
Track

583
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,368
Crime books

584
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
Find out with

585
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024
That's fascinating

586
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:13,632
Yeah I feel like we're in you can buy gas spot territory

587
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,680
What are selling your book or the like

588
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:22,080
So this guy he didn't name himself after race Bannon from Jonny Quest

589
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,896
Can confirm that

590
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,712
He's written a book called race against

591
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:32,064
Steve-O

592
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,672
And you got a little bit of breast Interpol agent

593
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,744
Has a really

594
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,536
Really extreme story

595
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,096
About going around Europe in killing

596
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
People who were involved

597
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,936
Denis human trafficking and child exploitation

598
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:53,824
Drinks and Alex is a little bit ambivalent about this because he believes that Interpol is actually engaging in

599
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,432
And so he's having a difficult time squaring this but

600
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,968
He's going to interview race Bannon

601
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,504
And

602
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:08,928
This is this thing no one is ready for this I'll tell you that right now

603
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,208
He's got to go to some calls

604
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,000
There's a theme

605
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:12,768
And these calls

606
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,096
In California in Northern California

607
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,192
I just wanted to congratulate you on your excellent

608
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,984
Interview again Coulter last week

609
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,848
Counting down of America that you're

610
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,640
New York

611
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,200
Yes and I mean I just wanted

612
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,992
Air hockey

613
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,296
Run over by a

614
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,064
Attract

615
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,024
Yeah this is there's a real Trend most of the calls that he gets about how he destroyed

616
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:51,680
I don't recall that I don't either but I don't recall her slapping and honking like a goose

617
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,472
Her laughing at how stupid

618
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
Yes

619
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,896
Nice laugh but

620
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,176
Perhaps that stop me

621
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,736
Yes we get another call and guess what it's not the same thing

622
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,344
Alex

623
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,416
Agree with the last caller there

624
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,440
Are you doing

625
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,488
Tremendous job on Tannerite

626
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:16,768
Standard

627
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,304
He really thinks he's something

628
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
It did a job

629
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,360
That's not what she said

630
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,456
But ya didn't either on who showed or in the book

631
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,016
Real interesting

632
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,064
Misogyny

633
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,184
April absolutely one-hundred-percent misogynist

634
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,464
Your calls of like

635
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,072
Resentment towards this woman who thinks she knows things

636
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,656
It's strange but I it's not too unexpected

637
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,984
I think one of the things that you really notice about this is it

638
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,080
Culture is legit stream relevant

639
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,128
Answer there's a preoccupation with

640
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,664
And like an obsession with

641
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,224
Continuing the conversation about her

642
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,528
Long after that interview happened right

643
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,552
And like soda

644
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,928
Secrets of aftershocks of attention of the earthquake of the original

645
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:22,560
Boulder and reshape it into like this heroic story that Alex

646
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,632
Vanquish Medusa or whatever

647
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:32,032
It would not surprise me to discover that most of the time when Alex

648
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,592
Is easily dismantled by a woman

649
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:41,248
A group of men get around him to gather and say that he's so great and he's he won he's the best at

650
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:44,064
Well woman would ever defeat any of us

651
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,624
It was so amazing how you yelled cupcake

652
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,976
Drunkenly if that woman is a woman

653
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,280
Men are better

654
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:57,120
So Alex gets to introducing dr. David race Bannon

655
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,424
The excerpt

656
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,728
Or like the little blurb of his book

657
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,008
Cersei

658
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,544
Could not sound more bored

659
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,360
And the darkest

660
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
Deny

661
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,856
Deliver

662
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,672
Beyond the reach

663
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,632
Notorious

664
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,800
Criminal

665
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,688
I even Ian to the middle of that

666
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:19,808
This is a sleepy board

667
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:23,392
That's high in tree I mean it it sounds

668
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,440
Blackamoor

669
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:30,560
So I imagine it's probably not as true as we would like it too

670
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:36,960
Who knows this guy Jonny Quest characters

671
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:43,360
You being recruited at 19 after being caught at a South Korean Riot that one raises

672
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,384
Sure

673
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,224
That story is actually fairly interesting he was at

674
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,016
South Korea

675
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,040
Student uprising

676
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
And

677
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,600
He got stabbed

678
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:56,672
By some guy

679
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,440
To kill him

680
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:03,840
I am aha Interpol recruited him right they were really impressed with

681
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:08,960
At 19 Interpol is like 10 that's a good murder their scouting

682
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:09,984
Okay

683
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,336
Riots now I'm going to say that sounds far-fetched but now that I hear it

684
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,664
I think he'll tell a little bit more of the details of that story

685
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,224
Later so we'll get to that

686
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,344
We got recruited in became part of this

687
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,112
Unit

688
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,648

689
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,720
Brought that goes around Atlanta

690
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:34,560
Deals with these human trafficking

691
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,448
Interpol was the good guy

692
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,240
However

693
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
Certainly

694
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,288
Subdirectory

695
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,568
Wish I were

696
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,592

697
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,408
Do identify those

Having said that

703
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,576
You mentioned

704
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,648
Foremost listener

705
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,672
It's difficult

Do you see their him being like

710
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,352
Different Alex

711
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:14,496
This point is going to be like hey

712
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:19,104
I'm dope

713
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:24,224
That's a good way to placate Alex's

714
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,064
Concede to his main point right right out of the gate

715
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,600
Right right

716
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,672
What are things that I'd like to do a Xanax

Experiment

718
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:38,560
No I want you to experience this information and see

719
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,352
What you think about it

720
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,632
Other red flag

721

Write Spanish

722
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:49,312
Yeah but we're going to begin the story at the beginning and we're going to go through all the way to the

723
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,104
And we're going to go

724
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,431
Piece-by-piece to see what is true and what's not true

725
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,991
Well I mean we don't we can't really know that

726
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,063
But I just want you to have your instinct

727
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,087
Gacha life

728
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,159
What what do you what do you ask somebody who

729
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:10,047
Takes in information and assesses it how do you feel now this guy sounds like

730
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:10,815
Got cold

731
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
Let It Go

732
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,191
Alex's

733
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,751
He's really trying to nail this part down that is like

734
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:19,775
Sure

735
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,079
Traffic

736
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:25,407
King and what-have-you every time I look into it

737
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:30,271
My enemies who are doing

738
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,143
Exactly correct

739
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,679
Meijer's with Interpol

740
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,471
When we were assigned

741
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,751
Crackers individual

742
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,543
Many times

743
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,847
We would find with any network

744
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,639
The slavery ring

745
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,663
Their individual

746
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,687
Jules highly-placed

747
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,711
Either religious

748
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,735
Store political

749
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,503
Leaders are

750
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:02,783
People

751
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,551
Old man

752
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,343
Very seldom

753
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,111
Those

754
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
Targets in

755
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,415
Instead we would Target

756
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
People lowered

757
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,519
That is correct

758
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,311
Well

759
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,615
Problem number one is very simple

760
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:34,783
If you are in control of your story why are you agreeing with absolutely random and saying things Alex to say

761
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,599
I mean if your story was true would you say true things

762
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,623
Instead of being like Alex

763
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,647
You got it ask

764
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:45,791
Exactly right unless that is part of his true story to say that

765
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,559
Piano

766
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,607
Alex bring this up

767
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,631
Is forcing a change

768
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:54,751
The story you haven't read his book actually be part of

769
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,311
This is a sad is life story

770
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,615
Construction though of

771
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:03,967
This guy is an Insider haha

772
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,503
In this agency

773
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,527
AR games

774
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,063
Any kid

775
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,087
Experience

776
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,415
The Interpol is essentially just a cover-up operation

777
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,951
Protecting these really rich

778
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,975
Powerful people

779
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,535
While taking out lower-level folks

780
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,815
No he didn't

781
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:24,959
That's exactly right

782
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,495
That I have a problem

783
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:31,359
I don't think I have it from the Fuller interviews I don't think

784
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
If you would

785
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:32,895
Not say

786
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,175
Say that

787
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,711
What

788
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39,807
Wouldn't he say well you would say that he's

789
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,623
Killed a lot of people

790
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,415
Do believe that there are a lot of P

791
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,207
Interpol who wanted this

792
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,743
Terrible traffic

793
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,279
Stop and we're doing everything

794
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,559
To stop it

795
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,095
But I also know that

796
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,119
Frequently

797
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,399
We were

798
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,423
Not assign

799
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,447
The cases

800
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,471
Where it was

801
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,495
Was very clear and

802
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,263
Individual

803
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,287
Significant

804
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,311
Influence

805
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,847
Was either by

806
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,127
Selling child

807
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,151
We are actually in

808
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,175
Involved in

809
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,711
The services

810
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,783
Unbelievable

811
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
Now

812
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,087
You would have stopped

813
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,671
The teams with arcane

814
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,439
Angel known as

815
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,231
The cleaners were innocent

816
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,007
We want to talk about this

817
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
When we get back

818
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,943
Mormon missionary

819
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,223
In South Korea

820
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,759
Call thing

821
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,087
Okay alright

822
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,391
How you feeling

823
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,183
Genesee Bloodsport

824
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,255
You know how that's wrapped Frank Dux

825
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:57,375
I hope that you know how that's a true story

826
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:03,263
I'm getting a lot of blood from this right now Houma today

827
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:07,871
The military had to let me go fight in this underground tournament because I was

828
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,639
Too good

829
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,407
For them

830
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,431
Get in the way of

831
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:15,039
Had to keep tabs on me because I'm too good what if I fight against old cover

832
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:15,807
Well

833
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,623
Yeah there's this interesting of those wipes

834
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:21,951
It's totally understandable because it's story

835
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,231
Is wild

836
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:29,631
Assassination team haha I think that there is a strange Trend in some of these gas

837
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,423
But Alex has that they

838
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,447
Like to

839
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,239
Portray themselves as hitmen

840
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:39,103
Larry Nichols his claim that he killed people for the Clippers

841
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,639
Yep.

842
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:44,735
Yeah I don't understand why these folks just insist on

843
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:48,063
Play Murder credentials

844
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:54,463
I don't know whether true or not cuz you know Larry's case was bulshit he admitted that he lied about that

845
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,535
Bouquets still might have been an actual cleaner

846
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:00,863
I don't know too many people who

847
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,399
Yeah I don't know

848
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:08,799
Too many people who killed anybody

849
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,567
Why

850
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:15,711
Do people look up to you if you kill a lot of people and I think it's

851
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,991
Machismo thing

852
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:23,391
Big menacing scaring people as part of their masculinity

853
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:26,463
And no know who has killed anybody though has been like

854
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:32,351
Killing people is not something to ever say ever kill people

855
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,399
Soldiers

856
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,679
Call Cami my grandfather

857
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:42,079
It's much more sense

858
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,103
What it was like

859
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,407
Yay I got medals in

860
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,967
Both of them were very much like

861
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:53,599
Not something to brag about I think that you hear that typically and interviews and stuff with people who have

862
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,951
The Story begins

863
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,255
Rooms for him in South Korea in this riot

864
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,303
He'll discuss that here a little

865
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,631
Started as a Mormon missionary in

866
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,655
South Korea

867
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,031
What time is very war-torn

868
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:12,799
Country

869
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,079
2500

870
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:16,127
Students were killed during that riot

871
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,407
And I was required

872
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,431
Use lethal Force

873
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,455
Myself

874
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,479
Myakka

875
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:23,039
Who came to the attention of an Interpol recruiter and it was

876
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,575
Just convenient

877
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,367
For him to have somebody

878
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,391
Who had Korean Lang

879
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,927
Training

880
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
Malleable

881
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,487
To their propaganda

882
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:32,767
He says many

883
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,047
Fundamentalist

884
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,727
Kosher in

885
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,495
Fundamentalist

886
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,543
College campuses are without doubt the

887
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,311
Primary

888
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
Recruitment

889
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,359
A most intelligent age

890
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,407
The reason being

891
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,943
If you have someone young and naive

892
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,223
Who will equate

893
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,503
Service to God

894
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,527
With service

895
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,575
You can get them to do anything

896
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:02,975
Call man that whole thing about marrying fundamental a service to God with a form of patriotism

897
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:09,887
Probably feel like that is heavy residents with Alex's present-day career anything about that

898
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,935
Exactly what he does

899
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,983
Instead of getting people to

900
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:18,335
Do things in service of the country to take them to buy pills

901
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:22,687
I mean the mentality is pretty much the same describing

902
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:25,247
Yeah Alex's did really Auto

903
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:28,575
I am getting feeling like

904
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,855
If

905
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,879
He weren't

906
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,695
Recruited by Interpol

907
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:37,023
He would have been recruited by the secret space program

908
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:43,423
Said that I'm getting like that all of the recruiters for a very lot of Camelot

909
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:46,751
For various places we're all at that particular riots

910
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:53,151
They were kind of looking around and he just got nabbed by Interpol first he was about to be a super soldier and he doesn't even know how

911
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:58,271
How much you missed out all of these groups like this is a good space program

912
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,039
Globalist

913
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,087
All of them were there for like

914
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,111
A convention

915
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,671
And the right itself was actually just like

916
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:08,767
A recruitment thing watching with binoculars

917
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:14,911
Squid game until people became soldiers

918
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,679
That makes sense

919
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:18,239
So Alex wants to ask about like how

920
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,543
How many people have you killed

921
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,847
Like you're talking about the bearded assassin

922
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,127
How many people you've killed

923
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,663
We were then given

924
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,943
The dossier on this

925
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,711
Individual

926
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,991
And assigned either

927
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,783
The team or singly

928
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,319
2 Traxxas

929
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,087
Individual

930
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,623
Extract

931
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,647
As much information

932
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,415
Responsible

933
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,183
From them

934
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,975
Either through undercover work

935
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:39,743
Or

936
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,511
Sometimes

937
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,791
True torture and then Ulta

938
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,559
Play Eliminator

939
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,775
Answer this the head of arcane

940
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,311
Angel commissioner

941
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,079
The fair

942
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,103
With Interpol

943
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,127
Told me that I love you

944
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,151
200

945
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
250R

946
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,943
Archangel cleaners

947
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,967
Surah fath

948
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,015
Most of them or respond

949
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,295
Beaufort into

950
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,063
Two three digit

951
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,647
Yessir

952
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,415
Sure

953
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:18,143
Don Cornelius

954
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,167
The women and children

955
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,447
How big

956
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:23,519
It is amazing

957
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,055
Of huge

958
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,591
Global proportions

959
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,615
The money that is

960
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,639
Regenerated is

961
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,919
Listen to the billion

962
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:30,943
Dollars

963
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:31,711
So you killed

964
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:34,271
The hundreds of into the hundreds of people

965
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,831
That's the type of thing that where somebody's like

966
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,135
See this is so crazy they'll have to

967
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:43,487
There's no way anyone would believe that I would lie about that

968
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:50,143
It's too obvious that I'm lying I'm good that's why they'll buy it I'm getting a strong sense that you've

969
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:50,911
Attractive

970
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:55,775
You've marked this is bulshit pretty close to saying definitively

971
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:56,799
This is complete

972
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
Sweet bulshit

973
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,919
CBC you have

974
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,711
All of the cleaners

975
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:08,063
For the Interpol 258 or so of them have

976
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:15,231
Killed a lot of people

977
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:21,631
So you're telling me that these people are important enough to be assassinated but not important enough for anybody to notice

978
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:24,447
Thousands of them are going missing at all the all the

979
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,799
Do you have

980
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,847
You know just the basic

981
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:33,919
Gist of the story is already giving you massive

982
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,199
Red flags

983
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:35,967
The

984
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:38,783
South Korean Riot that leads to being

985
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:41,599
Recruited by Interpol

986
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:44,671
Becoming part of that program called Archangel where he's killed

987
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,463
Into the hundreds of people

988
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,487
Write it just

989
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,255
To eat

990
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,535
It's a little fantastic

991
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,327
I'm getting

992
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,399
Close to what is going to be my favorite part of the story

993
00:52:54,911 --> 00:53:00,031
Which is the part where they have to explain why their evil organization that is directed them to murder thousand

994
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:00,799
The people

995
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:05,151
Will absolutely not harm them whatsoever after leaving and revealing all of those

996
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:18,207
And I'm looking for it already is unspoken

997
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,279
Won't say that you actually was an agent

998
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,303
Of course they wouldn't

999
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,071
Why would they

1000
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:27,423
Why they never reveal that. No

1001
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,447
No further

1002
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,239
So

1003
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:37,407
What are the big things that Alex wants to really nail down interview this interview is that they're ignoring

1004
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,431
The upper level

1005
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:44,831
People like the globalist who are they get a pass from Interpol

1006
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:45,599
But that space

1007
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,135
Basically the vibe that I'm getting from him

1008
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,671
When he says old money

1009
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,743
That's what happened

1010
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,815
What is Italy

1011
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,887
Ultimately it comes down to

1012
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,423
Money as almost all of

1013
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,703
Is pernicious rings

1014
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:01,727
Do

1015
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:02,495
The producers

1016
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,263
Themselves

1017
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,359
When we were able to extract

1018
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,639
Information from the producer

1019
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,687
Frequently they would name

1020
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:12,735
More powerful

1021
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,503
People who work

1022
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,783
Funding their activities

1023
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,343
Much of the material as well as

1024
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,623
The children themselves

1025
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,415
Some of the names

1026
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,439
We were given we would

1027
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,463
Deliver to

1028
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,231
Our commissioner

1029
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,511
And never here

1030
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,303
They were names

1031
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,839
The people that are info

1032
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:30,399
In the world for their

1033
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,191
Peter political

1034
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:34,495
What are their name Siri or religious

1035
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,567
Wow

1036
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,335
Yeah that's

1037
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,735
Wow this is exactly

1038
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,759
What I've

1039
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,831
Made up stories about for a long time and now you're

1040
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:50,111
Telling me that all of its

1041
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
True this is

1042
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:53,951
Overwhelming Alex is not doing the work to sell

1043
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:57,023
But he's also not doing the work of the sort of

1044
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:03,935
I don't know critical analysis

1045
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:07,007
Serious

1046
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:10,335
It really feels like he's just trying to get this guy to finish

1047
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:14,175
His story and then get him off the air like you just going consoles just like

1048
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:20,575
Wow that's amazing is on for the rest of the show

1049
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:27,231
Thrilled by this because it it feeds into the narratives that Alex already has in place

1050
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:31,071
Namely that they're going around there finding these people is under using

1051
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,631
Interpol as a way to cover up

1052
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:39,775
Rise rich and powerful people find people are being blackmailed

1053
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,591
In order to do exactly what the globalist want

1054
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,359
M2

1055
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,383
We've been wearing

1056
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,919
Anchorage to infiltrate

1057
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,687
The network

1058
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,223
Just basically doing

1059
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,271
Standard undercover work we were developed

1060
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,807
Complete legend or covers

1061
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,575
Story

1062
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,367
Information

1063
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,159
As possible before we also

1064
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,695
Definitely eliminated our Target

1065
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,231
Sometimes you think

1066
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,255
Torturing

1067
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,583
Why we were doing this we off

1068
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,607
Futon cover

1069
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,655
Many names within the network

1070
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,679
They were not known

1071
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:11,007
Low-level producers again all across

1072
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:11,775
The world and

1073
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:15,103
Immediately recognizable

1074
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:17,407
Or upon further research we could

1075
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:19,199
He was highly placed Within

1076
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,527
Within a religious organization

1077
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,295
Haitian divorce

1078
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:26,111
Some major Global Corporation

1079
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:33,791
Gyro

1080
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,471
Just talkin around

1081
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,495
The warehouse where we

1082
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,287
Betraying that Archangel talking

1083
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,823
Sing with some of our supervisors

1084
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,847
Xcetera

1085
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,663
We do know that they were occasionally

1086
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:53,503
Times when these individuals were blackmailed

1087
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,271
The information

1088
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,295
Uncovered

1089
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,319
To suit

1090
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,599
Current agenda

1091
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,415
Who's all works perfectly for our

1092
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,439
Right

1093
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,231
I get it

1094
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:03,999
Come on

1095
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,071
Are you telling me that Interpol

1096
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:09,119
Is in the business of blackmailing

1097
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,143
World leaders

1098
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,423
Why

1099
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,215
Why is INTERPOL doing

1100
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:22,943
Right is that our first question ultimately at the end of the day Interpol does not like exercise a lot of power

1101
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:27,295
In the global structure know that's the first question

1102
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:32,415
A question it's not really even a relevant question for this interview haha

1103
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:36,767
More about those assassination kill those people

1104
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,047
God dammit

1105
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:48,799
Assassination

1106
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:49,567
Team

1107
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,103
Cleaners usually with

1108
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:51,871
3 or 4

1109
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,663
Individual sometimes we are sent out

1110
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,687
Singly or in

1111
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,455
Teams

1112
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,991
The team pad

1113
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,271
Their Own Strength

1114
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,295
Weaknesses

1115
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,831
My particular for table

1116
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,599
I was watching on his

1117
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,879
Close sweat work

1118
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,647
That is

1119
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,183
Close quarter combat

1120
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,719
Hands are bladed

1121
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,375
Yes

1122
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:17,471
Yes yes absolutely

1123
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,263
The message that we used were design

1124
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,799
To eliminate

1125
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
Quickly

1126
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,639
There were other methods

1127
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,663
Used of course

1128
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,687
Mercenary

1129
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:32,831
Enough

1130
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:39,999
The master and knives I was proficient in the size

1131
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:46,399
Other people in my group had

1132
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:52,799
Of course nunchuck guy there was another guy but he was a little bit out there

1133
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:58,175
You know what on those long road trips he would keep us laughing he was a good guy

1134
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:05,599
Dad I had to murder him yeah so he's not like

1135
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:11,999
It's like a knife out of it you got like The Dirty Dozen f****** a******

1136
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:18,399
Got the you got the guy is a sharpshooter nice guy probably explosion

1137
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:29,663
Of course you can get into narrow syndrome

1138
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:32,991
His story may be more believable for Alex

1139
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:33,759
Is

1140
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:34,527
This

1141
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,295
Next clip

1142
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,831
Talking about these sort of

1143
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,927
It's not exciting to kill people kind of

1144
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,743
Is counter to what you would expect

1145
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,279
Somebody telling the story

1146
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,303
To say

1147
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:50,399
Little bit more credibility isn't it sort of off

1148
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:51,423
Expectation

1149
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,215
Lido

1150
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:53,983
Throbbing

1151
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,287
Sing another person's life

1152
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,311
Find of using

1153
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,591
Torture Tech

1154
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,639
Extract information of course

1155
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,663
Plays heavily

1156
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:02,943
On one soul

1157
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:03,967
Is very difficult

1158
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:07,295
To deal with

1159
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,599
Frequently these individuals we would either catch

1160
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:11,903
Four-wheeler

1161
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:12,671
Catch them

1162
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:15,231
Surrounded by video or

1163
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:15,999
Photograph

1164
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,791
Images of

1165
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,815
Abusing children

1166
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,143
Seeing those images it was not

1167
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,447
Then to

1168
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,471
Use the method

1169
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,007
In which hour

1170
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,287
I was trained to extract

1171
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,567
Information

1172
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:35,967
Throbbing horror supposed to Annex

1173
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,735
Flash

1174
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:39,039
April right situation

1175
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:39,807
No

1176
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,087
I mean

1177
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:45,695
You should be a f*****-up interview no matter what really

1178
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:46,975
Like

1179
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:50,303
Where are you at in your own brain

1180
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:56,191
That you can hear somebody in such a banal way just be like I executed

1181
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:59,007
Hundred

1182
01:00:59,263 --> 01:00:59,775
With

1183
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:04,127
No legal justification beyond what it was we saw

1184
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,663
An archangel named

1185
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:10,015
Exactly why I'm listening to this person and

1186
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,039
I am an Alex

1187
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:11,807
This place going

1188
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:18,207
Instead of you're a f****** terrifying psychopath and you need to be stopped at

1189
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:24,607
It all costs that Alex does have some misgivings about this emotionally

1190
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:27,167
Will killing people

1191
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,983
He does think that this sets kind of a bad president

1192
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,519
Can a can

1193
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:34,079
So I appreciate him at least giving voice to that

1194
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:39,199
Alex has some tough stuff

1195
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,223
But we gotta face it

1196
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:58,399
The truth but David race Bannon everything he said on the shows

1197
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,935
Complete lie

1198
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:06,335
2006 Bannon whose previous name was David dillie but he had actually legally changed the name of the band that does sound cool

1199
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:12,991
He was arrested in, Colorado on a number of charges

1200
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:16,575
Criminal impersonation that'll do it crime and attempted

1201
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:22,719
Will get into the details on this but the short version is that he just made up his entire story about working for Interpol

1202
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:29,375
Us authorities were essentially fine with letting it go but it became a huge problem when they realized he was using these fake credentials

1203
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,143
Quote

1204
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:35,519
Solicit fees in excess of $3,000 for a two-day training course on human trafficking

1205
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:40,383
At that point he was actively profiting off of his criminal impersonation so they decided it was time

1206
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,687
Go on to take

1207
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:45,503
Plea deal where he admitted to the criminal impersonation

1208
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:48,319
And the other computer crime and theft charges were dropped

1209
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,367
He got five years probation

1210
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:52,159
It was ordered to undergo Mental Health

1211
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:56,511
Open substance abuse treatment as well as performing 100 hours of community service

1212
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,279
Presumably

1213
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,559
Not as a secret assassin

1214
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:02,655
There's a chance that he actually could have done prison time for this but the prosecution

1215
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,935
Specifically decided not to

1216
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:09,823
Pursue it and the fact that he had to undergo mental health and substance abuse treatment right there was something

1217
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,359
Irrelevant to that

1218
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,639
That made it so like me

1219
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,663
We think that he's

1220
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:18,783
Got a problem I mean it gets back to the point of saying something like this which is if you

1221
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,551
Did all the

1222
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,831
All of these things in your saying it

1223
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:21,599
You are

1224
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:23,647
Absolutely out of your f****** mind

1225
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:26,975
And if you didn't do all of these things in your saying it

1226
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:29,279
You're absolutely out of your f****** mind

1227
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:31,583
There's something going wrong

1228
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:37,983
So the bottom line here is that this guy's a complete fraud in the stories he's telling based on personal experience that he's at

1229
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:38,751
Add are all lies

1230
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:43,359
All the stuff about how he knew that Interpol was ignoring some reports powerful people involved

1231
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,407
Golden child trafficking

1232
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:50,015
The stuff about torturing and killing and killing child pornographers that was from his imagination

1233
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:54,111
The stuff about the riot in South Korea where you had to kill a man and I've got recruited into

1234
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,647
Interpol at the complete fiction

1235
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:02,559
The Charlotte Observer is a really good article about this where they rely on statements from Interpol itself as well as an interview with Bannon

1236
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,327
Ex-wife

1237
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,375
Pretty clear how much of a fraud do you

1238
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:09,983
Cheap planes that during the period of time he claims he was out there killing human traffickers

1239
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,263
He was actually quote

1240
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:14,079
Teaching computer classes at a community college in Raleigh

1241
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:18,431
Is it North North Carolina not North Korea

1242
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:22,783
Assessment

1243
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,319
Think David is well

1244
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:30,719
You wanted to be a hero and wanted to be a writer so he created a relic backstory in a book with kind of solved both problems

1245
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,535
The way you jump

1246
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,815
Is actually pretty

1247
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:38,911
He wants to be special but he doesn't want to put into work

1248
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:41,215
Hilariously whatever

1249
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,127
You're right that is devastating

1250
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:54,527
Hilariously one of the sources that did some of the really good work deconstructing his fraudulent backstory

1251
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:57,087
Is a website called Bushido. Net

1252
01:04:57,343 --> 01:05:01,183
It's dedicated to exposing people who lie about their martial arts back

1253
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:05,791
That's great unfortunately to be a third-degree black belt in hapkido

1254
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,071
And this got some of the folks at

1255
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:09,119
Bushido poking around

1256
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:10,655
No

1257
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:15,263
Yeah my friend

1258
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,799
They poked around

1259
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,079
Figured out

1260
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:21,407
Pretty much clearly lying about their belt and what led to pulling some

1261
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,175
Threads

1262
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:28,831
Their post that originally started on how he was lying about his martial arts skills ended up expanding at we Savage takedown

1263
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:29,599
Facebook

1264
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:34,207
And if their description of the plot is accurate at all this is one of the most ambitious lies I've seen

1265
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,487
On the show

1266
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:38,303
There's so much International Intrigue and murder

1267
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,119
Even as to kill a friend and lover named

1268
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:47,519
When he finds out the truth on North Korean spies

1269
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,823
Premier things just

1270
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,359
Deteriorate into an exercising

1271
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,151
Fact-checking it's almost breathtaking

1272
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:59,295
They show that based on the year he claimed it happened that South Korean Riot he says he was in could not have

1273
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,831
Actually even happened at all right

1274
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:04,671
They had somebody in France go to investigate whether or not a French

1275
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:08,511
French Secret Service member that he claims to be engaged to

1276
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,047
But died in the line of duty

1277
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:13,119
Was a real person or not boil alert chichiwawa

1278
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,399
It was all made up

1279
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:20,543
They even contacted the Korean school he claims to have a PhD from and they have no records of him getting a degree at all

1280
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:26,687
Great it's amazing stuff and it really helps make sense of why the Charlotte Observer article about him is titled

1281
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:29,759
The man who lied about everything

1282
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:30,783
Pretty much nailed it

1283
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:34,367
I think this entire interview with Alex really highlights

1284
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,159
Two problems with his show that exists

1285
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,439
System 2003

1286
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,207
Annie's guns

1287
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:38,975
0 work

1288
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:39,743
What's the remedy

1289
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,535
The first is that he's the most

1290
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:44,351
Gullible Mark who's ever hosted a show of this size

1291
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:50,495
Just about anyone can come in and tell him made up stories about something he wants to believe and Alex will buy it wholesale

1292
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,287
And pass it on to the audience's truth

1293
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,871
This guy or Steve pieczenik say the stuff that Alex wants

1294
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:58,175
To hear and things that make his narrative easier

1295
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,223
Create a perception that

1296
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:02,015
Geopolitical significance

1297
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:04,575
Presumably historic heroic people

1298
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:07,647
They think that I was just shows an important place to make an appear

1299
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:13,023
That validating of Alex's narcissism is just something he can't resist taking part in

1300
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:16,863
Regardless of how clear a liar you haven't developed for in order to get his fix

1301
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,935
The second problem is actually a bit more serious

1302
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:23,519
And that's because of how irresponsibly handles this stuff

1303
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:26,847
He's actively disrespecting the very issues he's pretending

1304
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:27,615
To take seriously

1305
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:31,711
Uncritically interviewing is Doctor race Bannon is an affront

1306
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:34,527
The people who take the fight against human trafficking seriously

1307
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:38,879
Instead of dealing with the issue soberly as it exists in the real world

1308
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:40,159
Retreats into his own

1309
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:42,463
And in the process helps this guy promote

1310
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,231
In profit off

1311
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:45,023
Creating a fake life story

1312
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:48,095
The exploitation of children as an intriguing plot point

1313
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,119
Essentially it's a

1314
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,655
Propped his story yet

1315
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:56,799
How should be really ashamed of his participation in this but obviously race Bannon should get to the Lion's Share of the flag

1316
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:03,455
The notion that he created this entirely fake career and Interpol and was using it to run seminars on human trafficking is

1317
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,223
Terrifying

1318
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:09,343
It's unknown all the organizations that he sold the seminars to but when he was arrested

1319
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:14,975
It came about in the aftermath of one of his speaking engagements on a college campus in Colorado

1320
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:21,887
After he took that gig the Colorado police caught wind of him and contacted him to see if he would do a training session for the police

1321
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,167
He quoted

1322
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:25,727
Bryce and that was plenty to fill out the warrant

1323
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:31,103
When is Hughes willing to lie to students about the reality that is a very serious issue of human trafficking

1324
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:34,175
He was willing to lie to police in a training setting

1325
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,967
He probably had in the past

1326
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,735
Yeah

1327
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,015
This is more than a charlatan

1328
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:40,831
Is a person who made his living disrespecting victims

1329
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,599
Human traffic

1330
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,391
It's just amazing to Alex

1331
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:46,975
Can't or will not see through this very clear fantasy story

1332
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,791
Of murders and spy novel tropes

1333
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,071
Just because it works

1334
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,399
To help him demonize the people that he wants to demonize it's a shortcut

1335
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:57,215
Taking the shortcut cuz he doesn't want to do the work

1336
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,263
The thing that I really want to

1337
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,543
Sharp focus on

1338
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,079
As much as like

1339
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:04,383
Obviously this guy's the real problem

1340
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:07,455
His appearance in the way Oz gauging with it

1341
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,991
Really does

1342
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:11,295
Has a connective line to the present

1343
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,087
Yahoo's show sucked in

1344
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,623
Similar ways back then

1345
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,415
And he never learned

1346
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,695
He never

1347
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,999
You never fix these holes in the boat

1348
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,023
Or whatever it's

1349
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:25,119
It's just know he learned but he learned that the holes in the boat or what keeps him floating

1350
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,143
Oddly enough

1351
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,215
Yeah yeah yeah that that that may be true the paradox

1352
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,239
Maybe

1353
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:33,823
Maybe maybe I could or maybe he realizes it's in his

1354
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:40,223
At best interest to sync the post and so the holes are actually good I can breathe underwater what the f***

1355
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:40,991
Yep

1356
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,551
It's

1357
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,855
I mean if you don't give if you don't get caught

1358
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:51,231
Consequences for your actions Beyond being rewarded for that you're not going to change your behavior

1359
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:52,511
It's it's

1360
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:56,607
All too often this is a little bit

1361
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,143
Skinner isn't with Alex

1362
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,423
Except just Direct

1363
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:02,751
If you reward him for this Behavior he continues

1364
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:03,519
To do it

1365
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,543
You know

1366
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,311
It's very simple

1367
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:08,639
He does seem to have no

1368
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:11,455
Ability to experience negative

1369
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:12,223
Feedback

1370
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:12,991
Like

1371
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,015
But there's no

1372
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:17,855
Constructive criticism at his world really that ever seems to exist

1373
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:24,511
And so there is no negative feedback at positive feedback negative feedback is just proof positive

1374
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,303
That you are on the right track

1375
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:32,191
Until what was trying to f*** with you that's just positive feedback baby

1376
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:35,775
Is it makes for a devastating Loop

1377
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:39,871
Brutal so there's another thing that they have a conversation about

1378
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,663
That I think is a little troubling

1379
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:47,551
And they seem to want Alex and race Bannon

1380
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,319
They both

1381
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:50,623
Seem to want to invade Thailand

1382
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:55,231
Wow be the US should invade Thailand because of human trafficking

1383
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:55,999
Concerns

1384
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:58,047
Which I think is geopolitical e weird

1385
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:02,911
I'm in.

1386
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,407
Not even saying

1387
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,687
It amazes me

1388
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:18,015
The things that we seem to worry about enough

1389
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:18,783
That's over

1390
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,063
And yet here are literally

1391
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,903
And I've been in Thailand

1392
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,671
Land on a number of

1393
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,463
Assignments and we saw parents

1394
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,231
Children

1395
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:28,767
2 years old

1396
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,303
To sell them

1397
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,327
The slavery

1398
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,607
Is this

1399
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:37,983
Should not be allowed by any

1400
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:49,759
I'm not denying the exploitation of human trafficking does exist

1401
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,295
At all but

1402
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,319
These dudes

1403
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,599
Are having a

1404
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,391
A fraudulent conversation here

1405
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:58,719
Surrounding a fake lived experience

1406
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:00,767
The this guy is is describing

1407
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,559
It's being used

1408
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,583
Call Ford

1409
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:05,375
Geopolitical things like

1410
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,935
Invading Thailand starting award

1411
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,471
I thought I was an idiot

1412
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:11,519
Can guys really against War

1413
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,287
I mean

1414
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,823
Iodized

1415
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:14,591
I just

1416
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,871
I just don't

1417
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:16,895
I mean

1418
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,455
Yeah yeah

1419
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:22,015
It really going out there and saying that

1420
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:22,783
People can hear it

1421
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,831
Should start a war Wild

1422
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:32,255
Some calls I mean just really some assholes said that there's a lot of human trafficking going on in Thailand so

1423
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,279
You know what

1424
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:35,071
Let's invade at least

1425
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:38,911
For either

1426
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,471
I don't know

1427
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,263
But we can take the calls

1428
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,055
We cannot ignore it.

1429
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:45,823
Rob

1430
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:51,711
Qveen Herby

1431
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,039
Individuals

1432
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,599
And tell me how

1433
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:01,951
Amazing

1434
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:04,255
Call

1435
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:09,887
Basically hero kill people I feel like they don't

1436
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:12,447
Stephen even f****** do

1437
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,215
Much

1438
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:15,775
Write a couple albums

1439
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:22,175
Well I mean turn on the bright lights was their best what I didn't get better after that let's be let's be real

1440
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:29,087
Pretty good don't know enough Interpol songs or albums to make this drug work

1441
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:32,415
Call you when I deliver this is a risk that ass

1442
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:39,071
Yeah I don't know I don't know the extent to which Interpol is going on

1443
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,607
Assassination Squad

1444
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:47,263
It's embarrassing the way that Alex has now accepted the story and is reporting

1445
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,799
As opposed to being like

1446
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:51,871
I'm talking to somebody who claims that he was

1447
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:56,991
That would maybe be responsible way to interview this guy with a little bit of pushback

1448
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,271
I am like

1449
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:03,135
Let him are the claims but make it clear that you as the person the audience Trust

1450
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:07,487
Have some misgivings right about the store

1451
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:13,887
This f****** guy rules

1452
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:17,471
What hero

1453
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,751
Bucking get into it

1454
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,663
It is very much so

1455
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:27,711
And my PhD is in Asia

1456
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,735
In history from Soul Man

1457
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,527
National University by the way and

1458
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:32,319
While

1459
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:34,623
Throughout Asian history as well as Western

1460
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,391
History

1461
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,415
The elite

1462
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,439
Pursue this

1463
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,975
Task and dark fetish

1464
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,119
Attract

1465
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:47,167
Anything else will

1466
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:48,959
4:30

1467
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:49,983
Thank you will

1468
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,687
And I mean

1469
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:05,343
What's a grim added detail for me

1470
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:11,743
Like the fact that the audience at requested Alex interview at every opportunity

1471
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:18,143
Are preparing for the interview in anyway so we will just get duped by a con man into making a mockery of child exploitation

1472
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:22,239
The act of not preparing for this interview I want to be very clear about this

1473
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,263
Is a choice

1474
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:27,359
And I suspect this one that I would routinely makes because if he prepared

1475
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:33,759
He wouldn't be able to justify interview in these really ambitious Liars who helped him create profitable narratives and validated

1476
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,295
His own inflated sense of self

1477
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:36,319
Real guess

1478
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,087
Wouldn't do that

1479
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:40,671
At forum and if you treated the comment interviews like they deserve to be treated

1480
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,975
They wouldn't provide him with what he needs

1481
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:49,631
It's kind of like an unspoken mutually beneficial Arrangement between Liars we get a plausible deniability

1482
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,423
Get a platform to say we are both

1483
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:56,543
And then maybe you get hired by another cop agency to teach them about an f******

1484
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:57,311
Human traffic

1485
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:01,919
Will be completely useless as a training exercise

1486
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,199
Let's be clear

1487
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:09,599
Counterproductive it might actually impiantare ability to deal with is real and serious

1488
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:11,903
F*** these people

1489
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:14,207
So your way other talk about his book

1490
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:17,279
Against evil get it cuz of name is race

1491
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,679
Now that I got last week

1492
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,239
New Horizon

1493
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,007
Compressed air

1494
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,287
Penguin

1495
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,079
Wow

1496
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:40,063
Right

1497
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,695
Didn't write any old book you want

1498
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:48,255
Unfortunately

1499
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,327
Maiara

1500
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,423
It's not

1501
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:59,775
So I am actually not entirely even sure that New Horizon is an imprint

1502
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:00,799
Good lucks

1503
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:01,823
Take me to the list

1504
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:06,687
On the website included which wasn't a good sign off

1505
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:12,319
The job yeah and then in 2021 they decided to close up shop and in a post announcing

1506
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:14,879
By the end of operations of new Verizon

1507
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:18,719
They discuss the history of the publishing company and they don't mention Penguin at all

1508
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:25,119
Which is another bad sign I don't believe it actually was artifact worth

1509
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:25,887
An imprint of anger

1510
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:26,911
Probably

1511
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:31,263
Being a partner throughout enough

1512
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:35,615
I don't believe that but Alex is using that part of his life

1513
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:38,687
In order to establish that they would have done fact-checking

1514
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:42,527
So therefore this guy stories must be true

1515
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,295
I think that's

1516
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:44,319
Justice

1517
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,599
Super duplicitous

1518
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:50,463
What you think they would just let you make a movie out of Ally

1519
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,255
You check up on it they wouldn't be like

1520
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:56,095
What is the kubotan why is this guy there they wouldn't

1521
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:59,935
They wouldn't do any of that it can't be true Dan

1522
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,471
So we get some

1523
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:05,311
Interesting stories here at this point

1524
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:07,615
Maybe this

1525
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,895
Banning characters

1526
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:12,479
Maybe feeling a little bit more like I was just saying all this stuff is true

1527
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:18,367
Live Let It Go

1528
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,391
I actually spent

1529
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:21,951
Sometime in the North Korean labor camp

1530
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:22,719
Get it

1531
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,511
North Korea ID

1532
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,279
Idea I

1533
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,047
Myself

1534
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:27,583
Was imprisoned

1535
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,887
In North Korea

1536
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:30,911
When I was captured

1537
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:34,751
My PhD is

1538
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,775
Is an Asian history from

1539
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,311
University so

1540
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:39,103
I like 10 I know a lot about this

1541
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,663
I can assure temp

1542
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:43,455
North Korea has been working

1543
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:46,015
Construction programs biologic

1544
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,039
Chemical weapons

1545
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,063
428

1546
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,695
Big boat

1547
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:55,999
Call it is

1548
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:59,071
It is it's a huge everyone on the inside

1549
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,095
Has known that

1550
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,911
It may be that is now just more politically

1551
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:05,983
Convenience

1552
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,079
House

1553
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:16,991
Hang out there

1554
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:20,063
That is correct

1555
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,087
There are

1556
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:22,367
Horrendous

1557
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,647
Involved

1558
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,951
I was only there for

1559
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,487
A little under a week

1560
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,767
Until I was

1561
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:29,791
Traded

1562
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:32,095
To South Korea in

1563
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,143
Play swap that is

1564
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,167
Is there was a known

1565
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,191
Mole

1566
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,215
South Korean

1567
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,495
Secret Service

1568
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,519
He was actually an hour

1569
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:40,543
Green double agent

1570
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:41,567
He has been

1571
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,359
It was traded back

1572
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,895
For me

1573
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,175
Yeah they also got

1574
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:51,807
Cash considerations and a spy to be named later

1575
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:56,159
Unprotected for the next 22

1576
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:58,719
Yeah

1577
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:04,351
You can get the sense to that one of the ways that this guy really is able to get people like Alex

1578
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,631
To go along with

1579
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,167
That stuff is very soft-spoken

1580
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:08,703
He seems nice

1581
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:09,983
And then also

1582
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,775
Clearly has some just

1583
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:14,336
Like ingrained or in a

1584
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,616
Improv skills

1585
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:20,736
Like he's able to say yes to just about everything and then move it over to something else

1586
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,504
Like

1587
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,808
Talking about them serving dead

1588
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,576
Human meat

1589
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:25,856
I was like yes

1590
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:28,672
And also there's a bunch of torture methods

1591
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:35,072
Shift away from having to be talked about the cannibalism

1592
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,144
The redirect

1593
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:44,544
How is it that you know so much Alex and I'll tell you also about what's going on now

1594
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,104
Check that I think Steve do it a little bit

1595
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:47,872
How does my

1596
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:50,176
Later though cuz he was

1597
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:56,576
More than willing to be like no now he directed the shows

1598
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,392
Improv

1599
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:01,952
Evolved far away

1600
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:02,720
Haha

1601
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:05,280
So I we learn the sex clip

1602
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:10,144

I was involved

1607
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:22,688
Operation with Interpol

1608

Frigidaire terrorism unit

1647
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:36,416
North Korean terrorist in France

1648
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:42,816
And that his fiance got shot and killed died in his arms

1649
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:45,376
This is a little much

1650
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:52,800
What are you doing

1651
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:54,848
I don't even need this in my life

1652
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:05,856
I think any responsible person having this interview would have to be like what the f*** are you talked out of here

1653
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:07,392
Go away Siri

1654
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,160
That is

1655
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:12,512
Absolute bulshit

1656
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:19,168
At the moment of her passing then lower your head and then dramatic

1657
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:20,704
Play raise it up where did scream

1658
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:27,104
No at God himself as a rain down upon your faces

1659
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,384
The next chapter

1660
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:35,808
Seem to have an understanding of what's going on in this interview and that is like worth

1661
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,368
Going to be able to use each other pretty well

1662
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:40,672
Alex much alike

1663
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:43,744
He did with the interview and the whole conversation

1664
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,024
About Angela lips

1665
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:46,816
A whiz kid

1666
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,168
CPS

1667
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,984
Because he hates the child protective service

1668
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,032
Gordon's O'Bannon is a willing

1669
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,568
Participate

1670
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,184
Not involved in this

1671
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:17,280
The number one group when I read the news

1672
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:21,376
Counselor

1673
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,056
Don't

1674
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,360
Power

1675
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:32,896
Children

1676
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,040
Very much

1677
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,088
Alex

1678
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,368
The profile

1679
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:44,672
Well said Alec

1680
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:46,208
Everyone in child

1681
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:49,792
Protective Services is indeed running a front for human trafficking

1682
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,072
Great work

1683
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:52,096
I am truant

1684
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:53,632
CRST officers

1685
01:24:54,144 --> 01:25:00,032
It doesn't get more North Koreans terrorist than true Public School teachers probably in the mix.

1686
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:02,336
Why not today is there around kids

1687
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:07,712
So you asked an interesting question at the beginning of this and that was the idea of how he still alive

1688
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:10,016
I told you we would get to that damned.

1689
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,296
Here's the explanation there

1690
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:12,576
Question

1691
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:14,368
A list of

1692
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:15,648
People

1693
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:18,976
Incorporation High government or high religious areas

1694
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:20,000
Finance

1695
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,792
Globally

1696
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,144
It were involved

1697
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,168
He was probably too

1698
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,008
An excellent question

1699
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:32,800
Repeatedly

1700
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:34,848
If I may say this

1701
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,176
Account

1702
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,712
But that is

1703
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,736
Part of

1704
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,016
The largest

1705
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,296
Documentation

1706
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,576
Secret

1707
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:45,600
Insurance policy

1708
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,624
Before myself in

1709
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:47,648
Family

1710
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:53,024
Release it to 100 torque

1711
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,448
I understand

1712
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:05,824
Around

1713
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,128
So this how Liars like this guy lie

1714
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,920
Like you can't produce a list of names

1715
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:12,480
Because that's his insurance policy to stay alive

1716
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,016
Impulse would not exist

1717
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:20,672
The absence of proof as proof itself which generally speaking as the mark of someone you should

1718
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:21,696
Shouldn't take seriously

1719
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:22,976
However more

1720
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:26,048
Interesting lead the way Alex and gauges here it is fascinating

1721
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,864
Is it releasing these names

1722
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:35,264
Because it doesn't ruin policy to stay alive and he's got to do that

1723
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,800
Calling 100 places in

1724
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:39,616
But then Alex remembers that he's normal talking point

1725
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:41,152
Is it not that

1726
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:42,688
Tecumseh

1727
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,992
It consistently

1728
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:49,088
Position that you're in danger only if you sit on information

1729
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,368
The only way to act

1730
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:52,672
It would be safest to live wide out in the open

1731
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,488
What Alex should be doing if he was serious is to

1732
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,280
Eejit insisted Banton release

1733
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:59,328
All the information that he has immediately

1734
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:01,376
Cuz did not do so according to

1735
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:03,424
All the things Alex usually says

1736
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,240
That's a threat to his life to not release all of it

1737
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:10,080
I suspect Alex doesn't do this cuz on some level he knows Bannon is making

1738
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,360
Stopping there is no less

1739
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:13,152
Press the issue

1740
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,736
The only way really through this interview is playing along

1741
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:19,040
Even if you have to contradict long-held position

1742
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:21,856
I mean I think the simplest thing

1743
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:23,136
This one

1744
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:25,696
Let's take it at face value

1745
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:26,464
Is that true

1746
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:30,304
Is it true that you are withholding the names

1747
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:31,840
Of the very

1748
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:33,376
Traffickers that you

1749
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:36,192
Theoretically are 100% against

1750
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:36,960
To protect

1751
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:37,728
Just you

1752
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:41,568
What Acura you're willing to kill in the triple digits

1753
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:42,848
Annie

1754
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:46,944
Possible harm comes to you oh my God yeah I got to protect the bees

1755
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,248
Billionaires and millionaires who are financing

1756
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:55,648
The ongoing human trafficking spit still happening that I'm not doing anything about what you were saying now is that you were

1757
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:58,208
Willing to invalidate everything you've ever done

1758
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,744
Meaning that every murder

1759
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,072
Committed is 100-percent worthless and on your black shirt

1760
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:03,840
Kingsoul

1761
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,632
And then if you

1762
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:09,472
F*** you selfish desire for safety comes at the cost

1763
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:11,008
Of presumably

1764
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,032
The lives of

1765
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:14,336
Countless children

1766
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:19,456
Individuals you guys want to play your masculine I've killed so many people bulshit

1767
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:21,504
If you want to talk about courage

1768
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,832
Kill zero people and die to get that information

1769
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:25,600
Right

1770
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:26,624
Pharmore drugs

1771
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:31,488
So Alex is going to take a few more calls but he realizes like s***

1772
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,768
Let's talk about World War 3

1773
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,384
That is so serious

1774
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,176
Is been right on the cusp

1775
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,456
Bro long time

1776
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,992
Matt is right now too

1777
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:55,552
Detroit

1778
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:56,320
7

1779
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:59,904
Alex really seems to before

1780
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:03,232
For this whole thing and he wants to know more about these these killing

1781
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:06,048
Seems to be a point of fascination

1782
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:06,816
A Alex

1783
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,632
How you executed

1784
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:10,656
What's with a knife

1785
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:12,448
Primarily

1786
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:14,496
Expertise was

1787
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,288
With bladed weapons

1788
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:20,128
General

1789
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:24,736
We did either I would work

1790
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:26,784
Problem

1791
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:32,672
Individual and I can say that there are many occasions

1792
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:33,952
Square thank God I was

1793
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:34,976
Team because

1794
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:36,000
Some of these scumbags

1795
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,024
Very tough

1796
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,816
We'd like to thank

1797
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:39,840
Them all being coward

1798
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:40,608
But they weren't

1799
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,144
Are there were groveling

1800
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:42,912
As well however

1801
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,264
Alrighty

1802
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,544
My goodness indeed

1803
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:52,896
So your visitor view comes to a close with a whimper but

1804
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:54,432
This whole thing was

1805
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,200
Outrageous

1806
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,480
Start so f*****

1807
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:57,504
Yeah what's up

1808
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,040
I was I was like

1809
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:03,904
I was very surprised because like I said this stretching 2003 that I've been listening to has been really boring

1810
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:04,928
Not worth

1811
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:06,208
Even discussing really

1812
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:07,488
And then I get

1813
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:10,048
I get sucked in by the story of a

1814
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:10,816
Genius

1815
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,096
High School

1816
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:14,912
And then it turns into an episode

1817
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:17,728
Perhaps one of the most brazen

1818
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,752
Sociopath

1819
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:25,152
His show might be an exaggeration

1820
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:28,224
Particular lies that this guy is is selling art

1821
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,784
The nature of them

1822
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:33,600
Much sicker than a lot of the other people

1823
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:37,952
Are they coming to Alex's orbit the personal interaction with the

1824
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:38,720
Stories

1825
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,512
What they're about

1826
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:41,792
It just gross

1827
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,864
Yeah I mean it's it is that kind of like

1828
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:47,424
I feel like the Batman

1829
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,984
Conundrum for for these dumb

1830
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,264
You know like

1831
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,592
You want to all the superheroes the guy who goes out

1832
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:59,456
Killing human trafficking knives up killing people

1833
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:02,528
And just like Batman goes and takes care of crime

1834
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,344
You're like yeah but you're not doing

1835
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,368
F*** all but

1836
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:07,648
Masturbating basic

1837
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,184
You could be doing

1838
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,976
You could be helping people

1839
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:16,096
If Batman spent a f****** Dollar on helping human beings instead of building a goddamn

1840
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,120
Batboat

1841
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:23,520
Then maybe we'd be in a different situation this or dealt with the actual problem instead of the symptoms of a problem

1842
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:27,616
This guy's doing that same thing of like I'm willing to hold onto these names because

1843
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:29,664
That's heroic it's me living

1844
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:33,248
I'm a vigilante totally

1845
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:39,136
Taking on sort of the lower levels of things while intentionally

1846
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:41,184
Protecting the powerful and wealthy

1847
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:43,232
You have just

1848
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:49,632
Told the most heroic story of yourself Subway's when they looked at it in that light it's almost

1849
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,424
Good that this is fake

1850
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:57,824
No it's incredibly good that this is fake otherwise there talking to somebody who is literally running interference for

1851
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:02,944
All of the most powerful people in the world so they can continue child exploitation

1852
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:07,040
Yeah so we wouldn't last clip here and it's Alex Soto realizing that he didn't

1853
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,576
Get the most of the news

1854
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:12,160
Acquainted

1855
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:22,656
Underground

1856
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,808
Armaldo

1857
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:40,832
Daughter

1858
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:57,216
I think listening back to these old episodes I understand how the strategy of Never Getting

1859
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:58,752
The actual stories develop

1860
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,592
Back then 2003 in particular around this time

1861
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:08,992
It was super important for Alex to get people who are listening to go to his website because that was where they had a better chance of getting in

1862
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:10,528
Integrated into the revenue stream

1863
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,320
The best way to get people to

1864
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:17,696
To go to the website was too hype up huge bombshell news that never actually gets covered on the show

1865
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,720
Totally proven

1866
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:21,280
And documented on the website that where you got to go to find it

1867
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:27,936
Understanding you can kind of see how his show might evolve to essentially be a promotional tool for the website

1868
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:31,520
Where Alex is insinuations about the news stories he should

1869
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:37,152
Really it should be really seen as a sales tactic right people to take action without the website

1870
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:38,944
Go to the website is a call to action

1871
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:45,344
Not going to the news is it called action for highlight right absolutely not

1872
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,112
His best interest

1873
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,904
Discuss the stories on air because

1874
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:54,304
If he did so the audience the impression that they've covered the relevant topics and there's no real need for them to go to

1875
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,608
The site to see that coverage repeat it

1876
01:33:56,864 --> 01:34:02,240
Suspicion that this was an intentional strategy that also conveniently made it to Alex didn't have to do any work

1877
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:04,800
And let's just continue to the present day that's

1878
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,848
The training that he gave him

1879
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:11,712
Also as it relates to that last part of the clip where Alex is being all snarky about banning bears

1880
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,736
Bears are bad

1881
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,016
You can't own a bear

1882
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:16,832
A bad example

1883
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:18,880
He's actually making a solid argument for band

1884
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,208
Because

1885
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:22,976
The danger

1886
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:29,120
So let's ban guns cuz of the danger that is what I want if you want

1887
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:35,520
Students be allowed to live in the woods

1888
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:38,336
Official data stream or whatever

1889
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:40,384
Everybody can have guns but they

1890
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:44,736
Can't interact with human society have them in your home you can have free range gun

1891
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:46,272
Yeah something like that

1892
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:50,112
Old people driving that's also a really bad example because we

1893
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,904
Required licensing to drive

1894
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:56,768
I guess I was wants to compare the relative dangers of old people driving and guns that's great let's just

1895
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:01,120
Then treat them similarly and require licenses and Universal background checks for gun ownership

1896
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:05,984
His arguments are dumb even these arguments that he thinks he's making that are like

1897
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:09,568
Slam dunks his best argument

1898
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:10,592
Are the ones he makes

1899
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:12,640
In a sarcastic sounding voice

1900
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:18,016
Because if you if you attack your actual

1901
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:21,088
Rebuttal with a washer

1902
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:27,488
Let's band Bears the actual point you want to make is that everybody should have unlicensed

1903
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:32,608
Unregulated Thomas Jefferson had a bear than everybody should have a bear

1904
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:36,192
Actually that one does make sense pretty.

1905
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:42,848
This episode was fun it was fun

1906
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:44,896
Heavenly knowledge fight contact

1907
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,688
Upset

1908
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:47,712
Terrifier

1909
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:52,320
Big Sur so much more interesting

1910
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,856
Stuff to dig into

1911
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:55,648
Nair then a lot of the present day

1912
01:35:56,160 --> 01:36:02,304
It's really nice to have that to that little break

1913
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:03,328
It's going to

1914
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:09,728
It's going to kill us all that little break-ins will I will

1915
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:10,496
Pikalox

1916

Need to shape up 19 years overdue he's got some time is he can figure it
