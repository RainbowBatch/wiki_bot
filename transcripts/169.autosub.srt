Interesting podcasts

23
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,136
I was hoping

24
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:31,904
Actually

25
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,952

Listen to the podcast

51
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
Have decided

52
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
Whether or not to go

53
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864

Thank you

58
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:31,456
Yeah so I wanted today but I wanted to do is that I wanted to

59
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
Celebrate

60
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
City of Austin

61
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:40,672
Yes and I will say that I have found a great Austin related episode for the live show

62
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
But I found another offer

63
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,584
Episode ostomy episode

64
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,680
Episode is that like Schaumburg Chicago

65
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,216
Is that the kind of thing

66
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Sort of

67
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,544
Like about Red Rock

68
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,104
Or whatever

69
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
Redwall

70
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,992
Series of books about mice fighting

Jacques

72
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,160
But before we get to today's episode

73
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,047
I should say we did record an episode over the weekend we were going to release on Monday and the universe soft

74
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,839
To not let that be recorded

75
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
And it got lost

76
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,191
It was

77
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,495
It's really fascinating because

78
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:30,591
The entire episode was essentially about how

79
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,991
You felt it that what we are talking about doing that episode

80
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:43,391
Cosmically we then did not do that we were talking about how everyone should ignore Alex's,

81
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:52,095
Bizarrely the episode doesn't record as if it were God's a

82
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
We actually recorded the Epic

83
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:58,239
Right I can guarantee that this isn't some way that were stealth say

84
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:04,639
That you should drink some MB

85
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:11,039
In that episode we did Cover also a little bit of the other stuff that Alex talked about on that Friday episode

86
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,975
So important that no one is talking about that we do need to play here at the beginning of this episode

87
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:23,071
Not heard by The Beatles last night I can almost remember

88
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:29,471
From the June 8th 2018 episode of The Alex Jones Show

89
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:33,823
The show a couple hours before he calls in

90
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,615
To talk about Anthony Bourdain

91
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
He calls in to say

92
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,527
Alex how refreshing is it to be a president

93
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,111
That essentially flips the bird to the globalist

94
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:14,271
The only place rustic line.

95
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:27,071
Resources for x or landmaster

96
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
Yikes right

97
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,127
We freaked out and screamed about this for like 10 minutes yesterday

98
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:46,527
No need to sort of recreate

99
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,391
Hot intelligence services

100
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
Hook up with Russia

101
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,719
Dominate the world

102
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,255
Geographically

103
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,047
Dominate

104
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
So that's

105
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:03,935
Not great which I believe

106
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,519
Dominating a globe makes one a global list

107
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,615
The only thing about that I still cannot get over is

108
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,919
What is the third faction of the paddock

109
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
What is it

110
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:21,855
So we got the Patriots we've got one confirmed faction the other one is

111
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
Or at least

112
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:27,743
Controlled vampires

113
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
Miss Molly

114
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,863
Schnapps

115
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,471
A very

116
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,543
Patriots Patriots

117
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:46,431
The globalist do battle International

118
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:52,831
Sit around and just laughing like a ha ha ha

119
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,183
Absolutely

120
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
Like you can trust

121
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:05,119
Aficionado there so absorbed

122
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,959
Communicate

123
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,775
Have they turned

124
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
Coded language

125
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
None. It's like you're all right

126
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:22,527
We're going to be going over is the November 30th

127
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
20

128
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
14

129
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
An episode of

130
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,367
Of the Alex Jones

131
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
I'd like Mary Austin

132
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,279
See if you have any idea why I

133
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,815
Have chosen this as an Oscar

134
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,839
Destiny episode

135
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,631
November 30th

136
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
2014

137
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,983
Right

138
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,287
See what happens in

139
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:51,711
Just at the first Thanksgiving

140
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,271
Christ was crucified then correct

141
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,087
They do

142
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
No

143
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
Alright correct

144
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
Bethlehem

145
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
Are you sure

146
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,511
November 28th

147
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,327
A 220 something in the morning

148
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,655
Larry McWilliams

149
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,239
What

150
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,287
A ton of bullets

151
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:20,383
At the police station

152
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
Mexican consulate

153
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,199
Also shot a bunch of bullets

154
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,735
Epi Federal Courthouse

155
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,783
D i was shot down by a cop

156
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
Eventually

157
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:31,135
You had let me die written in marker across his chest

158
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:36,255
He also in his pocket had a copy of a book

159
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
That's where the Hydra

160
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,679
Exactly.

161
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
2-acre

162
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:53,919
Call Dee

163
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,735
It's kind of like a loose-knit a group

164
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:01,087
Call yourself a priest in this Phineas priesthood

165
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,927
And he had a book about them and their history and its occupants like

166
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,487
As if you it was Catcher in the Rye for him

167
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,047
Which speaks volumes about

168
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,327
What he was about

169
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,655
So I went in the outback

170
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,055
Some of that I knew

171
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,151
Probably

172
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,015
There was more property damage

173
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
From what I've been able to go

174
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,343
The most Austin

175
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,391
Mass shooting I can think of that

176
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,743
Even their Mass Shooters like we don't want to hurt it

177
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,047
I don't think I want to

178
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,495
Congruent

179
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,567
You got to go to the Mexican consulate after that

180
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,407
Also our friend art Acevedo

181
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Police chief

182
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
Yeah

183
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Speculate

184
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
That there was real

185
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,807
To believe that the attack

186
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,855
You've been politically motivated

187
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:12,255
An anti-government attack

188
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
Also might be linked

189
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,583
To feelings about immigration

190
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
Being a

191
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,679
You tried to set the Mexican consulate on Spotify

192
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,727
Alright

193
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
Acevedo

194
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,335
Seems pretty obvious

195
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,223
From Texas monthly shooting up

196
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,271
Consulate shortly after President Obama

197
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,319
Executive order regarding immigration

198
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,463
Certainly

199
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,047
He's also if you looked over.

200
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,631
If you looked over social media you'd find that he had

201
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,655
How's the lottery

202
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
Positives

203
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,703
Stuff about Ron Paul

204
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,799
Some sort of connection that he had their philosophically

205
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:13,695
No that was the thing that was that count to the bank

206
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,487
I just knocked out of the bank

207
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:21,119
Up to the colors you have to stand on the thing

208
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,447
Bullets up in the area according to the law

209
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Okay

210
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,543
So I would also accept sliding a piece of paper

211
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
To the teller the

212
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:35,199
Because I have a flashlight

213
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,319
This guy was a mess

214
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
He had a lot of them

215
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
Indications that he might be

216
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
The guy

217
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
Would be doing this

218
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
Skyrim stuff

219
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
He ended up

220
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,023
Getting shot by a cop

221
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:59,519
Judy is an old white guys 49 year old white guy

222
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,847
Galaxy around

223
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
Stop it

224
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,479
Stop

225
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,575
Because the guys in old white dude Alex has some complicated feelings about it

226
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,879
And again

227
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,439
Kind of a fan Alex doesn't really know what

228
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,975
To do with it and we'll watch him

229
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,047
Spinners wheel

230
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
And on the 28th

231
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
He took the day off

232
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,399
The 28th was a Friday

233
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
He took that off

234
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,727
Because he's like she busy masturbating to this guy

235
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
Thanksgiving

236
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,847
Maybe maybe Thanksgiving

237
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,407
Panera pre-recorded show does really funny

238
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:42,783
To listen to the morning

239
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:49,183
Great interview with Michael Savage

240
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
Alright

241
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
All right bro

242
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,535
So here's the first clip where Alex

243
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
Disgust is what he

244
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
He thinks is going on

245
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,935
The 30th of November

246
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,983
2014

247
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,263
Also wanted most defensive

248
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
Things I've ever heard of the Chevy place

249
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
ZZ Top

250
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103

00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,759
For 6 p.m. central

252
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,487
Bottom of the hour

253
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,631
As much as possible

254
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,239
Talk about

255
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,055
Austin Texas

256
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,383
We're a few days ago we had

257
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,199
22 am

258
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:50,623
Running around shooting up the police station the Mexican consulate and

259
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,023
He's right here

260
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,559
Who's my hero

261
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,911
Hero I'll give you on that event

262
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,727
Austin shooter

263
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:10,335
Government motive

264
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:15,199
I saw some online videos of ninja swords and stopping

265
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:20,575
If it's the same Mo as the sky on East Coast

266
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,463
Okay okay

267
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:33,631
Your take on this one

268
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,679
You want him to have a gun he already had swords

269
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,263
The police station

270
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,079
Training

271
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:51,551
Smoke bombs

272
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,695
I would say David in present day or so you wouldn't

273
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,791
Alex doesn't like this this argument of like they're mentally ill

274
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Folks

275
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,143
Notre to throw bombs at Pharmaceutical

276
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,543
They're all just

277
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,335
Already

278
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
Allowed for this

279
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,407
To be like right

280
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:23,807
Any chance video game in this year

281
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Please compare

282
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,135
Oh okay

283
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,951
Quite shooter right

284
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:33,535
That is not going to go with

285
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
He starts with

286
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,351
This guy lives

287
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
What I pray

288
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
No

289
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:44,031
He's not going to say that he's not going to say that word for word what this guy does is what I tell

290
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,591
You're not going to like this

291
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,127
I'm not going to like this

292
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,943
I just sent you email people

293
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,575
You don't really know when they're going to strike

294
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,279
Bolts incidences of

295
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,751
How do you do that

296
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
Dad

297
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,455
The problem is

298
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,295
As awful as that is there's a certain part of my brain that's like

299
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:34,719
I never would have made that connection man

300
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,535
Never would I have even considered that

301
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
Possible to connect those two events

302
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
I don't know

303
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,375
Goodonya Alex

304
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,935
We're figuring out the single worst narrative

305
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,471
That is humanly possible

306
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,263
I don't understand why you would

307
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,663
Put those pieces

308
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
Alex is going to say

309
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:59,551
How could I possibly put those two piece

310
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:05,951
Shooter that shot of the f****** Mexican consulate in Ferguson does Ferguson have a Mexican consulate

311
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,231
Why does Austin have Amex

312
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,559
Chicken consulate that was another question of Texas

313
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,887
Is Austin On the Border

314
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
Not quite

315
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,239
Calm down

316
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:25,407
You should a hundred percent of seeing that, can I take a nap

317
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,455
What are the similarities

318
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,527
The end of November 2014

319
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Alex's

320
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,343
Desperate to discredit

321
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
The situation in

322
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,415
Ferguson because it doesn't

323
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:40,255
It does not look good right we have a situation we're just

324
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,327
Not too long before where we're at right now

325
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
The

326
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,911
I wish I had the

327
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
The exact date

328
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,215
The policeman

329
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
Who shot Michael Brown

330
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,639
Wilson was acquitted

331
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
I have the right date

332
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
Exact

333
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,015
Of course I should have

334
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
Obviously made the connection

335
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,367
That Alex would make a negative connection

336
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
Shinto

337
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,671
A white man

338
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,975
Murdering

339
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,071
Right and then everybody be

340
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,375
Rightfully outraged by that

341
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
To a white man

342
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
Shooting up

343
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,495
Police station

344
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,543
The Mexican

345
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
Consulate

346
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,335
And that of course

347
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,735
What's in front of him in his own City

348
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
Is an act of War

349
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
Supremacist

350
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
Active White

351
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:46,047
What is the reaction to

352
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,119
The states

353
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,751
Perspective

354
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,079
You just made me feel really good even after all this time

355
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
See things through Alex

356
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,807
Look at it like

357
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
You've gone native

358
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,647
I'm willing to throw this guy under the bus

359
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:19,583
Even though he's my guy the only way I'm going to do that is if on the way out I can't

360
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,887
Two legitimate protest

361
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,167
Right

362
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,983
You know might have involved a little bit loading here in there

363
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:32,383
That wasn't the entire protest even most of it

364
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,455
There's an argument to be made

365
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,735
Who cares

366
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271
Did the issue is

367
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
You take

368
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,855
White terrorism

369
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,135
Black Proto

370
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,207
Right conflate the two and all of a sudden you can

371
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:50,815
Can complain about both of them in the same way it appears that your Rising above

372
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,351
The racial tension

373
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,959
I'm just trying to get us a fight with each other

374
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,495
Literally deranged

375
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,311
Lunatic shut up a bunch of

376
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,847
Police Federal Building

377
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
Tried to burn down the next

378
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,687
Can consulate like now this is a protest

379
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,479
We could go line-by-line

380
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,295
Everything that that guy did Alex

381
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,831
Suggested that people should do

382
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,135
To certain extent I'm sure he

383
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,256
I guarantee

384
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
I would never

385
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
Force you to do all this

386
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,400
But if you went through everything that Alex Jones said

387
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,424
From like 2,000

388
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,776
132

389
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,568
Sooner or later you get like

390
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,616
You should shoot up the police station

391
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,664
Does courthouses need to be shut up

392
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,736
I got Mexican consulate

393
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:44,320
I got

394
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,880
You know what

395
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:51,232
Who does it got a bad feeling about those people I'm very proud

396
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
But that man

397
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,792
Conflict that's worse than the DM

398
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,120
I tried to get my Mexican citizenship

399
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
Two papers there

400
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
And they were like

401
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
You're not

402
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
It's very it's very difficult

403
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:05,824
Alex is operating on a bunch of real hard

404
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,104
Hard-and-fast

405
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Sources

406
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:11,968
Write imaginary information

407
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,760
Imaginary

408
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,392
Never like that

409
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,184
I never liked that

410
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
Say quotes

411
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,768
Don't like that

412
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,584
Flash wait for criticizing

413
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,960
Police shooting

414
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,008
Fpi just got shot

415
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,056
Real quick about those FBI agents

416
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,616
CNBC article about that

417
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,688
Two FBI agents were shot at a barricaded home just miles

418
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,504
From the protest rack st. Louis suburb of Fergus

419
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
It's an early one.

420
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
Play police.

421
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,624
Both suffered non-life-threatening injuries after the shooting in Norfolk

422
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
St. Louis County

423
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,440
The incident occurred around 3:50

424
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,720
Teen a.m. local time

425
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:59,328
Authorities in St Louis County for dealing with violent protests after a grand jury decided not to

426
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
In Divergent

427
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,632
Some police officer Darren Wilson

428
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,192
Over the fatal shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown

429
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,264
It was not immediately clear whether the shooting was connected

430
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
The teddy on rest

431
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,592
So it's probably completely unrelated saying

432
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,360
At the time that Alex

433
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:16,736
Able to report on it

434
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,016
Is this the same city

435
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,832
How far away were they from Ferguson's

436
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,672
Question why don't the cops ever invest

437
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,024
All sorts of stuff happened

438
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,120
That makes protesting

439
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
NSAID

440
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,752
Necessary

441
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,568
That is not you should not be allowed to

442
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,848
Who's close quote

443
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
According

444
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,688
This was an article in Time Magazine

445
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,552
Not the villain

446
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,344
Violent protests

447
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,368
Violent riots

448
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,648
Necessary

449
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
The headline was

450
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,536
Right

451
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,376
Do you a bit of that article that Alec

452
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
I want to deal with

453
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
He's never read it

454
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,960
Probably quote

455
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
MLK's

456
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,384
Letters from a burn

457
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,432
No it's just more of a

458
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
A discussion of

459
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,296
The realities are in our modern time in Iraq

460
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
And

461
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,648
Violent protests

462
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,440
The Tea Party Boston

463
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,208
Some tea party was

464
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,488
Being the way it is B

465
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,816
Writing is only ever looked

466
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,352
Bad when

467
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,424
The group that doesn't plan

468
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
Always

469
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
Look

470
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,312
2 people who really don't like

471
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,848
The content of what the protests

472
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
It's just

473
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
It's not the right way to do that

474
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
It's

475
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,040
To just accept it

476
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:58,112
That you're going to get f***** in the ass for the rest of your life

477
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,392
And for the rest of your children

478
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,696
534 the rest of America

479
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,000
That's the right way to go about

480
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,048
Sure sure

481
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,864
I don't want it I don't want

482
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,168
You deep into that cuz we will get into in a little bit

483
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,240
For now I want Alex to get back to these headlines

484
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,520
Cuz he's got some

485
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,568
He's got barnburners

486
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,896
Medline

487
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
Story

488
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,968
But a link from CNN

489
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,248
And a link from time Maggie

490
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,528
Alright that sort of thing

491
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:33,696
He goes Wherever not much to talk

492
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,096
Turn off

493
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,888
Now everything is always a

494
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
Okay

495
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:49,312
Well we're going to Riot

496
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
Necessary

497
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,896
That's from time

498
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
It's not

499
00:25:55,968 --> 00:26:02,112
Ferguson protesters were peaceful

500
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
From

501
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,208
Infowars Time Magazine

502
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,792
A protecting Ferguson businesses

503
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,584
Another result

504
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:15,168
Explosive Infowars Nightly News Last Friday Night

505
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:18,240
So there's an article about have the brave

506
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:21,568
Brave Oath Keepers are protected

507
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,432
Heather being attacked by protesters

508
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:33,856
Right now picking up want to talk about is Alex in the last clip before this one

509
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,952
We'll talk about how there's so much going on involving like the Saint Louis

510
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,488
Situation

511
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,048
Hey this is great

512
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:45,120
This is not going to be a full episode where we talked about the

513
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:51,008
Realities of Ferguson that other people have done much better jobs than we ever will

514
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:55,616
Entirely

515
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,944
It's really difficult for me not to

516
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,248
To point out that during the entire concert

517
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,528
Immigration with Ferguson

518
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:09,184
Policeman was relieved of Duty and say Louis effort was caught on camera and Oath Keepers meeting rattling off horribly

519
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,232
Racist homophobic nonsense

520
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
What

521
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,792
In the police

522
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,072
There was a white

523
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:20,960
He said that there are at least four sodomites on the Supreme Court and called Barack Obama art

524
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:25,568
Quote undocumented president from Kenya who is also later

525
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,616
Went

526
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,968
Hovering

527
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,760
The protests for CNN

528
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,784
Yeah

529
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,856
Physically assaulted him

530
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,904
Camera

531
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,352
Right so that was a guy with the oath keeper

532
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,400
Keepers

533
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,704
Kind of mentality

534
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
Hey

535
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,264
Do you know what they do though

536
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,800
And you got to give him this

537
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,360
They keep their oats

538
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,128
Sure

539
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,920
To be racist

540
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:10,112
To keep if you think that this is a like a like an isolated incident during the same time

541
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
Policeman real birth of the

542
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,232
Department was suspended after video came out of him pointing

543
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,000
Semi automatic

544
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,304
Quick service rifle at peaceful protesters in

545
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,840
Screaming should have done like quote

546
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,168
I will f****** kill you

547
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:29,568
Very strong strange Behavior also

548
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,872
The policeman Matthew prepared we was on

549
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,432
Patrol during the Ferguson protest would end up being suspended

550
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,456
For posting stuff

551
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,736
On Facebook like quote

552
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,832
These protesters should have been put down like a rabid dog the first night

553
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,856
And quote

554
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,416
Where is a muslim with a backpack when you need it

City Coronavirus

557
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:56,448
It doesn't take any pics I have utility

558
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,264
At least at least he's 142 and that's

559
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:05,152
Also everybody talks about and rightfully so I don't think it's wrong to talk about Michael Brown

560
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:10,016
But it would be really pissed and I'll point out the during.

561
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,320
Queen Michael Brown's murder

562
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:16,416
The acquittal of Darren Wilson many other on our black man

00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440

Say I'm so that could be

568
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,056
Casinos

569
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:33,824
Pretty terrible

570
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,224
Long long history that goes back Beyond

571
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:45,856
I believe the dollop integrate episode covering that's if you want to learn more about that from the check it out

In-depth situation going on there and his

574
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,744
Dia of like

575
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,560
Please pour Oath Keepers trying to protect the business

576
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:00,704
Chiweenie 49 year-old

577
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,104
Situation works itself out

578
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,640
In some ways

579
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,432
I mean I don't I don't mean to

580
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,016
Like you could have really killed a lot of people

581
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,296
He was motivated

582
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
It is very naked

583
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,136
We're talkin about we're back to

584
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,696
McWilliams

585
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,840
Yeah the answer is no

586
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,632
The answers honestly no

587
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,424
There's look I'm not

588
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,824
I'm not saying that there should be some sort of government Final Solution on white men over the age of 40

589
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:43,968
I'm not saying that that's a good idea what I am saying is that there is no

590
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,784
To the fact that we would be better off without the

591
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,600
I'm sorry bro there's no reasonable argument

592
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,136
I'm sorry bro just B has been

593
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,208
Alright alright

594
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,256
Clearly

595
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,352
Born in the show Alex

596
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,400
It sort of made his point

597
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,680
And that is

598
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,728
Use literal white terrorism

599
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,776
As being the same as black protest

600
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
Which isn't true

601
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,920
But

602
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,016
I respect that you've been concise

603
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:24,416
Because at this point it's not very far into the episode it's maybe 10 minutes in

604
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,952
From here on out

605
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,976
To try and approach from

606
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,000
Different direction

607
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,840
So if he keeps talking about this though eventually he's going to be like

608
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:35,424
Aaliyah big fan of this white terrorists right

609
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,240
Like the more he talked about it the more is going to

610
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,032
Leak through the little cracks

611
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:40,800
Axon is

612
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
Rhetoric

613
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,200
Guadalest exploit Isis

614
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,504
Black Friday

615
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,808

616
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,208
That I seen the culture a white Friday

617
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:04,608
Rivers gallbladder problem probably

618
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,144
He's talking about

619
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,448
Diane Black Friday

620
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,752
He's going to try and tie and Black Friday

621
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,544
That is

622
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,824
The globalist

623
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,384
Lower those prices

624
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,712
So much make sure that

625
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,016
People will trample over each other

626
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,064
And remain divided

627
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,112
In order to keep us from

628
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
Fighting against the globe

629
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,928
Interesting Theory

630
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,720
That's it

631
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,024
Social Engineers are using the right effect

632
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,008
Free home

633
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,712
He said that's right that's right

634
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,272
Sorry

635
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,576

Alright

642
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,464
So

643
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,232
Yeah

644
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,768
White terrorism

645
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,328
It's Ferguson

646
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,352
Fault

647
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,912
Black Friday

648
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,984
He's just associating

649
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,056
Whatever it is that. Is my

650
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,592
If it was

651
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:56,736
If it was Christmas he would have been like commercializing Christmas if it was the Easter he would have been like we've got the our Easter sales

652
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,784
Like he would have just done whatever is

653
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,856
Regional Airline

654
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,392
They just mad cuz he had to go shopping

655
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:07,488
The other day

656
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,536
Well it doesn't like

657
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,072
Does end up being like a

658
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,352
5-minute ramp

659
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,424
On the show it goes on quite a while

660
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:20,544
Stop sales tax that is

661
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,872
What's up

662
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,504
I'm out

663
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,832
Consumerism for Quality consumerism

664
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:39,232
As a merchant as some of the cells and developed products very successful

665
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:45,632
I know what specials and deals

666
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,448
Because the scam of Walmart and Target

667
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,752
They raise the prices the week before

668
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
Discount

669
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:58,176
We don't do that,

670
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,480
T-shirt high-quality supplements

671
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:04,832
Water filters

672
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,928
The whole thing

673
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:13,024
Pretty impressive

674
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:21,472
Realistically

675
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,520
Ferguson is bad

676
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:29,920
But not in the way you think

677
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
Stand-alone

678
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,016
It's cuz he's got the pivot from

679
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:40,416
White terrorism threats from black Friday's an inside job to a Wii

680
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,184
Wheel of something

681
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,768
Consumerism

682
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,792
He's again

683
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:50,912
Consumerism just the Mindless type

684
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:55,776
Wahoo

685
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:02,176
Also by the way

686
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,200
No no

687
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,760
This behavior that I authentically condemned

688
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,808
Yes it is still terrible

689
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,832
But not

690
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,112
The way

691
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:15,744
Play it look okay the Bible is all about those like don't lie

692
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,400

693

White Lies

694
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,216
You know that's no big deal

695
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,008
White means good

696
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
Live

697
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:31,360
GoodLife generally sales are like two

698
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,896
Determined based off MSRP

699
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,176
Not off what does

700
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,200
Surprise

701
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,088
As two people put out

702
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,368

That one button

705
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:51,072

Wonderful wonderful man

708
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,688
That could be interesting

709
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:10,016
I did send my shirts a text message

710
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,040
Nope

711
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,344

At pivot and I expect

720
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,152
Of course

721
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,944
This shooting that happened in Austin

722
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:39,968
He lives in Austin

723
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,504
Responsibility

724
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,832
But you're

725
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,648
Can't talk about it without bring up Ferguson

726
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,696
The only thing that he can do

727
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,072
Because to me

728
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,888
Police station

729
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,192
Mexican consulate Federal Building

731
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:10,176
Democratic Party

732
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,856
Black neighborhood

733
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,136
Funny

734
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,976
Mr. Brown Tujunga

00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,792
I need some Thug from the cops on the fridge

736
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,680
Even well

737
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:34,240
While trying to decry

738
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,800
The Democratic party's co-option

739
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,848
Of these peaceful protest

740
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,176
And turning them into a racist attack

741
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,712
Meant to divide

742
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:49,344
Even though even in the middle of doing that he's still got to be racist as f***

743
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,368
Now might not

744
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:54,208
Got the time to show you this

745
00:38:54,464 --> 00:39:00,608
Covers for dollars at cost for $72

746
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:07,008

747
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,568
So kindly got for us by listener Keegan

748
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,896
Look at the cover of that b****

749
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,432
Great

750
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,712
So

751
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:21,600
Forever watching a cover of the Infowars magazine

752
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,672
Scott George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin is a half

753
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,720
And half of the same face

754
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:30,048
With the words divide-and-conquer under it as if to suggest

755
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,608
That murderer and victim are the same

756
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,912
This is his

757
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,728
This is where he's at but he's not like this one to white person

758
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,496
The victim

759
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:42,336
He's never here

760
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:45,920
He's made a cottage industry out of demonizing immigrants

761
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,200
Because of this

762
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
Is accident

763
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,856
Just a few hands

764
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,904
Mexican gentleman

765
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,184
Because it wasn't

766
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,976
Shot that

767
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,280
Accidentally went off of bounce off of concrete

768
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,816
There's no intent

769
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,608
So like that

770
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,656
What I mean this is

771
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,216
It's hard to take him at all

772
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,752
Seriously

773
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,032
Just like

774
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,616
You with your saying that Michael Brown is a thug

775
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,896
Didn't you think that the police

776
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,456
Didn't lie and you acted responsibly

777
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,016
I know where you coming from bro

778
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,808
Same place

779
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,464
McWilliams

780
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,816
Like you saw the video evidence no other way

781
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,936
So

782
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,728
That's why my favorite article

783
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,008
Goes to read our

784
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,080
Ones written by people who are like

785
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,360
We need to

786
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,128
Standees

787
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,944
They don't like being called racer

788
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,736
Because racist

789
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,760
Is a bad word

790
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,648
Are they

791
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,976
How could you prove this racism

792
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,280
They don't like that label.

793
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:09,888
You can't tell them that the race I would offend him

794
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,680
I wouldn't like it either

795
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
F*** yourself

796
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,496
I don't like

797
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,776
The label cross eye

798
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,312
I either but

799
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,944
Might be choosing

800
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,016
Right Alex Jones

801
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:31,392
You got to you got to wear that race cannot go buddy

802
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,464
If you want to put out a magazine with a cover

803
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,024
Stab magazine

804
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:42,400

Join in

806
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,472
I didn't edit this point with Alex

807
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,752
Dwindling numbers

808
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,032
All across the board

809
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,568
His best bet is to just

810
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,384
Put all the chips in white.

811
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,783
What you first have to have crossover appeal

812
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,599
The last year Alex Jones

813
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,391
Go to alexa.com

814
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,231

817
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,607
In terms of

818
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,375
His position

819
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,399
As a website

820
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,423
They're expanding

821
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,727
3000

822
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:22,079
3200 Orso 4100

823

241

824
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:25,151
100 in the last year that's uncanny

825
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
A terrible drop

826
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
Weird times

827
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:30,271
DoubleDown

828
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,159
He just loses listeners of on both

829
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:42,559
Remedy loses the actual hardcore big if you're not hardcore

830
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,631
Exactly

831
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,191
Also make art

832
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,727
Very different because

833
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:53,055
Finally everybody in the you know

834
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,871
Rightwingwatch svr will be like

835
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,151
Oh we can just discount

836
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:57,919
He's a white knife

837
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,199
F*** off

838
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,479
Maybe

839
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,271
So

840
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,295
I would like to tell you

841
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,575
Pointwise

842
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,111
He's always right about

843
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:13,535
Cuz it was

844
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,655
It's no secret at all

845
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,239
To repeat it

846
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,287
Jeffrey

847
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,567
So

848
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,127
I've been able to

849
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:28,895
The Gleam

850
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,175
That most of his own

851
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:30,943
Understanding from

852
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,711
Mystery

853
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
Green

854
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,087
I might've

855
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,159
No I just

856
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,183
Like I have a

857
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,487
Weird thing about those

858
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,255
Like

859
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,535
You just

860
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,863
Get fit just a little bit wrong like like take it for granite

861
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:49,887
Granite

862
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,287
The possibility I might have

863
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,567
But have you always

864
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,895
No

865
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,711
Idea

866
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,271
Could you maybe one of the faith

867
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
Who

868
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,087
Gleams

869
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,391
Mask

870
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,671
There

871
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:17,023
The cube in a cube

872
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,559
Hey there fairies

873
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,863
Lake Anna midsummer

874
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,751
Leave you hanging

875
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,775
Enjoy it

876
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,359
Adverb

877
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,639
I've deduced

878
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:39,039
Got some fun with that one

879
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,599
But I figured out that most of Alex

880
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,879
History

881
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,415
Understanding at 9

882
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
90 books about

883
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,487
Write all these books about this

884
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,023
Civil War

885
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:49,791
Just comes from

886
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,095
And Nazi

887
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,143
As demonstrated by the

888
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:00,287
The American Revolution

889
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:03,103
Nope

890
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,151
You have some problem

891
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:08,479
But because markedly after

892
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:12,063
The seven year war

893
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,367
And the final ratification

894
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:20,767
It created

895
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,679
Some people

896
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:33,055
And so America became the Revolutionary idea

897
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,871
Savers

898
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,015
The elites

899
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:45,599
The American system

900
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,951
By the 18th

901
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,999
When people get

902
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,559
We can't compete with regulations

903
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:57,119
Child labor

904
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,423
Flavor

905
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,263
We can't compete with

906
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,287
To take it over

907
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,591
You see the rise of JPMorgan

908
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,639
Rockefellers

909
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:12,223
By the Dutch royal family

910
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,247
Rothschild

911
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,111
The robber barons Rothschild

912
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:22,207
If we they were regulated

913
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:29,119
The other opposition

914
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,167
Okay

915
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,471
I think the problem is clear

916
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,287
People having

917
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,591
So we should do something about that right

918
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,407
There's another problem that is like all that history

919
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,175
Korean Lord

920
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,759
So accurately has

921
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:46,783
Declared

922
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
You believe that

923
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,367
A lot of a lot of history.

924
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
Come from his

925
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
None dare call it

926
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:52,927
SeaWorld

927
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,487
We will be dealing with

928
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,535
To detail

929
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,583
Revolution

930
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,423
The model

931
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:07,775
Because everybody

932
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,567
Not a good model

933
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,359
Terrible model

934
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:17,759
It was a bad model I apologize Freedom that will get coverage

935
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,831
Freemason Abbey restaurant

936
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:24,671
Favorite

937
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:29,791
Freedom

938
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:33,119
Selective breeding

939
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,167
So that's a little bit

940
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:40,287
Maybe you don't have a great grandpa

941
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:47,199
Books that are filled with lies I would say that it is uncanny

942
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,063
What the

943
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,111
This is the guiding Quest

944
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,135
Of the show

945
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,439
Right where he to be

946
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,975
Are you not lunatics

947
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,743
Person

948
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,119
Bright

949
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,679
You would open up the phone

950
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:10,495
I'd like have a reasonable conversation about the

951
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:14,335
Right but as soon as I heard him ask this guiding question

952
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,615
I said to myself

953
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,943
No goddamn way he's answering that question

954
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:23,295
Rebellion

955
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:31,999
We should have this topic all throughout the week not just on this Sunday show

956
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,559
This is such a big issue

957
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,655
You're not going to cover this at all and I'm going to guess with your next

958
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,447
What is legit

959
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,519
I feel like it's like

960
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,543
Court definition

961
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,311
New

962
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,407
I take everything on a case-by-case basis

963
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,967
This is a lot of there's a lot of

964
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,991
Circumstantial stuff

965
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:56,319
Cross-culturally that

966
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:58,879
To us doesn't apply to other folk you know

967
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:01,183
In terms of the historical

968
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:04,511
Basis of our society

969
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,303
The revolution

970
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,863
The Japanese newspaper system

971
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:15,519
Circa I remember that amazing music

972
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,543
The Japanese

973
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:22,943
Portmanteau

974
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,015
Feel good doesn't feel good coming out of your mouth

975
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,087
I almost said it and I was like

976
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,183
I could defend it in a court of law

977
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,207
I think so.

978
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:37,535
I think where I put on trial

979
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,215
Boxer

980
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,543
I'm actually going with

981
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:52,895
Rebellion I felt like that when was pretty good Vine with it

982
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:56,479
I also think it might therefore what a legitimate Rebellion

983
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,247
Probably Falls

984
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:00,319
Berkeley lower than Alex's

985
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,087
That like

986
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,583
It's very it's very,

987
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:15,935
Because later in this episode I don't I didn't keep it in because Alex doesn't respond to

988
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:19,519
If you responded in any way I would have kept

989
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,311
Equipment

990
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,079
Truecaller WhatsApp

991
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:24,895
Legitimate reason like what the final straw for you

992
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,687
And the caller says

993
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,759
If I see the government rounding people up

994
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:36,159
That it's time but that's the final straw

995
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,719
20

996
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,743
17

997
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:42,559
When the immigration policy was enacted

998
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,095
He saw

999
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:48,959
That the government was rounding people up I decided that was my break

1000
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,775
King point until he has absolutely

1001
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,543
Sure

1002
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,079
Confirm that you will

1003
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:57,151
Stop doing this because I don't know who this caller was

1004
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:01,247
I'm not worried about Alex

1005
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:05,087
Just moves on to another topic after the caller said right

1006
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:07,135
Absolutely that is a Line in the Sand

1007
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,023
Is callers words on him

1008
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,303
Although I would assume

1009
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,351
But back then

1010
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,119
Superlatives

1011
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:21,983
Hey cuz how you get supplies by FEMA camps all the time

1012
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:27,359
Though what we are aware of now

1013
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,895
Is that that is not

1014
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,175
Our threshold for reveler

1015
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,455
Turns out it's not

1016
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,271
Turns out that if the government is great

1017
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,111
Yeah I would love

1018
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,135
I would love

1019
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,159
A Egypt

1020
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
We should be

1021
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,951
Revolution

1022
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,303
The government is rounding up people separating them from their families

1023
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,887
F****** police are murdering people

1024
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,935
The all of our Institution

1025
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,471
Are f****** destroyed

1026
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,007
They are left in

1027
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,031
This is

1028
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:56,799
Perfect

1029
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
Revolution

1030
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:03,455
It turns out that I

1031
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,551
People's Revolution

1032
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,831
I want to join in

1033
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,623
But I'm not going to be the guy to

1034
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,695
Throw the first f****** Stone it's pathetic I hate myself

1035
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,999
It's a complicated thing and I don't

1036
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,279
I don't

1037
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:24,959
Right there but the reason that I don't I don't agree with you and I feel kind of shity that I don't agree with you

1038
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,239
Is that ice

1039
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,263
Still don't think

1040
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,799
If that's the right way to deal with it

1041
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:32,127
Right I still think that what you're going to end up doing

1042
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,151
In that case is making

1043
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,199
Things worse for the people who are large

1044
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,247
We're going to be French Revolution

1045
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:40,575
Unfortunate

1046
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:43,647
You and I are

1047
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,439
Described as even though we're

1048
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,743
Especially me pretty damn poor

1049
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:51,327
Barely boujee White young males

1050
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,143
I don't think we are in a very

1051
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,167
Trouble

1052
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:59,519
Position unless they try and organize

1053
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,311
Is orgo weatherman on people's asses

1054
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:05,407
Doesn't blow up

1055
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,455
The temperature bring awareness

1056
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,247
Plato people who are being

1057
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,039
Victimized by Ice

1058
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:15,391
There's a really decent chance at all that would end up happening is radicalizing war

1059
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,159
People

1060
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,183
And ice

1061
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:17,951
Remaking message

1062
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,975
Situation

1063
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:21,279
I don't know what the right solution is I don't

1064
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,303
Grudge people think

1065
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,327
VIP like

1066
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,607
We got to get

1067
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,679
Hoorah

1068
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,983
I don't know I still think of Courts

1069
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:35,871
Conceivably are the right way to go about the other card things around and Garfunkel

1070
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,407
I think the the

1071
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,431
My my

1072
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,991
Feelings are a general strike

1073
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:50,463
We're not trying to overthrow the government break

1074
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,743
Your s***

1075
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:57,631
I think we're finally going to f****** your s*** scale version of like a blocking traffic

1076
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,423
What happened

1077
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:05,055
Control the government

1078
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:09,151
F*** with your bottom line I guess I don't know I think there's a good in between

1079
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,943
And I just

1080
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:11,711
I don't know

1081
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,527
Anyways let's start

1082
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:17,599
What's up Alex Jose

1083
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,135

That is

1085
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:21,951
Here

1086
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,535
Where Alex is getting Petty coming in from a commercial

1087
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:46,527
Infowars.com

1088
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,599
Powerboat races 1996

1089
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,391
Coward

1090
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,695
Infowars.com

1091
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,999
So that's the shop

1092
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:56,767
Detect

1093
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:59,583
You take that little bit here comes that lie

1094
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,375
Here is

1095
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,655
Time Magazine

1096
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
On Friday

1097
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,727
Good work

1098
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,519
I just ripped off.

1099
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:10,079
I would love it

1100
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,687
So

1101
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,503
Slader

1102
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:22,623
He juggled Rush Limbaugh by dropping paper route

1103
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,671
After he's complaining about someone

1104
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:27,231
Ripping him off saying powered by truth

1105
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:30,559
Google did I couldn't figure I'm sure he's talked about going back but

1106
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:36,447
I couldn't figure out who he is

1107
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:40,543
Powered by truth

1108
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,823
Cuz that kind of suggest

1109
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,359
It's the same way that

1110
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,151
Things are powered by gasoline

1111
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,175
In Tavares you

1112
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:46,943
Burnet

1113
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,967
And transform it is

1114
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,527
Yeah

1115
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,391
Yep he's ripping off erotic in it

1116
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,719
He's women Opera

1117
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,279
Done before this but I like to imagine epistle

1118
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,583
Nanako beginning

1119
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,887
Not but

1120
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:06,911
These headlines

1121
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:26,111
It's not what the name sounds like but even like no matter what

1122
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,903
If there is a

1123
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,719
Is racism in the way he says that name

1124
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
Question

1125
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,047
You know

1126
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,351
Eun haoh

1127
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,375
Nai believe

1128
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:51,711
Wait do you like

1129
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,991
Comfortable

1130
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,599
Hard pass

1131
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:01,183
And she goes on to just say it's wonderful

1132
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:06,559
Okay

1133
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:09,631
Here's one out of

1134
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:13,727
Is lying when they say Ferguson protests were peaceful

1135
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,055
Those aren't articles from

1136
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:20,639
From CNN or any new articles that's just Infowars coverage

1137
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,407
Other article

1138
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,967
So now back to this time article

1139
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,527
Nautical that Alex's

1140
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:28,319
Saying goes on to

1141
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:31,135
Violent rioting is wonderful

1142
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,415
Cheese for it

1143
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,695
That's great

1144
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,231
Right I mean

1145
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,535
You you'd expect him to actually get into

1146
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,327
To be arguments the Nuance of instead of

1147
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:43,935
Misrepresenting the headline and then lying about what's in the body

1148
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:47,519
You know what it could be

1149
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,407
Look

1150
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,199
Basically all he does is

1151
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,991
Look I mean

1152
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:03,391
With that my tractor

1153
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,159
What's the capital

1154
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:07,487
Young honor Blackman

1155
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,303
Angry Bird

1156
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:16,959
Text and I know I know

1157
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,007
It's what we do with that anger that

1158
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,823
In such a case is rioting so wrong

1159
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:24,895
Rights are necessary part of the evolution of

1160
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:25,663
Society

1161
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,967
Unfortunately we do not live in the universe

1162
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:30,527
Utopia where people have the basic

1163
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,831
Human rights they deserve simply for existing

1164
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,111
Until we get there

1165
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,415
The legitimate frustration sorrow and pain

1166
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,975
Other marginalized because will boil over

1167
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,255
Spilling out into our street

1168
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,047
Has quote normal citizen

1169
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,327
Watch the event of

1170
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,863
Unfurl on their television

1171
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:45,887
I'm praying the Twitter feed

1172
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:48,191
There's a lot of head-shaking finger-pointing

1173
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,727
Privileged explanation going

1174
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,007
We wish to see

1175
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:51,775
Seclude against

1176
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,055
The people involved

1177
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:55,103
Does separated from our history as a nation

1178
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,639
Dehumanize the change agent

1179
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:59,199
Because of their bad and sometimes violent decision

1180
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:02,527
Because if we can separate the underlying racial tension

1181
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,319
The clearly exists in our country

1182
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,855
From the looting in the rioting of

1183
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:06,879
Select individuals

1184
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,927
We can continue to ignore the problem

1185
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,463
I would put forth

1186
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:13,279
The peaceful protesting is a luxury of those already in Maine

1187
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,047
Stream culture

1188
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:16,095
Those who can be assured

1189
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,887
Their voices will be heard without viola

1190
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,191
Those who can afford to wait for the chain

1191
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:20,959
They want

1192
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:25,823
I risk sounded racist but if it was a white kid there would be no riot

1193
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,151
Another person another person wrote on the T

1194
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:29,919
Tea party page

1195
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:35,039
History shows us that blacks in this country are more apt to Riot than any other population

1196
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:38,879
They're stirred up by racist black people instead out to cause problems

1197
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,647
End of story

1198
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,975
Set the post that she is referencing from a two-party base

1199
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,999
Sounds a lot like Alex

1200
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:49,375
Yep blacks in this country are more after Riot because they're one of the population

1201
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,679
They're one of the population still need to

1202
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:54,751
In the case of the 1992 riots about Rodney

1203
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,567
30 years of black people trying

1204
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:03,711
To talk about their struggles of racial profiling but still vastly unfair treatment came to a boil

1205
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,479
Sometimes

1206
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,247
Enough

1207
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,271
Is simply too much

1208
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:09,855
Then after that Catalyst event the landscape of Southern California

1209
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,391
The National League

1210
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,159
Police forces take

1211
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,487
At no point in the article does she

1212
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,255
She say

1213
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,863
Is good for the rioting is good

1214
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,167
Discuss the underlying causes

1215
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,447
And what's going on

1216
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:26,239
The conversation that Alex G

1217
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,263
Unwilling to

1218
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,799
She's on one

1219
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,591
Explains why it is

1220
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:32,127
Is a reasonable

1221
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,151
Thought

1222
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,455
It is not an irrational

1223
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:39,039
I thought it would be a rational if white people ride

1224
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:41,087
Over anything

1225
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,647
If that's an irrational thought

1226
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:45,695
If you've been depressed for

1227
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,463
Always

1228
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:48,255
If you are being murdered

1229
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,279
By the cops

1230
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,583
Who are ostensibly there to protect you

1231
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,119
Tannerite

1232
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,519
That's a totally reasonable thought

1233
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,799
It's another thing to I think

1234
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,823
Just like it wasn't

1235
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,151
Ask her if it was a

1236
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:07,967
Away from like

1237
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:09,247
It being

1238
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,271
A riot riot

1239
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,551
Do you know

1240
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,903
Also you also have to add in the fact that

1241
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,439
These stains

1242
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:19,487
The same things they are saying

1243
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:23,071
This isn't the right way to do it and all that bull

1244
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,607
They said

1245
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,375
Colin Kaepernick

1246
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,399
Buick

1247
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,935
It doesn't matter how severe

1248
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:33,311
What what does it matter if you write if they're going to say the same thing if you peacefully

1249
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,103
The bottom line is always

1250
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,175
Yeah exactly but I don't shut up

1251
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,247
Wait your turn that's never coming

1252
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,087
It's important

1253
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,951
I think some of that is important

1254
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:54,303
This is the article that Alex refuses to read Brett's misrepresent

1255
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,071
Service

1256
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,607
Of trying to tie the situation

1257
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,375
Ferguson

1258
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,911
To this dumb dumb

1259
01:01:59,167 --> 01:01:59,679
White

1260
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:02,495
Springhill can't believe he's tried and tried to set fire to the Mexico

1261
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,775
Can consulate at 2 in the morning

1262
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,055
And was not drunk

1263
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,359
Had a serious like legit plan

1264
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,895
A head-to-head he's gone

1265
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,431
How to getaway car

1266
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:13,759
He laid out his funeral clothes at home

1267
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,527
With a note

1268
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,319
He left a bag of food for his

1269
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,855
Pat's on his neighbor's door

1270
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:24,511
You know you can tell the FBI you didn't know anyting no one knows about this

1271
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,303
He had his braces

1272
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,071
Hover

1273
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,095
Write this guy

1274
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,399
This was not like a I'm drunk

1275
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:32,959
2 in the morning on a set the Mexican consulate on fire

1276
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,727
Cuz

1277
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,007
I don't know I don't like

1278
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,543
Text

1279
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:40,383
In the show Alex

1280
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:42,943
The question earlier

1281
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:43,711
Presented

1282
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:44,479
What is

1283
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:45,247
Is the time

1284
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,063
What is a legitimate Revolution

1285
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,367
And he gives a pretty narrow version

1286
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:54,207
I believe it's actually a minor increase in tariffs on

1287
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,511
That be correct I'm doing

1288
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,351
Very narrow

1289
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:13,407
Let's say you're a Ukrainian in 19

1290
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,199
35

1291
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:18,015
Perry's Pizza

1292
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:21,087
Raping your wife

1293
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,623
Disappearing

1294
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:26,463
They're invading your country that is clearly

1295
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,511
You got a ride

1296
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:35,935
Somebody's coming down the basement where you're hiding take me to concentration camps

1297
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:42,079
This is 2014 right

1298
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:47,455
70 years

1299
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,015
Your presence

1300
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:56,927
Oh no no no no no no no no no

1301
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:07,423
Ukraine

1302
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,471
Ukraine on your mind

1303
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:12,287
He's totally cool with that

1304
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,591
He also

1305
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,639
Ukraine specifically course

1306
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,431
Also by the way

1307
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,967
Because we're doing

1308
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,783
2018 is

1309
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,831
18 right

1310
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:28,927
November 30th

1311
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:29,695
2014

1312
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:30,975
Nosotros

1313
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:31,743
Cirrhosis

1314
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,935
Somewhere between 2009 and 24

1315
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,215
Gotcha

1316
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:41,983
Which

1317
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:48,639
Unfortunately does not narrow anything down and not a lot

1318
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,919
Is that are open today

1319
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:51,967
2014

1320
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:56,319
Anywho

1321
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,599
Redundant perhaps but

1322
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:58,879
Do it anyway

1323
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,231
What's his name

1324
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:06,047
Larry Steven McWilliams

1325
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,191
Because I support the police killing

1326
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:18,847
Shooting

1327
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:24,991
Civil War

1328
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,015
Well

1329
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,831
That's only these two things are the same

1330
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:31,135
Onlyfans

1331
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:33,951
Whether or not

1332
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,231
It is bad

1333
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,791
To start murdering

1334
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,095
Even though in this case they did not

1335
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:43,423
Right even though in this case it was not the

1336
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:46,495
He certainly could murder

1337
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,823
It is X Corp Alex reads a news report

1338
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,663
The point on that last

1339
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,711
The reason I have it in there

1340
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:57,759
Again just to reinforce the

1341
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,551
Can't deal with this without

1342
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,343
Changing the goalposts

1343
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,391
Got moving it down

1344
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:08,511
And I actually have

1345
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,815
Damning thing to bring up at the end of the

1346
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:16,191
In order for Alex to cover the news about busy

1347
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,007
He kind of has to treat it like

1348
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:21,311
You'll see what I mean

1349
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:45,887
He has to put on a mocking voice just to read the news

1350
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,679
The f*** is that

1351
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:51,519
Horrifying

1352
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:54,335
He shot over 100 rounds at these building

1353
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,431
That's not good

1354
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,455
I mean

1355
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:00,991
The white

1356
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:04,575
Supremacist have enslaved black people for hundreds of years

1357
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:10,975
Like what are you doing starting a civil war

1358
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,119
F*** off

1359
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,143
So

1360
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:18,911
Of course

1361
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,679
We know that

1362
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,983
Lying just below the surface

1363
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:22,751
First of all this

1364
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,543
Natural fear

1365
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,823
About the second

1366
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:30,943
It's interesting, as much as I would have expected

1367
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,295
He's mentally ill

1368
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:40,671
The guns

1369
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,207
Of course it's it's sort of like

1370
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,487
The idea

1371
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:44,511
Is in place

1372
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,279
That this is like

1373
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,047
It's fake

1374
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,839
Until I get the cap off flag.

1375
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:50,399
Course like that

1376
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,423
It's always

1377
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:56,543
But I would have thought there'd be more fears about the second amendment that there actually are

1378
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,615
White guy doing it they're going to come after your gun

1379
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:01,919
Yeah

1380
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:04,223
White people out there

1381
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,807
Crop up

1382
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:08,831
Not here we see it

1383
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,391
And they're playing

1384
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:14,207
Again

1385
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:21,119
Is the flying fish

1386
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:27,519
Flavor Flav was at church

1387
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,103
With TV shows or dramas at movies

1388
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,639
Where crazy people go

1389
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,711
Hugo Chavez voicestation

1390
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,735
Right

1391
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:40,831
But just by cops suicide by cop

1392
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,623
Try to create a chain reaction

1393
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:49,535
Or you hung out with a bunch of weirdos

1394
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,655
Your biggest fan

1395
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:03,615
You go and do speaking engagements if people keep coming up to you.

1396
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,895
Specifically

1397
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:11,551
Sometimes it's a good idea to blow up the policeman Tire career is largely built on denying that a guy who blew up

1398
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:17,951
The Federal Building actually did it

1399
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:21,279
He killed RFK that's crazy false flag

1400
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:27,679
And all I need to do is say Elohim City all of a sudden I have an arc

1401
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:30,495
Come on I've got an argument

1402
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:34,591
Elohim City

1403
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:36,127
Holy

1404
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:36,895
Makes perfect

1405
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:39,967
It is just

1406
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,039
Abso at this point Alex

1407
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:47,391
Where we going

1408
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:54,559
Do you understand that the police are the second most awake I've done

1409
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,839
Announce

1410
01:09:56,095 --> 01:10:01,727
Why do grandmas real quick who's the first most

1411
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:08,127
Take me to might be it might be the Army is number one he doesn't specify but also I want to know what the old awake means

1412
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:11,967
Aware of the globalist

1413
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:16,319
Conceivably there's parallel the police

1414
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,343
The 2nd

1415
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,623
Most awake

1416
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,207
A number for

1417
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,231
You know what's crazy

1418
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,255
Number three

1419
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,535
Elks Club

1420
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:27,839
Shriners

1421
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:31,935
Shriners absolutely all marching bands

1422
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,287
His

1423
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,055
Write up

1424
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,591
I'd like to see his

1425
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:40,127
What time is it

1426
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,919
Where's the where's the grass I love

1427
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:48,319
I would really really love just to be able to go

1428
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:53,183
Over this. View at I get to the bottom of exactly what hooray

1429
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:58,815
Is an online poll or how many drops out of junior college so I assume he's not big on

1430
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,607
The scientific method

1431
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:09,567
Based his entire life on Monday none dare call it a conspiracy of the scientific method is a really

1432
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:13,919
Reality is not

1433
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:15,199
Part of his cap

1434
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,479
Is that a reality made

1435
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:26,719
God-awful scared police

1436
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:33,119
And they want to overturn the chessboard because we're winning and start a civil war

1437
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:33,887
Liberty moments

1438
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,703
Or Washington

1439
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:40,799
People to go out and do stuff

1440
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:46,687
Statistically shofar extremely low chance with Patriots

1441
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:55,391
But the media trying to hide it like a

1442
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:58,463
Realize what's really happen

1443
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:06,399
Stuff going on there at the end

1444
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,191
Mama is cockamamie

1445
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,727
Just do it

1446
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:13,055
Looking into Sovereign citizens find out how often they

1447
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:15,359
To the cop because they believe they have the right to

1448
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:17,151
Travel on roads without a license

1449
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,943
And then get really upset

1450
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,223
The King's Manor,

1451
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,527
And I don't recognize the authority of

1452
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,807
Admiralty police

1453
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:24,575
Police officers

1454
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:28,671
What I find really interesting there is that he's like

1455
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:36,095
A patriot shooting a cop or Superluv the odds of a black guy burning a build

1456
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:38,399
In his neighborhood are super low

1457
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:41,471
We're being lied to about this stuff

1458
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,007
It's the reverse

1459
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:49,407
Is he

1460
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,711
The only conclusion

1461
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:58,111
No making a direct limit even this incorrect comparison for both

1462
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,135
Not even that

1463
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:02,719
A white person is most likely

1464
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:05,791
The Sovereign citizens

1465
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:10,655
The freeman-on-the-land and all those types of weird Patriot militia types who are

1466
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:11,679
Real

1467
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:14,751
Real against people having Authority

1468
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,031
They shoot most

1469
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,151
And then you get into like

1470
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:26,271
You're right there's like people are the ones who resetting fire

1471
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:30,111
You see like all of the the indications of

1472
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,135
Agent

1473
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:34,719
Pictures that were on the scene in Ferguson

1474
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:38,047
Infiltrated protest group

1475
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,375
You know you get those sorts of

1476
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,143
Vacations

1477
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:48,031
Because

1478
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:49,823
We're watching

1479
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,639
They can't false-flag these any

1480
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:59,295
They can't engineer

1481
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:03,647
Because it was real

1482
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:05,183
They hype it up

1483
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,719
Like it happens all the time

1484
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,535
Yeah

1485
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:12,095
Argument is

1486
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:16,959
They can't do it themselves because we do it for them all the time

1487
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:20,031
That is kind of part of there

1488
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:22,591
Strong

1489
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:23,871
It's not good

1490
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,407
None of this is good

1491
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:27,455
No for now

1492
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,991
In this next clip we get

1493
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,015
What's real

1494
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:31,551
What's up

1495
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:48,959
Shut up voice Department

1496
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:54,335
Anime

1497
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:15,071
Infinity Cube

1498
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,607
Spring Meadows open

1499
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,399
Keep being weird about it

1500
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,007
Further

1501
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,799
This reported man

1502
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:25,823
I don't even know if he's real

1503
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,919
I don't trust the media they're staying

1504
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,503
And they're saying

1505
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:35,807
Then he was mad about open borders

1506
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,111
Which who knows about that

1507
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,415
I mean yeah

1508
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:49,631
You know

1509
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:56,543
Do you know where is shockingly similar take on the situation to Alex Jones about

1510
01:15:56,799 --> 01:16:00,639
Going to make people who work against open borders look bad

1511
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,663
Storm

1512
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:06,015
How would they say that

1513
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:10,623
Greenpoint's Alex Jones

1514
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:14,975
The feeling that he was awake between Voldemort

1515
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:17,791
Vladimir possible

1516
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,095
It's probably some

1517
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,119
Weird

1518
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,935
He-who-must-not-be-named

1519
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:29,823
You can be sure the Hostile aliens really control the country

1520
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:30,847
Going to use this

1521
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:31,871

1522
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:33,663
So that's one of them

1523
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:34,687
191

1524
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,711
Quotes

1525
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:40,063
Talk to tax on the part of the angry white man

1526
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:43,647
Is a dream come true for any Jewish or darky gun-grabber

1527
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:45,695
An agent of genocide against White

1528
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,999
The putrid smell of Zionist rmx

1529
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,535
Kinfolks black against White

1530
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,071
And the US Constitution

1531
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,351
Heavy in the air here

1532
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:57,727
Guiding father Odin chimed in

1533
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:00,799
Good attacks

1534
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:10,527

01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:15,903
What you're hanging on to

1536
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:17,695
That just

1537
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:20,255
I think I think you're holding on the wrong feet

1538
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,303

The media picked up on the story we want

1543
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,055

01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,407
Aerial view

1546
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,967
The overwhelming sense

1547
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,247
A lot of their post

1548
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:43,807
Is just

1549
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:44,831
Very

1550
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:45,599
Vineyard Way

1551
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:46,879

1552
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:47,647

01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,999
It's like they can't find

1557
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,279
Any other exam

01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:57,887
Maybe

1561
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:00,447
Put together a statistic

1562
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:03,519
All of these crimes that have been committed

1563
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:05,567
And develop some sort of pattern

1564
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:08,639
Come on you guys can't do that these are false flag

1565
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,687

Once again

1570
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,815
Coincidence we've ever seen

1571
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:32,191
Does rhetoric matches up with

1572
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:33,471
Literal

1573
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,311
White supremacist

On their side

1577
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:45,247
I don't know

1578
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,343

Is pushing all this multiculturalism

1580
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:59,839
Because they want to wreck the society

01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:16,384
Subsidiary that we called him out on

01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:32,000
Not yet actually figured out if that's a legal name.

1608
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:38,144
Not the one time we actually discover a crime nobody pays attention
