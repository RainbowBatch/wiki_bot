54
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:31,103

Just a lot of splat

114
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,359

192
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,511
This is the leading story story

193
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:39,263
Sacrifice to their death

194
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:47,455
My patience wears thin it's really hard for me to approach

195
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,735
This because

196
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,623
Not even something that I'm interested in really responding

197
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:01,023
Yeah we can't really have a discussion about the merits of any

198
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,559
Arguments whenever

199
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,631
You're automatically just invalidating one by being like

200
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:12,799
Sure they got good point for Satan you can't trust those guys

201
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,615
It's taking things almost to an unfair playing field

202
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,431
To automatically and incessantly

203
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,991
Yellow of the devil

204
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
There's not much

205
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,087
Not much really

206
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
You know

207
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:32,511
Reasonable people can do with that all right for the little Kristen

208
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
He doesn't

209
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,351
Sign my check so right

210
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:42,751
If you want to talk about a lot of nationalist

211
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,847
Make a big deal out of worship

212
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:58,111
Necessarily appreciated by God

213
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,183
According to his

214
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,023
And one of the big ones

215
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
Maybe even the first

216
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,863
What is that don't f*** around with Odin

217
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,167
I'm paraphrasing

218
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:19,359
Preoccupation

219
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
With Norse

220
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,943
Deities of mom and some of these whites

221
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,967
Supremacist

222
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,783
Naturally now if your complaint

223
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,135
What you want to talk about all the time

224
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
Time

225
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,975
I think that maybe

226
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,815
Policy differences

227
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:43,679
I have worldview differences with these white nationalists

228
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:50,847
Nothing to do with their interest in Norse God because you didn't trade your

229
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:57,247
For wisdom if I were to do

230
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:02,879
Decrying the white supremacist Menace

231
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
The evils of Odin

232
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:09,279
I would expect no one would take me seriously either even though

233
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:15,679
Even if I were listening to Joe about

234
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:22,079
Admit definition

235
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:26,687
I don't I don't think that I would be that interested in

236
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,479
Have a tough time

237
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:35,135
Listen to a dickhole who just talks about

238
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,463
It's it's weird it's it's really weird

239
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,255
Yeah that's no good

240
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,047
Can you imagine a show

241
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,655
Uche ojeh

242
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,703
Most of the Oath Keepers

243
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,727
Worship Odin

244
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,007
So we don't need to worry about

245
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:57,919
We're good guys need to talk about anything about what they represent

246
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,783
The worst about

247
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
Worship

248
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,463
Doing great yeah the way I feel like

249
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,255
Top of the

250
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,047
Yeah so it's

251
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,095
It's a lotta it's a lot of

252
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:20,447
There's a Pig episode

253
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
A lot of

254
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:26,591
No conversation whatsoever about their whistleblower complaint

255
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:32,991
No look like you work for the literal Christian Temple

256
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:39,391
My version of God

257
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:47,071
And as matter worship Satan

258
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,119
Just become the thing where it's like

259
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,655
Alright

260
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,983
Listen to the show at the

261
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,751
Interesting

262
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,127
Stupid news

263
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:06,783
And Thor is only like chaotic neutral it fast

264
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:13,439
The things that I find interesting or what we're going to be on this episode from the shackles of

265
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,975
Actually taking seriously

266
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,279
Anything he says I like it

267
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,327
At least for this episode

268
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:23,167
Perhaps infestation of disappointment

269
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:29,311
First thing

270
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,431
Is that

271
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
Blind

272
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,735
To the world around him

273
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,783
He recognizes that Matt Drudge

274
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
Signaling

275
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,879
Some dissatisfaction

276
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,719
People are noticing that

277
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,047
Are not Towing the exact party-line they always have

278
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,983
Turn on

279
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,007
Which is weird

280
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,359
A 15-year

281
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,895
Change the whole face the world

282
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,343
Need help getting

283
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
Good question

284
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,712
It's not an issue is none of this makes sense

285
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,248
What is

286
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,296
Alex is to be

287
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,576
This is a war

288
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,600
Between good

289
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,392
A literal devil

290
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,864
Literal devil

291
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,424
What

292
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,384
Main part of the Patriot team makes it hard for you to complain about him now

293
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,712
Working for the devil

294
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,296
I really wanted to have a

295
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,600
Success in his future endeavours even though

296
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:21,184
Regardless of what I believe about his

297
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
Quality

298
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
Since he's working

299
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,792
Looking for the other team if he is in any way successful

300
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:32,448
The devil wins is super-effective

301
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:38,848
Really helpful for the devil

302
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:49,088
But it does make sense when you recognize that I was looking

303
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,560
We should all this late anymore

304
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,656
I'm going to need dredge up back on my side

305
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:08,544
Much larger Organics

306
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,944
Statistics I can see all of the incoming traffic still need that

307
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,760
So working for the devil

308
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
Okay

309
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,064
Boy

310
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
It is such a bummer

311
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,416
To live in that world though

312
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
It's like

313
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,720
This guy that I

314
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:31,072
Loved and respected in his giving me a huge boost throughout my career

315
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,376
Has changed his opinion about something

316
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:37,216
So rather than at all engage with that

317
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
He's working for the devil

318
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:46,688
You don't really have any

319
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,320
Because he can't cuz even that would be too much

320
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,880
He's clearly on the other side

321
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,416
You know the other side of me

322
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,488
You know that's funny though

323
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,792
Especially red like think about it this way

324
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,560
Alright

325
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,376
Normally when Alex hate something

326
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
That he used to love

327
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,728
He throws a tantrum about it until he gets a 10

328
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,312
We saw that work with Joe Rogan

329
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,104
With Matt Drudge

330
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,944
You can't say that he's a devil worshiper and then Matt drudge is going to be like

331
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,760
Well let me put a couple links back on my side

332
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,528
Right

333
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,296
Your foot

334
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:29,440
I think the different relationship there and

335
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,744
The Joe Rogan can

336
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,328
Drugs made

337
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
Teen years of your career

338
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,896
Had largely been based on traffic

339
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,688
Attention that came

340
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:56,320
From this

341
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,632
Just like I'm going to need that traffic eventually in the future again

342
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:15,264
It wasn't very hard for Galileo who took care of him that whole time

343
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,664
There's a lot of parallels between Alex

344
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:29,600
He believes blacklivesmatter worship

345
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:35,744
Sacrifices and rituals in order to appease their dread God

346
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
Naturally

347
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,608
Pieces that he has about this

348
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:46,496
Is a video

349
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,968
The shooting in reality it's a guy who's like

350
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:02,368
Hey shot these dudes out here this is crazy

351
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,752
It's amazing that I was in prison

352
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,872
Kind of lost in this weird

353
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,480
Feeling of like I need to dwell in Vengeance fantasies

354
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,040
Criminals never even had a bloody nose

355
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,368
Politically

356
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
Catwalk

357
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,096
Tool

358
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,424
Right before it's due

359
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,336
Call Colossus clown

360
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,456
Civilization with its show

361
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,504
This is a harbinger of death

362
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,832
Thunderstruck

363
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
Make no mistake

364
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
Just

365
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,672
Does not saying anything

366
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,232
This is a Colossus

367
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:14,304
Caviar caviar calamity

368
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,216
It just filling time with vaguely angry slightly Vengeance film

369
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,264
He's a headline from the Sun

370
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,288
Yeah

371
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,312
Just words

372
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
Also

373
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:33,248
Politically got there we've never gotten our pull the teeth politically

374
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:37,600
Politically knocked out before

375
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,672
I don't think it I don't know

376
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,696
Literally

377
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,864
Alex

378
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,192
Honestly I might have called

379
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:59,360
Find some space nonsense

380
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,688
So much of this is just filling time and I talked about the devil

381
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,504
But Alex does start

382
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
That I really think is a board

383
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,832
People need to know about

384
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:12,416
And a large part of that Alex

385
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,976
Conceives of his own position in the world

386
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,560
And this is where it gets really f****** scary

387
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,840
Whenever it's like

388
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:22,400
We're playing against the devils like okay

389
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,216
The cheat code for you not to have to have any real

390
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:29,312
Defensible position so you can just send all this stuff

391
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,592
But listen to the word

392
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,896
He's painting himself into that picture

393
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,712
A lot about 46

394
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,016
Long time ago

395
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
Permission

396
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
Like 34 years old

397
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,656
Mission 4

398
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:01,824
17

399
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,272
Washing machine

400
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,120
Cursor to the

401
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,192
Weren't you a Satanist at 18

402
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:33,824
Just wrote down

403
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:40,480
React

404
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,296
You f***** up is

405
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,088
Creating himself as like

406
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,112
Process

407
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:54,304
Preparing to play this

408
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,912
Crucial role in the battle between

409
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,008
Let's say

410
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,080
Things

411
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,384
Settle down a little bit

412
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,408
Let's play

413
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,432
Tensions

414
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:15,552
Go down a tiny bit maybe vaccine is is released

415
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,344
But we can start to

416
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
Work back towards

417
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:23,488
Maybe Biden becomes president

418
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,768
Summary

419
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,120
More overt can be scaled back

420
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:32,448
Is there pushing for reform can maybe have

421
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,752
I'm more sympathetic

422
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,056
Maybe Biden gets elected in the real work can begin

423
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
Bright

424
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,872
Maybe some of that happens

425
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:50,112
That would be really bad Until you realize that that means Alex

426
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:56,512
Saved us from the cataclysm

427
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,536
2017

428
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,072
Over 30

429
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,144
What are the 10

430
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,216
This sort of language only makes sense

431
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,496
If it

432
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,800
Towards something really bad

433
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,336
Literally the epochal

434
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:17,504
The actual there's going to be a thousand years of

435
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,392
Plans are alive

436
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,768
Train coming to your miles an hour

437
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,584
All this and I

438
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,144
Was prepared since the age of 3

439
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:39,776
Like

440
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:46,176
You can't go back on

441
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,712
This is not the sort of thing that's like

442
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,504
You can go put your phone

443
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,528
Should be

444
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,392
This should be endgame

445
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:59,744
Pardon the use of the term

446
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,888
The Mayan apocalypse is coming should have been immediately tossed into a ditch whenever it didn't

447
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,960
From a business perspective

448
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,032
A couple of the most slick

449
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,824
David Wilcock

450
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,920
Already had pretty in French

451
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,808
Well then this should have ruined a lot of folks

452
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:30,976
So I think it's really upsetting disturbing

453
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,768
Before

454
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:36,608
Cataclysmic battle between the devil

455
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,168
Claiming that the prophets always works out well

456
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,448
It's not good

457
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:48,384
I want I want

458
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,760
Like this is such a good version of what

459
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,512
Forces on this planet

460
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,840
As the oxygen you breathe

461
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,520
I want to take you away from God then I want your spirit to be with them

462
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,104
Why

463
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,760
Churches

464
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,120

470

People that just can't really believe

471

They'll wake up later because you and I and others

472
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,904
I'll just say that

473
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,488

Yeah I mean you can feel coming the whole time it was

477
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:56,896
Where is the point you're coming getting ready to try and monetize

478
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:00,480
To create with this bedevils really wants your soul

479
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,648

00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:00,575
Closest I could get to something I was like a original

560
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:04,415
Mark is it is a military thing

561
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:09,279
Because they can't have an individual individual energy

00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,583
Things being

572
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,631
For the artificial

573
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,167
I'll just have the transformative something

574
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,471
Oh boy

575
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,519
So it's

576
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,543
Is

577
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,823
The transhumanist

578
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:00,223
Well it's because they need to get energetic imprints of each of us or something at

579
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,039
Standing too close together you can

580
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,319
That makes sense

581
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,343
Now that's right

582
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:10,463
Technology support

583
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,767
But they can't figure out how to really like

584
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,815
Isolated signature

585
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,863
I mean there's that

586
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,263
Bachelor

587
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,823
Away from somebody

588
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:32,223
They could have one of those Google street cars

589
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:38,367
If any of this word the actual issue

590
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,719
Six feet apart generally in public

591
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,255
Is not

592
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,559
Is a real problem just

593
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,327
Metric system

594
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,143
Is a military term

595
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,423
Pete in this car

596
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,191
Country

597
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:58,591
She's coming in and saying

598
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,151
Individual energetic imprints of them

599
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:04,991
The record or whatever I was like

600
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,807
Conceive up doctor

601
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,367
She said whatever

602
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:15,231
All the people at the top of this ladder I'm either eugenicist and I believe many of them are Satanist

603
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,071
Agendas

604
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:25,471
So she's talking about black people who support vaccines

605
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:28,287
To really get a negative view of religion

606
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,567
If you listen to

607
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,615
The show

608
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:34,943
You know it's true

609
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:40,063
Christians during the satanic panic

610
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:46,463
Aflutter with the same things of it

611
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:48,767
Fortunately for probably

612
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,583
Going to be going to get a bath

613
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,863
Rap office

614
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,191
Sure I think a problem is

615
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:58,495
As long as you're really vague about it

616
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,031
And a Christian

617
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,079
The devil's real

618
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:02,847
Play Adele

619
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,127
Don't follow the devil

620
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,407
Everybody's like okay

621
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:09,503
Whenever you take that and then you actually put it in your life

622
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:14,367
The devil is here on Earth and he is the reason that we have to stay 6 feet away

623
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,951
Everybody who believes in the literal

624
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:22,559
As long as we have

625
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,607
A pretty nice

626
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,935
Ability for everyone to recognize

627
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,983
B sincerely held beliefs

628
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:36,383
Can be metaphorically accepted by me and we can go about our business

629
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,151
Is fine

630
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:43,551
I just becomes a problem when your sincerely held beliefs

631
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,575
Cases for

632
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:50,207
And your politics the disagree with mine

633
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:52,767
Come down to the little Rose Bowl

634
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:56,607
That is the problem

635
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,167
At no point in the Bible is it like

636
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,959
Goblin the devil look

637
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,751
We're going to eat going to be rough

638
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:06,079
But eventually we're going to come to a kind of date

639
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:12,479
I'm sure there's going to be a thousand years of God's Reign but then after

640
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:16,319
Missing from the Bible

641
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:19,647
Satan is super into police reform

642
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:30,399
I miss the chapter where like Satan is really pushing hard for updating with the voter Rights Act

643
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:33,727
Jesus lied 828 look I'm tired

644
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,055
Police reform

645
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,967
Anyway

646
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:48,319
This next clip she's there

647
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:52,927
And they're coming back from commercial break and of course

648
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,207
There's no sound

649
00:46:54,463 --> 00:47:00,095
I only play this quit because it's interesting to catalog a new tech issues on Alex's show

650
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,399
Phone

651
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,471
Grocery store

652
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,199
Josh Turner

653
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,343
I'm wearing to work on that.

654
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
Now

655
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:31,071
So I guess they had to remind turned all the way down or something

656
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,631
It's amazing it's a problem

657
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,679
Everything

658
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:42,079
Must have been working fine but somebody else something out there

659
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:46,687
Release program

660
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,223
I don't know it's not good

661
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:53,343
It has like two whenever there's a new

662
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:57,183
Somebody got a big board just like pressing buttons every now and again

663
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:03,583
Well we can't hear anymore

664
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,887
Yeah so

665
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,447
A lot of this is

666
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,471
Kind of

667
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,495
Boring

668
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:14,335
Nonsense interview with a boring

669
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,127
Nonsensical

670
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:21,247
Caspersen door and then

671
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,551
Bishop Larry gaiters back on

672
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,879
Etymology

673
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:33,279
Right

674
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:47,871
I'm not going to talk too much but but

675
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:54,271
First episode where we encountered him

676
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,831
Nichols

677
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:04,255
Here we go

678
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:08,095
Communist there really witches

679
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,463
This is

680
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,231
Total

681
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,535
Satanism the end of our species

682
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,303
Yacht

683
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,887
So easily either knew which guy

684
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:50,847
See see if he's got some which stuff are some words on Word

685
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,895
Blacklivesmatter

686
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:58,527
Paradigm relational reality

687
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:05,183
What's up colors okay

688
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:18,751
Foundation is this West

689
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:24,639
Which represents this 16-point

690
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,063
Timeout

691
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,415
Where in the United States and in Canada

692
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:39,999
Three women

693
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:52,031
First of all I love this dude is saying that like

694
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:07,391
I'm going to get something to eat I'm W the floor cuz I have to I bet just

695
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,719
I kid.

696
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:14,815
Interested I'm interested in the fact that you're saying

697
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,839
But I got to go

698
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:19,935
Digital only 144,000 black lives matter people are going to

699
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:25,567
So again this comes down to

700
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:32,479
I don't believe you if your complaint is that there's a West African religion

701
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,015
Still need more

702
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:44,255
16 points

703
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,023
16

704
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:45,791
Chapter

705
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,815
You f***** up

706
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,887
Black lives matter website

707
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:54,495
Chapters their official chapter okay

708
00:51:54,751 --> 00:52:00,895
Sure

709
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:07,807
For the error in accounting

710
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:13,951
And that's not represented by a pin on the map

711
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,999
16 that are pinned in the map

712
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,815
Hamilton Michigan one isn't like the dark

713
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:23,935
Evil pope

714
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:27,775
Tons of unofficial ones throughout the country and throughout the world

715
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:33,151
And then also they have a portal on the website where you can apply to become an official chapter

716
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:39,551
They would be doing that if they were an esoteric religion

717
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:45,951
For some meaning

718
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,743
Really strict about those

719
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:54,143
Yeah they wouldn't have 17

720
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,935
Trying to sneak on by the rules

721
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:59,519
Maybe their God is like

722
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,799
You don't got to worry about

723
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:03,103
The weirdest guy

724
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,895
Sounds more reasonable than most

725
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:13,087
The rules of God I can do anyway really quick cuz they're so unstable

726
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:21,023
Violated

727
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,559
Bishop gaiters

728
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,327
Is now

729
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,351
The witch guy

730
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:30,751
Witches witches

731
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,823
Blacklivesmatter has been design

732
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:43,807
America because they were being used

733
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,855
I got to go

734
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,879
Man

735
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,999
Always gone like they

736
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:56,863
It's always anytime black women lead anything that is an athame

737
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,679
Two white Night Lights the worst thing in the world

738
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,215
It's the worst thing in the world

739
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:08,127
Cuz black women I've always been generous with like they've been the first to be something and then the last

740
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,711
Like that is almost always been the cases of like

741
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,503
It is always

742
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,551
Leaving social justice first

743
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:18,623
And then black women being the last people for to benefit

744
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:21,695
It's not like there weren't any black f****** suffragettes

745
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:26,559
And kind of b******* that they have

746
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,839
To go after black women

747
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:28,863
Always

748
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:39,103
Is a compelling point

749
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,199
Right always right first they can scry into the future

750
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:45,759
Incredible

751
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,551
Here is that

752
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:50,623
In order to get this episode together

753
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:51,647
You know

754
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,671
We're recording this

755
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:55,743
Mrs. Tuesday's episode

756
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:56,511
The shop

757
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:59,071
There was a feeling that I had

758
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:02,399
He would have a response

759
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:05,983
Do something that seems important seems relevant

760
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:06,751
Huge

761
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:10,847
And seems like it requires a response from someone like Alex

762
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:21,855
He would ramble about the devil

763
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,391
Much of his time

764
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:29,791
Boring

765
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,071
Call people witches

766
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,095
Like its

767
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:37,983
There's nothing to hang your hat on

768
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,519
There's just nothing

769
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:45,663
So you have to ignore it

770
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,943
Like on the right

771
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:50,527
Or at least Alex is audience must be bored of deep States.

772
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,295
They have to

773
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,319
Because that's

774
00:55:56,927 --> 00:56:01,279
Wednesday doing it

775
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:07,679
It's the government

776
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:17,151
And you realize I cash it there's no excuse for why the things aren't happening

777
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:23,295
Warriors

778
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,087
Government

779
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:28,159
Kind of bored of that it's the devil

780
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,207
The girl working for the devil

781
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:33,535
I don't know what the next step

782
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,815
Super devil

783
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:41,727
You can't go up from the devil unless they're

784
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:43,775
Alright

785
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:45,567
You only have one knots to go up

786
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,103
From the devil dog Apollo

787
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,127
God

788
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:51,967
Also yes that's very funny

789
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:55,039
Highway

790
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,319
Here's what you do if your Alex

791
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,855
You say actually

792
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,671
God has turned against us

793
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,695
We have to fight

794
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,463
God

795
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,767
And the devil I don't think that Alex

796
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:09,119
Would be able to sell that

797
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:15,775
Defeat God is a some cell

798
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:19,359
I find I find it

799
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:25,759
Interesting to watch this progression

800
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:30,879
That I would be in Port

801
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,415
Then bringing about the

802
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:41,119
I get that it's interesting in a sense because I I do think these are the sorts of things you would expect to see

803
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:47,263
And somebody before something really bad

804
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:53,663
This happened right before some kind of an intense flame out surprise

805
00:57:53,919 --> 00:58:00,063
Mark of the document

806
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:00,831
It's like

807
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:07,231
It's equally likely emergency

808
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,511
Seafood 6 months from now

809
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:11,327
Every moment he doesn't explode is it is edging

810
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:15,679
It's just edging you know it's little bit going to just do it

811
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,215
Movies at

812
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:23,615
It's somewhat that if I allowed myself to get drawn into that

813
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,407
Cuz he's behaving

814
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:27,967
Right typically are

815
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:29,759
It's tough

816
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:35,903
It's interesting to watch but it's also incredibly uninteresting to listen to Gators

817
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,463
What is a paradox

818
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:43,583
But those do calls before we get out of here

819
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,375
Hey tough guy

820
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:48,959
Austin

821
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,263
Free of me

822
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,079
Lifeguard

823
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,383
Thought I'd share

824
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,151
Story with you

825
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:01,759
Hi

826
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,295
Cousin Austin

827
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,391
Happened

828
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,207
School District

829
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,487
They were

830
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:12,511
Attending a

831
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:13,791
School play a couple years

832
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,559
Miguel

833
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:17,887
Apparently

834
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,423
During this play

835
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,471
Very near the

836
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,263
They heard someone

837
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,031
Heckle

838
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,567
Call element

839
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,359
Stage

840
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:28,895
They started

841
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,431
Pretty much right off the bat

842
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,711
Yelling things like

843
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,735
You know

844
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,783
What kind of tree is that

845
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:35,807
Sitting down

846
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:36,831
Sitting tree

847
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:41,439
And other well not brass

848
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,511
Child actor

849
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:45,791
Sage

850
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:47,839
Hey friendly

851
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,375
Can you do this for

852
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,167
The play

853
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,703
Before someone in

854
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,263
And I noticed

855
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:56,799
Certain

856
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,847
Individual

857
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:04,223
Who had allegedly been drinking and alleged leaving heckling

858
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:04,991
Children

859
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,271
School play

860
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,087
So I just thought

861
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,367
That would be a nice break

862
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,903
From present-day in

863
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:12,671
Alex

864
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,695
Religiosity

865
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,767
And I wanted to weigh in on

866
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,303
Very hot debate dance

867
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,095
Bringing up about five iron

868
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,375
Friends and say that

869
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,399
It's the holdup

870
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,935
Hold up pretty well

871
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,495
Thanks for all you do guys

872
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,287
Yeah

873
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,871
I was waiting for him to say

874
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:38,015
Walker for validating that opinion

875
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,295
Also

876
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,575
Obviously

877
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,623
This is one person story

878
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,415
We can't take it as proven

879
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:48,767
Can we Heckle a child performance

880
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:52,095
I would not be surprised

881
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,887
Godzilla

882
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:57,727
What I would assume he behaves like

883
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:04,127
You know likes somebody is

884
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:12,831
Somebody's child is at a play

885
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:18,207
Find you and you just get so fed up your like finally you stand up you turn around and it's Alex Jones you like

886
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,511
Yeah

887
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,839
This is not fair

888
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,887
Pizzeria

889
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:31,263
Going to have to be like

890
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:34,079
Yeah you're doing you

891
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:36,383
This Is the End

892
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:41,247
Bees and assholes

893
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:43,295
Always carry a tiny bull horn through

894
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,367
Tyranny slapper one

895
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:55,583
Always be aware

896
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:03,519
Bird in the background that call

897
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:10,687
You're also your bird in the background

898
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:14,783
Professionalism

899
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:15,551
Anyway

900
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:17,855
This is about

901
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,487
Anyway

902
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:24,767
I'm calling be

903
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,303
In one of Dan's men

904
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,399
Mentioned how

905
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,167
Awesomeness

906
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,471
Grounding

907
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:34,751
And then

908
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:35,775
It turns out

909
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,311
Crucifix

910
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,335
Peach plant

911
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,871
And I'm not very good

912
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,639
Growing plant

913
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:41,919
But

914
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:42,687
Either night

915
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,711
I was sitting there putting my

916
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:45,503
Thinking about

917
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,343
And she

918
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:51,903
And

919
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:52,671
Electrical

920
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,023
Angie

921
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,559
Scared of having to my bed

922
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:00,863
Wackadoodle

923
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,655
Here's some water

924
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,311
Amazing day

925
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,359
Adult

926
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,383
Countryside

927
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,711
Just wanted to say

928
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,991
Thanks for that

929
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,039
And how

930
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:21,855
Something

931
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,391
You know watch something grow

932
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,463
Anyway

933
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,255
Thanks for the show

934
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:30,815
Put into it

935
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,351
And don't be so

936
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,119
So hard on yourself

937
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,703
Y'all got to take RDU

938
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:38,751
You deserve it

939
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:47,455
I reserve the right to remain hard on myself

940
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:49,247
Like anybody

941
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:53,855
Hearing either my perspective

942
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:57,183
If you jack off with your plants

943
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,719
And your your cat

944
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:05,119
Aspiranet

945
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:11,519
Is how people feel about their offspring to some extent

946
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:19,199
Kind of the same thing with plants and

947
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:25,599
Westie

948
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:33,023
Into a fussy old lady and I think that's my favorite part about having dog

949
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:43,775
Call dear old Grumpy Cat Just sleeps all the time

950
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:46,591
Pretty early

951
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,663
That's what I understand.

952
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,943
Aeronauts

953
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:53,247
We already said something

954
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:59,135

957
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,303
It's tough to recognize

958
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,375
