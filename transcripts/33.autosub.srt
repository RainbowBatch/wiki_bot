Like David does not have a slingshot

8
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:33,792
He's just running around

9
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,864
David has receipts

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,192

11
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:44,032

But their respective governments hey man let's just have a good time

Today Jordan

30
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,624
What happened over the weekend

31
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:08,768
Now I will say that it was one of the most delightful birthday weekends I've had in a long time we went

32
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:16,960
My best friend in the world Nikki gift wasn't on him and his wife

33
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,544
Good to spend some time with him I close down an arcade bar

34
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,104
One night of the weekend and then

35
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,176
Alex Jones did what he did on Saturday

36
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,272
This is a great birthday gift that he gave me

37
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
It's

38
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,576
So good

39
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,904
He does certainly more than

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,232
I mean even for somebody with narcissistic personality

41
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:44,352
Disorder that he still thinks about you on your birthday that is very

42
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,424
My relatives

43
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:55,360
Alex was

44
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
He released

45
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,712
Special Report

46
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
Yes

47
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:05,856
Now we're briefly because it's not really worth going into and it's kind of stupid

48
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,160
This deal with first

49
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,696
Was about how

50
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
People are diagnosing

51
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,024
Trump with a mental illness

52
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
That's bad

53
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
Takes one to know one

54
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
It is bad

55
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,032
According to the rules that psychiatrist themselves

56
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,360
Put in place after I think everybody was like drinking water

57
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:32,224
Goldwater the Goldwater rule

58
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
Some psychiatrist

59
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:38,624
It's basically decided to impose on themselves

60
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,440
Because water was

61
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,232
A bunch of people

62
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Psychiatrist

63
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,304
Psychologist interviewed in a magazine

64
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,096
The Aspen

65
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,632
The diagnosed

66
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:55,776
That seems like a bad idea it was because they gave him a bunch of diagnosis and then

67
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
Anyone

68
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:01,152
So now it's like psychologists supposed to diagnose

69
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,736
Public figures that they have not actually interact

70
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,600
However at this point there are a number of mental health professionals

71
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,184
We're coming out and their argument is they have a right to warn

72
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
Obligation

73
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
Shinto Warren

74
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:21,887
What's the same thing that if you're in therapy and you say you're going to kill someone

75
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,703
You either tell the police or the potential victim

76
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,775
Right they have to do that because otherwise they're being

77
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,847
Psychiatrist

78
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,127
Or arguing

79
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
5 president

80
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,431
Trump

81
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,783
Please

82
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,111
So you're saying that psychiatrist and psychologist

83
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,927
Neglectful in their duties

84
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,231
Because they didn't inform Afghanistan

85
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,535
That Trump was about to murder a bunch

86
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,399
Even bigger the American public

87
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,495
They were right to warn them of the mental illness

88
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,055
Little bit late on that

89
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,895
That's the problem with these like guidelines

90
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:09,247
I don't know how I feel about to be perfectly honest I think there is

91
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
A little bit of a

92
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,319
Gray area

93
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,367
In terms of diagnosis

94
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,023
Interaction with

95
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
A very clearly

96
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,095
You can tell the truth lies all the f***

97
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,471
You can't be publicly without actually having sex

98
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,495
What's up buddy

99
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
As of medical

100
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,591
Professional

101
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,127
You are still a human being

102
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
It is a human being

103
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
If you don't look at Trump and say

104
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
Crazy

105
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
You're an idiot

106
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,111
Yeah somewhat video about this

107
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,903
It was about narcissism

108
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
Essentially

109
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,511
I think

110
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,815
A subject

111
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,911
I think you might be able to guess how it goes

112
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,983
Firmly on the side of how narcissists should rule the world

113
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
And everyone else is

114
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Like

115
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:11,455
Are we going to go. Cyst here where it's like

116
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:17,087
Are you in the studio right now

117
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,415
Shockingly close

118
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
The globalist

119
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:31,423
A boy who are using psychology almost.

120
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,751
Just territory right now

121
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,567
Defining as being a successful man

122
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,103
Is now narcissism

123
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:47,039
That is not a good also does we can have if you can smell this coming a mile away

124
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
Wants to talk about Trump and mental health

125
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:53,695
He talked about himself a whole lot

126
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:02,399
Play

127
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,191
The other first is just fun

128
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,519
MMS is kind of a summation of his point

129
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Like I said

130
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,663
Sigmund Freud was obsessed with poo poo

131
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
And holding his crap

132
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:22,367
Smoking cigars is phallic symbol

133
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,695
The fact that I got me Isaac

134
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
Whiskey

135
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:42,847
Alex Jones really wrestler with his subconscious there

136
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
Believe

137
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
Maybe I can

138
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,223
Donut Twitter pointed out that

139
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,855
Great

140
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,879
It looks like a wiener

141
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:06,143
I'm going on the profanity-laden red

142
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:12,543
Baby language

143
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,175
Yeah but that's what a serial killer

144
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,991
Terrify like a parent

145
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:26,111
Child was listening to this I wouldn't be comforted by poo poo in now

146
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
I would be like

147
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,511
I'd be way more concerned about the content than the actual obscenity

148
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,959
So anyway the next visiting capitulation

149
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,823
Thesis statement about the

150
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
The psychology stuff

151
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
As I recall

152
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,247
He basically makes the argument that narcissism is is b******* and everybody. But then he

153
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
Displays

154
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,575
Broadly narcissistic tendencies

155
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,191
I didn't exist

156
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,031
Thinking you're successful

157
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:34,463
They loved

158
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,863
Turn off Donna

159
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
Play do

160
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,687
Go on show Rogan podcast

161
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,759
Because they are make-believe wannabe Stars

162
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,391
Politics

163
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:16,447
So I get why the narcissist

164
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,543
Gyros

165
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
Did he just say that

166
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,919
The narcissist

167
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
And those guys

168
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,759
Who want to Beast

169
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
Who are stars

170
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,343
They want to control everybody

171
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
And save them

172
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
They want to be the Saviour

173
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:41,279
Xavier players of a created problem

174
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
So what he did

175
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
But yeah

176
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,887
Exactly

177
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
Let me know

178
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
Not even metaphorically

179
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,031
121

180
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,247
What is like

181
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,831
3 more minutes long and as I realized

182
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:11,487
All that good like

183
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Keno's

184
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
That what he's doing

185
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,471
Maybe criticize

186
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:28,383
All he does all the time and say how he has no ego

187
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,951
The other clip that he put out

188
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
On Saturday

189
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
Was

190
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Title

191
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,839
New Sandy Hook information

192
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,631
Holyshit

193
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
There's a new Sandy Hook

194
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,215
Information

195
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,287
Oh I thought you were talking about new Sandy Hook in Maine

196
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,567
They just started a town

197
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:02,431
All the people just

198
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,015
So I was thrilled

199
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,831
But he posted this video just based on the title

200
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,111
And I could not wait

201
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,439
To find out what the new information

202
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
You should not be talking about

203
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:21,119
Absolutely not I was talking to you earlier and I told you my theory as to why

204
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,703
Decided to bring backup

205
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
Give him this custody trial

206
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,311
And there's a lot of people clowning on him on Twitter

207
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
Saying

208
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,663
Hey we should follow Alex Jones around after he loses his kids

209
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,967
And tell him that they were actors the whole time

210
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,295
So there's a lot of people making that kind of joke

211
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
To be like

212
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
F***

213
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
They're hitting the spot

214
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
I got to come out

215
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
Prove that I'm right

216
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,791
This was a bad idea

217
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,119
Because

218
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,215
Rrl Jones

219
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:03,615
Level blunder this is bad during the winter

220
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,895
More or less

221
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:11,295
That is what he did

222
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,111
Long clip that he put out

223
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
Because there's a lot of stuff

224
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
It's just repetitive s***

225
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,743
About how he's not an actor

226
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
He's totally real

227
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:27,423
Just literally verbatim the same stuff that we heard in episodes

228
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,007
There's a lot of other stuff that he just uses

229
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,615
Vaguely true instances of the media lion

230
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:39,455
Reinforce his argument Ray

231
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,247
I don't believe

232
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
You

233
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:48,671
When you're saying but I also don't want no skin in that game

234
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
Just because

235
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,231
Yes they do lie

236
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,535
Doesn't mean they're lying now

237
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:58,143
Yeah the possibility that where I'm at

238
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,703
Together

239
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,031
Seems like a fruitless Battlefront

240
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
At least

241
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,663
Pothole

242
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
Really big one

243
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,271
So we're on flat tire

244
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,599
This is multiple you busted episode

245
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,903
Then

246
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,463
I will say this just an anticipation

247
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,279
Alex bust himself accidentally

248
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,583
And then he tells one of the

249
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
Craziest

250
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,887
Stories from his life

251
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,215
I can't believe it's true

252
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,007
And we're going to get to all that

253
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,591
On this episode

254
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
Can there be more

255
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,527
Spoiler alert

256
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
Would there be

257
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,575
Discover

258
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,599
There's nothing

259
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
Which

260
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
And he's a f******

261
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,487
A****** in Monster 44 what he said about it

262
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
But even if he is right

263
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:01,119
He covered it completely just tell you what the new Sandy Hook information is

264
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,167
Cuz I'm not sure where it comes up

265
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,703
But I can just tell you one wants that

266
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,311
Okay so his argument of the new Sandy Hook information

267
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
Adhesive

268
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,663
I just realized this

269
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
If

270
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,527
The media has about all these other things

271
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,087
Why would they lie to us about that

272
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
That's the new information

273
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
That's not new

274
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,183
And that's not information

275
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
So wait

276
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
His new information

277
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
Is a nymph

278
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Yep

279
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,655
51

280
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
I worry about that

281
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,287
Because it's and it's not even just that it's a

282
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,567
Speculative

283
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,615
Inference

284
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,175
If

285
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
Why not

286
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:52,319
If you consider that it is still at Savin Beach

287
00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:00,767
Absolutely doesn't track the premises don't lead to the conclusion that anyway

288
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,327
If they did this then they want to know

289
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Hello

290
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,519
That's so here's the Telltale how long is this

291
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,591
How long is this video

292
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,383
How long is this

293
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,431
An hour an hour

294
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,711
Information

295
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,247
That he spreads out over and

296
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,551
That's the new Sandy Hook

297
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:29,183
Make a meal out of talking about the media lying

298
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:33,279
Right and again it's like okay we talked about

299
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,815
Video of Anderson

300
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,839
Cooper's nose

301
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:40,959
Disappearing if you look into it there there are like video specialist as I like

302
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:47,359
River really necessarily have to be a green screen there are aspect ratios and things within a camera

303
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
That could account for that

304
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
You don't know what this

305
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,759
I've seen this happen before.

306
00:16:54,527 --> 00:17:00,671
Inclusive

307
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
Like I said

308
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,511
You f****** gets into a f****** crazy story about his life

309
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,583
Anderson Cooper's nose is green

310
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,887
It's true it's one of the greenest things on the

311
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,495
Looks like Baltimore

312
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,591
To your question even further

313
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:23,199
If you have little information you'll see this is how he start

314
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,015
Donald Trump

315
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,855
General come out

316
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:40,095
Rogue

317
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,519
Don't get the truth out about the Democratic Party

318
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,335
The Republican establishment to put Donald John Trump

319
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
The office

320
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Couple thing

321
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,991
About it is he saying Wikileaks is good

322
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,527
Yeah

323
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,855
Of the Trump

324
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,439
Yeah he talks about how loyal

325
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,999
So I'm assuming that Julian Assange has released

326
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,279
The new Sandy Hook at 4

327
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,607
Formation

328
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
This

329
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,935
The preamble to getting really into the

330
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,751
Of what it is Julian Assange himself

331
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
The Patriot

332
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,359
America at all

333
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
Who is

334
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,431
Not beholding to our laws

335
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
Certainly not

336
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,527
Is it the one

337
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,463
Sex.

338
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
Chip should work

339
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:44,095
So if Trump is telling

340
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,143
They are independent branches

341
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
Now

342
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
Let's play

343
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:55,359
Get rid of any

344
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
The Constitution

345
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,735
Meaningless today it's a suggestion

346
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:07,391
People are fired for disagreeing with Trump

347
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,791
Forest

348
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,071
Tears

349
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,167
Long series of TV

350
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
Graphics about his poll numbers

351
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
Go music

352
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
Stop

353
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
Noah's first

354
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,967
The second thing that I think

355
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
Is interesting

356
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
Is it Alex's

357
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,087
Accidentally in there I believe making an argument why you should

358
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,111
Prosecute

359
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
Really

360
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:42,975
Volume

361
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
Community

362
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
Classified

363
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
Illegal

364
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,119
Disseminated

365
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:49,887
Which would be a leg

366
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
No

367
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,751
Disagree

368
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,543
Technically

369
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,567
Technically

370
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,847
The people who leaked

371
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,175
Under the barest rule of the

372
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,199
Espionage Act

373
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,735
Against

374
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,015
Ever.

375
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
They did

376
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,623
Right

377
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,647
If you are going to

378
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,463
Say that Wikileaks by Distributing

379
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
Committed a crime

380
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
Then

381
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,839
Every single news

382
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
F******

383
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,191
This is a bigger argument than we have the time

384
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:30,335
To get into right now but I don't necessarily the same as a normal journalistic Outlet

385
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,639
Because they are doing things strategically

386
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,455
And they have to withhold leaks

387
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,735
That they have gotten

388
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,295
Suspicious reasons

389
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,575
I do

390
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
The guardian

391
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:47,999
This is going to be a longer conversation we need to get down to the new Sandy Hook

392
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,767
Information

393
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,791
My point

394
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,095
I think if I can put a button on it

395
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,143
Is there instances like

396
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,679
The case of Chelsea Manning

397
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,983
Revealed things

398
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,799
War crimes

399
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,103
A lot of the stuff that he allowed

400
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:08,735
That's another thing

401
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,295
Here at the Clinton emails and stuff

402
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,831
Documentary crime

403
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,416
I don't think you should treat them the same way

404
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,744
One of them is a horrible propaganda campaign

405
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
Against

406
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
Specific person

407
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,816
The other is

408
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
Legitimate whistleblowing

409
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,656
Interesting that's

410
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,192
I don't know how you

411
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:32,544
Treat them differently right and in my mind I know they're not the same thing

412
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,408
I think that's where we get into the

413
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,992
And this is the bulshit argument I do not want to make

414
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,576
But it is that slippery slope

415
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,600
I don't

416
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,880
Rarely ever

417
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,416
Gree with slippery slope argument

418
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,720
Sure

419
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,768
But in this particular instance

420
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,352
As well as in I think the god

421
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,656
But that's a whole nother

422
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,520
I know what you're saying and what you need to do what you need to clarify

423
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
RV

424
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,360
A slippery slope is a logical fallacy

425
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,384
Because you're saying

426
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,712
In the future and you have no way of knowing that

427
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,040
You can say it makes a press

428
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,624
President that's really scary

429
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,440
But it's not like okay now everybody is going

430
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,744
To go down

431
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,816
Sing the courts can look at this

432
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,888
Precedent

433
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:33,216
The only the only thing about that though

434
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,008
Is that

435
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,360
Now you expand the liability

436
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,176
Sure and when you do that

437
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
Makes them

438
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,224
Far more

439
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,904
That goes too far than one that

440
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,928
Is afraid of

441
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,720
I would like to aromantic

442
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,512
I would also

443
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
You probably should

444
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,328
Parking public people sex

445
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,912
WeeWorld

446
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,728
It's almost like the two of us

447
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,264
Can't solve this ourselves

448
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
Probably not

449
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,336
Life's complicated

450
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
Call The Proud boys

451
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,200
Outlaw censorship

452
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:19,552
There's a lot of stuff that we can't really eat as much of policy wonks as we are

453
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,856
It's difficult to get to the bottom of the door

454
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,136
Alex Jones

455
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,928
Is a man who loves

456
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,024
To get angry about that a little bit

457
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,072
Next

458
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,400
It Was Written in the early nineteen

459
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:39,520
In order to get into the right

460
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:44,896
Yeah to get to the heart of the matter and what's going on

461
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,968
If you are you definitely are

462
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:56,416
It's important because we're going to

463
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,232
As we do want every f****** episodes that you've done

464
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,864
He goes on after this

465
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:11,264
Again not to talk about Sandy Hook but he goes on to talk about that one time

466
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,904
Deception

467
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,952
I go on Joe Rogan's podcast

468
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,632
41 podcast

469
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,448
Or 3 hours 45 minutes

470
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,640
But you can see how the media

471
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:54,272
Bushcraft

472
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,928
Yeah moving on them like a b****

473
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,072
Now shows depends on Trump Hill play the clip

474
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,656
But on both ends. Ladies and gentlemen they will not show you

475
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,752
Trump is wrong

476
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,152
What are the quotes that he would like

477
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,200
Just for fun

478
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,760
Here is the clip of him on Joe Rogan

479
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:32,160
You can see if it matches up at all with reality

480
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
Asking about aliens

481
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,120
GM Joe Rogan

482
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:47,520
Leave that on the show on

483
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,080
Hour-long violent argument

484
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,384
If you want go find

485
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,552
This is what Alex

486
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
Himself out of

487
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
Contacts

488
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:09,280
Donald Trump racist

489
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,912
That is friends with him

490
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,936
20 years ago

491
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:20,032
It's all just completed

492
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:26,432
At the RNC speech he says Republicans

493
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,968
For civil rights laws

494
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:34,368
Music

495
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:40,256
To use a real

496
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,592
You said it not perfect

497
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:59,968
He's a man

498
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,272
And those kind of do their type

499
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,320
Hyper aggressive personality

500
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,952
Frank Dimitri

501
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:16,352
The big one is incontinence

502
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:30,944
Whatever you want

503
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:51,424
Talking about bushes in Whitesburg

504
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:57,824
Conversation

505
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,224
Locker room

506
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,808
Company should have said probably

507
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,904
What is he's really doing he's really to Italy called

508
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,720
Snopes

509
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,768
No that's the clip from Rogan

510
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,584
I think that anybody saying

511
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,120
Defending Trump

512
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,912
Is totally right

513
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,960
The only one

514
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:31,360
Defending Trump and even the stuff

515
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432
Go fuc yourself

516
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,040
Willing

517
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,320
Participant

518
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:45,184
He's talking about kissing people before they even get introduced

519
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,488
He's moving in on people like a b****

520
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,280
And then they reject him

521
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,584
Grabs people pussies

522
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,864
Like that's not

523
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,888
What's going on

524
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,448
Absolutely

525
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,496
In that clip making excuses for him

526
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,032
The hidebehind

527
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,080
Hey look

528
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,616

529
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
Hey look he's

530
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
Which is

531
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,552
I've made mistakes

532
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
Sure

533
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,624
It's a it's a

534
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,160
That's that's the thing like

535
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:16,928
Would like

536
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,952
That

537
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,720
False

538
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,000
Bulshit of like

539
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,280
Well it's not rape

540
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,376
Right that doesn't make it okay

541
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,448
No Monsters everyday thing

542
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,984
Since so many women have

543
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,776
To deal with but your defenses

544
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,568
Well I mean it's not rape

545
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
A truck not a defense

546
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
The defenses like

547
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,664
It could have been worse

548
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,480
Yeah great

549
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,040
Look you told him my car but

550
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,368
I'm not going to press charges because you didn't kill me

551
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:52,512
Could have been worse

552
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,864
All right you're busted Alex

553
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:01,984

558
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,160
On our way to his Integrity says

559
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,656
What is Jomon

560
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,960
Never do that to somebody

561
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,288
Pieces of news

562
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,592
That we've discovered

563
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:43,968
Contacts

Find

571
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,664
What is a pizza K12 recently better than on Recycle

572
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,200
This is not a retraction

573
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:20,576
Right immediately detects the classic example

574
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,880
Do now because it made such a media splash

575
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648

00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,256
It's not a retract

579
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,792
You have to retract it

580
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,584
The entire pie

581
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,864
Pizzagate story was wrong

582
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,400
And we were wrong for doing

583
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,424
How many did

584
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,216
This is not

585
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,432
How do you spell vet

586
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,992
I think I might email him

587
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,784
And asking for retract

588
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:55,648
Because that he is a complete liar about the

589
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,440
Okay

590
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,976
I can't overstate it

591
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,000
It's just

592
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,280
Literally

593
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,048
He's a liar

594
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,608
So in this episode there's going to be no

595
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,168
Lying versus

596
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:07,936
This is stupid

597
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
None

598
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,264
This is full-on

599
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,312
In full control of his back

600
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,872
There's no wiggle room

601
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,432
Lying

602
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,992
But he starts to introduce

603
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,808
The Narrative about Sandy Hook

604
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,832
This probably like

605
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,880
I would say 10 minutes

606
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,464
No it's because we're not

607
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,560
When we get

608
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,168
The hook information

609
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
Here today

610
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,288
So he introduces saying that we're going to talk about Sandy Hook by

611
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,640
Saying that information we come out

612
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
Right

613
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
He's going to

614
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,224
Acknowledge that

615
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,272
Was wrong information

616
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,184
And he is

617
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,976
Very remorseful about that

618
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:04,768
Forces

619
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,048
And just

620
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,352
Penske has minimized

621
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
The murders

622
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,912
People's children

623
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,448
I am traumatized parents

624
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,520
He doesn't need to harass them in person

625
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,568
To do that

626
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:22,432
But can we get into the information he goes to complain a little bit about Madeleine Albright

627
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,768
Is on 60 Minutes

628
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,816
With Leslie Stahl

629
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,656
15 years ago

630
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,032
What's a reasonable price to pay

631
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,872
And so much more

632
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,904
We've heard that half a million children of God I mean that's more

633
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,232
Children and I don't want open in Hiroshima

634
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:13,632
And you know is the price worth it I think this is a very hard

635
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,960
Choice but the price we think the price is worth it

636
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:23,360
It's a good price

637
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,480
Turns out Saddam was a CIA operative

638
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,832
Kuwait

639
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,648
Ambassador was okay

640
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:42,560
We don't know what are you getting

641
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:48,960
You notice he doesn't have any documentation for it

642
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,752
If you go to his like

643
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:56,384
You go to Infowars and try and find any documentation on it there's nothing

644
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:59,200
He said was fourteen years ago which was in 2000

645
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:02,784
3

646
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:09,440
Does a 1996 interview that she did on CBS

647
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,048
No it was Desert Storm

648
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,120
It was the original time in Iraq

649
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:23,520
Phantom Menace

650
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,824
Clone Wars

651
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,384
He doesn't What you talkin about

652
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,176
What you said

653
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:36,832
You still coming out of contact

654
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,904
That. Hussein invaded

655
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,184
Yes I did happen

656
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,232
Alex

657
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,304
He was told by the CIA

658
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,376
For now what we know is that he did that

659
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,656
I didn't respond

660
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,936
We put sanctions

661
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,704
Anorak

662
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,728
Weave

663
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,752
Serious sanctions

664
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,800
That ended up causing a lot of

665
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,568
People to die

666
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,872
Economic sanctions and that sort of thing

667
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:06,016
Madeleine Albright has gone on record and said we were very specific we did not put sanctions on food or medicine

668
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,064
Those sorts of things could still go in

669
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,368
You know people end up hoarding

670
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,696
It's not something you can really control the distribution of

671
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,256
That's a big problem but that's not

672
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,048
No problem necessarily

673
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,328
I don't know how you

674
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,352
So

675
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
Thousand children

676
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:32,896
He was talking about in that interview was is that acceptable

677
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:36,224
Try and stop someone from invading other country

678
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
That is a bad quote

679
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,344
And

680
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:45,696
Democracynow for COD

681
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,232
With Madeleine Albright

682
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,768
And interviewed her about that

683
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,584
Escorted

684
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,144
Secretary Albright

685
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,192
Do you regret having said

686
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,264
Do you think the price is worth

687
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,312
Beers Madeleine Albright

688
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,592
Response

689
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,408
I've said 5000 times that I regret it

690
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,944
It was a stupid statement

691
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,248
I never should have made it and if everybody else

692
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,808
That is ever made a statement they regret would stand

693
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,344
There'd be a lot of people

694
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,648
I have many many times said that

695
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,696
And I wish people would report that I've said that

696
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,720
I rotate

697
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,256
In my book that it was a stupid

698
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,608
Search eastern up and gave a retraction

699
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,656
Exactly

700
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,424
Yes

701
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,704
That is both

702
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,984
Honorable

703
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,776
And also

704
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,056
It was a stupid thing

705
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,080
It was

706
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,128
And I wish she hadn't

707
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,480
And I wish you'd known that when she wasn't

708
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:46,880
That's like Obama, I wish we hadn't killed

709
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:54,048
This instant isn't the media line

710
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:58,656
It's someone who made an unfortunate statement even

711
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,704
Stupid is that statement is

712
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,752
You kinda understand where it came from

713
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,824
Yeah like there was a war going on there was

714
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:09,152
A guy who

715
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:12,224
And it's like we talked about you end up

716
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,296
Siding with a force

717
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,088
Do takeout

718
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,464
Against

719
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,840
You make unfortunately it's f***** up

720
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,608
But it's not

721
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,144
It's not what I want to say

722
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,192
Global foreign politics

723
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,520
Pretty complicate

724
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,080
Just a complete map

725
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,712
You're pregnant totally out of context

726
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
You're not

727
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,296
You're not a Walkman

728
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:53,696
You're not dealing you're not dealing with not until you donate to our Patriots

729
00:38:53,952 --> 00:39:00,096
Patreon he will get absolutely do that for

730
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,376
Donut

731
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,008
After this key goes on

732
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,056
Do I give a string of Lies

733
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,592
About about

734
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,408
The times media is

735
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,688
I am an

736
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,992
He gets into talking about the lies

737
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,040
They made us bomb Syria

738
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,136
Pretty cool

739
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:23,904
Pretty cool

740
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:28,768
Where's the last criticizing your not there

741
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,424
Right here,

742
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,568
But yes

743
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:45,408
Where is the last

744
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,432
Who criticized

745
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,480
Right here right here

746
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,296
Where's the last criticizing

747
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,320
You're not there

748
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,368
Then stumble Te'o

749
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,144
Easy

750
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,984
Play the gentleman

751
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,312
Because there's a lot of research has to go into this

752
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,968
Does have to go in

753
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,016
A lot of research

754
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,832
No absolutely not

755
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,880
I would love to be a fly on the wall

756
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,416
In the war room

757
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:32,512
Infowars beer pong

758
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,560
They probably everybody

759
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,120
Turn down for the WWE

760
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,656
Oh man

761
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,448
I would not be surprised

762
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:46,848
Some overlap what's the angle on this

763
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,616
Whoever

764
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,176
Is Trump about to turn heel

765
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,184
The only one that I really know and mainly because

766
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,208
What

767
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:03,744
What

768
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,144
And that's okay

769
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,704
It's not but sometimes you should just go

770
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,496
I'll tell you what

771
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:18,592
It's real easy for me to find the truth about things Alex says

772
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:22,688
Because I would dare say eighty to ninety percent of the time it is the office

773
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,272
95

774
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,064
If the first link on Google

775
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,344
Sure

776
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,928
Google a thing he said

777
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:39,328
First link that comes up will disprove

778
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:49,056
Sort of lead people to do surface-level

779
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,592
Research

780
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:53,663
The first link

781
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,991
Ellicott

782
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,295
So Alex is going on this year review

783
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:03,135
Whole bunch already about him

784
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:07,231
August. Congratulations to everybody who did the March 4th

785
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,095
I hope we

786
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,935
All the way

787
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:18,751
God damn paid protesters man that's a bummer

788
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:22,335
Forty thousand people out there

789
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,615
That's God

790
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,967
It's like 25 bucks like jewelry

791
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:31,295
Absolutely

792
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,063
Ridley Scott

793
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,951
Is he at George Soros on Twitter

794
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,975
If so

795
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,767
Funny

796
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,047
Right bro

797
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,095
Angry boys

798
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,751
Haven

799
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:55,615
Yes he goes on in his Mexico update

800
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,039
Defend himself

801
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:11,743
It's about the new viewers

802
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,959
You can verify this

803
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,983
For yourself

804
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,751
You can't

805
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,055
Also

806
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,359
This is what people

807
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,151
This is

808
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:35,551
Not true don't like a lot of people don't want to get busted in some sort of Allah

809
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:39,391
I'm not lying this is all about truth here man

810
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,671
All about truth

811
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:44,255
It's it's one of the best ways to get people to

812
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,815
Just believe you is just a unbelievable

813
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,143
A lot of people are dumb

814
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,727
It's been terrible

815
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:57,567
It is true you're an emotion in those sorts of things

816
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,383
It makes people shut off cognitive

817
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,407
Little

818
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,967
Stopgap measures in their brain

819
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,807
Otherwise guard them from believing.

820
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:11,647
Takes over ironically lizard mask part of your brain

821
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,439
So that's dumb

822
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,999
The next clip Alex then goes on

823
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:19,327
To get into more about the media lying about him and

824
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,095
Text

825
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,143
Horse pivot

826
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,423
Specifically

827
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:28,287
Just like all the media is always

828
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,847
We're going to get

829
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:36,479
But this one is just sort of generalize lies and then

830
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,247
It gives

831
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,015
Into

832
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,319
Big old islamophobia

833
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:44,671
Great great I was wondering we were going to get to hating on people who believe in his

834
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:46,975
Just be a second

835
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:53,375
Is the I'm sorry Muslims worship

836
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:57,727
Apologize

837
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,055
The media says

838
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,591
Lee attacks never happened

839
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,359
Sandy Hook

840
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:08,479
When you can go and find myself

841
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:17,439
With both side people that sing

842
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,975
And former top

843
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,767
School security

844
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,863
Law enforcement folks like wolf

845
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:30,495
The truth

846
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:36,127
Have you got a government caught lying about that causes Wars

847
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,943
Hundreds of thousands of children from

848
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:43,295
Bill Clinton

849
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,415
So is his basic argument is

850
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:52,255
We know the government is willing to accept that half

851
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,279
7 million children

852
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,047
When is a

853
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,583
Is a reasonable loss

854
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,375
Is Madeleine Albright

855
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:00,447
She has

856
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:10,943
Is killing civilians is acceptable in the Rules of Engagement or whatever it's like

857
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,551
There's a map on it you can kill up to 30 people if you get a good

858
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,623
So we know that the government

859
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,391
Is willing to

860
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,159
To kill

861
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,767
Then kill these children

862
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,143
Depicting his position on Sandy Hook

863
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:30,911
Quote

864
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,959
Oh yeah

865
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:37,055
Snippet his his position is even more nonsense

866
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,079
What you just said

867
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,127
Because his position is

868
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,455
There been people on the show and we've had debates about it

869
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,551
But I don't know I can't prove it either way I don't know

870
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:51,391
The government clearly was and is okay with killing civilians

871
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,671
Do your part was only

872
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,463
That was the sort of like

873
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:00,863
The carrot dangling out of his

874
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,983
Or at least he's very inclined to believe

875
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,543
I can't prove it either way

876
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,591
Hiding behind

877
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,431
Do we have a

878
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,199
Clip of him

879
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,247
Static

880
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,783
Hold on would you say that

881
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,551
Perhaps

882
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,599
He is mischaracterizing

883
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,623
His own state

884
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,391
I don't know

885
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:29,791
You don't know I have no idea let's see how this plays out

886
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,071
Generally whenever I ask

887
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:37,471
Question like that you have no idea

888
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:40,799
Whataboutism

889
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:49,503
And they do this over and over again I don't want them to sit there and shake their finger at me

890
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:53,855
Compare about children being shot in mass shooting

891
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,999
I'm here

892
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:02,815
Cause of death

893
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:06,399
George Strait

894
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:07,935
Drowning

895
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,703
Is definitely

896
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:12,543
CDC

897
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,615
I looked into the CDC

898
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,663
The statistics about this

899
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,199
Pretty off

900
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,247
The cause of death

901
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,783
The top

902
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,575
Cause of death

903
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,879
Number 10 number 10

904
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,671
Suicide

905
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:31,487
Suicide Squad

906
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:37,631
Guns will not all of them but a lot of them are and then number for is just do Vegas f****** thing

907
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,399
Accident

908
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,495
Accidental gunshot

909
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,823
Is well-taken

910
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,127
In terms of heart disease and cancer number one

911
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:48,895
Into

912
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:52,735
Lower respiratory diseases is number three

913
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,783
I mean if you want if you want

914
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,831
Go down that road

915
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:59,135
I mean until we heart disease

916
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,927
Let's not tackle guns

917
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,511
Do you like

918
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,815
The point that people who are against

919
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,607
Guns generally make

920
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,375
Earliest

921
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,143
Against

922
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,423
Everybody having gun

923
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:14,239
Is B A lot of these deaths are really avoidable

924
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,263
Whereas

925
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,543
Heart disease

926
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,079
A little bit more complicated

927
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:23,455
But it also takes early detection in order for it to be

928
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,223
Efficient

929
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,015
Heart disease is a penguin

930
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,415
A lot of those are just like

931
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,183
Hey

932
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:33,951
Human being

933
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,743
We're not

934
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,279
Supposed to live

935
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,607
Dirt bike

936
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,423
That's irrelevant

937
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:47,519
The thing that people are complaining about not generally that no one should have done

938
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:50,847
Kill Everybody

939
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:55,455
All the accidental gunshot death

940
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,479
Exist

941
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,247
Couldn't

942
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:59,295
Be gone they don't have to happen

943
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,855
Right

944
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,047
Control over who had

945
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:14,911
We had better education a better education about guns

946
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,935
Nothing like.

947
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,959
Leave guns out

948
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,983
That sort of thing

949
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,567
Don't let your kids be around them leave download

950
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,639
All that sort of stuff would be really effective

951
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,407
And

952
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:28,479
Of course Alex's argument against

953
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:35,135
If you yelled at Piers Morgan

954
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,927
One-time famously

955
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,511
Sword

956
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,535
That

957
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,303
It's not 14

958
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,583
Closer to like

959
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,863
Like 10 but like

960
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,399
It isn't the biggest

961
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,191
That doesn't matter

962
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,471
Also well

963
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,031
Also we're not allowed to study it because somehow

964
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:52,799
The gun lobby

965
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,079
Is so strong

966
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,639
They got a rule in Congress that you

967
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,943
You can't do any research about guns

968
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:06,367
In the context that he's talking about you talk about mass shootings

969
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,391
Stuff like that

970
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,183
So much

971
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,487
Millions of people died from mass shootings

972
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,279
Is that they're all horribly traumatic

973
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,815
Usually involve

974
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,143
Incredibly Ennis

975
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,983
Cook children

976
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,127
I can't do it

977
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,663
Like I can't do it

978
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,783
Are we just all accepted that mass shootings are happy

979
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,391
What's what is it going to take

980
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:42,463
Not really is going to take do you want it

981
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,743
The only

982
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,767
Real way that pee

983
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,047
People are going to make any

984
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:46,815
Changes there

985
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:50,655
Minorities start shooting white people all the time

986
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,935
Is it

987
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,959
Or if we start

988
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,775
If we start utilizing our Mash

989
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,151
Adamantly

990
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:01,919
Sure

991
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:07,295
Don't I don't like I don't like the line you're starting to go down

992
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,575
If you see a mass shooter

993
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,903
Walking down the street on his way to imagine

994
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,999
Just point them toward the ridge purse

995
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,535
I'm not saying

996
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,327
That you should encourage anything

997
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,887
I am not encouraging violence towards anybody

998
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,655
Sure

999
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,959
Pregnant

1000
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,823
Pointed in the right direction

1001
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:34,431
There are

1002
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:40,831
I'm agreeing or disagreeing with you

1003
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,367
Are a Virgo

1004
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,487
Suicide attempt

1005
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,023
Definition

1006
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,047
And no one's

1007
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:51,839
You are

1008
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,519
Cars

1009
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,335
Islamists coming in

1010
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:09,247
No one said banshee

1011
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:15,903
From as usual

1012
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:30,239
But this latest attack

1013
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:35,103
Medium

1014
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:48,415
Last year without Muslims

1015
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:56,607
That sounds reasonable

1016
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:59,679
Your Gator kill you

1017
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:09,663
Education cancer or any number of these different

1018
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:13,247
What's what's the difference

1019
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:18,623
What's the different one of them is a Muslim

1020
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,183
Stuff is not really what he's

1021
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:24,255
More importantly

1022
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,047
What people were taking a

1023
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,071
Issue with was

1024
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,375
The way he

1025
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,655
Doubt about it

1026
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,959
Before the facts were in with your response

1027
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:36,543
No matter what the truth of the situation is

1028
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,823
If it does

1029
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,127
You know if it does come out there this into

1030
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,151
Incident was

1031
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,175
Is an act of terrorism

1032
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:45,247
It's still wrong of him before the factor there

1033
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,015
2

1034
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,063
That sort of thing

1035
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,087
It's Unbecoming

1036
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,111
8

1037
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,391
Just Unbecoming

1038
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,415
It is

1039
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,951
The president of the United

1040
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:55,999
So

1041
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:59,071
That's what makes

1042
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:05,983
It's Unbecoming if somebody is becoming human

1043
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:11,103
President tweeting this s*** out that is a

1044
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,127
To Violet

1045
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:16,479
Especially if it's a present who has the record that he has

1046
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,063
That situation

1047
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,623
With every other single thing that he's ever

1048
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:27,231
I'm not wanted to wrestle with the details

1049
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:28,255
The other thing I think

1050
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:33,631
It's funny cuz he's having riots every night and like they posted a video with little while back proving

1051
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,447
They're trying to burn down Paris

1052
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,471
And there's riots

1053
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:40,799
People shooting off fireworks in like a celebration

1054
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:47,455
The holiday

1055
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:52,063
What is f****** wrong with you guys that Muslims celebrate Chinese New Year

1056
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:57,695
I didn't know I didn't I wasn't even been Bastille Day

1057
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,767
I don't remember exactly which holiday

1058
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:05,375
But it was something that just took wildly out they would just lie even if you were

1059
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,655
Like that's the most

1060
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:10,495
Easily disprovable thing there because even if you're exaggerating

1061
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:13,311
You're resorting to hyperbole

1062
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,591
Which as you know

1063
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,359
I would never

1064
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,895
Never

1065
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,199
Every night

1066
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,735
Implies there's a lot of riot

1067
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:21,503
Regular

1068
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:26,111
And even then if you're saying

1069
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,415
Well I'm not I don't mean every night

1070
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,439
I just mean there's a

1071
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,207
Connor Ryan

1072
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,231
Yeah

1073
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,511
Okay

1074
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,279
Joe

1075
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,095
Show me to riots

1076
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,375
Yeah

1077
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,911
Cuz you know what

1078
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,679
One riot

1079
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,447
I will except

1080
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:44,287
Sure but if you're going to say there's rides every night I want at least two

1081
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,335
Intuit

1082
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:49,407
Unrelated into

1083
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:51,967
If you want to develop a pattern and then test

1084
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,575
Yeah

1085
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,599
Number two

1086
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,903
Lowering my bars information

1087
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,463
Information Wars

1088
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:08,863
Out of courtesy for your a busy with all the other skirmishes in the intro of War

1089
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,679
Formation war on like 6 front

1090
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,959
Smokey Point

1091
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:15,519
What's a custody battle

1092
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:20,639
Yeah

1093
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:31,135
Makes these claims that they just aren't

1094
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,159
Ever support

1095
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,695
So

1096
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,463
Hooray

1097
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,743
Great

1098
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,279
Please demonize

1099
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,303
Population

1100
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:39,839
Based on your whims

1101
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,375
To create a storyline

1102
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:43,423
Please go ahead keep doing that

1103
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,959
It's not going to bite you in the NFL

1104
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:46,495
Never

1105
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,263
Well

1106
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:48,543
I made it

1107
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:52,383
A lot of people have gotten a lot of power by doing it you've made a lot of money

1108
00:57:56,223 --> 00:58:00,831
Easily influenced by demagogue not making any money

1109
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:07,231
Nothing is demonizing

1110
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,255
Higher population

1111
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,791
We're going about a backwards

1112
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,071
We're demonizing

1113
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:11,839
A guy

1114
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:15,423
Are we getting

1115
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:21,823
To him in Subway's way more like his rhetoric and not what he stands for as a tragic flaw.

1116
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,919
Human beings we're being way to Fair Game Plan

1117
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,687
Who should we

1118
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,455
Demonized

1119
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,759
What is there like

1120
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,575
Aztec

1121
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,367
Someone is not around anymore

1122
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:39,487
Let's demonize him group is not now that's not even

1123
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:42,815
He was chopping off somebody's head

1124
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,399
Oh my God

1125
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,679
These dirty Aztec

1126
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:51,007
We need to do something out of our ground is

1127
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,031
Right

1128
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:54,847
Sunrise

1129
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,127
Praise to the sun god

1130
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,943
Which as we all know there's only one God

1131
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,575
This isn't going to work

1132
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:13,535
It's a hundred percent is not going to work it's not

1133
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:18,911
An Inca

1134
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,191
It's not thinking

1135
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,239
Inca

1136
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,007
Income

1137
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,031
No it's it's own

1138
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:24,799
Who cares

1139
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,591
That's irrelevant

1140
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:32,735
I'm so high

1141
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,015
Cruising the f****** head

1142
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,807
With your jokes

1143
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,647
You know what

1144
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,695
After 33 years of being alive

1145
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,463
I finally found

1146
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,487
The place where I belong

1147
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:47,583
That's another Linkin Park song

1148
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,375
Look look I don't know any

1149
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:54,751
Linkin Park

1150
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:55,775
At all

1151
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,151
I know their name is Lincoln Park and they don't

1152
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:04,479
Be forgotten

1153
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:09,599
Alex's figured out where all of the stuff

1154
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,367
About

1155
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:11,903
His Sandy Hook

1156
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:15,231
Position that the media is lying about coming from

1157
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,791
Yeah

1158
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,351
The media has made specific

1159
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,887
Friendly's figured it out

1160
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,423
And I'll let him speak his

1161
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:27,519
0 article we found

1162
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,103
New Yorker magazine

1163
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,943
This is

1164
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:43,647
Because I look at everything from the Associated Press

1165
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,695
And they all

1166
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:49,791
Lyft

1167
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,839
This is the most crazy thing

1168
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,375
I've ever seen

1169
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,935
September 11th

1170
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:56,959
They quoted it

1171
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:01,055
Jones amazing reputation around his family from his high volume

1172
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:07,967
I have to pause there cuz you're totally right if he was able to figure out where was coming from they attributed it

1173
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:11,807
Quotes

1174
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,855
And they said

1175
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,391
From the New York

1176
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,159
Hey Alex

1177
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:21,023
It's like a double apostrophe importation dark journalist

1178
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:26,911
Use other people's reporting at their own reporting

1179
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,703
You can't do all of the news by yourself

1180
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:32,287
It's only plagiarize if you don't

1181
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,847
If you're able to

1182
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:37,407
The patient zero anyway

1183
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:40,735
Really good point I completely missed that

1184
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,279
Shropshire

1185
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:02,495
Those were

1186
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:06,335
Now you know this week's here

1187
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,991
This is Brittany

1188
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:15,807
5000

1189
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:17,855
But I Noah

1190
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:26,559
Just keep

1191
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:37,311
Never said that

1192
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,079
So now

1193
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,127
Now listen

1194
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:41,663
I've listened

1195
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,455
You have

1196
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:45,759
Just going to adjust

1197
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:46,783
Hunch

1198
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,319
You

1199
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,367
May have

1200
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,647
Audio

1201
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,671
I just might

1202
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,439
You might

1203
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:57,279
Before we get to that

1204
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:01,631
I think they're he saying that everyone saying that he's fake

1205
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,679
Has no audio lullaby

1206
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,703
Everyone

1207
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,471
Responding

1208
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,263
To your lawyer

1209
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,823
They're not

1210
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,127
Most people

1211
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,407
Collaborate

1212
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,431
With their attorneys

1213
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,015
Client

1214
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:21,087
They're saying what they've agreed is going to be there gameplay

1215
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,439
Maybe that's wrong to make that assumption and Yukon road from your lawyer

1216
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,487
Maybe that's the case

1217
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:33,887
Going to put we're not going to put a medium Avion this we're going to put a very plausible

1218
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:42,335
You're making that claim I don't know what the fuc

1219
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,103
What is up with you

1220
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,383
But if your lawyer

1221
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:47,711
I would almost

1222
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:55,647
So now you saying that article is patient zero of him saying

1223
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,415
That

1224
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,439
Sandy Hook

1225
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,207
Was fake

1226
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,487
701

1227
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:03,583
And they don't have any don't have any audio of Hillary

1228
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,607
No links

1229
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:07,167
New Yorker did not do its due diligence

1230
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,191
They needed to

1231
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:08,959
Supposed link

1232
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:13,055
To all of these things and you can do it

1233
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,103
So that means they don't exist Dan

1234
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,639
I rest my case

1235
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:20,991
I would like to travel back to the show

1236
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:26,623
On January 13th of 2015 Huron remove the strike this evidence for the record

1237
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,415
Denied

1238
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:35,583
What I'm curious about is do you think that there's a new level of sophistication with a lot of these false flag

1239
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:36,863
Where

1240
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,423
A couple of pizza

1241
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:45,055
I just want to make it clear cuz it Doesn't there's no context

1242
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:48,639
Is the Charlie hebdo attack

1243
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,687
That's how they got into this

1244
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:52,735
He's making the argument that

1245
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,783
Because I think Alex does references

1246
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:59,647
Charlie hebdo also false flag

1247
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,767
Absolutely man

1248
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,303
Islamophobia

1249
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:12,703
It's the globalist doing that to make people more afraid of Muslims it's complicated

1250
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:19,871
She's a very Tangled married and it also had something to do with strangling free speech

1251
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,455
Anyway

1252
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,479
Who's responsible scholar

1253
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:28,831
Flimsy evidence that get everybody talking and serum in the wrong direction

1254
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:37,023
Jamaica Jamaica

1255
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:41,887
It's just that when they were funded by Western Funding

1256
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,567
Provocateurs

1257
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:56,479
Becomes a red herring

1258
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:57,759
Because

1259
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,807
All the world

1260
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:09,535
Bowers

1261
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,095
Then

1262
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:14,911
Caught using blue screen

1263
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:18,751
Email Bloomberg

1264
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:22,847
Reselling is people get ready next 24 hours to capitalize on a shooting

1265
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,639
Yeah show

1266
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,711

1267
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,991
Completely fake

1268
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,855
Manufacturer

1269
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:42,047
Clearly

1270
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,071

That is very that's crazy

1277

All the stuff that he said

1278
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:15,583
You said all the stuff that he said the media is making up about him

1279
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:17,375

How long did it take you to get that clip of hemline verbatim

1287
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:39,135

It's completely insane yeah it's kind of like

1290
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:58,591
You know the criminal who wants to get caught

1291
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:01,663
Kind of like he's got to be exhausted

1292
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:07,551
Recent version of the zodiac I can't repeat

1293
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,575
F*** you

1294
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,623
You stupid son of a b****

1295
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,903
How dare you

1296
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,439
That's enough of that

1297
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:16,511
But now I want to get into for a second

1298
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:19,327
Enough for our show

1299
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,607
I will leave the rest

1300
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,375
Do the parents

1301
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:24,191
Of that Dad the dead children who are

01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:27,263
Really doing some good work telling a shut the fuk up

1303
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,031
Which is correct

1304
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,567
I like to see

1305
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:31,871
Terrible for their loss

1306
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,639
But

1307
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,943
He referenced a bunch of things there

1308
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,735
That are like little pieces of

1309
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,271
Proof that Sandy Hook is fake

1310
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:41,599
Yes I want to make my position clear

1311
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:42,879
I think it was real

1312
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,927
And I want to make my position.

1313
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,207
Look you're taking

1314
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:51,071
I want to make my position a little bit further clear

1315
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,887
I am a person

1316
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:56,191
Who engages conspiracy theories

1317
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:59,775
I'm person who for the last years and years of my life

1318
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:00,799
Has been like

1319
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,079
What if that's true

1320
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,615
And I've looked into things

1321
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,919
And I remember when Sandy Hook happen

1322
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:08,735
I remember seeing all of these conspiracies

1323
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,015
Popping up about them

1324
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,319
IWatch

1325
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,087
Peoples

1326
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,367
Sandy Hook is fake

1327
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,391
Videos

1328
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,439
Scary

1329
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,487
Really some of it's real scary

1330
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:21,791
Describes

1331
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,375
Because it scares me just based on

1332
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,399
No matter what

1333
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,471
Trying

1334
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:30,495
Declarative

Yeah and said that means that there

1336
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,335
You can never trust

1337
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:35,615
Annie

1338
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:38,175
You can never tribute

1339
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,455
Blame

1340
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:43,807
They were making these claims

1341
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:44,831
Seem to be real

1342
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:45,855
There was a bunch

1343
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:49,439
To stop about like police

1344
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,975
Xclear

1345
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:56,607
Stuff and all this instance of children walking around in a circle

1346
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:59,679
What is the Anderson Cooper

1347
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:02,495
It's really interesting

1348
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,775
To be really scared

1349
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,823
5

1350
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:09,151
Right I looked into it a bit further

1351
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:09,919
And found

1352
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:10,943
Explanation

1353
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,479
For literally everything

1354
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:14,015
That most of it was

1355
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:15,039
These videos

1356
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:15,807
Post

1357
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,575
On the internet

1358
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,623
Really

1359
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,415
These things are all

1360
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,183
Lies

1361
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:25,791
So why there's doctor video

1362
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,839
As we discussed there's an innocent explanation

1363
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,655
Entirely possible

1364
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:34,495
The children walking around

1365
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:37,311
You have to stay out of

1366
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:41,151
Around

1367
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:43,199
There's nothing we could do we can't like

1368
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:46,527
We might need to question people

1369
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:47,807
No

1370
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:57,791
Yeah it's a small town and why would anyone go back to this place

1371
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:58,559
Memories

1372
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:02,911
It's insane all of the pieces of evidence

1373
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,703
Or circumstantial is f***

1374
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,983
And most of them are Bass

1375
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,287
On manipulative explanation

1376
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,311
Made by YouTuber

1377
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,615
Why would you f****** evil

1378
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,383
Why would you

1379
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,991
He makes millions of dollars

1380
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:25,183
Yeah people really want to disbelieve every

1381
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:28,767
Over and over again makes life more interest

1382
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,559
Yeah but I mean

1383
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:32,351
That's like that kind of stuff

1384
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,143
Seems more

1385
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:36,703
You have a full-on

1386
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,031
You have an agenda there

1387
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,055
Where somebody's

1388
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,591
If your doctoring video

1389
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,639
It's not because you want to make life more

1390
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,967
It's because you're going out there

1391
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:50,015
To deceive pulling a prank

1392
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:51,807
With a purpose

1393
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,415
Will not do

1394
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:59,743
Understanding of the word

1395
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:06,399
Cruelty cruelty

1396
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,423
No I don't even want to

1397
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,191
Reference

1398
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:10,751
But there are those Webb communities

1399
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,543
That

1400
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,567
Right there's a lot of

1401
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:14,591
Message boards

1402
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,407
Right

1403
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:23,807
Secure kids come on and they're like they bully them to kill themselves Community online

1404
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:24,575
You think it's funny

1405
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:31,231
Videos necessarily are a product of that

1406
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,767
Yeah get attention

1407
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,815
Get things into the zeitgeist

1408
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:37,631
Whenever it's every single time

1409
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:39,167
And if you're not careful

1410
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:40,703
If you don't look into things

1411
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:43,007
You can fall for really dumb s***

1412
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:47,871
I'm super glad that I did

1413
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:50,943
Videos

1414
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,735
And then you went

1415
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,503
And look

1416
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:55,295
Further and that's where most

1417
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:58,879
Primary source or what they think

1418
01:12:59,135 --> 01:12:59,647
Because their primary

1419
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,719
And then they were like well I trust them

1420
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,487
So

1421
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,255
Done

1422
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:07,583
Or not even I trust them I trust the person who shared this

1423
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:10,655
The person who shared the brewery

1424
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:13,215
Yeah not ever a

1425
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:13,983
Two step

1426
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:18,335
So whenever whenever we're dealing with a lot of aloe

1427
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,103
Alex Jones

1428
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,151
Ultimately that's

1429
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,687
Like we're the second step

1430
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,223
Hopefully

1431
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,015
Yeah hopefully

1432
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,807
Again which is why weird

1433
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:30,623
No

1434
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,927
Of my own

1435
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:33,951
Life

1436
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,743
And what I can give you

1437
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,535
I can't prove Sandy Hook happen

1438
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,071
I can't do that

1439
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,095
I just can't

1440
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:42,399
I can't prove almost anything

1441
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,423
In the world

1442
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,191
Brenda Hampton

1443
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,215
Right

1444
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:46,239
I can tell you

1445
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:48,543
Thorough examination that I've done

1446
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,079
Every single piece

1447
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:53,663
Zodiac was fake

1448
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,431
Is b*******

1449
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,711
Yeah and Alex Jones

1450
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,271
And once again

1451
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,575
Did land on them

1452
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,879
Alex Jones

1453
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,415
Being a coward

1454
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:10,815
Hiding behind the I don't know when in reality

1455
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:11,583
On climate

1456
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,375
12

1457
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,143
F*** you

1458
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,191
You're killing me

1459
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:18,751
You are personally responsible

1460
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:19,519
For the

1461
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:21,567
Of millions of people

1462
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:26,431
In this case I was responsible for anyone's death

1463
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,991
F****** dick hole

1464
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,039
But nobody is responsible for

1465
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:31,807
The pain of

1466
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,647
You very clearly when talking to that

1467
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:38,463
January 13th 2015

1468
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,231
Set that

1469
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:40,255
He doesn't

1470
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:43,071
If there was all actors it was a sympathetic effect

1471
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:44,607
You couldn't believe it at first

1472
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,375
But then he

1473
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,399
Prove it

1474
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,167
Do himself

1475
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:49,983
So clearly that is what he believed

1476
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,031
All this other stuff is window dressing

1477
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,847
And what store

1478
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:56,895
Nope it is Howard

1479
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,175
Is pure

1480
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:58,943
Hiding

1481
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,711
Yep

1482
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:04,063
Nope

1483
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:05,343
F*** you Alex

1484
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,879
F*** you Alex

1485
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:09,439
So it goes on from there

1486
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:12,511
After he says all this b******* about Sandy Hook

1487
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,047
I2

1488
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:17,631
Basically where are we at just goes on from here

1489
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,399
To play

1490
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:23,519
Which is unfortunate

1491
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:31,199
People out there that have never

1492
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,991
The show

1493
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:41,183
Completely

1494
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,279
Same time

1495
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,863
Are you crazy

1496
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,911
No it's called a skid

1497
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:53,983
High School level 1,000 devil

1498
01:15:55,519 --> 01:16:01,663
People

1499
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:08,063
Illustrating how it's bad by playing the part of statement does not

1500
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,415
Alex

1501
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:17,279
LinkedIn LinkedIn

1502
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,583
That is a a

1503
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,119
Dumb person that's a

1504
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,399
God

1505
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:28,287
Are you really the devil are you really I don't understand, how could

1506
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:36,735
Alex is not engaging with the truth even in that state

1507
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,319
That this

1508
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:42,623
Remember

1509
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:46,719
He was being sincere when he dressed up like the devil

1510
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,743
Right

1511
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,511
Say everyone

1512
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,167
They worked at in Fort Worth

1513
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:55,935
So I rule

1514
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:56,959
Nothing

1515
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:00,287
Anything is Possible

1516
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,311
In that

1517
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,103
That is

1518
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:07,455
Come on you're so stupid

1519
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:10,271
I will also not rule out

1520
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:15,135
Play Sublime he makes up plenty of people who say things

1521
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:18,719
To him all the time

1522
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:26,399
Both Richard linklater movies

1523
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,935
Advisor

1524

That with no that wasn't Scanner Darkly

1525
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:32,031
Oh okay I'm sorry

1526
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:37,919
Advise on the movie The Discovery movie

1527
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:42,015
Boys Waking Life was the first one of the rotoscoping

1528
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:44,319
What's my favorite movie

1529
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:49,439
A bunch of stuff throughout this about Alex

1530
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:54,047
Really still hammering home that he thinks that everyone is just talking about her

1531
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,583
Escape

1532
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:58,143
Another one

1533
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:04,543
Little different isn't a

1534
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:08,383
That one I do genuinely think

1535
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:12,735
I agree he's very confused understand

1536
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:18,111
What the people who are attacking him are up to

1537
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:20,927
Here is Miss next clip he's going to

1538
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,231
Explain what he thinks the world is doing

1539
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:23,999
To him

1540
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,023
And it's fascinating

1541
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:27,839
Cuz I cut out two parts in this episode already

1542
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:28,863
Works

1543
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,887
I'm not a victim

1544
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:33,727
This is Vic

1545
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:37,823
No one showing

1546
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:40,895
The Journal of Medicine and WebMD

1547
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,711
But

1548
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:52,415
Massive massive

1549
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,695
And then people get Warren

1550
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:02,399
45/56

1551
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:07,775
7

1552
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:14,431
Blown up

1553
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,199
You are crazy

1554
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:23,903
Advertisers let's list

1555
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,439
You don't have any

1556
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:37,727
Know your channel every major News Channel

1557
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,799
Talk to your lawyer

1558
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:46,431
Berea

1559
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,967
Really scary stuff

1560
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:50,271
I say this man is psychotic

1561
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:51,551
So he thinks

1562
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:53,855
That being serious.

1563
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,135
You say Alex

1564
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:57,695
Comes when you are not wearing a clown

1565
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:02,815
Not at all cabal of Elites

1566
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:03,583
Globalist

1567
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,119
They're getting together

1568
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:07,935
To try and take him down because it's becoming too influential

1569
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,287
Could we use his words

1570
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:18,688
Literally a whippersnapper

1571
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,808
I'm not done sketches

1572
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,344
So we're going to say that he's fake

1573
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,440
I mean we don't have to do that for us

1574
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,208
Okay

1575
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,000
Another thing

1576
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,304
He's gotten really angry on Arrow bunch of times

1577
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,840
Let's

1578
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:41,728
Manipulative

1579
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,008
Let's not

1580
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:48,640
Presentations of Alex is a little bit

1581
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:54,272
Rocky training

1582
01:20:56,064 --> 01:21:01,184
People who are making memes who are pretty good at it

1583
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,208
But like

1584
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:05,792
But he doesn't understand humor

1585
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:12,192
Now cuz I don't understand why you

1586
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:12,960
I don't

1587
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:14,496
Watch any TV news

1588
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:18,080
Noodle top box

1589
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:24,736
Other than like better than going at it

1590
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:27,808
Cuz they're implying that the actual

1591
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:30,880
Has a clip of him

1592
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:32,160
Being crazy

1593
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:38,816
I I don't I don't know I can't speak

1594
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,864
Cuz I I don't have like

1595
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,656
I don't have Google alerts for Alex

1596
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,424
Right

1597
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:47,008
I don't watch a ton of

1598
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:50,848
Stevie really don't have

1599
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:54,176
I can awareness of that world very much because

1600
01:21:54,432 --> 01:22:00,576
Much like Alex tell people to don't trust me I don't put a ton of that into my brain I look for

1601
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:02,112
Sources and I have

1602
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:05,184
Some aggregators that I trust and I speak out

1603
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,720
Usually in the written form

1604
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:11,840
Yeah that's mostly where I'm at I don't know I will say I don't believe

1605
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,888
Legitimate news news

1606
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:14,656
Delivered

1607
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:19,520
Rick news not delivered

1608
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:21,824
All of them

1609
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,712
Sonora Leon McAdoo

1610
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:30,272
Definitely not

1611
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,832
Bigamist

1612
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:35,648
I'm not guys don't take that out of contact

1613
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,464
I do think

1614
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:43,072
Places like the Washington Post

1615
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,888
Have had articles

1616
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:47,680
The fact that is lawyer

1617
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:51,776
Is that the diesel performance arts

1618
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:54,848
A response to that memes of him

1619
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:55,616
Dressed up as

1620
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:56,640
The Joker and stuff

1621
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:59,712
But it's people saying

1622
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,576
It's so stupid

1623
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,112
Explain

1624
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:06,880
Tiana mean

1625
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,416
It cuz it's

1626
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:09,952
It's something

1627
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,976
So stupid

1628
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:13,792
Hit you and your brain just kind of shuts off cuz like

1629
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:17,632
Nah she's a character performance artist

1630
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,400
Defense in

1631
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:20,448
In terms of dressing up in a lizard mask

1632
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:22,752
And all that stuff isn't necessary

1633
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,824
Stop him from his children

1634
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:26,592
The defense

1635
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:28,384
View the character is needed

1636
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,432
For the violent Outburst that he has

1637
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:32,992
That's where he needs that depends

1638
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:35,808
The comedy sketches that are funny

1639
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,088
Those

1640
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,952
He does not need excuse for making those any right-thinking person gets what he's doing

1641
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,256
I don't even want talk

1642
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:50,912
Any more episodes

1643
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,728
About

1644
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,776
Him him talking to his dad

1645
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,312
Does dads like

1646
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,016
What do I say

1647
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,808
He thinks gay people give off

1648
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,600
What do you argue about

1649
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:12,672
Days are Caliente

1650
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,696
BNA

1651
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:20,096
This argument is so dumb that my my brain just does

1652
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:27,264
We will not be dealing with

1653
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,800
Will be continuing

1654
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:32,384
But we will not be feeling anymore with him and his weird

1655
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,176
Performance art

1656
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,480
Is a performance artist

1657
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:38,016
Even if he doesn't

1658
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,320
Even if he does

1659
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,160
All propaganda

1660
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:48,512
It's

1661
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:54,912
I don't want to tip my hand through hard Alex Doug quote Shakespeare.

1662
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:59,008
As long as

1663
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,640
But he doesn't understand that

1664
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:07,200
Everybody plagiarize the New Yorker

1665
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:10,528
Plagiarized

1666
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:12,064
Also

1667
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:12,832
I mean

1668
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,624
We don't have time to get into it but

1669
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,416
Shakespeare might not have been a person

1670
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:18,464
It might have been a persona

1671
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:20,768
Performance artist

1672
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:22,560
In some ways

1673
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:24,352
I will say I think

1674
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:26,656
Christopher Marlowe

1675
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:28,192
It is

1676
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:28,960
He is a guy

1677
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,264
And got a weird old head

1678
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,592
Next

1679
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:36,640
Back to Sandy Hook for a couple clips

1680
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,944
Ostensibly

1681
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,712
But

1682
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,480
They guess it's not

1683
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:41,760
This is

1684
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:46,112
Alex claiming that the mainstream media lies about his position

1685
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:49,952
He is enough himself why

1686
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:51,232
He does not believe it

1687
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:54,816
He doesn't believe that

1688
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:58,656
Right there on two layers of Alex Jones

1689
01:25:58,912 --> 01:25:59,680
Does not believe

1690
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:02,240
Beef Wellington of Lies

1691
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,408
That I believe.

1692
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:15,040
He goes and harasses family

1693
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:17,344
He sues families

1694
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,608
I believe kids died

1695
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:30,656
That I said I see Devil's Advocate

1696
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:34,752
Call Solomon

1697
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:40,384
Because the media has been caught

1698
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:43,200
Knowing

1699
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:46,784
You can go watch the full deal

1700
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,088
You just played it

1701
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,112
Display the Daleks

1702
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,904
You're not good at this

1703
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:55,488
That's crazy

1704
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:03,168
What he saying there is so stupid

1705
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:08,288
Something like that I have no idea

1706
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,312
I don't care

1707
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:14,688
But the idea

1708
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:17,248
I don't never heard anyone play me super family

1709
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:20,320
Say that I do know

1710
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:22,112
Big lizards

1711
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,672
Absolutely

1712
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:26,464
Have absolute

1713
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:30,304
Their life

1714
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:33,632
They put them threw up fresh

1715
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:34,912
F****** hell

1716
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:39,776
Every goddamn this is an instance where he's responsible for the

1717
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:45,408
But I can't really control what your listeners due to some extent you know like

1718
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:51,296
Fully responsible for their actions isn't fully responsible for every pocket

1719
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,856
Filled with Catcher in the Rye in the sea

1720
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:57,184
Espouse

1721
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,256
What position is Alex clearly

1722
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:02,048
There was a fake operation

1723
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:05,120
Big conclusion that you can take from okay

1724
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:07,168
If it is fake and no one died

1725
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,520
Pretending

1726
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:16,384
To keep

1727
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,176
Alex is

1728
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:20,480
Complicit

1729
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:22,272
A hundred percent responsible

1730
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:25,600
For the actions of his listeners

1731
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,392
Dickhole pundits with ladies Oregon

1732
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:34,048
Like you're you're saying that you never sued them and you've never been to Newtown

1733
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,328
Doesn't mean anything

1734
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:36,608
F***

1735
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,680
You I've never been to New Town so

1736
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:40,704
I'm off the hook

1737
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:44,800
Guess what we got another lie about Sandy Hook coming up

1738
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:47,616
Investigated all I'm saying is

1739
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:49,152
You should have

1740
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:52,480
Most fake shooting

1741
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,784
We know that sat before they've been taught before

1742
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:57,088
False Flags household

1743
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:06,048
I'm not saying real kids didn't die because a majority of people online

1744
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:12,448
So much

1745
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:17,824
So that means a whole new

1746
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:21,920
That's a whole new version of a Sandy Hook lie about his position

1747
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:25,248
He was saying earlier that he doesn't know he can't figure it out

1748
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:30,624
Now in this clip you think I'm inclined to believe that there was a patsy that got killed there was a shooting

1749
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,392
Fake

1750
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:32,928
Mass shooting

1751
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:34,464
What

1752
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:38,304
2 years ago

1753
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,096
Complete actor based operation

1754
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:43,680
And no real new information has come out in those two years

1755
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:44,704
Can you

1756
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:45,472
Point me to

1757
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:47,008
Mass shooting

1758
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:49,824
I can't but I mean Alex could show you plenty

1759
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:56,480
There's no way there's a fake mass shooting based on what he thinks but I

1760
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:57,504
I don't I don't I can't

1761
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,040
I don't know

1762
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:06,464
Again again golden moment Boston bombing

1763
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,256
Now there you're just

1764
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:10,048
Putting the seed of doubt in

1765
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,584
Philippe over

1766
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,352
Anything's

1767
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:13,632
Any

1768
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:14,656
Possible Circle

1769
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:17,216
Absolutely

1770
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:19,776
That's insane

1771
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:22,336
Because

1772
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:23,360
The

1773
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,384
Man goes like this

1774
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,432
The globalist

1775
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:28,224
So doing this basically to push

1776
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:28,992
Control

1777
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:32,576
The large

1778
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:38,976
One of the big narrative

1779
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,816
To turn people against

1780
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,352
It didn't work

1781
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:46,400
I guess

1782
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:47,680
Yeah

1783
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:53,056
Volume

1784
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:56,384
Well you're blaming the globalist you're actually doing is

1785
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,152
Repeat it

1786
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:59,968
Warmed-over and dress-up anti-semitism

1787
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,272
So what you doing is

1788
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,040
Brothers.

1789
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:08,928
Clear slime to draw but trust me that is what's going on

1790
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,208
Subconsciously

1791
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:12,768
It is all going back to

1792
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:13,792
This idea

1793
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:15,328
Of a global cabal

1794
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,352
Bankers

1795
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:17,632
Jewish Elite

1796
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:18,400
Who are

1797
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:20,448
Controlling our destiny

1798
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:21,728
So

1799
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:22,752
Weird

1800
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:24,800
Bandwagon anti-semitism

1801
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:26,080
It's thrilling

1802
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:35,552
Like how long

1803
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:36,576
Hate the Jews

1804
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:38,880
I don't know man

1805
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:45,280
It's been a long time

1806
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,192
Anyway

1807
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,728
That whole thing

1808
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,824
How many years are we going to do this

1809
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:59,104
I don't know probably

1810
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:03,712
22 everybody in the Middle East

1811
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,696
Hey

1812
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:15,232
Exterior

1813
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:19,840
Alex

1814
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:23,424
Was really trying to make the point that

1815
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,448
He's not a victim

1816
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:25,216
Although he is

1817
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:26,496
Perpetrating

1818
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:28,800
Incredible victory

1819
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:31,872
Evans next FlipKey

1820
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:34,688
Explains the D is

1821
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:35,456
Thunder

1822
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,480
Massive Attack

1823
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:38,528
You might as well be tricky

1824
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:46,208
Very nice thank you alright makeup for my love Lana Del Rey

1825
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:49,280
Radiation is real

1826
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,912
That is what's going on right now

1827
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:55,936
I'm out

1828
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:59,264
I don't know no preferences

1829
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,824
I do know about tricky

1830
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:08,224
Alright I'm sorry explained that he's under attack and it's all about

1831
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:08,992
His character

1832
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:11,296
Fictional character think

1833
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,576
It's about his integrity

1834
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:18,720
Understand that there is a hit

1835
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:25,888
A strong man that is not me

1836
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:29,984
There's an imposter

1837
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,520
What's happening

1838
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:33,568
And what's going on

1839
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:36,128
And I think you're incredibly stupid

1840
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:41,760
You think your audience is

1841
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:44,064
I'm stupid

1842
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,088
It's

1843
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,136
It's crazy

1844
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:48,672
It's just crazy

1845
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:54,048
Like

1846
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,072
You are protect

1847
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:56,096
Goodbye a strawman

1848
01:33:56,352 --> 01:34:02,496
People are creating is a better person than you

1849
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:06,080
Is fake is a better person than the Alex that we're looking at right now

1850
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,360
That person at least has come

1851
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:08,128
Consistency

1852
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:09,152
Isn't a coward

1853
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:12,224
Still work or at the very least

1854
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,528
Is only wrong about one thing.

1855
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:18,880
Unwanted

1856
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:19,648
A f******

1857
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:20,928
Absolute

1858
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:22,464
But like

1859
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:27,328
I'd like

1860
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:29,120
What would I keep

1861
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,400
Occurring in his voice is

1862
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:31,424
Is pure nihilism

1863
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:36,544
Like Dykes his is the destruction of

1864
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,312
Everything

1865
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:38,848
Like

1866
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:42,176
That quote B

1867
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:42,944
Steve Bannon

1868
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:43,968
About

1869
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:45,504
You know like

1870
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,808
Destroying destroying the government

1871
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:48,576
Entirely

1872
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,344
Yay

1873
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:52,160
Me listening to all of his stuff

1874
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:54,208
It's almost like his main goal is to

1875
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:54,976
Destroy

1876
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:56,512
Any and all objects

1877
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:59,328
Liked except the second

1878
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,400
That's all we need

1879
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:06,240
The Second Amendment

1880
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:11,360
Obama had gone into your homes and taking your guns

1881
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,384
I just want

1882
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,944
If you want to live in the world of amerigeddon

1883
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:15,968
Sure

1884
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,248
I'm fine with it

1885
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,528
Let's Groove

1886
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,576
What's your favorite Rye

1887
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:23,392
See if it's possibly better

1888
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:25,952
As much

1889
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:31,072
As much as people like to like Alex Jones want to say 37

1890
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,352
1976 all over again

1891
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,192
Those

1892
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:37,216
Are often

1893
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:38,240
The same power

1894
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:41,056
Yeah living in that

1895
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:42,592
SeaWorld

1896
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:44,640
Believing themselves to

1897
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,176
To be that when push comes to shove

1898
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:47,456
I'm really going to do it

1899
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:48,480
I'm really going to do that

1900
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:52,064
Dude

1901
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,344
Look

1902
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:55,904
I'm a manic depressed

1903
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:05,120
Okay if anybody like you got me on this one like you and I are too far as like

1904
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:05,888
We don't

1905
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,704
Necessarily disagree if you murder me

1906
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,520
There's a part of me that's on your side good point

1907
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:12,544
Exactly

1908
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:18,432
Free speech

1909
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:20,992
We wouldn't

1910
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:23,552
Maybe kill ourselves

1911
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:28,160
Absolutely all the all the visions of like zombie apocalypse like

1912
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:30,464
Oh man I would be the guy running that game

1913
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:35,584
F*** that if I could become a Hermit in the woods

1914
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,352
I'll do that

1915
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:40,448
Yeah but if not I'm out I don't want to fight contact

1916
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:43,264
If your meds

1917
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:49,664
Although maybe then I would be the leader of a roving band of cannibals possibility

1918
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:52,736
We have to we have to

1919
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:55,040
Deal with Alex having a little bit of a break

1920
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:56,832
I got a little bit of a mental break

1921
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:02,976
For the rest

1922
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:04,256
Episode

1923
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:06,048
How much more

1924
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,072
We have

1925
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:08,096
Five more clips

1926
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:10,400
Five more clips

1927
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:11,680
And

1928
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:12,960
It's all a tree

1929
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:14,240
Treatise on

1930
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:16,544
The degradation of society

1931
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:20,384
Great notnice first clip

1932
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:23,200
What he believes is going on

1933
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:25,248
Without we don't have the rights

1934
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,528
Sioux passage anymore

1935
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:29,344
Ditto

1936
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:32,416
We can talk all day about that if you want

1937
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,952
Let's all I'm saying is

1938
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:36,000
Go back to a tribal Society

1939
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:37,024
We're Men

1940
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:37,792
Have

1941
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:39,072
At the age of 13

1942
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,608
Some sort of writer pass

1943
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:42,656
Then we're good

1944
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:46,496
Dude you going to say

1945
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:51,360
You say that's a dumb thing to say we need to say this but it would be great if you'd like

1946
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,200
Lay you down and make you

1947
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:58,528
Take me to cut from 109

1948
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:01,344
Put your hand to a nest

1949
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:07,232
Quit making your apps

1950
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:09,792
Get rid of one hand with bullet ants

1951
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:12,608
Well

1952
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:16,448
Except you love where he doesn't go

1953
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:21,312
But first you look like the right to Spring I'm assuming that he does the

1954
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:28,480
You know you shouldn't make predictable it's sweeping string sections

1955
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:31,296
More simple than you think it's so stupid

1956
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,064
You get to judge

1957
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,344
Just that swell

1958
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,904
The the violin

1959
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:36,928
Violas

1960
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,464
Let's go back to travel

1961
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,232
Society

1962
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,560
But you're talkin about the Arts

1963
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:46,144
That's one thing but Alex I think is a little bit more worried about

1964
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,424
Stem education

1965
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,960
Has he complained about here

1966
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:55,360
I need to go back to being human are calculators

1967
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:00,480
I know how to do a lot of math

1968
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:11,488
Calculator

1969
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:13,280
Even though I haven't

1970
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:15,584
Charge to mass in years formally

1971
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:20,960
I could still do geography geometry

1972
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:28,128
Text Spencer

1973
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,664
Actually I can't do that

1974
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:31,712
6 / 7

1975
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:35,552
Is that bad. I don't know what the

1976
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:36,576
12 point

1977
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:37,856
Point or something

1978
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:39,136
12.2

1979
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,416
Some long those lines

1980
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,208
I don't matter

1981
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:47,328
When I was in school we had calculator

1982
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:50,400
So one day we were talking about the Pythagorean theorem

1983
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:52,704
Quadratic equation

1984
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:00,384
Oh I thought that was

1985
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:03,456
The quadratic is like - 4

1986
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:05,248
B plus or minus

1987
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:07,296
The square root of

1988
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:08,320
No I don't remember

1989
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:11,648
I don't remember it now but I actually proved

1990
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:18,816
Each of those equations work breaking it down variable by variable

1991
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:20,096
I had calculators

1992
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:22,144
But I still did it cuz I was interested

1993
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:28,032
There's a cop. Not even like an in-depth math guy they're people who like

1994
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:29,056
Video x

1995
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:30,336
Explanations of how

1996
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:32,896
Pythagoras didn't think of that theorem the Wade

1997
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:34,688
Like a building block

1998
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:36,736
Geometry

1999
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:40,064
He thought of it

2000
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,344
Yes that's the weather

2001
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,160
And so there's this really amazing confluence

2002
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:46,464
How you see the world with

2003
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,744
And how you find out

2004
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:49,280
All of these different equation

2005
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:50,048
Since back before you

2006
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,888
Like you didn't get the

2007
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:57,216
Look at how all of these squares fit together

2008
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:03,616
I swear and then you keep tearing that apart and tearing that apart

2009
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:04,896
And then you believe in God

2010
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:10,016
Traces directly to like the

2011
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:12,832
Golden ratio in the spiral of life

2012
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:15,648
Comes out of

2013
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:22,048
Pythagoras a rap group called The Lost Children

2014
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:25,888
Milan

2015
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:27,680
Fuckingawesome

2016
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:30,240
It's a rap song about math

2017
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:33,312
F****** great these dudes are so cool

2018
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:36,640
I don't I don't support everything they're into but they're cool

2019
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:38,688
Anyway

2020
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:40,224
This Mexico

2021
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:41,760
Alex

2022
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:42,784
Is going

2023
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:44,576
To really freak out

2024
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:48,416
Because he remembered that one of his big points he likes to try and make is a

2025
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,696
But no one has a memory

2026
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:52,000
And that everything in the world is super important

2027
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:54,560
The only thing that is super important

2028
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:55,584
When you're going through life

2029
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,864
Is having a memory

2030
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:57,888
That seems like

2031
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,168
Might be right

2032
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:01,216
Considering the fact that he

2033
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:02,496
He doesn't remember this

2034
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,544
Exactly an

2035
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,568
In this clip

2036
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:12,224
He has forgotten something explaining I'll explain after

2037
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:17,856
Please I enjoy listening to this

2038
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:18,880
Really salient

2039
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:22,720
Remembering

2040
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:28,864
If you

2041
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:32,960
There's information there's knowledge

2042
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,568
You're five years old

2043
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,432
You can interface the internet

2044
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:50,368
You can speak you can do basic things but you don't know from life experience

2045
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:56,000
For the memory

2046
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:58,304
You know you forgot

2047
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,840
That there's four ways to learn

2048
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:04,192
He forgot that he's claimed that he was reading college-level books at age 6

2049
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:10,848
What do you do at age 5

2050
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,152
But he's saying that

2051
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:18,784
You don't know how to trust information

2052
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:21,088
You don't either

2053
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:26,976
You dumb piece of s***, dumbass whole you stupid son of a b****

2054
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:32,608
You judge yourself I don't even need to knock on the door you just busted your dumbass self

2055
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:36,704
Hold on what's great you ask me in the middle of that clip is there a graph

2056
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,008
And I'll post a screenshot of this cuz it's

2057
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:42,592
F****** hilarious has taken a piece of paper

2058
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:46,432
One of his Infowars

2059
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:48,224
And he is flipped it over

2060
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,272
And he is drawing a stick figure on it

2061
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:51,296
That says 5

2062
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:53,344
Lemon there is

2063
01:43:58,464 --> 01:43:58,976
Stick figure

2064
01:43:59,232 --> 01:43:59,744
5

2065
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,792
Deidre

2066
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,120
Bright

2067
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:09,472
Goes up and then another stick figure

2068
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:12,800
That's the grass

2069
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,872
He successfully graft

2070
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,152
Beijing

2071
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:18,688
You should use a Texas

2072
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:21,504
Instrument graphing calculator

2073
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:23,552
Just put

2074
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:26,368
5 years old and 75 years old into a text

2075
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:35,840
Pornography on there has ever called

2076
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:38,144
My friends

2077
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:44,544
Calculator

2078
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:50,944
Alex it's not a graph

2079
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,480
You're making a dumb point

2080
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:54,784
It is one of the most

2081
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:56,320
Truism

2082
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:57,600
When you're young

2083
01:44:57,856 --> 01:45:02,464
Can't really understand how to use information because you don't have the experience and maturity

2084
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:04,256
The comes with being older

2085
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:09,632
Also

2086
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:10,656
Because

2087
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:12,960
Idea of

2088
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:14,752
Let's just say

2089
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:17,312
If you are going to go by

2090
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:19,616
Who is evaluating a

2091
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:23,968
Do you think old people are

2092
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:24,736
Your top

2093
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:26,528
75 year old

2094
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:30,112
No no no it's probably somewhere in the middle of adulthood

2095
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:35,232
Probably late 20s early 30s

2096
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:41,632
Probably move 144th

2097
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,936
Variance equaling wisdom

2098
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:44,704
Ace Parking

2099
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:48,800
Stupid to ever talk to somebody

2100
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:51,872
Don't tell me about the sixties or whatever

2101
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:52,640
Because I lived

2102
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:55,968
I would like listen you don't know what's going on

2103
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:56,992
Right now

2104
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:59,552
Don't tell me you knew what was going on then

2105
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,320
When you are a f******

2106
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:02,368
Experience

2107
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:03,648
Informing

2108
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,048
True

2109
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:11,072
Is true there's exceptions

2110
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:13,632
It's only true to a point

2111
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:16,704
I agree and disagree with

2112
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:19,520
Disagree with Alex's stupid

2113
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:23,360
More more

2114
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,384
Entirely

2115
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:27,968
Fine 100% we can agree to disagree. That's totally fine

2116
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,248
Not in my world

2117
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:31,040
Let me write down a graph

2118
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:34,368
I'm drawing a small stick figure looks like

2119
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:36,416
Damn

2120
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:42,048
Screenshot this

2121
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:44,864
Oh no

2122
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:45,632
Vertical

2123
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,936
Oh my God no slope

2124
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:48,704
That Alex

2125
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:53,824
And then all the way down here is me giggling at me

2126
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:58,944
Would you like to draw another line to the side of a William Shakespeare over there

2127
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:05,344
Because it's time for the Shakespeare Library I do remember that

2128
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,648
Context in the corner of his paper

2129
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:09,184
He has drawn

2130
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,208
Basically

2131
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:11,232
Triangle

2132
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:13,536
Without a bottom

2133
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:15,328
Uptown

2134
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:17,376
Like a parabola

2135
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:23,264
Basically

2136
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:27,872
Alright be like two bases of the triangle and up at the top

2137
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:30,688
And he's making the argument that you are

2138
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:39,392
Like that weed we always will

2139
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:41,440
Trying to make the argument that

2140
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:43,232
When you're young and when you're old

2141
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:47,840
You're down like you're you you're not as smart and when you're in the middle of the your life.

2142
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:49,376
Your Peak Avenue bring Shake

2143
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:52,960
Mobility

2144
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:58,848
Experience life Revelations you hit a peak

2145
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:02,176
And then your brain cells begin to die

2146
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:05,760
Become a child again

2147
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:09,344
The child

2148
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:11,392
You're only wants the man

2149
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,416
Three Times a Lady

2150
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:17,536
Once Bitten Twice Shy

2151
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:21,632
Cool Alex cool cool cool cool

2152
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:25,984
I'd like

2153
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:27,776
He seems to know

2154
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:32,128
A lot more Shakespeare than I would have expected him to do but yeah but these are all like

2155
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,408
Generally

2156
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:34,432
I've known quotes

2157
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:41,856
Yeah but the definition

2158
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:43,648
I would argue that that is

2159
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:45,952
Sixty to seventy percent of the population

2160
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,232
Unaware of that

2161
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:48,256
If possible

2162
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:52,608
All the world's a stage even if

2163
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:53,888
Tampa Tribune

2164
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:54,656
Shakespeare

2165
01:48:55,168 --> 01:49:00,288
You you have a general idea of that like you heard that from somebody in a bar you and be like

2166
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:01,568
Holyshit

2167
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:05,152
Here's what I would say

2168
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:10,528
I don't think that Alex does any researching or is engaged

2169
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:11,296
With

2170
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:12,064
Substance

2171
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:12,832
Now

2172
01:49:13,344 --> 01:49:14,880
But I'm not saying that you haven't

2173
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:18,976
I believe you did do a lot of reading earlier

2174
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:22,304
Seems like it he's not an idiot

2175
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:26,912
He's a dumbass but he's not an idiot like you know something a lot of

2176
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:29,728
We need a glossary of our

2177
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:31,520
Particular definition of the

2178
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:35,872
Insults that we have thought that out

2179
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:37,920
Illiterate

2180
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:45,856
Incapable of reading isn't capable of

2181
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:46,880
Integrating Factor

2182
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:47,904
But you have learned

2183
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:49,184
Into a coherent system

2184
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,464
Lip reading facts

2185
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:55,072
Is what's

2186
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:58,144
The issue and it's easy to have quotes

2187
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:02,752
He knows he doesn't really know how to make them

2188
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:05,568
Threat anyway as the Bible said

2189
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:06,848
Even the devil

2190
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:09,920
Scripture scripture

2191
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:12,736
Is this

2192
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:17,088
I know

2193
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,112
This Is the End

2194
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,160
My friend and

2195
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:24,000
I don't even know how to describe

2196
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:27,072
But he starts ranting about the Rites of Passage

2197
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:30,656
And then tell the story from his life that we're going to get into

2198
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:32,960
I don't even care

2199
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:34,496
Here we go

2200
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:40,896
But if you don't give yourself

2201
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:43,456
Text

2202
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:49,344
You're not involved you don't develop

2203
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,624
In your entire life

2204
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:52,416
Is a five-year-old

2205
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:01,376
At 13 years of age

2206
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:11,104
The shaman

2207
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:15,968
414

2208
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:19,296
You know what you go through testing into rituals

2209
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:22,624
411 libertad

2210
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:27,232
To see if you were an adult yet

2211
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:35,168
Leave somewhere else do something else go join alcohol and other

2212
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:48,480
The normal

2213
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:51,296
Intersex

2214
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:52,320
What the f***

2215
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:56,160
Is a ground work

2216
01:51:57,952 --> 01:51:58,464
It's a passage

2217
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:01,792
Isn't to be fair in some cultures

2218
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:03,072
He's not far off

2219
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:06,656
I mean

2220
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:10,496
4424

2221
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:12,032
Making an overgeneralization

2222
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:13,824
What he's done

2223
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:15,104
Is

2224
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:16,640
Explain what

2225
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:18,432
Entire world knows

2226
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:19,200
Tubi

2227
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:20,480
The historical right

2228
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:23,808
Yes

2229
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:24,576
Over

2230
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:27,648
Now

2231
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:29,440
I want to say

2232
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:33,536
I don't have time to attack

2233
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:37,120
If that's

2234
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:38,912
If that's where you're starting

2235
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:40,448
Fine now

2236
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:42,752
Let's see where he goes with it

2237
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:44,288
In this next clip

2238
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:48,896
I very rarely at a loss for words

2239
01:52:50,176 --> 01:52:50,688
So thrilled

2240
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:54,272
So thrilled I'm tickled

2241
01:52:54,528 --> 01:53:00,416
Thrilled correct please don't yell over this

2242
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:05,280
Is the new adult

2243
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:09,376
Is the peak

2244
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:14,496
In physical and mental overall Palace using knowledge

2245
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:16,544
To this level

2246
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:22,944
You're you are at your Peak

2247
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:33,952
Can most men I know

2248
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:38,304
360

2249
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:43,680
I want to get the approval

2250
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:55,968
Children

2251
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:02,368
So that's stupid

2252
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:03,648
They don't have

2253
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:05,696
Children

2254
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:06,464
Right

2255
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:14,912
No

2256
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:16,704
That's not what I was thrilled about

2257
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,728
Live It Up

2258
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:22,848
To point out like

2259
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:24,128
You're dumb

2260
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:26,432
You dumb. Dumb this is stupid

2261
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:27,456
Where is it what is

2262
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:32,064
What is the talkative mad piss people don't have kids when they're younger I guess

2263
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:34,624
Right

2264
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:35,904
50s world of light

2265
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,328
If you like your life or anything like that

2266
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:46,144
And you hated everybody in that timer

2267
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:50,752
It doesn't matter if having those kids would ruin your life and you don't want to have them

2268
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:52,544
You know you work

2269
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:53,312
Able to take

2270
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,872
Now he's going to get into

2271
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:56,640
Some really

2272
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:57,920
Really unfortunate

2273
01:54:58,432 --> 01:54:59,968
Uses of language in this neck

2274
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:02,272
Section

2275
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:03,296
Talking about people having

2276
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:04,320
This is not a good I

2277
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:07,648
Oh I mean it is what's on his mind

2278
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:09,184
I couldn't imagine

2279
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,488
Tell me any other circumstance

2280
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:12,512
Be involved in his life

2281
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:13,792
So

01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:17,376
You going to play some more stuff

2283
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:19,424
About people failing to reach these rights

2284
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:20,704
The passage such as having

2285
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,496
The kid

2286
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:24,800
His own life

2287
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:26,336
It is

2288
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:30,944
One of the things he says

2289
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:35,296
We're going to have to stop and talk about for maybe half an hour

2290
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:38,112
Cuz it's straight up

2291
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:41,952
Straight up the best thing I've ever heard in my life

2292
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:48,864
Nope

2293
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:49,888
Definitely not

2294
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:52,960
College

2295
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:54,752
The priest

2296
01:55:56,544 --> 01:56:01,152
Do you got to make money

2297
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:12,672
I had to pause there just cuz that's so horror

2298
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:14,976
That's so fucken horrible

2299
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:19,072
So

2300
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:20,608
So what's this

2301
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:22,400
But why is he

2302
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:26,752
Any of this mean

2303
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:30,336
He's angry so this is about

2304
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:36,480
Video supposed to be

2305
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:42,880
Is this the new information

2306
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:46,464
Women in the forties Oparin

2307
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:53,632
That's how we know those kids were real

2308
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:55,680
Better argument

2309
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:56,960
This is

2310
01:56:57,984 --> 01:56:58,496
Wow

2311
01:56:59,008 --> 01:57:00,288
Wow

2312
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:01,312
6

2313
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:03,360
Seniors is whenever

2314
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:04,640
One that

2315
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:06,432
That presupposes

2316
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:07,200
Is the cultures

2317
01:57:07,456 --> 01:57:13,344
Not allowed to change ever or at all

2318
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:15,904
Hopefully

2319
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:18,976
Even beyond that

2320
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:24,352
And I want it I want to remind

2321
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:25,632
Everyone

2322
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:27,680
16

2323
01:57:28,192 --> 01:57:31,264
He says even by his own

2324
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,800
Recollection

2325
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:35,360
Something's wrong with him

2326
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:36,640
Perfect smile

2327
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:40,224
He's a great man

2328
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:44,064
Isn't sales all the time

2329
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,600
He just tells you the right things

2330
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:49,184
To do doesn't give himself a God damn

2331
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:50,208
So

2332
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:56,352
Different Virgo let the rest of this play I don't know.

2333
01:57:56,608 --> 01:58:02,752
This is where he transitioned sorry

2334
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:05,312
This is very transitions into his own wife

2335
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:08,640
And it's nice

2336
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:25,792
Then I just of a sixteen-year-old I was 16

2337
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:28,864
You want to party anymore

2338
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,448
I grew up

2339
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:38,848
The fight song

2340
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:47,296
Ben 10 fight with full grown man

2341
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:52,672
College years old

2342
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:54,720
F-16

2343
01:58:59,072 --> 01:58:59,840
I was a leader

2344
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:07,264
So he's going to say more about his history there but let's take a second he didn't have sex with 156

2345
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:12,128
43

2346
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:18,016
He's talked to the nmac 250 x

2347
01:59:19,296 --> 01:59:22,368
If you're a fifteen-year-old and you're having sex with college girls

2348
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:23,904
You're being statutory rape

2349
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:25,952
But be that as it may

2350
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:28,000
It's not that

2351
01:59:28,256 --> 01:59:31,072
His version of the Rites of Passage

2352
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:33,888
Complaining about the people are going through

2353
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:34,912
Being in fight

2354
01:59:36,704 --> 01:59:38,240
Yeah

2355
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:41,568
I f***** a lot when I was young

2356
01:59:41,824 --> 01:59:44,128
I don't understand what your what Your

2357
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:50,528
Definition of toxic masculinity this is the definition of ugly

2358
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:52,832
Female discus portable

2359
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:54,112
There are only two ways to

2360
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:57,952
Whether or not

2361
01:59:58,208 --> 02:00:01,024
Yeah absolutely a dick

2362
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:02,560
What a f****** dick

2363
02:00:02,816 --> 02:00:03,328
Outlook

2364
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:04,608
These kids now

2365
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:07,936
Not f****** everybody when they're 16

2366
02:00:08,192 --> 02:00:12,800
Because conservative

2367
02:00:13,056 --> 02:00:16,384
150 women if we apply

2368
02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:17,920
Ratio

2369
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:19,968
Describes

2370
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:20,736
His listenership

2371
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:21,760
Right

2372
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:22,784
So

2373
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:24,832
It's 45 million

2374
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:27,392
And we put it somewhere around 3

2375
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:31,744
223

2376
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:34,560
We apply that

2377
02:00:36,608 --> 02:00:39,680
So that would be roughly is that would be roughly

2378
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:41,472
Speaking in a week

2379
02:00:42,496 --> 02:00:43,264
Speaking in days

2380
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:47,872
Actually closer to like 1.4 million visits the website

2381
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:50,944
Please send me like 10 times higher

2382
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:53,504
No more than that.

2383
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:55,808
/ 40

2384
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:00,160
Round round

2385
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:04,256
That's a lot

2386
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:06,048
16

2387
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:08,096
Let's engage

2388
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:11,424
With the idea that it's 16 he's had

2389
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:13,728
Sex with 150 different women

2390
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:14,752
Conservatively

2391
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:21,664
So if you've you finish your thing and I got an idea

2392
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:28,064
Are you really excited cuz I got an idea generally reach sexual maturity

2393
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:28,832
Give or take

2394
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:33,696
To procreate according to the Roosevelt

2395
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:42,400
150 in 3 years

2396
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:43,680
It's fifty a year

2397
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:45,216
10-week

2398
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:49,824
He's having sex with a different woman every week for 3 years

2399
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:53,408
In the time when you in 15 your age

2400
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:55,200
Sophomore in high school

2401
02:01:55,456 --> 02:01:55,968
Right

2402
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:58,528
All through High School

2403
02:01:58,784 --> 02:02:01,856
He's banging a new lady every week

2404
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:02,880
In Austin

2405
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:03,904
Yeah

2406
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:05,184
Alright fair enough

2407
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:07,232
Cheerleaders

2408
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:08,256
Bad Girls

2409
02:02:08,512 --> 02:02:14,656
Crocker crocker doesn't matter really in the last couple episodes going on I like I talked

2410
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:19,264
That's gross

2411
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:20,544
You had a point

2412
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,312
Siri

2413
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:22,848
I like theories

2414
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:24,128
Fuct 100

2415
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:24,896
50 women

2416
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:25,920
In one night

2417
02:02:26,176 --> 02:02:27,968
In in

2418
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:32,320
So

2419
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:37,184
He spent a week in Japan

2420
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:43,328
There could be video

2421
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:45,632
I don't know baby.

2422
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:46,400
But

2423
02:02:49,472 --> 02:02:49,984
Sure

2424
02:02:50,752 --> 02:02:51,520
Wood

2425
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:52,800
Pulisic

2426
02:02:53,056 --> 02:02:54,336
His behaviors

2427
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:56,128
I think you'd be dead by now though

2428
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:59,456
30 years later

2429
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:03,040
Yeah I mean if it eroded his brain in

2430
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:07,648
A developmental phase it is possible that that part of the brain wouldn't grow back

2431
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:12,512
So I can't vouch for this part

2432
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:16,096
You gotta assume he wasn't wrapping it up

2433
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:17,120
With everybody

2434
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:19,680
You're young you're stupid

2435
02:03:21,984 --> 02:03:22,496
You know

2436
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:26,080
If Alex Jones is used a condom

2437
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:27,872
He did it under duress with a gun

2438
02:03:32,224 --> 02:03:32,992
He's like Hey listen

2439
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:36,320
I don't normally use a condom but I do respect the way you're

2440
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:41,440
So here is the rest of his about

2441
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,304
Why about

2442
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:50,912
It's absurd and it's irrelevant

2443
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:52,448
To the point he's trying to make

2444
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:53,216
No that's too

2445
02:03:53,472 --> 02:03:53,984
Pure

2446
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:57,056
Bullshittery bracket

2447
02:03:57,312 --> 02:04:03,456
It's yelling at each other

2448
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:07,296
In the clarity of us not yelling at each other

2449
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:10,880
Masculinity equals fighting and having sex with lots of women

2450
02:04:11,136 --> 02:04:14,464
Those are what make you there

2451
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:17,280
Part of the big problem with Arkansas

2452
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:18,304
Humanity

2453
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:24,704
We are also heard by Metallica

2454
02:04:25,472 --> 02:04:26,240
Human race

2455
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:27,264
Is hurt

2456
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:28,032
Bye

2457
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:29,312
The fact that we

2458
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:33,664
Like this is something

2459
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:34,944
That I do not

2460
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:35,968
Appreciate

2461
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:37,504
And he's not in

2462
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:39,808
But it is

2463
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:40,832
The fact that

2464
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:42,368
A lot of times we forget that

2465
02:04:42,624 --> 02:04:43,392
That we are

2466
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:45,440
Sure we're not

2467
02:04:45,696 --> 02:04:48,000
We're not some hyper evolved

2468
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:49,792
We're still f******

2469
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:56,704
We're still we're still beholden to our route

2470
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:59,776
Aspire for greatness

2471
02:05:00,032 --> 02:05:01,056
Do your physical work

2472
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:06,944
We should be all be able to detach ourselves from this

2473
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:10,272
The world of the world

2474
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:13,344
The world

2475
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:15,648
Alright

2476
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:18,720
I'd love it

2477
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:31,008
The rest of this clip.

2478
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:34,592
Cuz he had a radio show the local radio show in Austin

2479
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:38,944
Is Bragg

2480
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:42,272
21

2481
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:48,928
23 I would send it

2482
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:05,056
24

2483
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:07,104
I have a son

2484
02:06:07,616 --> 02:06:09,408
I got a big Empire

2485
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:11,712
I couldn't believe it

2486
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:12,736
If we can't believe it

2487
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:14,528
But also like

2488
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:18,368
Who's on who's like 12 who works

2489
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:19,392
Infowars

2490
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:21,440
There's got to be another older song

2491
02:06:22,208 --> 02:06:24,256
He might have more than four kids

2492
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:29,120
He might have more kids than he is even claimed the secret number of kids

2493
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:34,752
I don't know what's going on now

2494
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:39,616
He has paid for abortions in the past

2495
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:44,224
Maybe that was his long toddlers like

2496
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:47,808
24 I had a son

2497
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:58,304
Although the pain for multiple abortions just make sense if you're banging out 150 girls at 6 p.m.

2498
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:00,608
Big lot more girls than anybody would appreciate

2499
02:07:00,864 --> 02:07:07,008
But also like

2500
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:11,616
Maybe his dad

2501
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:12,384
Just practice

2502
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:16,224
Had to pay out a lot

2503
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:18,016
If it was during this.

2504
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:20,320
Were you saying he was massively sexually active

2505
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:26,208
Being sexually active

2506
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:29,536
No worry about it like a f******

2507
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:35,680
Mentality of

2508
02:07:38,496 --> 02:07:39,008
Belk Bowl

2509
02:07:39,264 --> 02:07:41,312
All over the place that's

2510
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:45,152
I didn't care about them

2511
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:46,944
Care about anybody but me

2512
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:48,480
I cared about

2513
02:07:48,992 --> 02:07:50,272
Even if it isn't like

2514
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:51,552
Just about the sex

2515
02:07:51,808 --> 02:07:53,856
Part of it even if it is about that being a writer

2516
02:07:54,112 --> 02:07:55,904
Do whatever it's still bad

2517
02:07:56,928 --> 02:08:00,256
If you're doing it that much

2518
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:01,536
The compulsion

2519
02:08:04,608 --> 02:08:05,120
I don't know if that's

2520
02:08:06,144 --> 02:08:06,656
Things I've heard

2521
02:08:06,912 --> 02:08:10,496
It's possible insulation not for our show

2522
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:15,104
I mean he just goes out gallon more about this

2523
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:17,408
I cut the rest of it and she goes out

2524
02:08:17,664 --> 02:08:19,968
Cuz he just yells more about how he's real

2525
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:22,784
Is that

2526
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:24,832
It does have a

2527
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:27,904
Looking back on my career like this

2528
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:29,696
This is your life kind of element of it

2529
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:33,792
The end of that is

2530
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:36,864
You know like Twilight

2531
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:41,472
And I'm not going to have a job in 6 months somebody please

2532
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:45,056
Does the feeling of like where did I go wrong

2533
02:08:45,312 --> 02:08:49,920
Right maybe everywhere but

2534
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:50,944
Has a feel of

2535
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:53,504
I think I did every

2536
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:58,368
Everything right well you know what I'll bring myself into a tiny bit

2537
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:04,000
That I can definitely relate to in terms of like

2538
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:05,280
Stuff I didn't stand up

2539
02:09:07,328 --> 02:09:09,632
I knew even when I had those feelings

2540
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:13,984
That they were Petty

2541
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:15,264
They were basing ego

2542
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:19,360
Absent these things like when I first started stand-up I created

2543
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:20,384
Successful show

2544
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:21,920
In Columbia Missouri

2545
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:24,224
Every week on Tuesday

2546
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:28,064
Scott hundreds and hundreds of dollars for the bar

2547
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:29,344
Do that sort of thing

2548
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:33,184
When I'm trying to make an argument for why don't more people care about what I do

2549
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:36,000
And that is just Petty

2550
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:38,304
I regret that I was caught up

2551
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:42,144
I knew even when I was making those arguments

2552
02:09:43,424 --> 02:09:48,032
I know I'm wrong to feel this way but I don't exactly know why

2553
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:52,128
It's insecurity

2554
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:56,992
It's a feeling of not being valued to the same level that you value what you do

2555
02:09:57,248 --> 02:09:59,296
Ran its natural but it is embarrassing

2556
02:09:59,552 --> 02:10:01,856
Out of someone who's a propaganda

2557
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:04,672
Who makes millions of dollars a year selling phones

2558
02:10:04,928 --> 02:10:09,280
It's super embarrassing also super embarrassing

2559
02:10:09,536 --> 02:10:10,816
Cumin the same episode

2560
02:10:11,072 --> 02:10:13,376
Where you're denying your own statements

2561
02:10:13,632 --> 02:10:19,776
About in order to demonize the media

2562
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:26,176
Like the thing I think about that that whole ego now

2563
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:28,736
Is especially when it comes

2564
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:29,504
2

2565
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:31,808
Is the arena that

2566
02:10:32,576 --> 02:10:34,624
Most familiar with Drew

2567
02:10:35,392 --> 02:10:35,904
Right

2568
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:39,744
There is a certain amount of that word egoism

2569
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,024
That Wilkie

2570
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:41,792
Keep you going

2571
02:10:42,304 --> 02:10:42,816
And

2572
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:46,144
You can't think you can't think you suck if you want to

2573
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:49,728
Right people to like you there is that

2574
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:50,752
You know

2575
02:10:51,008 --> 02:10:51,776
Narcissist

2576
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:52,544
Like

2577
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:53,568
Alex Jones

2578
02:10:53,824 --> 02:10:54,848
Regardless of whether or not

2579
02:10:55,104 --> 02:10:55,616
He's a

2580
02:10:55,872 --> 02:10:56,640
Pathological

2581
02:10:57,152 --> 02:10:58,176
Narcissist

2582
02:10:59,456 --> 02:11:01,248
Bagel one

2583
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:02,784
It is always about

2584
02:11:03,296 --> 02:11:04,832
Yeah

2585
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:05,856
Has served

2586
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:10,976
That's really that's really one of the traits that has served him well on his

2587
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:15,840
Assent to millions of dollars so there's a certain amount of that ego where you think

2588
02:11:17,632 --> 02:11:18,144
A

2589
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:19,424
This is a

2590
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:20,448
Cancerous

2591
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:23,264
Double edged sword

2592
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:27,872
Is what it is can be used to help you like there's a reason that

2593
02:11:28,128 --> 02:11:29,920
Whenever who was John

2594
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:30,944
Jon Ronson

2595
02:11:31,456 --> 02:11:32,224
And the psychopath test

2596
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:35,552
There's a reason that when you test

2597
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:40,928
Far more likely to be Psychopaths

2598
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:42,208
Talk about anybody else

2599
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:43,232
Your

2600
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:46,304
Probably going to be more willing to do all the s***

2601
02:11:47,072 --> 02:11:48,096
To get you into places

2602
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:52,960
Because you're taking such high risk

2603
02:11:53,216 --> 02:11:54,496
With your own reputation

2604
02:11:54,752 --> 02:11:58,336
What's wrong

2605
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:05,504
Again

2606
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:11,904
You might lose it all and I think that's why you my people

2607
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:15,488
Cannot reset in craps you were talking about

2608
02:12:15,744 --> 02:12:19,840
They came up in my mind is the idea of like a weapon that's productive

2609
02:12:20,352 --> 02:12:22,144
Will kill you there are a lot of parasites

2610
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:23,680
FedEx

2611
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:26,240
Wilshire General Tso parasites

2612
02:12:26,496 --> 02:12:30,080
You can have that are advantageous for a while and then they

2613
02:12:30,848 --> 02:12:31,360
End up hurting you

2614
02:12:33,664 --> 02:12:38,272
Futurama reality

2615
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:39,552
You can have

2616
02:12:39,808 --> 02:12:41,088
You can have a tapeworm

2617
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:43,648
And you'll end up losing weight

2618
02:12:43,904 --> 02:12:45,952
You lose

2619
02:12:47,232 --> 02:12:48,512
Listen to the things like that

2620
02:12:48,768 --> 02:12:49,280
This

2621
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:54,144
Narcissism and this unwillingness to deal with reality on realities term

2622
02:12:54,656 --> 02:12:55,680
Is a parasite

2623
02:12:55,936 --> 02:12:57,216
That's within Alex Jones

2624
02:12:57,472 --> 02:13:00,544
And not only that but he is absolutely enabled by

2625
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:07,200
Unfortunately the culture for him

2626
02:13:07,456 --> 02:13:08,736
But but that's

2627
02:13:08,992 --> 02:13:09,760
One of the things that he

2628
02:13:10,016 --> 02:13:10,784
He can ride that wave on

2629
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:11,552
Unfortunate

2630
02:13:12,064 --> 02:13:13,344
His toxic masculinity

2631
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:15,648
Does

2632
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:17,184
Engender people

2633
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:17,952
Supporting him

2634
02:13:18,208 --> 02:13:22,560
Yeah people who sort of identify with that is ultimately that

2635
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:27,168
He slept with 100

2636
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:27,936
50 women

2637
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:30,240
That's not going to hurt him

2638
02:13:30,496 --> 02:13:34,848
Listening hi-five themselves

2639
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:37,664
And well and I'm sure they like

2640
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:40,736
Mama exactly

2641
02:13:41,248 --> 02:13:43,040
Because that's that's a certain wish

2642
02:13:43,296 --> 02:13:44,064
Fulfillment fan

2643
02:13:44,576 --> 02:13:45,088
For those

2644
02:13:46,624 --> 02:13:47,648
