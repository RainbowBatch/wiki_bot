Hairstyles are not for me

00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
To try

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,536
Accidentally put it in one of the boxes

63
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,376
So it'll be a housewarming

64
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
For the new place

65
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,448

66
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,728
Stuffed

67
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,776

Our natural reaction

72
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
But another thing

73
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,648
Service brought is

74
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,672

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,328
Cherry flavor

78
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,192
It was described by Andrew as being a either you're going to love it or you're going to hate it

79
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,496
Equation

80
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,288
I'm going to love it you're going to hate it

81
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,568
That's my prediction

82
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,360
That is a very good predict

83
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,128
Alright

84
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176

The right.

95
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,663
I think it might be good another one of them I will hate myself

96
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,479
I don't think I can handle another

97
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,527
Vegas kratom

98
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,999

Entire time

106
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:10,015
A sound drop that we heard on the first episode it's good enough

107
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
Now

108
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,623
Someone who listens to our show

109
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647

00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871

Here on this episode

157
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,295
Because I have a little bit of a musical out of context drop

00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,471
What are the reasons

163
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
Stay in the present day

164
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,335
Stuff out as opposed to retreat

165
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
The past has

166
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
We are watched

167
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
To do from time to time

168
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,479
Is that someone in our Facebook group

169
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,087
May or may not have confessed to killing a dog

170
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
Yeah we always got to pay attention

171
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
Dog situation

172
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,983

5 years old

176
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,247

Can make your muscles

183
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,871
Fall apart to mess up your joints

184
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,175
Daddy couldn't get up

185
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
There's no surgeries for that

186
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
What's a catch-22

187
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
He went three more years

188
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,623

Don't get more than that cuz it could hurt him when the regular dose would work I give you more

193
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,215
Because I'm a call back

194
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
I made the decision

195
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:39,391
Supposed to give me supposedly and a doggie be operated a happy running around still have three more years

196
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:44,255
Summit explained that so I know y'all need to disagree if you wanted you could agree but

197
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,327
It's like this country ladies and gentlemen

198
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,375
Is a Labrador with hip dysplasia

199
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,543
You trying to empower the people

200
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,127
Tsheets

201
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,431
So another day

202
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,783
Conversation about a dead dog

203
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,767
Try to pretend that I don't understand

204
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,583
I'm only taking the time to discuss this clip 42re

205
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,631
The first is pretty obvious

206
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:26,495
That is compared to normal people Alex Jones brings up dead dogs

207
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,311
He Compares almost everything any situation

208
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,383
Do what that dog he uses memories of dead dogs in

209
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
Use for emotional outbursts

210
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
He on multiple occasions

211
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
This compared his enemies

212
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,271
The dogs that need to be put down

213
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,087
I'm not in any position to say with certainty

214
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,415
Absolutely have a preoccupation with

215
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
The death of dog

216
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:51,327
Based on what I've heard on the show if he talks like his psychologist would be negligent

217
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,863
If they didn't ask follow-up question

218
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Oh yeah

219
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:59,007
The second reason I bring this up is that I don't think the allegory

220
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
Conclusion

221
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,639
Any story you had an alien dog will everybody told him should be put down

222
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,455
But he was stubborn and didn't want to listen to their advice

223
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,015
He worked part-time in a farm setting

224
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,087
You sure that he knew better than all the doctors and veterinarian

225
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,415
In order to keep his dog alive broke the law

226
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439
Scammed medicine

227
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,719
From multiple Veterinary

228
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,303
To give to the dog which allowed the doctor survive three more years

229
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,583
At which point is

230
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
Still died

231
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:30,495
According to drugs.com Depo-Medrol is generally use a dog's quote

232
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,543
Associated with acute localized arthritic

233
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
Condition

234
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
And generalized arthritic

235
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,199
When a dog is being given Depo-Medrol they're generally

236
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
A great deal of pain

237
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,527
Drugs

238
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,831
Depo-Medrol is also used to help dogs with

239
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
Seasonal allergies but

240
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,463
The decision to put a dog down as always

241
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,279
Incredibly difficult to find it hard to criticize

242
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
Someone too harshly

243
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
Come down on either side of the

244
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,143
On what hand do to the animal you love is

245
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
In constant pain

246
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
Is really hard

247
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
The deal

248
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,263
But on the other hand it's really hard to fight

249
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
Canfield they can

250
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
Vicksburg

251
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
Pet can be blinding

252
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,431
And rationality can go out the window replaced by naive notion

253
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
So you can make things

254
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,015
Writing help your love won't help your loved ones stay around

255
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
Forever

256
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
The thing is

257
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,415
Alex's actions which would definitely illegal

258
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,695
To put off the inevitable

259
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,231
Which is that his dog died

260
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,791
This is why the allegory doesn't work

261
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,119
What he's describing is the very definition of exotic

262
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
He's liking it

263
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,471
Open up his dog on painkillers instead of putting

264
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,263
So what Trump is doing for America

265
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:40,639
Knows better than the metaphorical veterinarian

266
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,175
In order to keep things moving

267
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,479
But just like Alex's dog

268
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,783
This doesn't end in a miraculous cure

269
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
He's better for is

270
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
Structurally

271
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,719
Sweet Leaf

272
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:04,447
Have accidentally stumbled onto the real truth

273
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,007
Trump has created traffic illusion

274
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,079
You can pretend it isn't going to go away and then

275
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
The dog will just

276
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Look man

277
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,015
White people

278
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,807
We were going to be a minority soon

279
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,087
Let's just move on

280
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
That's just how it's going to go

281
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,159
What is the dog

282
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,023
Instead of giving your dog an opioid

283
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,559
Skip

284
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,119
Maybe this is where we first met

285
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:39,519
No

286
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
I could have been

287
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
I'm so

288
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,383
Are we start off on that

289
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,175
Just really salty allegory

290
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
Straight in

291
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
2

292
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,855
Anti Elon Omar

293
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Straight

294
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Bigotry

295
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
Evans first clip do we have

296
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Alex

297
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
He's just like

298
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,559
You could not be more blunt about what

299
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
Complaints about her

300
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:08,447
11

301
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
That she said

302
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,151
Venom

303
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,687
Because I hate

304
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,015
How they come and they talk about

305
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,575
Fuller brush

306
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,439
She's an Arab

307
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,095
Be more blunt than that

308
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,911
Really gross

309
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:50,431
Anaerobic

310
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,039
False

311
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,367
Booties with readout in order to make sure that you don't appear to

312
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
To just be

313
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,671
Responding

314
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,951
To that aspect

315
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,975
If it creates

316
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,767
False ideas about you

317
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,839
You better by tonight 11/8 America

318
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,447
Talks about

319
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
Supposed

320
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
Her family

321
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,615
This is how Rome use black

322
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,943
Until Arabs taught them

323
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,951
Europeans did not have black slaves

324
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
Until

325
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,607
And then it's the perfect thing to have someone

326
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:47,007
Scanning a lot of black people

327
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:53,151
Somalia

328
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,247
Rumors

329
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,063
They are the leaders

330
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,927
He's just responding

331
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,231
2 visual cues that he takes

332
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:13,119
And has determined about what he knows about her based on that which is the definition of

333
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,399
I don't know prejudice

334
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:19,519
Define the color of their skin that I took that has a

335
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:28,223
He said European countries he was specifically talking about Rome earlier in that that conversation

336
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,807
Rome large

337
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Have

338
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,623
Non-whites

339
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,927
Was because they took slaves

340
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,951
From Concord area

341
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,999
And Their Kingdoms

342
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,815
To Africa except for the

343
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
North

344
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,423
Most part of Africa

345
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
Did they didn't have it

346
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
Conclusively

347
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:54,847
White slaves yes absolutely

348
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
The slave trade

349
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,455
It's an irrelevant conversation

350
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,039
Because the answer is they

351
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:08,927
Write any of the Aborigines in Australia in play the Latin American people Dan

352
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
Right

353
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,975
I mean it

354
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:15,327
It's not that simple

355
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,167
Interesting position

356
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,215
The show on the nights

357
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,031
That is because we are not Trump rally

358
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
Where people

359
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,127
Kerbeck

360
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,407
Where to post rates

361
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:35,295
Alex's listeners apparently a responding that Trump is

362
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
He's backing off

363
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:42,207
Spelling about whenever he's come out and said I didn't like that chance

364
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
They think that he's being

365
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,047
Globalist

366
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
Or whatever

367
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:53,727
Send her back

368
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,263
Is that a lot of people

369
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,639
Are that mine

370
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,967
What did you think the lock her up

371
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,527
Type mentality was going to morph into

372
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,575
Like this is the obvious next stage

373
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:14,975
Only people are surprised New York Times And The Washington Post

374
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,911
But we all know that the real answer was

375
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,959
You wanted a chat send

376
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,031
That's what you really wanted are fun

377
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,151
The only real defense

378
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,431
People who want to

379
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,479
Pretend that they are not idiots

380
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Can have

381
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,831
Look the mob

382
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
Justin

383
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,647
Lauren Justice

384
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:50,047
They're not changing lockherup summarily they're saying give her a trial at lock her up it's

385
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:56,447
After

386
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:02,079
And that's the same thing with this Omar situation or not saying just deporter they're saying

387
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:08,479
Every trial and then deported that's what the intellectualizing Buckhead

388
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,271
Alex

389
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,295
Just trying to live in

390
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
Counterpoint

391
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
Shut the fuk

392
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
Sure

393
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,879
Fair enough

394
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:20,768
Trying to live in that space where there's the heir-presumptive

395
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,608
We're still trying to follow the law

396
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,936
Whitehouse.gov

397
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,896
And then deported really nice of him

398
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:42,272
Guilt to make sure she

399
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,576
I mean the guilt is really presume

400
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:48,416
I wanted a particularly disgusting is that if you

401
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,720
Listen to show your Clips like this

402
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,256
He understands

403
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,352
He actually wants and with actually motivating him

404
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,632
He's her being

405
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,216
Now the way he would prefer to kill her

406
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,544
To send her to a dangerous place

407
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,944
Gacha forced her to leave the United States go somewhere where he will be killed

408
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,272
Will settle go for going to multiple veterinarian

409
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,296
Injecting her with

410
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
Basically

411
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,648
I don't know either way

412
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
Square Biz

413
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,952
It's Helen

414
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,864
I just know that I'll send her back

415
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,472
Fraudulent

416
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
She won't last

417
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,336
A month over there

418
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,640
Because she's famous

419
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,992
It's on their head in her own

420
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,784
Russian somalis

421
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:54,720
We'll kidnap her so give her a week before she was kidnapped

422
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,256
Airport

423
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
Whatever

424
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,400
Squatted

425
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,264
Cheez-Its

426
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
Right

427
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,104
I mean if you are

428
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,896
You have made a vow

429
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,176
Very strong case

430
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,200
Even

431
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,504
If she is found guilty of

432
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,320
Immigration fraud she's a refugee

433
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,600
It should not be set back

434
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:26,720
Standards around the world

435
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
You cannot send people back

436
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,304
Two places where you have any reasonable

437
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,936
Awareness but they will be absolutely

438
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,704
We killing them

439
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,800
Ethically speaking what you are doing is you are

440
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,712
Want he's relishing in this idea of like

441
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:54,112
Yeah I will do what I do to a dog

442
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,184
I want

443
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:04,352
Well it's almost in the same way always looking for somebody to be the

444
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
Aggressor so they

445
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,448
Somebody the way that they want to right you know

446
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,776
They're trying to get her killed without

447
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,056
Terrorism

448
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,872
So they're trying to follow quote

449
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,432
Killer

450
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968
Let's

451
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,856
Did she murder somebody

452
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:33,280
Alien Omar

453
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,840
Did she get you run somebody over with a car

454
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,144
I'm not unaware of that

455
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,472
He just talked about how we should be

456
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,520
She's spoken Waze

457
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,848
Be very easily misinterpreted and lied about by the

458
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
Right wing

459
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,664
And particularly these right

460
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
Propaganda

461
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,016
Trigger finger for

462
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,296
People

463
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:59,904
2 don't like America the right way

464
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,440
Somebody to die for

465
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,608
Skip this next

466
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
It's just Alex

467
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,168
Omar came to America

468
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:11,936
At the cross hymn

469
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,472
And the people

470
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,520
Sure those that people

471
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,056
I need to be clear about this

472
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
He's all over the place

473
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,640
Incredibly

474
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,920
On this episode

475
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,248
This is one of them

476
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
Nothing

477
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,368
Anybody

478
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,648
Saying something like that

479
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
Deeply ashamed

480
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,512
Omar does not have

481
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,096
Penal parts

482
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,448
Mattamy

483
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,480
Intuit if you're not going to get into it cuz you realize oh f*** what am I

484
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,016
What am I talking about

485
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,552
Speculating about her

486
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
Genitals

487
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:05,952
Baby wild of course

488
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,792
Obviously

489
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,328
Right that's what he's trying

490
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
His listeners

491
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,728
If you think this is appropriate

492
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,800
If you think this is an okay okay way to carry yourself

493
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,128
Even if you hate every single thing that a lot Omar stands

494
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,432
For this is not okay

495
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:30,272
I just I can't I can't say enough that's

496
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,808
Credibly disqualified

497
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
Horrible

498
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,856
I can't imagine

499
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:37,440
You have to be really really f***** up person

500
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,232
Absolutely

501
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:43,072
But there might be a reason that Alex has really sucked up

502
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
Completely

503
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,120
Easy simple

504
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,728
I know that he's very affected by food

505
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,312
Like when he forgot his

506
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
Child

507
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,128
Teacher's name

508
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,968
Chile

509
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
That's not an isolated incident

510
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
Because it turns out

511
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,344
There is dietary issues

512
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:10,976
Maybe the reason that the Fourth of July sale is still going

513
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:19,424
Lunch yesterday and then I went and got one of my fast-food indulgences that I don't

514
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:24,800
Sounds like a deal but I got a big order attendees from Popeye's and I ate the whole thing

515
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,384
Just a few hours but I was in a coma

516
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,160
What's a on there

517
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,984
I love chicken tenders

518
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,384
Popeyes

519
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,480
I thought that might have been a regional thing

520
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
You can't do that

521
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,648
I think it would be a profoundly

522
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
Weird things

523
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,488
Looks like you know what episodes

524
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
Ivan

525
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:20,096
Generally will eat something unhealthy while I edit

526
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:26,496
Put the episode out weird if I texted you the next day

527
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,520
What's up

528
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
Chicken tendies

529
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:34,944
Really would cut it that really wouldn't cut it

530
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,784
Like a real shity week excuse

531
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,088
Alex

532
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,648
You know he's so affected by food

533
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,208
That maybe that explains

534
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
Like everything

535
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,536
Maybe his diet

536
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:58,240
I'm trying to I'm trying to thread a needle that I'm not interested in threading

537
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,776
Getting depressed

538
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,800
Clinic

539
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,592
Play so to the point where

540
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,872
Eating his food

541
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,432
I've been unable to do any work

542
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,552
Or possibly there's some side effect of denote

543
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
Well

544
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,880
In combination with all of his

545
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,160
Looking for worst product

546
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,952
Maybe they have created

547
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:22,304
Such a digestive

548
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,168
Destroyed by a food that normal people can digest easily

549
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,704
Little like some of those

550
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,472
Things that might

551
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:35,360
Like maybe it makes it so you can't

552
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,944
Maybe you should just get a regular cleanse

553
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,224
Maybe he's lacked

554
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,248
10 the intolerance

555
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,528
Alright alright

556
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,064
OxiClean

557
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,600
Hogan Road over Iraq

558
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,928
Sew-in t'god

559
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
Episode

560
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
Normal

561
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:56,352
I don't care as long periods of time talking about.

562
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,656
Exactly the same way he always does

563
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
But he

564
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,704
He makes this

565
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,496
Comment your about

566
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,520
Using the Lord

567
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,544
Zayn

568
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
But I find

569
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,104
Really interesting and

570
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,128
Pretty

571
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
I think it indicates

572
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,688
His relation

573
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,712
Kinship with religion

574
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:16,576
God fearing that I have a conscience I have a soul like a

575
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,856
Field.

576
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,880
University

577
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,744
Cheetah Hillary Clinton hell

578
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,048
I want

579
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,496
So what year is

580
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,288
Alex essentially saying

581
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,848
Like you're not supposed to take the lord's name in vain

582
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,408
Understanding

583
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,224
Good

584
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,296
I don't know if the standard by which

585
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,320
God

586
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,112
Set down his rules are like

587
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:57,536
Hedonism is the key to understanding the Pleasure Principle

588
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,328
Your Guiding Light tour

589
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,376
You know that I don't I don't know if

590
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
Is like a

591
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,664
I had a really bad headache and then I called the Pope the devil and I feel better now

592
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,760
To have like a

593
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,296
This weird

594
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,320
The Gorillaz

595
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,904
Relief valves whatever he says really f***** up religious

596
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,928
It's not

597
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,464
I don't think that that makes them

598
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,000
True or good

599
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,816
I think that says more about his psychology than

600
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,400
Maybe it explains why

601
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,680
You sucks it's wearing so much

602
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,472
Much like he can't eat

603
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,288
In the right context at all

604
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,896
Calling upon the strength of the Lord

605
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,432
To destroy his enemy

606
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,248
It isn't so good at it

607
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,112
I don't know if it works

608
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,392
No I'm pretty sure it works

609
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,768
Call Alex

610
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,584
Alaga Paladin

611
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,192
Going to get into that business with

612
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,472
Omar's genitals

613
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
And now he's about to

614
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:17,664
Does gets back into the theme of genital mutilation

615
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,480
I don't want to break down his thoughts about this

616
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,016
I only in playing this

617
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,064
This clip because of the sheer lunacy

618
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,880
How this goes

619
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,488
But

620
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,536
The part of the female anatomy

621
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,616
This is serious business okay

622
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:52,736
This is a family

623
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,040
That's why I kept

624
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:58,112
What are you doing

625
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,976

I think years ago they're stopping

639
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:53,408
So what are the things I love to do brings me the most Joy

640
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,688
Is hearing Alex

641
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,736
Tell stories I've heard him tell and

642
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,528
Whenever there is a

643
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
Repeat story

644
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:03,904
Tracing the little details that seem to shift based on how he wants

645
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,232
To use this is always something I really enjoy

646
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,512
Sweetheart of course

647
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,280
The classic

648
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,304

Alex tells the story again

657
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,696
Take note

658
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:42,304
See if you can point at this is like one of those things and Highlights magazine

Too pretty sizable

661
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:53,056
Ways in which the story is

662
00:34:54,336 --> 00:35:00,480
Mexico

663
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,856
After I left

664
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,928

Wobbling

671
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,392
A bunch of

672
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,256
African Muslim

673
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:48,864
Arab

674
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,856
Fleming

675
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,160
Urgent

676
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
Your girlfriend

And they're worshipping the Muslims

680
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
Wolf

681
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,064
Wow we know the term and we stopped using it because it's

682
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,184
Terrible thing to say does kind of rhyme

683
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,512
Yeah

684
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,048
Rock band

685
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:53,120
I'm just because it rhymes

686
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,448
It's funny how both words

687
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,728
Isn't that term our offense

688
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:05,664
Alone

689
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,944
Kind of

690
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,992
Kind of lame

691
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,672
Slightly differently

692
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
But

693
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,280
Leave the two major differences with see if you found

694
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,840
I'm going to go with African Muslim

695
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:30,240
Write that one's pretty big for typed into the story helps

696
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:36,640
His eye is a piece of the Omar story as a

697
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,920
Supposed to just being a

698
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:42,272
Generalized I don't like Muslims years how they behave kind of narrative

699
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,344
To understand if this is what he does

700
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,624
Absolutely

701
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,696
I'm going to go with

702
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,024
I don't remember them meeting Alex in the other

703
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,864
I don't remember Alex being in that other story

704
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,144
At all

705
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,680
Do they're all afraid of him

706
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:03,776
What's

707
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:09,408
So stupid understand

708
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,992
Include areas where and he can

709
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,576
Those little pizza

710
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:22,464
Looking to suck

711
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,536
Pretend Arab trade

712
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,840
Slave trader class

713
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
He's too powerful

714
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,984
So f****** stupid

715
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:39,104
This is ridiculous he's held every story he tells either has him

716
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,528
The source of all

717
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:52,416
Nobody is ever just unaware of who he is

718
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,720
Right you never blamed

719
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,560
He's pretty pissed

720
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,584
Let's

721
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:04,192
So if we get to the Alex talking about the house

722
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,728
This is part of a long

723
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,288
Deconstruction about the devil

724
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,104
Heard before

725
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,176
It's not worth it it's not worth our time to read

726
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,200
Go over this

727
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,760
However Alex doesn't do bring up something

728
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:22,368
There's a reason the people side with the Devil

729
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,648
Okay

730
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:27,488
Beer people generally side with the devil out of fear

731
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,536
You would think

732
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,352
In the Bible

733
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,168
You would think that but it's actually fear

734
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
Okay

735
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,520
Alex has a really good source on

736
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,616
Most people don't you stay

737
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,968
They choose it because they brush up against it may get scared

738
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,808
And the Devil comes around and says sure of me

739
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,088
I'll protect you

740
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,136
Give you power

741
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,488
I'll do that

742
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,304
What is Palpatine

743
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:08,960
You have a powerful enough to defeat Obi-Wan Kenobi

744
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,728
Yoda

745
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,776

00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:23,040
Well there can only be to say that any one point in time

749
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:23,808
The first thing that

750
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,088
Alright

751
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:34,048
Sports Authority the basis for his a religiosity in the original Star Wars movie

753
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,960
The most midichlorian

00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,520
This is

In the neighborhood

Alien Omar

Banana

762
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,416
I know it's offensive

763
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:03,488
I know it's offensive I really don't know

764
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,256
He was trying to

765
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
As far as an accent

766
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:12,960
He's talking about this licky brush up against

767
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,800
Great midichlorian

Discussing

771
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,176
What the Satanist

772
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,456
Told him what

773
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,992
He was younger

774
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,344
Was your dog

775
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,928
Oh my God

776
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,888
What should cut your dog's heart up

777
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,008
And it just goes from there

778
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,336
If you know that it goes from there that implies that

779
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,872
Cut your dog's heart out

780
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:55,967
Because how would you know where it goes from there if you didn't follow the first

781
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,527
Stop

782
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,575
Of course I don't believe any of this stuff

783
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,623
I think this is nonsense I think it's a

784
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:06,207
Absurd fantasy that you've come up with

785
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,743
Told him to kill his dog

786
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,791
But I don't

787
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
The amount

788
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,607
What time you spend talking about dogs

789
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,143
Killing of dogs

790
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:19,007
I don't believe there's not some sort of trauma that's based around motivating

791
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,055
This to be such a focal point

792
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,103
August conversation

793
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:28,735
It has to be some deep buried thing where it really feels

794
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,271
Like I don't

795
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,599
The Goldwater rule

796
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,623
But I

797
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,647
Would be

798
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,183
Surprised

799
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,719
There is

800
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:42,303
Incident in his past where someone did tell him to kill his dog

801
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,071
There has to be

802
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,887
Yeah for someone else killed his dog

803
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,423
He saw that

804
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,959
There's some sort of a

805
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,983
Resonant

806
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:50,751
Trauma

807
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,287
The ripple effect

808
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
Arcgis

809
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,407
There's still effective

810
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,759
Never ever ever talked about

811
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,039
As much as I have

812
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
In the past

813
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:04,831
Year-and-a-half

814
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,879
Yeah years of our podcast

815
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,647
It's

816
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,415
Sane

817
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,999
And it's not again I have to stress

818
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:12,767
It's not like

819
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,327
I'm just cherry-picking every single time we talked

820
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:21,471
About that dogs do a lot

821
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,543
Even if this was

822
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,103
Every time that he's talked about dead dogs

823
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,663
That is 10 million times more than I've ever

824
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,711
I promise you there are

825
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,735
Yeah I believe it

826
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,527
Alex

827
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,319
Is rambling

828
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,367
S*** about

829
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,903
Emperor Palpatine

830
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,463
And the devil

831
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,511
Satanist

832
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,279
Can you tell your dog

833
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
Right

834
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,095
Alex gets on to

835
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,375
I guess maybe more than

836
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,655
Inspirational message

837
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:54,495
And that is about how again his idea

838
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,775
Can BV tools

839
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,055
God's vengeance

840
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,615
Wichita

841
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,175
Be how Alex wants

842
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
To look at it

843
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:11,647
Bookshelves

844
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:18,303
A man and woman in history has been used implement

845
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,375
Or the

846
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,655
Device

847
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,639
Panda

848
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,967
God's plan

849
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,551
And that I be a vessel

850
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,159
Everybody else plays a mascot.

851
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,719
Nice. She don't get things you asked for

852
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,023
You get

853
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,559
What you pay for

854
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,375
Suffocate yourself

855
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,935
Presence of God

856
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,567
You also need to be careful

857
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,383
When you do ask for something

858
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,735
Make sure you're going to be up to it but that's God's Secret

859
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,063
Really want to stand up against evil

860
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,599
God's going to

861
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,903
Put you through trials and tribulations

862
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,951
More weight on you

863
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,487
Powerlifter

864
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,535
Or drug dealer gymnast

865
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,375
I don't see any

866
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,399
Real Subs

867
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:30,239
Listen to difference between what he's describing of God like giving you little tasks

868
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:38,175
Telling you to kill your dog escalating

869
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:43,039
The same Playbook that parallel and I'm trouble site

870
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:46,111
I also just I know we talked about this

871
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:46,879
Before but like

872
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,719
When you take in the idea that

873
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,279
Humans are the imps

874
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,815
Instruments of God's vengeance

875
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:59,423
And sometimes you know you just admit yourself to God's will

876
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,471
Instrumental

877
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,031
Calling for God's vengeance

878
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,847
Against people who politically disagree with you

879
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,919
It is the sort of thing where you are

880
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,687
Almost

881
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,991
Intentionally hoping that someone

882
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,271
Is in such a

883
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,295
State of Mind

884
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,855
And we're hearing God

885
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:18,879
Calling

886
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,927
To them

887
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,487
Instrument and Carry Out God's Revenge

888
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,511
Quote

889
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,583
This is not an acceptable way to carry your

890
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,167
This is the sort of thing where you are almost certainly

891
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,983
Hoping to find someone

892
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,007
Suggestible

893
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,543
Implant that suggests

894
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,823
Absolutely

895
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,103
Of valid

896
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,151
Religious conversation

897
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,687
It's not a valid

898
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:45,503
I don't even know what other like

899
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:49,343
Category to put it in political conversation it's not a valid conversation

900
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,647
To be having

901
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,695
I think it probably is legal but

902
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,999
I do think that

903
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:59,839
Should things go bad

904
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,119
To be taken very serious

905
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:07,007
To hurt someone that Alex's demonizing and putting a big Target on

906
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,847
Do you know oh what do you know they listen to Infowars

907
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,151
I think Cliff is very relevant

908
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,735
Clutch like that are very relevant because they're giving the audience

909
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,271
Who maybe suggest

910
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,831
The excuse

911
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:25,439
Absolutely if you are not committing a

912
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:28,767
Because you are a living will

913
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,815
In the presence of God you have

914
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:37,215
You know you're just like it said in the Bible

915
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,239
Everyone of your actions

916
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:41,055
Justifies anything

917
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,847
Just say I was suffocating mice

918
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:46,431
There's literally

919
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
Well

920
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,015
Yeah I mean it's functionally

921
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,063
For someone in that state

922
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,343
It's really

923
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,135
It's really

924
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,927
It's really scary

925
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:00,767
No it's being kind of a consistent

926
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,303
Piece of Alex's rhetoric now

927
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,863
I don't remember hearing him say stuff like that

928
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,631
A lot

929
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,399
In the past

930
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,191
I know that

931
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,727
It certainly would have

932
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,799
2009 or

933
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:16,127
The 2013 stretch we're going through I have not heard him

934
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
Like this

935
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,687
Which are

936
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,503
I guess

937
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,783
Hoping

938
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
To inspire

939
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,599
Yeah

940
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,367
Excuse preamp

941
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,671
Isn't it

942
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,207
Started

943
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:33,535
Really doing like after after the

944
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,559
Send her back

945
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,375
Led to so many

946
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,655
Conservative

947
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,191
Luminaries

948
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,495
Defending

949
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,543
Sending her back

950
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,567
That kind of thing

951
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:46,847
It's like

952
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,895
If if somebody does something

953
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,431
Then

954
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,223
During the defense

955
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,503
About

956
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,087
That kind of

957
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,879
That's just a line that

958
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,255
Yeah I hope I hope that your

959
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,279
Thought doesn't

960
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,303
Come true but

961
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:10,399
So I just exited

962
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,447
Alex

963
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:16,543
Literally no reason to ever say

Almost the same thing as I QVC

So of course I cut them to the 4th power

982
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:32,063
Like he does another half-hour into the 4th power from dr. Nick begich

But

987
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,167
He pretends

988
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,775
He's going into the fourth hour according to him

989
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,799
Because it needs

990
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:55,103
Take calls

991
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,383

00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:31,199
The things that he's accused of I just don't care

1003
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,759
I just I don't

1004
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:37,343
He spends an hour of a show called

1005
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,159
Unless Blumenthal called

1006
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
You didn't

1007
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,463

Year and him not putting on a character

1025
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:50,303
He should be a padded cell and if he's putting on a character like

1026
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:56,703
Characters

1027
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,495
True

1028
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,799
Self

1029
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:02,847
If that's

1030
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,615
The character

1031
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:06,175
Who are you trying to appeal to with this character

1032
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:11,039
Characters

1033
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,087
So f***** up

1034
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:13,855
I can just

1035
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,463

1036
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,791
Whatever it wants a Bubba list

1037
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,215
What goes on a little bit and it's

1038
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,495
Because I think Alex

1039
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,079
Like his f*****-up

1040
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,383
And I don't think it's a good

1041
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:44,319
T probably never the kids might beg for Mommy and talk to my text mommy's next timings

1042
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:51,487
We only talked to the children like that

1043
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,559
I came I saw you died

1044
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,119
TalkBack to that's why

1045
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,167
I talked to her in the way they like to

1046
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,727
McDonald's

1047
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,823
It's not good I don't take anyone

1048
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,127
Pretends is enemy

1049
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:11,455
He is listening to his show

1050
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,735
All he's doing

1051
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,015
Freaking out his audience

1052
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:18,111
But you didn't listen to Everyday everyday

1053
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,159
The idea that he's

1054
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:25,023
Talking like that in order to talk back to the globals the way they talk to the children they have

1055
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:32,191
Scarcity can get adrenochrome in their blood and drink and get high talk to Demons the album Etta create a One World Government

1056
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,471

00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,663
Mirror there that's how you make people feel

1058
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,527
No

1059
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:50,367
Oscar calls

1060
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:53,951

00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,999

00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,279

00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:37,215
Girl back from the front line of the information War

1078
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:43,615

1079
00:55:56,671 --> 00:56:02,815

1082
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:48,383
Sing along

1083
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,967
Does he have any more

The big is real serious business there's a lot of s*** going on in the world right now

1086
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,047
So I'm going to cut it

1087
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,095
That he's allowed in the fourth hour

1088
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:13,983
Because I'm a f****** sick along with Pancho and Lefty for over a minute

1089
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:17,823
It's good up radio

1090
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,871
Lo and behold there mostly

1091
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:28,831
This first one is really funny because it starts out with a guy who is a veteran of radio

1092
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,111
The Talk Radio

1093
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,391

1096
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,999
Couple seconds of this called

1097

1098
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:45,983
Product

1099
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,007
He might recommend

1100
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,543
Now just

1101
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,311
Answer is

1102
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,079

And you know better than anybody there I think

1111
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,591
This is a really dangerous

1112
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,127
Want to be asking Alex

1113
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,663

Careful

1117
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,159
He might say this product

1118
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:36,927
Is good

1119
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:42,559

I don't I don't think that I think he's just trained as listeners to know that they will get a much better day in court

1149
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:34,943
If they do an ad in their call earlier the episode

1150
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:39,807
When callers bring up the supplement Drive sales because it's

1151
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:44,415
The old appears to organic

1152
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:46,207
Have planted

1153
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,279
Time his behavior is so

1154
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,631
Incentivizing people to do that

1155
01:00:53,887 --> 01:01:00,031
Call Natural Organics

1156
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:03,103
I'll get more time on air

1157
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,895
Strategy

1158
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,199
Maybe I'll be able to plug my own

1159
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:10,783
SoundCloud whatever

1160
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,831
And plus if that was a

1161
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:16,415
Call he wouldn't said I've been in radio 15 years I didn't know who you were

1162
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:24,095
It runs counter to Alex's grandiosity

1163
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,679
This dude is lying

1164
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,799
No I don't think so

1165
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:38,431
Six months that he's already got all the all the things down all that stuff

1166
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,711
Dude if you listen

1167
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,735
For a week

1168
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:46,879
You have all the stuff done

1169
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:51,231
This whole no medical claims

1170
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:51,999
Like

1171
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:59,167
From how much of this should I listen to and how much of a joke

1172
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:01,983
If you were motivated

1173
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,007
Towards him

1174
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,055
Are you listen for a month straight

1175
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:08,383
You would understand the rhythms you would understand the

1176
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,455
Probably understand the worldview

1177
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:14,015
You probably wouldn't understand where he's getting his ideas

1178
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,063
From

1179
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,599
A good bit of reading

1180
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,367
Yeah

1181
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:21,439
Involves clues that he doesn't give out very often

1182
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:24,511
You know like those little things

1183
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,279
It don't come up

1184
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:28,351
But once every few months

1185
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,471
Little signals video

1186
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:37,055
Able to find out what he's talking about

1187
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:40,383
You probably wouldn't understand that but you would understand the message

1188
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,407
Very clearly

1189
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,735
You doing that

1190
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:47,551
Colin

1191
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,623
And like six months

1192
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,439
Very rare that he actually takes calls

1193
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:59,071
So getting that training in the last six months difficult

1194
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:00,863
I don't know

1195
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,911
I think there's been enough okay

1196
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,983
Anyway Alex's another thing

1197
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:11,359
Overdrive

1198
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:13,407
Power of the fourth hour

1199
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:17,503
People calling in it doing at

1200
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:20,063
That's a large part of it

1201
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,623
And then the other part

1202
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:26,463
Trump has sold them out by walking

1203
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,999
Kickbacks

1204
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,887
Alex B this might be a point

1205
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,423
But he's out of step with his audience

1206
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,727
Like they might be past him

1207
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:42,847
Able

1208
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,895
To match them because if he

1209
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:45,919
.

1210
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,687
He would

1211
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,223
Nashua

1212
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:52,063
Out now on Redbox

1213
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:56,415
Red bar with pizza

1214
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:59,999
Was Mike David Chicago podcast

1215
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:02,815
Yeah yeah

1216
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:08,703
I think I think he's out of step with his audience eclipsed him

1217
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,751
They don't have a business

1218
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,287
You does

1219
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,847
He has to do this b******* about a White House

1220
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:18,175
Petition to get them exposed

1221
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:20,223
Suck it lets get pitchforks

1222
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,247
Start screaming

1223
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,527
So

1224
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,551
That that

1225
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,391
He also takes one call from a guy

1226
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,159
Started

1227
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,999
He wants to point out

1228
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,279
Be careful with that

1229
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,815
Because you can take two

1230
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,119
Too much and it could be dangerous

1231
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:40,959
It is very strong

1232
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,495
Strong stuff

1233
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,055
She done just turns into like a positive

1234
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,079
Course

1235
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,615
But it leads

1236
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:50,175
Spiraling about t.i.

1237
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,967
And just like

1238
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:53,247
DeSoto

1239
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,063
Talk about the iodine

1240
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:59,135
Visit Alaska

1241
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:03,743
And it is absurd way to try and sell iodine

1242
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:04,511
Pills

1243
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:08,095
7 years ago

1244
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:14,751
I was coming a mile everyday exercising couldn't lose leg weight just poured off

1245
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,759
Did I died

1246
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,855
I was not impotent

1247
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,415
But let's just say

1248
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:37,791
I was like God when I was a teenager stuff

1249
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:41,887
Remember that

1250
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:45,983
Text manifestation

1251
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,775
Is that

1252
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,847
No wonder they're trying to keep it away from us

1253
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:55,455
I'd like to remind you as a family

1254
01:05:55,711 --> 01:06:01,855
Just just to let you know in a while there it wasn't

1255
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:06,719
Right

1256
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:09,279
To get your big juicy

1257
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,839
I don't know why my dick was big younger

1258
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,607
When I was younger

1259
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:15,935
I don't know why but the bad halogen

1260
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:16,703
Coming in

1261
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:23,103
Bromine

1262
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:29,759
The fluoride and all that stuff

1263
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,159
Yeah then it gets on iodine

1264
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:42,559
It will not if you use

1265
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,607
X2 survival Shield

1266
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:47,423
Amazing

1267
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,495
Grove

1268
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,287
I don't know

1269
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:55,359
I mean the family show but I don't know how

1270
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:56,895
Your

1271
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:57,919
Sitting here

1272
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,943
With a straight face

1273
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:00,479
And you're still pitched

1274
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:02,015
The f****** iodine is

1275
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:05,343
It made my dick bigger and also I lazy

1276
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,367
Yeah

1277
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:09,183
Yeah and I'm his baby lazy

1278
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:12,511
Every part of it is iodine

1279
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:17,631
Incredibly unhealthy loss was sober accumat is almost like I was on speed

1280
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,167
And then I was like

1281
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:19,935
Because I

1282
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:27,359
It encouraged an unhealthy lifestyle wherein I got the results I wanted but

1283
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:34,015
Almost miracle

1284
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:42,719
I can live an unhealthy lifestyle with just the family show

1285
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,327
This show sucks

1286
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,119
So ridiculous

1287
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,679
If I had to describe what this is

1288
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:52,959
Triggering

1289
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,007
Evoking

1290
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:58,847
This absurd

1291
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,127
Mexico Lobos

1292
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:04,991
There is definitely yet you have to recognize the danger

1293
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,527
He's doing

1294
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,087
Bruised saddles

1295
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:11,391
Implying

1296
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,415
This woman

1297
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,439
Omar

1298
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,719
Is that

1299
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,487
Cheese

1300
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,279
A Muslim

1301
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:20,607
Who's here to destroy America

1302
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,935
Slightly lighter than which implies

1303
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:26,751
Did anybody else who may look like her

1304
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:33,407
You better keep them out of power

1305
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,687
Sucks

1306
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,479
So that's

1307
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:39,807
That's not great

1308
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,111
Are you saying

1309
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,903
But when you built up this

1310
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:45,951
Level of animosity

1311
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,975
Beer about her

1312
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,071
Spiritualist

1313
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:51,839
Bucked up

1314
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,887
And included

1315
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,679
If you feel God

1316
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:57,983
Leading a tour to be the instrument of vengeance

1317
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:03,103
Playing with fire in such

1318
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,639
Irresponsible way

1319
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,943
Racist way

1320
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,735
Such a

1321
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:12,063
I pray nothing happens

1322
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,367
I don't want get alarmist

1323
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:17,183
And be like this is going to happen

1324
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:24,095
But this is the way you would do it if you were trying to do it and keep your hands clean absolutely

1325
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,631
You would engage in in

1326
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:28,703
Operational terrorism without calling for it

1327
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,727
This is

1328
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,543
There is no better way

1329
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:37,919
It doesn't mean that the result is going to happen

1330
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,455
But

1331
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,735
The

1332
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,015
Set up

1333
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,039
Is very cool

1334
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:45,599
Yeah the results will happen or not

1335
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,695
Way to get there is

1336
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:50,975
Yes.

1337
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,255
That's the situation

1338
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:57,631
Throwing a bunch of

1339
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:00,959
Shooting out all the pallets of murder

1340
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,287
Yeah that's the way

1341
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:07,871
It's deeply response

1342
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,479
Know what I hope for anymore

1343
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:13,503
With him

1344
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:17,087
Yeah

1345
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:20,671
He doesn't deserve violence to be done to him he doesn't deserve

1346
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,975
I do I do I don't

1347
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,511
I don't know where the law is

1348
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,303
I don't know where that line is

1349
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:28,607
I'm not a scholar

1350
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,143
And those things so difficult for me

1351
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,703
What should cause

1352
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:36,031
Precipitate illegal

1353
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,055
Consequence

1354
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:43,711
I just think it important to recognize that this is what he's doing now in the off chance that something bad happens later

1355
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,503
Because it does

1356
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:46,783
2 Beats

1357
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:50,367
He needs to be held responsible for his action

1358
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,135
Absolute

1359
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,415
Easily as a piece

1360
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,207
Izzy's Pizza

1361
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,743
Looks

1362
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,535
Looks to be heading in a bad Direction

1363
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:03,935
A little bit shorter probably but

1364
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:04,703
Hey

1365
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,471
I'm moving

1366
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:13,151
Literally

1367
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:19,295
So we come to the end of this and I just think this is deeply irresponsible but at the same time it snowed portent

1368
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,319
You show this

1369
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,599
Clear

1370
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:25,951
I know the right word

1371
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:29,279
Is almost

1372
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,047
Farcical

1373
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:31,583
Like the idea

1374
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,375
Real

1375
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,399
F******

1376
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:35,679
Prejudice

1377
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,983
Nativist racist

1378
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:38,751
Agitation

1379
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,519
Towards

1380
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,799
Representative Omar

1381
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:45,919
And then in the same show he's talking about iodine making your dick bigger

1382
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:48,479
The family show

1383
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,015
I meant taking a minute

1384
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:52,063
I have to sing along with Pancho and Lefty

1385
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,367
This is a f****** absurd

1386
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:56,415
Kind of spectacle

1387
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,951
I don't

1388
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,535
If I hadn't been

1389
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:05,119
Bathing in this for so long

1390
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:07,935
I would look at this and I would just buy

1391
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,727
Lafleur

1392
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:10,751
It really is

1393
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:15,615
But with the real dangerous

1394
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:19,967
Potential it is it is fascinating especially because

1395
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:20,735
Isn't it

1396
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:30,207
Maybe Wednesday maybe Friday not a hundred percent sure as of yet

1397
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,231
But we will see

1398
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:32,767
But

1399
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,047
Whatever the case

1400
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:36,863
Outside it is knowledge

1401
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,655
You bet it is

1402
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:40,959
Where on Twitter

1403
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:44,031
We haven't been we haven't been kicked off Twitter Dan

Underscore fighting Garrett go to bed Jordan

Terrible

1411
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,423
Wanting Pizza

1412
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:17,823
People want to come see you from Tuesday through Sunday
