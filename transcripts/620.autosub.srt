1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important swetik

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody looking back and I was right I'm a little bit about

7
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,144
Jordan Jordan

8
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,168
Sure

9
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:15,008
I hate to

10
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:21,408
Every now and again got to get a little bit sentimental maybe a little modeling sure and I spot

11
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:25,248
Is just this the show I mean like the reality of

12
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
This

13
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,832
He's so bizarre to me and like

14
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,600
The audience

15
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,904
The being what it is

16
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
You reflect back on

17
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,328
You know where things were years of the past

18
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,376
Nothing

19
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,680
Like this seem even conceivably possum

20
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,728
I assumed it was going to happen the whole time

21
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:52,128
Okay having an having people who listen to the show in the numbers that they do

22
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,176
Positive attitude

23
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
Is

24
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,248
It was Unthinkable when we started

25
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,576
The idea of being able to interview the

26
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:06,976
Plaintiff lawyer for Alex

27
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:11,584
Close to have those things daily it's there's a reality to

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
The the sort of presents

29
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144
Examples of Our Lives

30
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,424
And I'm very thankful

31
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,216
4 +

32
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,520
Completely aware of the fact that it is

33
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,336
Is due to our wonderful audience

34
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,688
100% would like to take the opportunity on this holiday which

35
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:33,088
Maybe people celebrate or don't I don't I don't know I'm not going to judge to say thank you

36
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,112
Means a lot

37
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
100% agree

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,232
Whatsyourprice

39
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:45,376
And I'm going to actually say that this is one of the few times that we are 100% piggybacking on top of each other

40
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:51,776
All right I thought I was going to bug you in the corner cuz my Brightspot fits right in

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,568
He's our braids

42
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
I don't tell you why

43
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,664
Because today

44
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,528
You getting mad all right that's not what I'm talkin about

45
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,576
Recording on Thanksgiving

46
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,904
And many people use today is a day to give thanks

47
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,720
Thanks and so on and so forth and what is our bright spot

48
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,768
Other than a regular

49
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,792
Giving thanks

50
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
Four things that are

51
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,936
A lot of times

52
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:26,336
Hey what can I say do you want me to talk about how this is

53
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,920
What you're saying

54
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,712
And what I say to you Dan

55
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,992
And what I say to everyone

56
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,552
Is as you said many people don't celebrate

57
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
Today

58
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
For any number of reasons

59
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
Gone on record as being against genocide

60
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,208
Thanksgiving is not not about

61
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:48,608
The tradition of the turkey

62
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,888
So today

63
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,192
Like Bill Pullman before me

64
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
I declare this

65
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,032
American holiday

66
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Tubi

67
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
Global bright spots

68
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:04,992
Okay that is what it shall be across the world you're declaring independence from Thanksgiving

69
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,296
I am declaring

70
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
Thanksgiving all right

71
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:14,976
Location of the neighbors who are eating turkey with their family love tearing that scream

72
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
We are in the present

73
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,447
As we alluded to on Twitter we posted on Wednesday we're going to have

74
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,983
Sneaky Snake episode

75
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,799
Although news had just broken that Alex

76
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591
Got subpoenaed by the January 6th

77
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,359
Committee

78
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,151
Reasoning for that was

79
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
The time

80
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,711
Crunch would just be too severe

81
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,039
I'm trying to turn around an episode wouldn't have content

82
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,855
22 copper button

83
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,647
And we are here in the present day

84
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,951
And we're going to be covering

85
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,487
November 23rd

86
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,399
Lead the tone really

87
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,703
Also going to be covering

88
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,055
Various video couple videos that Alex put out on video that

89
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,895
Spoiler alert one of them is him standing in a creek

90
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:11,551
That is exactly what should have happened why isn't a goddamn Tom Sawyer

91
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,879
Maybe he just didn't have high water

92
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,415
Penny boots

93
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:22,047
I work at that business on all this but first Jordan let's take a little bit say hello doesn't do want

94
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,375
So first Patrick

95
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,935
I'm a policy

96
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:36,127
Next mohab shower from Sweden take as much or now policy want

97
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,431
Thank you very much

98
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,503
I like this one Polly sidewalk

99
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
That's nice

100
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
Thank you so much right now

101
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,159
Well done police

102
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,743
And Gerald asked that I bring this up by this is from his message

103
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:56,863
Alright I would love to mention that I had The Misfortune of meeting Alex Jones in 1999

104
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,935
He was nuts back then and unfortunately it's only gotten worse

105
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:09,151
Okay. Thank you so much you are now attacking

106
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,295
How's your 401k

107
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
Business

108
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
Money off that heroin

109
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,023
Usually large

110
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,959
So we start exploration

111
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,983
What happened in Alex

112
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
Immediate

113
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
The past

114
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:43,199
I'll buy going to the video that he put up called response to the January

115
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
Committee subpoena

116
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,783
Personal response time for him to get his message out

117
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,575
Right on his own platform

118
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,135
Exactly what we would have wanted

119
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,927
Play this is the pure on

120
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,255
Cut cocaine version

121
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:02,399
Delay none of that s*** no having to worry about like all I'm also doing my show nothing

122
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
Yeah

123
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
I've told the listener

124
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
That

125
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
You know why

126
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
January 6th

127
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
Committee

128
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
Create bylaws

129
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
The Witcher

130
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
Has

131
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
Myself and

132
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
Lied about

133
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
Show me

134
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
People I know

135
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
Claim that we want to do a

136
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
On January

137
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,287
This is same Democrats

138
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
Call Rittenhouse

139
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
Call shot three black

140
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
Liars

141
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,199
This is a criminal

142
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
This is something

143
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,039
Joseph McCarthy

144
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
A lot of people

145
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
America

146
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,367
It turned out some of the

147
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,791
Pretty funny how Alex is trying to use the image of McCarthyism to illustrate how he's being subjected to a witch

148
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,375
I'm halfway through he realize that he loves McCarthy and

149
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,679
You know you didn't think at all

150
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:11,775
Is the fact that is a well hold on

151
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,591
The funniest possible wages

152
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,223
This is exactly like McCarthy except for the opposite because I love McCarthy this is great

153
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
We are going to experience

154
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:27,391
A number of times where McCarthyism is invoked and it just a should choose another example cuz

155
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,999
Doesn't work

156
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:35,327
Which is why they're using the example exactly

157
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
Fit within their cosmology

158
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,471
The letter that the house committee investigating January 6th at Alex's

159
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,263
Is easily accessible and it pretty

160
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,591
Clearly lays out why they want to ask Alex a few questions

161
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,943
Honestly most of the information contained in the letter that they have the information that

162
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,735
Explains why he's being subpoenaed

163
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:59,391
It's just transcripts of things Alex said on his own show about his involvement in planning and organizing the rally

164
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:03,487
Any connection to books like Ali Alexander

165
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,839
Probably the part that looks the worse though is

166
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:14,239
Piece of a transcript from when noted race war fever Matt Bracken was hosting the fourth hour of December 31st

167
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
2020

168
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,335
Quote we're not going to be saved by anyone above us

169
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
We're going to only be

170
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,919
Be saved by millions of Americans move

171
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:27,295
Went to Washington occupying the whole area if necessary storming right into the capitol

172
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,087
We know the rules of engagement

173
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,367
If you have enough people you

174
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,671
You can push down any kind of fence over wall

175
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
That does

176
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
Sound incriminate

177
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,327
So yeah it's a little that is not good

178
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
Right up there with the

179
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:46,751
The capital is falling tomorrow taken tomorrow's news was today with my bracket in terms of predicting

180
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,031
Storming of the capitol

181
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:54,687
If I were Alex I'd be pretty worried right now cuz these are serious people paying attention to him instead of just dumb pocket

182
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:59,551
There's now a serious people at the ability to compel testimony and request

183
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,599
It's that are within the scope of their investigation

184
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:06,463
And honestly from where I'm sitting I think the committee is Sabina and most of the right

185
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
People

186
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,815
It'll be wise to keep an eye on things so folks don't over correct

187
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
Turn this into an

188
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,399
Insanely sprawling new variation on McCarthyism

189
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,983
But for now it looks like they want to ask the right people questions

190
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
I'm out

191
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,079
Even after this news broke about Alex's subpoena

192
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:28,479
Another round of Athena's came out for the proud Boys The Oath Keepers and their respective leaders Enrique tarrio and

193
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
Stewart Rhodes

194
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,831
Anyway the point is schitt's getting wild in Alex's world

195
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,391
Losing all these court cases by default looking

196
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,439
Millions in Damages probably

197
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
And now getting

198
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,351
Subpoena to testify in front of a committee that includes at least three house members that he's accused of being satanic pedophiles

199
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Is not

200
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Promising

201
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:50,751
Yeah that's not great that's Adam Schiff Liz Cheney and Jamie Raskin in case you're keeping score

202
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,103
I don't know what'll come of this but I'm really hoping that his deposition is telefax

203
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,919
Calling this a Witch Hunt

204
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Is

205
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
A little bit like

206
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,527
If you were a coven of witches who just

207
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
Blown up the king

208
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
And then they were like

209
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,391
They're hunting us this is a Witch Hunt

210
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,975
You know you can't be mad about that that's on you you're a bunch of witches you getting onto

211
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:17,631
Well you're not getting hunted because you're witches you're going to hunt because you blew up a king or whatever

212
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,447
You can hang out you're fine

213
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:25,311
Exactly if we act not who you are but it is very technically a Witch Hunt

214
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:29,663
Alex talks about

215
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
I knew this was

216
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
Major harassment

217
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
Really made me pee

218
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
Ascot

219
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
What

220
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,911
Cuz I'm not going to back down

221
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
What is the

222
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
Secret weapon

223
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
I got

224
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,015
He said

225
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
Talk about

226
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
Send

227
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
This whole global

228
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
Paradise

229
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
It's time to re

230
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,743
And show in Alaska

231
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,767
For five months

232
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
Diligently

233
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
Reset War

234
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
Holyshit

235
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:30,079
Here's the deal it turns out that Alex has started a new thing called reset Wars which if you believe his website is quote

236
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
He's the most important

237
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
Project to date

238
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,199
There's a video up on Band. Video that

239
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,503
Explains what it is and I'll get to that in a minute

240
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,319
First I need to make clear that this is not Alex's most

241
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
Important project a date

242
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,927
Is a painfully transparent attempt to harvest email addresses

243
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:51,839
The website reset wars.com is literally just a forum for people to get the waiting list for whatever is super board project

244
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,167
There's no more details on there it is just a form

245
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,263
Here's what's most interesting about this new website

246
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,895
If you check the bottom of the page you'll find a little link to the terms-of-service page

247
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,967
When you click on it you'll find something really bizarre

248
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:13,599
Website isn't run by Alex Jones Infowars LLC or Free Speech Systems LLC

249
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:17,439
It's not run by any business that Alex has been historically associated with

250
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:24,095
Instead it's quote presented by restore America marketing company LLC Delaware Limited

251
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,887
Did liability company

252
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:32,287
That's really weird it's glaringly different from Alex's other websites and things of businesses

253
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:38,687
Cease run Incorporated in Delaware on such short notice we near the Delaware secretary

254
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:44,575
Tri-states website that the company restore America marketing company LLC was incorporated on November

255
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:50,975
16th 2041 which I'm certain is just coincidentally the day after the default judgment came down to the Connecticut

256
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
Sandy Hook

257
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,327
Fun

258
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:01,727
Not every business Incorporated in Delaware is engaged in criminal activity but you should be aware that a lot of folks were up

259
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,751
How to no good liked

260
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,335
To use the state of their technical home and there's a few specific reasons why

261
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,663
The first is that there are preferable tax condition

262
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Canton estate

263
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:17,087
Another reason is that llc's in that state are afforded a great deal of privacy but having to public Lee list the ownership

264
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,647
And board members and such of their couple

265
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,951
That's great if you're super Shady

266
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,279
However there's one aspect of incorporating in Delaware that seem

267
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,095
Little bit more relevant than the others in this situation

268
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:32,959
Delaware LLC laws provide businesses with what's known as double shielding

269
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,823
In Most states if your business has a debt it like let's say if it gets sued

270
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,663
Your personal assets are protected from being considered fair game to

271
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
The creditors

272
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,247
However intelli where it goes both directions

273
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
That same protection exist

274
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,367
But if you personally have debts creditors cannot

275
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
Consider your LLC

276
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,671
In terms of

277
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
Collection

278
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,023
I don't want to make too blunt of an accusation but it almost seemed

279
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,143
Cosmically Shady with Camaro

280
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:09,055
There is also super duper Free Speech systems out of the Cayman Islands so weird

281
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:14,431
That he would incorporate so ever know

282
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:18,271
Yeah the day after

283
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:22,879
It's always like this important that they hadn't done this way to dreads

284
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,695
What are you guys talking about

285
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
4 years

286
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,279
Yeah I think here's my

287
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,095
What's the reset Wars website

288
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:37,215
Itself a URL domain name was registered about a month ago is in October

289
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:43,615
So there was a little bit of previous I think maybe it was like a project that Alex wanted to do and then

290
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,687
Got to get this off the Infowars

291
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,759
Restore America marketing company

292
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
It's it's

293
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,087
A new adventure

294
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Reset

295
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,415
Chester dance

296
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:00,767
What's f****** unfair reset Wars is just standard asking for Stuff

297
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:04,863
As you can tell from this clip from another video we put up on Van. Video titled

298
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
What is

299
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
Reset War

300
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Everything

301
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,263
Camp hold us

302
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,543
In the Ferdinand

303
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
Shroyer

304
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
Our energy

305
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
Customer building

306
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,527
This is beyond

307
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
This is beyond

308
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
Tiffany read about science

309
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
Because this is actually

310
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
Actually happening

311
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,439
Real world today

312
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,975
We have discovered

313
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Their secret

314
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Discovered

315
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
How to stop them

316
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
Give me to put it all

317
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
Together and

318
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
System

319
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,655
Give

320
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
To not just

321
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
Globo's

322
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
Transcend

323
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
The next level

324
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
All of you

325
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
Martino's

326
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,871
I've already witnessed

327
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,431
You are the leader

328
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
Of the future

329
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,991
But must go to the next level

330
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
Albuquerque

331
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,343
Free directions

332
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
Humanity

333
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
Before they get trapped

334
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,207
The globalist for building

335
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
All I'm offering is

336
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
Boo

337
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,679
Grabbing us at The Matrix

338
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,703
Feel like maybe he just met

339
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
Make that public

340
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,751
Immediately instead of putting

341
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:21,151
Bring up a page to harvest contact info from people only to eventually revealed it

342
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,199
Keep stuff from the club list all along

343
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,759
I will say that there's some good entertainment

344
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:31,647
And in one of the videos that Alex posted on Baya. Videos title to give yourself to God the

345
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,183
Journey of recent Wars

346
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,487
And the thumbnail 11 is amazing

347
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,815
I will post a picture of it I'll send it to you to put on Twitter

348
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:45,215
Okay it's just Alex with his shirt on standing in a creek with his hands raised to the heaven no no no no no

349
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,239
We're not doing Jesus

350
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
And if you think

351
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
This is clickbait It's

352
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,103
Do not Alex film part of the video standing in a creek

353
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,919
He's really trying to go for John the

354
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
It's like real hard here

355
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,247
Yeah like crazy heart

356
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:02,111
I'm going to play the audio from that video where Alex is in the creek

357
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:07,743
Okay we're going to listen to the right I'm going to play it in its entirety the only cuts that I've made are so we can

358
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,767
Breaking mic

359
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,071
Discuss what screen size

360
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,631
It is I think is more important lately

361
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:20,287
What we need to know is what reset Wars is all about this the Journey of recent Wars

362
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,567
Batman when he said he was

363
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,639
Inspire to get down on his knees and pray to God

364
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,175
And God responded with

365
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
Hey

366
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,967
Keep doing what you doing buddy

367
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
You doing great

368
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,271
You just need more money

369
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,599
It makes sense to reset where's is essentially the same thing

370
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:40,255
What's the issue for me and that's the difficulty if God is telling him that the answer is reset Wars why need to make

371
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
Completely separate thing

372
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
From

373
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:47,935
The businesses he's established and have been long-running for 20-something years

374
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,215
Easy eats

375
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
If it's no different

376
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,055
Bell is it's completely different

377
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,103
I don't know if it's all that differ

378
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
I hate this already

379
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,855
I'm not even waiting for you

380
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,879
God is waiting

381
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:12,255
Waiting for you but God is a Freewheel. You got to reach out with your hands

382
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
Help me

383
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,911
I choose good I choose

384
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
Fart

385
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
Eternity

386
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
And completion

387
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
It's about

388
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,151
Choice we make

389
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,223
Understanding

390
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,759
Fuses and manipulate socks

391
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
We have

392
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,695
To another level of understanding

393
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,999
Fight against this tyranny

394
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,303
The recent wards.com

395
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,751
So right off the bat this is

396
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,079
No different than anything else you generally here on Infowars

397
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
Except that he has like

398
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
I guess he's license

399
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,991
Pure moods music I mean that did sound very

400
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,831
Little new AG on your ass

401
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:14,975
F****** Boombox from the 90s playlist

402
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:21,375
Got to do with the Orinoco Flow

403
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,727
Very much the same thing

404
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
Is troubling

405
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,055
Because I would have expected it to be different

406
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
You know if it's

407
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,895
Somebody's got to make a whole new thing for

408
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:39,295
You know freestyle Wars

409
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,599
Well I mean cuz then they

410
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,879
It's too close to Infowars

411
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:49,279
Reset default

412
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:56,191
Are you can't just make you're not making a sequel you're starting over it's the great reset Wars if you will

413
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,519
No it reminds me so much of

414
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,103
The original Cowboy Bebop episode brainscratch

415
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
There's this

416
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,431
Cult leader trying to get everybody to migrate

417
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,479
Electronics and I'll leave their bodies behind

418
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,295
Just a meat sack all of these things

419
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,087
And hearing Alex do that is like

420
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,647
We're not just sitting for

421
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,304
Google one step away from everybody's wearing the same shoes rocket behind the, you know

422
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,584
Understand

423
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
I think there is

424
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,656
Reason to be a little worried but

425
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
I think

426
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,960
Honestly this is

427
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:35,360
She's just over selling the new website totally I think that's what it is

428
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:41,760
Go reset wars.com cam reset wars.com

429
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,856
It's appealing to some sort of vague pseudo spirituality

430
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
Hands

431
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
New AG bulshit

432
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,952
And religiosity

433
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,512
I'm just sort of amplifying that as much as

434
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,048
Do the candidates get a tent

435
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,584
Gen4 recent Wars.

436
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,656
I'm just so tired of people wanting me to ascend

437
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:04,288
Why do I need to ascend let's just try and make this s*** good but is a concern for a lot of people it seems

438
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
Ascending

439
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,640
Bad news

440
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,200
And that is that Alex doesn't stay in the creek hole

441
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,504
That is really deaf

442
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,624
Little bit

443
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,648
But

444
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,672
Pretty quickly ends up

445
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,440
Walking

446
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
Up up

447
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:26,560
Got to think that it was a heel in his backyard

448
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:32,960
Towards the end of it you can see a house in the background

449
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:38,848
He's not just talking back walking along a trail but might be near or connected to his backyard

450
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
I don't worship nature like

451
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
Cannabis for the wicked

452
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,528
Are all the way

453
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
Connection to God

454
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,184
Love you look at the last they're all embracing the Pfizer shots

455
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
Moderna stock

456
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
They're all

457
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,560
Embracing transhumanism

458
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,888
Call the same time Clayton is there so in line with the Earth

459
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
Schoenlein

460
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
Creation

461
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
But they worship

462
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,008
The creation Endust worship

463
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:07,776
Shelf

464
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
Instead of under

465
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,824
Standards the divine

466
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,104
Transcendence of reaching out

467
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,920
The gods water plan leader getting with that natural

468
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
Go program

469
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,968
Or rebelling against it

470
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
What you sent

471
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
I'll say that for

472
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,296
Parasitical

473
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
Hypocritical high on the mountain

474
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,648
And I said that from Deep research

475
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,672
Search understanding of how this

476
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
This really works

477
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
Alex

478
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,256
I mean he also believes

479
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
Like

480
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,352
Male-dominated societies as nature

481
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,912
It's a going against that would be

482
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
MSN

483
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,008
There's nothing that man has jorvik

484
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,824
Connection with the nature which is why the people that I see

485
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
Support politically

486
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:48,992
They are actively tearing it apart and distance bolsonaro destroying the Amazon rainforest

487
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,784
By Nature

488
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,880
Still nothing is happening here that is in any way different

489
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,672
Very standard Infowars

490
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,464
This is exactly the same s***

491
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,304
I've heard Alex talks fairly regularly about how he doesn't worship nature

492
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,144
About religious ideas more times than I can count this is

493
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,424
Just boilerplate

494
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,704
Infowars nonsense

495
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,520
I will say there's one difference and it's giving me an idea

496
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
Okay

497
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,568
He's walking up

498
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,104
And he's very clearly out of

499
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,920
The energy to get real

500
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,712
Excited and emotional about it

501
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,248
He's just getting what do you want

502
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,016
How to say out

503
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,808
Let's do a show with

504
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,576
Him on a treadmill

505
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,136
None of these big outburst

506
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:31,488
None of this fake crying he's too out of breath and too tired to do anything but Act

507
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
Delirious

508
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:37,888
The new for my entertainment Buck I don't think that would be a better show

509
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,960
Yeah but I think maybe he's tired he was in

510
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,032
In the creek that made the bottoms of his jeans heavier

511
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,824
Every step he was taking

512
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,848
Was exhaust

513
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:53,760
So if I were somebody watching this I will probably be asking myself why does Alex need to start a new project to do the exact same

514
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,040
I think he's been doing for years

515
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:59,392
How do you ask myself why Alex's rambling about vague nonsense instead of getting

516
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:04,256
I'll be asking why this big new website is just an email submission form

517
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:10,656
These are important questions because they have no answer other than Alex knows Infowars is a sinking ship and he needs to reboot

518
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:14,752
So I think that's what we're in the middle on

519
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,312
It's hard not to see a rat

520
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,848
Escaping that ship

521
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,384
You know just like

522
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,528
As all of the other people around him go down with that ship all the sudden this rat

523
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,552
Curry's out

524
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,856
With the Delaware LLC

525
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,184
It does feel that way

526
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:38,560
I don't I don't know exactly to get a sense of

527
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,096
What the exact

528
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,168
Plan is here boy does it feel like

529
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,216
Life raft

530
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
Leslie I'm broken

531
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,544
And yeah I mean sure

532
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
My dad said

533
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,592
We showed up with several

534
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,640
A million a million dollars but that's

535
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:58,016
Because I'm broken

536
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,832
Lovett Lovett

537
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,624
Big buyer one big box

538
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,208
Business Partnership with

539
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,280
Reset Wars which totally isn't me

540
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,048
I'm leaving

541
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,864
Restore America marketing

542
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,888
Man that's

543
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,448
That's real difficult to find Anna

544
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,800
So anyway I'm here we go more of this this video of Alex

545
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
Taking a walk

546
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,640
There's only two ways to go she was gone

547
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,176
God's plan or two

548
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
Those are working again

549
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,480
Plant operations

550
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,784
I got a lot of excuses and lot of reasons

551
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,088
Showing up at the end of the day

552
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,368
It's about enslavement

553
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
It's about turning over your will to them

554
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,208
And you will be betrayed you will be destroyed

555
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,328
Hateful lot so angry they chose wrong

556
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,376
We're trying to Claus many good Souls

557
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,424
With the meds they can that's really what this is

558
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,520
Any species of crab I've ever caught

559
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,544
Put them in a box

560
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,128
The work together to get out but instead any crab that tries to get out

561
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,944
Bending over and grab them attack you to start killing

562
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,504
As long as you just sit there and dice they're all happy

563
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,576
That one Crab House you get out they're not about to let that happen

564
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,392
Hence the intergalactic crab bucket

565
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
System

566
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
For the

567
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
Chickenshit

568
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,792
So I'm not sure if you can tell but in the background Alex

569
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:20,192
Is faintly playing the violin part from the endgame I did hear that a little bit I was

570
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:25,312
Is really surprised that's really surprised to suddenly hear that I'm like what time. Are we in

571
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,592
What is happening

572
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,408
Did he record this 20 years ago just

573
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,688
Sooner or later I'm at

574
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,016
He must have like maybe got drunk and watched endgame

575
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,320
I was like God damn that music

576
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
I have is my best

577
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:42,208
Also crabs are presenting that one of the other crabs was trying to get out of the bucket

578
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,536
Yeah

579
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,144
They're that guy trying to get out of here

580
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:55,520
Saudi phenomenon analysis talking about occurs when you have a bunch of crabs in a bucket and they're all trying

581
00:27:55,776 --> 00:28:01,920
Need to get out but in doing so they like wave around and knock another crab climb on another crab

582
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,344
Metaphor that Alex is trying to make only works if you believe that the crabs at the bottom of the bucket are somehow resentful of the crabs

583
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,112
Trying to get out

584
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
Inside to pull them down

585
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:17,280
You have to believe the crabs have complex intention so their actions which they do not

586
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:23,680
Better metaphor that can be made by the example of crabs in a bucket is about how sometimes doing things in your best interest can

587
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,472
Hurt yourself and those around you

588
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,080
It's individually in your best interest to run from a fire but if everyone does so you run the risk

589
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,104
The blocking exits

590
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,152
Making the situation worse for everyone

591
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,944
Take their time in their names

592
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,248
Call Bella the better outcome as a whole

593
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,784
And the same is true of

594
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,552
These crabs

595
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
Imperial

596
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,344
If I had higher fact

597
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,624
Call t.j.

598
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,952
The thing that I kind of was thinking about you is that like that

599
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,720
Dynamic

600
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,000
Of doing what

601
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:53,632
Prickly in your best interests at the expense of others and ultimately yourself

602
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,472
That's kind of Alex's career nutshell

603
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,032
Talking it well I mean in a crab bucket yes

604
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,568
Yeah it is very

605
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,104
Musically exactly what he is done

606
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:09,760
His entire life yeah it strikes me as like a crab metaphor it like you're the crab man you're the one who

607
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,040
Chilly talks about ascending

608
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:17,440
You're like all I'm going to get up out of this f****** bucket and you just wind up pushing everybody else down and then you can't get up Andy Irons

609
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,560
You need to be more like ants we're going to sacrifice Millions to get across the river some

610
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,584
I don't know

611
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
Sure

612
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,912
So Alex has the chickenshit

613
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,472
Dimension that he has discussed

614
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,800
He's talked about that quite a bit in the past

615
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,848
At least he's used that term a bunch of

616
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,408
Heard it before

617
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,456
And so that's why I quit Mark Zuckerberg

618
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,016
Just creating is creating the chickenshit dimension

619
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,832
Zuckerberg on rebuilding its

620
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,112
It's the chickenshit

621
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
Where are you

622
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,976
Going there believing you're going to find

623
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,304
Enlightenment all you do is find oppression and slavery

624
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,376
Because once I get you in their system just like the general internet was

625
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,936
Turn the clamp down on it and take all the basic freedoms away.

626
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,704
Went

627
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,240
The Wild Wild West

628
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
Caviar

629
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:09,664
And they're going to have all the prizes and celebrity worship for people that are involved in there

630
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,992
And then as soon as everybody basically is addicted to it and needs it to

631
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,528
Hava Java worker live

632
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,320
They're going to drop the boom on tape

633
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,136
Adult lockdowns

634
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,416
Four Sisters

635
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
Tractor run

636
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
On the vetiver

637
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,256
That's her play

638
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,328
Total false reality total false reality immersion

639
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
A true

640
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:32,960
Matrix system being built this is still no different than his show

641
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,264
That's the same picture supposed to be like

642
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,568
The Journey of recent Wars

643
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,592
And it's just

644
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,920
Bland Infowars content while Alex is haiku

645
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,456
Right

646
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,272
It's Infowars Outdoors

647
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
Lacentre

648
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,344
Infowars

649
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
Just walk

650
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,160
He's not being emotional he's not

651
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:58,560
There's no entertainment value they're certainly not boring man walking

652
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,584
That is pretty

653
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,424
The Dismount if you thought all this was underwhelming

654
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,216
Wait till you hear the punchline of this thing

655
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
Okay

656
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,544
Without being asserted to The Matrix parts of radio

657
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,592
Then TV becomes the center of the household

658
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:14,176
Piedmont dinner around it down to talking to Grandma and Grandpa on your neighbors and

659
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:18,784
Reading books you not watch TV that's desktop computers at $10 computers

660
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,832
But it's VR goggles and Google glasses

661
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,904
Linchpin forcing you into that system to use it to work

662
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,952
Be able to even do basic business

663
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,256
Because that's what all the major companies are in demand

664
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,584
And then if you don't behave and operate where they want your basically even

665
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
Blocked out of that system

666
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,936
Don't take the poison shots

667
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,472
How you're locked out of

668
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,056
Sending over and over again all of it is used

669
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,336
Control you not to empower

670
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,128
It's evil from the beginning gets it

671
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
It's a snare

672
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,624
That's beyond walks up to his house

673
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,928
Towards the azaleas backdoor

674
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,488
Now that was a real soft

675
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,280
I found that to be

676
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,584
Intensely underwhelming and I

677
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,120
Think what it was was just like

678
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,424
Alex didn't want to do a second take

679
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,520
And in the moment he couldn't think of a good pun

680
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
Might as well just ended

681
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,592
Walk towards

682
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:22,016
I do like those at the progression to The Matrix is from Radio to television Witcher 2 platforms that Alex has shows on

683
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,296
Alta computers and handheld

684
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,064
Computers Ocala

685
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,416
What is used extensively to further his career for a Google glasses

686
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:33,536
My point is that if history is Prelude and Alex would be more than happy to use VR platforms

687
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,560
So we could make a buck on

688
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:40,704
Also Alex probably couldn't have come up with a worse example of the tech enslavement plan than Google glasses

689
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:44,032
Google Glass was launched in 2013

690
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,568
No one liked it and almost

691
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:49,664
No one uses them outside of some pretty nice applications in the medical and surgical field

692
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:53,504
Alice is using this example because it's the image of

693
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,528
Kind of spooky

694
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:59,392
Like the man is going to force you to wear these VR goggles or whatever but in the real world Google released

695
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,440
Pretty impressive glasses base product

696
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,720
8 years ago

697
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,024
And no one's been forced to use them and it doesn't

698
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,792
Matter

699
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:12,448
There probably is some exciting applications that certain Fields will be able to explore the stuff that grows out of Google Glass in VR

700
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
Capabilities

701
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,800
But I just think it's kind of ridiculous to assume anything Alex's predict

702
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,592
Has any connection to reality

703
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,384
You imagine how

704
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,760
Expensive and prohibitively time-consuming it would be for an evil government to make everyone wear VR goggles

705
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:29,344
I know the people are freaked out about the idea of like you know

706
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,416
In that Mehta the Facebook commercial

707
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,976
VR for meetings at work

708
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:40,864
But like I'm somebody who works in plenty of offices I know that a lot of bosses can't even figure out how to navigate a conference

709
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,216
Call so I just can't see how VR4 meetings will ever be anything that can catch on

710
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,776
It's an added thing that's kind of cute

711
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,336
But it doesn't really add much to improve the ability of most

712
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,128
Businesses to carry out their business

713
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,432
Possible things that can go wrong

714
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:59,040
So it's not in there it would be dumb thing for most businesses to do

715
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,320
And also

716
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,600
Like this idea of

717
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,416
Enslavement and s*** like that or whatever like

718
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,696
We've had

719
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,976
World of Warcraft

720
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,280
We had second life

721
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,608
Like we had this stuff for a while

722
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,144
Where you can meet up with p

723
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,240
People in a virtual space we've had role playing games for a long time

724
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,032
Yeah it's not

725
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,592
People out about the like

726
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:27,968
The idea of Facebook having those

727
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,760
Probably going to be something that

728
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,576
I don't think it's going to work

729
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
The way the

730
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,624
He's afraid it is right

731
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,392
Bike

732
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,952
Facebook rolled out Facebook Marketplace

733
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:42,304
And like you could have been like oh my God this is going to take over for literally everything you can own

734
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,096
Buy and sell through Facebook

735
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,120
What is a

736
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
Gothic

737
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:51,776
What VR the casino losing with open Facebook yeah maybe it'll have application

738
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,056
Sims 4 it's small

739
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,872
Subsets of people are really annoying bosses

740
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,920
That might be about it

741
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,944
This is this

742
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,248
Skip back to

743
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,272
Bye

744
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,832
Hilarity how stupid I think

745
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,648
Fake people are like Millennials are doing stupid stuff

746
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
It's it's

747
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,440
The exact same thing

748
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,464
We're old now

749
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
World

750
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,536
What we do

751
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:16,608
It's not going to influence the future

752
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
And his his

753
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,912
Arguments are like

754
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:25,312
Old man grandpa being like I used to have with TV used to turn off at 2 in the morning like a f****** care

755
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:29,152
What matters if you want to talk about what the future is going to do

756
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,688
Is what the Next Generation

757
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,712
He's going to do what the Young

758
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,480
Your people are going

759
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:38,880
Are so f****** impenetrable people just keep saying Millennials are ruining wine or something

760
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,952
I don't even know what this sixteen-year-old is doing

761
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:47,072
That they're confusing but

762
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,352
Same time I think

763
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,424
That past Generations were as confused by

764
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,704
If the generation below them

765
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,728
It's just

766
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,008
Maybe

767
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,568
It was easier to create account

768
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,616
Show me this is a

769
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,408
Is particularly difficult to character

770
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,712
Mature generation that is

771
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504
Which is

772
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
Is my point

773
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,552
How much

774
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,576
They are like the

775
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:12,160
The future's going to be this in Facebook is going to be bad and all this stuff

776
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,464
If you look at the numbers of what like

777
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
Teams are doing

778
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,280
Facebook has nothing to

779
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,072
Like Facebook's going away

780
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,096
Like that's

781
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,144
The type of s*** that if you need to pay attention

782
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,936
What's going to be the future

783
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,728
What are those kids doing

784
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:31,104
Facebook is predominantly dominated by like Ben Shapiro links and

785
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:36,992
Yeah I would agree with that so we should be afraid of Tik-Tok

786
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,552
I work well for Alex goes like

787
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,392
China or something doesn't even know

788
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
Get to work

789
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:50,560
So I just think this is rambling nonsense this video is about topics that Alex talks about all the time already

790
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:54,144
There's no reason to start up a new company at least for my

791
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,424
Content standpoint

792
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,752
Which Weasley strongly suspicious is a business reorganization

793
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
Situation

794
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:05,920
The fact this website is presented by a totally new delaware-based LLC Incorporated

795
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,248
Badly

796
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,040
Strongly think that's

797
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:11,808
What's going on here

798
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:15,136
It would be a little bit like if Enron was like we get it

799
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:21,536
We're sorry and then they started a new company called totally 100% not and Ron we are

800
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,352
Totally not Penrod

801
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:29,216
Not us guys anyway this new reset Wars doesn't look like it's anything different

802
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,240
From the norm so it

803
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,032
It's just weird that it's being mentioned

804
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,056
Prominently

805
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:37,664
It is video like earlier that was supposed to be Alex's statement about the news that he was supposed

806
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,456
Peter by the January 6th committee

807
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:45,344
I won't hold it against you if you forgot that's what we were talking about before we got sidetracked by recently

808
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,488
Let's dive back into the response video where we left off

809
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,512
It really quickly

810
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:56,352
Let's listen to the end of the clip we heard before we jumped off into reset Wars

811
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,912
Just to see how stupid it sounds now

812
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
It's time to reset

813
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,544
Diligently

814
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
Reset War

815
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,616
Really is

816
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,664
Defeating all of the

817
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:16,832
Alex expects his audience to believe that he's been working diligently for months on a project where the only explanation for what it is

818
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,136
Exactly like regular Infowars

819
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,672
Put some new age music behind it

820
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:23,744
The website is just contact info Gathering form

821
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,536
For the business that runs the website

822
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,816
Was formed a week ago

823
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,864
Jiffy Lube a really hard

824
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,192
Possibly impossible sales pitch but Alex is cultivated

825
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,472
Very gullible list

826
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,008
Cerveza it's probably going to be fine

827
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:40,896
I think about possible ways this could be going and there's a couple of options that may be going on I think

828
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,712
The first is that Alex knows he's going to be f*****

829
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:48,064
In the Sandy Hook case is in probably is going to lose all his money and enforces going to go bankrupt

830
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,368
So before the ship sinks he starts another busy

831
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,136
Incorporated

832
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,184
The state where creditors can't come after your business

833
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,208
For personal stats

834
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,048
Which would allow him to essentially continue doing Infowars as if nothing had happened

835
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:58,816
Just as

836
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,840
Recent Wars

837
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
Instead

838
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,144
The problem there would come down

839
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,776
Funding with his new company but there's a lot of ways I could be handled in because of the Delaware LLC

840
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,336
Who make the assets of this new company much more difficult

841
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,104
The collect on

842
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,408
So if you were to I don't know

843
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,944
Get

844
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,576
Does big sponsor for reset Wars run by this different company

845
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,112
That would be a way that he could

846
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
Continue on

847
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,928
Yeah so weird how all of these

848
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,464
Is laws and structures

849
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
Specific and

850
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,024
Endemic to Delaware

851
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
It's almost

852
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,096
I mean it's almost like there is a specific

853
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,656
Coordinated effort with banks and politician

854
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:37,216
Things with in Delaware to create a tax Haven like that

855
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,520
That's good thing one of them is our

856
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,360
Yeah there is still a mechanism by which

857
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,432
Delaware LLC scam has assets

858
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
Take

859
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,992
Looking for personal debts it's just

860
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,784
Immensely more complicated

861
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
Difficult

862
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,344
Could happen

863
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,672
So we get back to this response video for Alex's

864
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:59,488
Is January 6th

865
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,768
Committee subpoena

866
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,048
This is what

867
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,584
What the hell is going on here

868
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,608
I feel good

869
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,656
Whatever happens

870
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,424
Jamir whatever have

871
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,496
That

872
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:12,800
The organization

873
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
Separately

874
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,384

Information

884
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,816
I was going to come out about

885
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
12 days

886
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,912
With the first

887
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,240
Mindwar Spirit War

888
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
What

889
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,312
Because of this all going down happen

890
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:48,128
Earlier and

891
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:48,896
Believe me

892
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
They know

893
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,456
The Edition

894
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,736
Comes out and

895
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:55,808
Scream over

896
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,576
It's game over

897
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:00,672
Calling it by indoors as if it's something different like

898
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:04,256
His bumper is Infowars there's a war on for your mind

899
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:11,680
Where can I have to see what ends up happening here but I would guess that this is a six-hour course Alex is talking about his

900
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:15,520
Just a sloppily thrown-together documentary type of thing that's meant to raise

901
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,288
Meant for this new web

902
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:22,944
Nothing about Alex and how he operates leads me to believe that he's just put together a 6-hour comprehensive class on how did the

903
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,712
Globalist

904
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:26,784
Would you going to give away for free and then bow out of public life

905
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,088
That's completely unbelievable

906
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:33,952
Either way though I really cannot wait to dig into this course once of The Middle

907
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,488
I think this is going to be

908
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,048
I really thought I am going to

909
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,328
I'm going to go with the

910
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,608
The course will never be over

911
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,912
That's my that's my feeling

912
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:47,264
His his immediate in the announcement of this project is like

913
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,544
Now it might not become

914
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:54,687
Meant to release it in 10 days from the Snowman

915
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:57,759
We're going to come

916
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:02,879
There are other outside organizations that will make sure that the recent War goes on

917
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,999
I want the money I want them getting in their battle.

918
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:14,399
I'll be I'll be in for that I get billed wire together

919
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
Salad Alex

920
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,751
Put build water at his breeches

921
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,055
Houses being attacked

922
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,079
Cuz he's a patriot

923
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,127
I guess that has something to do with

924
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:24,895
Subpoena

925
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,223
Hard-working page

926
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,247
But I'm telling you

927
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,271
The fact that

928
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,551
Boston

929
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,575
Information on quantum

930
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,599
Physics

931
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,879
What

932
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,415
Observation

933
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,439
Principal

934
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
All of us

935
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,375
Just Wynn

936
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,935
Evil comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord

937
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:51,775
Dworsky

938
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,055
That

939
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,383
Oh boy wow wow

940
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,175
It's it's almost like

941
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:01,503
They're the tip of the spear wow

942
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
Similar

943
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,599
Where the bulwark against evil

944
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,391
Quantum physics

945
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,439
And the observation principle half

946
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,975
To do with why Alex

947
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,255
Has been successful

948
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,303
Haven't you seen the quantum physics

949
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,071
I would like

950
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,375
Him to elaborate on that okay so

951
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:21,471
Electrons we know them as particles are there more like probability

952
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:27,871
Filled right because when you observe them you alter their behavior you're not really absorb

953
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:31,711
Really honestly they're just kind of a small weak electromagnetic field

954
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,991
And because of that

955
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,015
Alright

956
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,319
Yeah yeah then the Lord

957
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:39,647
Has to bypass electromagnetic

958
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,439
In order to raise a bulwark

959
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,975
Against the metaverse

960
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,047
Which functions entirely based on observation

961
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,863
Light passing through two slits

962
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,167
And then sometimes it's on the wrong one

963
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,703
Atkins Iowa

964
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,519
And recent Wars

965
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:08,831
So you know why my battle against the European Banks

966
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,367
Do with quantum mechanics

967
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:13,951
Absolutely

968
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,255
Because we're all good we're actually all

969
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:21,119
I think he might be listening to too much of that pure moods music

970
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,423
Could be difficult

971
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,983
So here's the Dismount from this video

972
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,519
God bless you all

973
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,799
And hopefully we've got

974
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,079
Broadcast

975
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,103
But if I get a ray

976
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,663
My test

977
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,735
Dot-com

978
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:37,759
I leave it to you

979
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,527
You asked you take

980
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:42,879
I know you're

981
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,207
But I really want

982
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,231
You to sit back

983
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,511
Cogitate

984
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:49,791
Meditate

985
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,583
On the fact that

986
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
Those of you that

987
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:54,655
My broadcast

988
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,007
Now

989
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
As

990
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,055
21

Parisienne

992
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,479
You realize how

993
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,527
Active

994
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,831
The tip of the spear

995
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,623
The very

996
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,647
Brookline 45

997
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,719
And we

998
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,047
All figures

999
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,327
Donate

1000

Infowars store

1005
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,799
Right now we've got

1006
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,567
Kirbopher

1007
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,359
10 hour cleaners

1008
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,687
The end of this videos

1009
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:45,087
Leather commercial but it also is a commercial that seems to invalidate the point of what we had just heard

1010
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,623
Thinking that

1011
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,183
Because if the Testament of his

1012
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:49,951
Life's work

1013
00:45:54,559 --> 00:46:00,447
Why isn't he mentioned it was recorded before they had two emergency launch

1014
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:07,103
I would assume

1015
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:12,479
So this is remarkable like this is supposed to be responsible to go to the news that he gots

1016
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:15,039
Peanut any barely touches on that issue

1017
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:21,695
Basically six-minute long promotional video for reset Wars with a title that leads you to believe it's going to have something to do with the

1018
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,463
Subpoena

1019
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:24,255
Which is disappointing in a little quick baby

1020
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,279
And yet

1021
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:28,351
Exactly what his genuine response

1022
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,143
To The subpoena would be

1023
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,423
And is

1024
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,983
It's fine it's interesting that this is

1025
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:34,751
Almost

1026
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:38,847
It's spiritually accurate what his January 6th

1027
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,871
Got the title is

1028
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,687
But if not

1029
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:52,159
Another video that came out was making the rounds on Twitter Alex recorded himself in his backyard while a truck was backing up

1030
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,719
In the background

1031
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,023
Are you saying that he's likely going to plead the Fifth

1032
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,303
For the

1033
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,583
Which you

1034
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:00,863
You can do that

1035
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:06,495
Lowe's outside America the fifth amendment allows people to refuse to testify and situation

1036
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,311
Where they feel like doing so would be self-incriminating

1037
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,383
Essentially the policy is that you can't be forced

1038
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,919
To be a witness against yourself

1039
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:20,831
There's an upside to this pleading the fifth and that you can remain silent and juries are instructed to not take your side

1040
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,111
Silence as an admission of

1041
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:22,879
They're not allowed

1042
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:26,719
On the other hand will you plead the fifth that usually means that everyone

1043
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:29,023
Knows you're guilty of something

1044
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:35,423
They're also downsides to the strategy for instance like if you plead the fifth you have no opportunity to defend yourself

1045
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:41,311
In Alex's case that would mean that all of his passwords that are very well-documented on his show

1046
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,847
Get to speak for him

1047
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,407
Without any chance for him to robot thing

1048
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,431
Provide context

1049
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,991
Text dad had a radio show where you

1050
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:52,063
Committed all the things that they say that you committed

1051
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:57,695
And you don't say that you didn't say them and it said your testimony is what you said from the past

1052
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,719
You're in trouble

1053
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,535
Is there is no serological

1054
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:06,911
Consider transcript of his show

1055
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:12,287
It also deprives Alex of the opportunity to grandstand and have his how dare you sir moment

1056
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,335
I think we all feel is kind of overdue

1057
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,871
Like some kind of a blow up in

1058
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,407
10 quart

1059
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:23,807
Going to go out with a whimper come on Alex 02 Concorde Ellison are you talkin about you're going to bleed

1060
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:28,671
The fifth this is your perfect opportunity to scream at Adam Schiff going down anyways

1061
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:31,999
Ask him about how Larry Nichols audio

1062
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,279
Text Colton I said

1063
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:39,679
You can blackmail Congress we've already seen it on his show can do it

1064
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:42,751
Also it's to understand that when you plead

1065
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:46,335
The 5th there's a requirement that the testimony you would be given would be

1066
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,359
Self-incriminate

1067
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:52,223
That doesn't necessarily have to me that you'd be guilty of the thing that the trial is about but

1068
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,295
The testifying about it would provide an essential

1069
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,319
Piece of evidence that

1070
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:58,879
Could be used to prosecute you for another crime

1071
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,183
I would guess this is what I was worried about him

1072
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,743
It'd be like if you're a witness

1073
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:06,047
To somebody's murder and you're like

1074
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:11,423
Hey listen I don't want to testify because the only reason reason I witness this murder was cuz I was committing a

1075
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,031
Completely different murder that you guys didn't catch me Albright

1076
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,383
I think all of this is kind of meaningless

1077
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,919
The committee wants to ask him

1078
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:27,551
Some questions because Alex was involved in the organizing of an event whether intentionally or not

1079
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
U.s. Kappa

1080
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:32,927
They are trying to set up perjury trap or even pursue criminal charges against Alex

1081
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,743
I mean that is the case does amplify Alex

1082
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,303
Is persecution complex he's playing it up quite a bit

1083
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,583
Bennigan's

1084
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,911
Steve Bannon was just arrested for contempt of congress after refusing

1085
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:43,679
Cooperate with

1086
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,447
Subpoena

1087
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,239
You didn't plead the fifth though

1088
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,031
But I'm sure ban into more important

1089
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,823
Investigative lengthen Alex

1090
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,591
It's hard to say

1091
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,895
I don't know if they would charge Alex of Kentucky

1092
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,175
Pecan recipe

1093
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:56,479
I thought they wouldn't I mean

1094
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,015
If he's

1095
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
Don't charge

1096
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,319
Him with

1097
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,855
Congress unless

1098
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,879
You're going

1099
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,903
Me to do

1100
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:07,231
You know sure otherwise you've just given him another

1101
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,255
A couple of weeks

1102
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,047
The grandstand about how can

1103
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:10,815
Chris is corrupt

1104
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:15,167
Do you know he'll ban in contempt and then it was like 3 Days Later returns

1105
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:15,935
Themself in

1106
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,471
You don't want to do any of that s***

1107
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,263
If you're going to do that to Alex

1108
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,847
He shows up in Congress and your life contempt and then you put them in jail

1109
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,151
100 questions

1110
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,687
And Amber

1111
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:30,783
It's it's

1112
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:35,135
Kind of interesting and exciting news the idea that he got subpoenaed

1113
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:35,903
But

1114
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,463
I think that this is going to be a disappointing

1115
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,255
What chapter in the book

1116
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,815
We're all going to be like oh the Alex part of this

1117
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:49,215
This is a dud I think there's a lot of big stuff going on and then you get Alex in there and I think they're getting Malik's mainly cuz they wanted

1118
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:50,239
Try and get Rodger Stone

1119
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,031
Well I don't know if that's

1120
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,823
Necessarily the case because Alex

1121
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
Did

1122
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,615
Promote

1123
00:50:55,871 --> 00:51:02,015
The federales a lot and stop Bastille

1124
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,807
Constantly in the lead-up

1125
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
He was

1126
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,879
Going on a road trip

1127
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,415
With Allie Alexander

1128
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:12,767
I think there are enough things that actually involve Alex

1129
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,535
Himself

1130
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,559
That

1131
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:20,191
Relevant asked questions about time a lot of those things dude

1132
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:23,263
Weave into issues with Rodger

1133
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,567
I like his involvement with stop the steel

1134
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,127
Who knows

1135
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:34,527
At the end of the day if you're going after a weasel out of all the people that are are put there you've already

1136
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,063
You got one that's already

1137
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,599
Supposed to be in jail

1138
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,671
You've got OJ

1139
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,207
Jesus Christ

1140
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:45,279
So we get to now the beginning of the actual show

1141
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,815
Mon November 23rd

1142
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,607
And you would think that these

1143
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,399
Subpoena is a top story

1144
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,495
A lot

1145
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,079
26

1146
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,455
National team

1147
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:11,903
Rodger Stone

1148
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,207
That's not our top story

1149
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:19,839
Ladies and gentlemen it's the fact the globalist are gearing up to launch new bio-weapon attacks on us

1150
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:24,447
Are establishing un1 martial law

1151
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:27,007
Launched this attack

1152
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:31,359
I don't know how else to say this but the subpoenas definitely are your top story

1153
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:35,967
The fear of you and Marshall are right around the corner has been the top story for 20 f****** years

1154
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,735
Stale

1155
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,039
Top story

1156
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,831
I mean if I'm

1157
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:44,415
If I'm a fan of Infowars and Alex says that I go cut

1158
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,951
And then we I keep Drive

1159
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:53,887
Mentions you in the top story listen I'm actually a very modest man and

1160
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:56,959
I don't like to talk about myself I want an able

1161
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:01,567
What what I've only talked about that I don't want to incriminate myself I don't want to talk about it asked

1162
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:04,383
Some case against me when would I have ever done that

1163
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:10,527
Anyway Alex's is going to talk about

1164
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,063
Axiom's of course

1165
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:13,855
In Union

1166
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:17,183
Germany

1167
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,207
Austin Jackson

1168
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,559
When the cupboard 19 genetically engineered bio-weapon

1169
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,775
He's going to start killing people

1170
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:39,455
That's a good save on Alex's Bart realizing the Civil War

1171
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,807
Hey if the Germans fight

1172
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,599
Anything Could Happen

1173
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:49,695
Chirp so the EU hasn't made vaccines mandatory

1174
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:54,303
I think Alex is just exaggerating the situation in Austria is what's going on everywhere

1175
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:59,935
Austria just announced recently the vaccines will be mandatory and that the country is in lockdown

1176
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:00,703
20 days

1177
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,751
But you have to understand why

1178
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:06,847
On October 1st the country had about 1,800 new Kovac

1179
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:10,431
By November 1st it was over 4,600 new case

1180
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,991
November 24th

1181
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,271
On that day they reported

1182
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:17,087
14139 new cases

1183
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:17,855
That's not good

1184
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:18,623
No

1185
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:23,487
S*** is out of control there and their government feels the DraStic action is necessary to

1186
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,511
Do to stop this

1187
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,279
The Surge

1188
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,839
I agree with that decision or don't

1189
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:29,631
That's fine but it's not appropriate

1190
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:33,215
This is the entirety of the EU making this mandate

1191
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:33,983
Go to the force

1192
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,007
Bloody Civil War

1193
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,287
Childish and stupid

1194
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:43,199
Particularly because a bunch of country is already mandatory made vaccines mandatory and they haven't found them so

1195
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:43,967
Dogs in the Civil War

1196
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:47,807
Indonesia made the decision in February Micronesia did in

1197
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,575
In July

1198
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:53,183
Tons of other countries have narrow mandates like government employees are healthcare workers

1199
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,487
It's not causing a civil war

1200
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:56,767
So

1201
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,303
But oh well

1202
00:54:59,071 --> 00:54:59,583
I mean

1203
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,607
No

1204
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,375
What is

1205
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,143
The Civil War

1206
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:02,911
Sure

1207
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,031
That's what I've got for you

1208
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,311
That's all I've got

1209
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,359
That's what you that's why I'm here

1210
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,383
I guess

1211
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,151
Batgirl

1212
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:17,503
I guess that is is appropriate question it is much as like

1213
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,807
What's the scale

1214
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,111
Does it have to be brother shooting brother

1215
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,719
You know you want to call America in the cold

1216
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,999
Civil War

1217
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,279
Heavy tension

1218
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,303
Yes have

1219
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,887
Is a great way to say I would not call this in anyway is Civil War

1220
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,935
It's a little bit of exaggeration

1221
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,751
You'd run by Germany

1222
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:45,919
German government says prepare for forced inoculations no one will be allowed to watch in your house if you don't

1223
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:51,295
German government didn't say the vaccines are going to become mandatory

1224
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,831
Are there Health minister

1225
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,879
Spawn actually made some really

1226
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:57,695
Depressing comments but Alex is just taken out of context

1227
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:02,303
Reflecting the fact that they've seen a 50% increase in new cases week-over-week

1228
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,583
He said quote

1229
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:08,959
By the end of this winter pretty much everyone in Germany will have been vaccinated recovered or died

1230
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:12,031
This isn't that everyone will be back

1231
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:17,663
It's a grim perspective that he believes that given the rates of new cases and a low rate of vaccination

1232
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:23,295
There's a good chance that by the end of the winter everyone will either have been vaccinated or will of God

1233
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,855
And that's some of the folks in the latter group will be dead

1234
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:31,487
Some politicians in Germany have called for vaccine mandates but as recently as November 22nd

1235
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,791
Angela merkel's spokesperson quote

1236
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:36,351
Made clear that her government had no plans

1237
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,887
The tackle the thorny issue of Acts

1238
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,655
C mandates

1239
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:42,239
It's almost as if the actual people in German government or saying the

1240
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,263
What's the things for my dad

1241
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,287
Claiming that they're saying

1242
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,615
And all these really doing is misrepresenting headlines and

1243
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,151
Man does that

1244
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,943
But he does

1245
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,223
Can't believe

1246
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,527
That what a sad day for a health

1247
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:57,343
Just to walk up and be like man

1248
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,623
This is

1249
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,903
Fox haha

1250
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,695
Sad

1251
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,463
Alright

1252
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,255
The end of press conference

1253
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,583
Yeah just going up there in front of Mike

1254
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,399
Is a real bummer groom

1255
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,447
S*** man

1256
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,471
So Alex

1257
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,007
Wasn't going to

1258
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:15,775
Talk about this

1259
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,311
Subpoenas but then of course he does

1260
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,647
And their subpoenas coming in all the rest of it

1261
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:34,975
Just Department

1262
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:37,279
Subpoenaing instantaneous ladders

1263
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,839
It's dealing with it with the lawyers and

1264
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:40,863
My Acosta

1265
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:54,687
Dudes and guys

1266
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,735
Thought you weren't going to talk about

1267
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:04,415
It's just going to let it be your main stories of un takeover

1268
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,207
But also it's mainly because

1269
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,791
Anti his personal

1270
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:12,607
Issues the world is ending but also it's mainly that I'm Blue

1271
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:17,727
That's what's interesting is recently we heard him say we're all already dead

1272
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,519
Right yeah

1273
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:23,103
When he was in a particularly bad mood cuz he lost some cases

1274
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,663
Some cases do we were all going to die I'm going to die

1275
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,943
I wonder where he's at now

1276
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,991
We're good American

1277
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:34,623
Understanding that discretion is the greater part of valor

1278
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:38,207
Were the poison shots in the rest of it is really

1279
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:41,023
Pushing towards the physical confrontation because

1280
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,815
They're losing

1281
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:45,631
Political war for hearts and Minds we're winning

1282
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,399
Big time

1283
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:51,007
The football game where in the fourth quarter and were like 60 points at

1284
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:53,823
Only

1285
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,271
Dave lost

1286
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:08,671
I thought that you'd already lost weird world that you are trying to force me to live in

1287
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:15,071
Yeah I thought it said one and even if the Patriots win their still going to like Nuke cities

1288
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:17,887
Super bio-weapon and then you're going to have to dig out

1289
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:18,911
People from

1290
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:23,263
Their underground bunkers and so self-reliant

1291
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:29,663
Then you're hunting all of this stuff has a bug out plan

1292
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:32,735
People

1293
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:33,759
Define Hast

1294
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:34,527
Sure

1295
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,319
Yeah I think

1296
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,855
What we're seeing is

1297
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:38,879
Alex

1298
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,927
Cuz maybe a little bit manic because

1299
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:43,743
The excitement of starting

1300
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:50,143
Believe

1301
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:53,471
I don't know maybe maybe he's finally reach that point of

1302
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,239
Acceptance

1303
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,263
Do you know where it's like

1304
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,311
I finally got it

1305
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,591
For me

1306
00:59:59,359 --> 00:59:59,871
This war is

1307
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,687
So all I'm going to do is ride it out

1308
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,967
2bn do you know

1309
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,527
No he's going to abandon the ship like a ray

1310
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:17,023
All along all right

1311
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,167
Engine

1312
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:27,263
So dumb

1313
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,311
You can track his mood

1314
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:32,127
Pretty generally We Lay this point a bit but really

1315
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:32,895
Howard Hughes

1316
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,175
Interpreting

1317
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,455
The Altima

1318
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,479
Outcome for Humana

1319
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,271
How how Alex Goes

1320
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,295
So goes the rest

1321
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,087
As it is

1322
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,647
Maybe excited

1323
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:46,463
Thought he's found a way to wiggle out of this stuff

1324
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,487
Also

1325
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:54,655
It could not be more transparent to that's the saddest part he really does think he's being super clever and it's hitting this very well

1326
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:58,751
I don't think she's hiding it I think it's how he experiences

1327
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:01,055
Even know if it's conscious for him

1328
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:05,151
That when he's in a bad mood to go ballistic on a weigh-in

1329
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:11,551
Feeling a little bit to work out now all of a sudden they were up 620 and then

1330
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,575
The 4th quarter

01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,391
Dumbass

1333
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,183
Anyway Alex is a lot of news

1334
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,463
But

1335
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,743
Might not be able to get

1336
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:23,071
So many incredible articles for today

1337
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:26,143
So much and I sit here before I go live on air

1338
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,215

America sell racially-divided

1371
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:06,239
Will burn up and be over

Topsail mountaintops in the hilltops in the valley

1373

China on four of the six big production houses that if you go look at who

1377
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,095
Bratz movies

Apple shows in all the TV shows and programs

1379
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,727
The Communist Chinese regime

1380
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:44,383
Which is the most homogeneous group of people in the world

1381
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,919
Weather

1382
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,967
WhatsApp

1383
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,319
Most of you decide you want to stay Who You Are

1384
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,087
What

1385
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,719
Chinese

1386
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:08,191
Billions a week

1387
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,727

Cool boy

Sup to this Breitbart article the most important article

1391
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:22,015
Weather when a little bit on a Jag there

1392
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,063
What is a boring yarn for Alex

1393
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:27,135
I really hate to hear that this is the most important topic to cover

1394
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:33,535
Are you going to be done this ramp many times like when any commercial features a family where the parents aren't the same race and that's apparent

1395
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,559
Ally propaganda again

1396
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,327
White people

1397
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,863
Like we've we've heard this

1398
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:37,887
Too many times

1399
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:45,567
Tearzah is he still talking about the same Chinese billionaire trying to buy like A1

1400
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,615
Content of a studio and that's why

1401
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,383
China owns

1402
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,687
All of the major

1403
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:54,783
It's more like just that same talking to repackage

1404
01:04:55,039 --> 01:05:01,183
It's interesting that he never actually says which movie houses are owned by the tiny

1405
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:05,279
Feels like China owns the movie studios

1406
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:08,607
But that's just because of gigantic part of the current box office comes

1407
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,631
A movie ticket sales

1408
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,399
In China

1409
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:15,007
And if you have a movie with Ghanta the China doesn't like your movie might not be allowed to be

1410
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:17,567
He played in China thereby limiting your earning

1411
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,335
Potential

1412
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,103
It sucks

1413
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:19,871
And I'm against it

1414
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:23,967
But exerting that kind of influence isn't the same thing as owning movie studios

1415
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:26,783
If you want to make content that would be offensive

1416
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,807
Trying to get still kinda

1417
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,599
Maybe you'll make less money

1418
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,135
International box

1419
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:34,207
I'm just freaked out by I listen I don't have anything yet

1420
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,487
Keep being Chinese

1421
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:40,607
If you want to be Chinese or whatever and all I'm hearing is him saying that is fentanyl the racist ass dragon

1422
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,959
And then you're telling me that China is the oldest culture in the world

1423
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:46,751
You're not supposed to believe that

1424
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:51,615
What's it supposed to be supposed to believe that the West has the oldest culture in that everything came from

1425
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:53,663
I don't know I think

1426
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:56,735
He can he can believe that something's predate

1427
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:00,831
But everything that's important like freedom and liberty and books

1428
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,111
And

1429
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:06,463
All that stuff is out of the way alright okay so we can accept

1430
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:08,511
Babylon but we can't allow okay

1431
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:13,375
Accept the things were around before but they were bad

1432
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,655
That's right yeah

1433
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:18,239
Nevermind so here's where this whole thing with the article comes

1434
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:22,591
This was a Breitbart article from November 22nd with the headline

1435
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:25,407
China Kyle Rittenhouse proves US democracy

1436
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,175
Chrissy has failed

1437
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:30,527
That's a flashy headline and its reporting on an op-ed there was published

1438
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,551
In the global times

1439
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:35,135
The actual original headline is quote Rittenhouse case

1440
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,439
Exposes illness of us political system

1441
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:41,535
The part about us democracy failing was taken from this setting

1442
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,071
Unsend the text of the original article

1443
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:43,839
Quote

1444
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:50,239
The Fallout from the not-guilty verdict in the jury trial exposes that the Democratic political system in the United States is fake

1445
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,263
He'll be quote

1446
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:54,847
Illness of social polarization and race racial diversity

1447
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,895
Said Chinese experts

1448
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:57,919
On Sunday

1449
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:03,551
The commentary is not the US democracy has failed as the Breitbart headline implies and Alex is covering

1450
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:09,439
US democracy has failed to heal this particular social ill and I think that's pretty self-evident

1451
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:14,303
I think Alex is pretty good proof of that actually

1452
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,119
What says Chinese officials who study water

1453
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:23,519
So there's an operating a Chinese Outlet which was reported on by britebar with an intentionally mislead

1454
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,543
Eating headline added

1455
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:28,383
And now Alex is just going to riff-off what do you assume this article is based on

1456
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,151
Breitbart

1457
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,431
A headline is

1458
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:32,735
The stupid game of California couldn't be more meaningless

1459
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:36,319
If this is the most important story that he is basing

1460
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:41,951
Hours of research and being up at 5 in the morning for you made his daughter this giant breakfast

1461
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:44,767
How long it took me to get to the bottom of this house

1462
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,815
10 minutes 10 minutes

1463
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:53,983
Seems to lost the original source

1464
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,775
Global Times article

1465
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:59,103
Massive difference in the point of these

1466
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,127
These two

1467
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,663
Wonder wonder about that

1468
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,711
There's nothing I love more than

1469
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:07,039
Taking out one chunk of a sentence and calling that your head

1470
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:11,647
Doesn't it it's not there's just nothing better than ending a

1471
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:14,463
Ending the headline with a f******

1472
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:17,535
Adjectives that going to describe the next part of

1473
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,327
Yeah

1474
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:24,703
So Alex believes that based on this Breitbart article to Total evidence that they believe

1475
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:26,239
US democracy has failed

1476
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,775
And they're just taunting

1477
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,543
The West

1478
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,823
North America

1479
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,871
Capitalist or whatever share

1480
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:34,431
Are going to team up

1481
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,967
Do takedown America

1482
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,759
And

1483
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:40,319
But he but here's what's going to happen before that all right

1484
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:44,159
America in the end of the country

1485
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:50,559
The justice department

1486
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:56,959
Trump and get Alex Jones

1487
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:01,055
You'll be a real boy

1488
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:01,823
Noah

1489
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:05,663
Always get rid of the Never

1490
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,687
Leave you in place

1491
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:10,015
I know after you guys brought the country now

1492
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,063
What's one last time to join the global

1493
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:12,831
I know that

1494
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,951
Did we lose it all

1495
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,191
All of us

1496
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,727
What

1497
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:30,751
Yeah

1498
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:36,895
What your Outburst was really one of my main points I thought they were winning

1499
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:42,783
What are they going to take to take down the country and then kill Alex because he wants to go to Exile

1500
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,063
What the f***

1501
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,111
What are we where is where is this all going

1502
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,135
Nowhere

1503
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,183
Fast

1504
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,487
Galaxy

1505
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:56,863
Is maybe a little over stimulated

1506
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,887
And is

1507
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:04,031
Give me one last chance to say no I would rather go live in Exile

1508
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:09,919
They're going to be like okay cool but then they're going to kill me right you guys are stupid cuz you don't know that you don't know how that's how this works

1509
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:10,943
If if

1510
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:16,831
This is the result of him taking a bunch of rainforest I think we know the next hour there's going to be a pretty significant

1511
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,111
Sure maybe

1512
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,135
Dialysis

1513
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,159
Honor

1514
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,439
That he's being attacked

1515
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:23,231
Stop until AIDS

1516
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:23,999
Decided

1517
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,023
He's going to play the

1518
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,359
Check on the evil

1519
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:45,503
Want to be energetic Lee spiritually

1520
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:48,063
Anyway

1521
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,879
What how like internal inconsistent that is

1522
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:54,207
I got to be under attack I'm going to

1523
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:57,023
Fight these motherfukers but also I'm going to plead the Fifth

1524
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,839
If you really wanted to

1525
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:04,191
And you do yourself to be innocent you should go to the court and a

1526
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,727
Put them on trial

1527
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:06,751
Remember

1528
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,031
This

1529
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,103
Hisar saint crispin's day

1530
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,407
We happy few

1531
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:21,855
The 300 at Thermopylae I just deciding

1532
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:25,951
We were right so we're not even going to fight his battle

1533
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:28,767
Scott

1534
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:35,167
You going to fight we've already defeated you in the war of words Xerxes we've defeated you in the Battle of ideas

1535
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,447
Come on

1536
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:40,287
Answer our letters before you fight us

1537
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:41,567
Boo

1538
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,335
Boo

1539
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,103
Boo

1540
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,127
Do something else

1541
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,455
Say boo to its episode

1542
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:51,295
It's just Alex and Paul Joseph Watson discussing the walk

1543
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,063
Peshawar attack

1544
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:55,391
And it's just kind of an attempt to nail down a narrative

1545
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:58,207
That the accused driver Darrell Brooks is he black

1546
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:04,351
Supremacist associated with black lives matter killing white people in retaliation for the written

1547
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,375
Nice word exhausting

1548
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,423
I don't know exact

1549
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:11,775
Really what is going to come out about this and I'm not going to engage with their

1550
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:12,543
Attempt

1551
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,079
To sort of

1552
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,127
Mailed out a story that they can work with

1553
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,663
I don't know we'll see what happens

1554
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,687
Seen it too many times

1555
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,247
Deeply deeply racist

1556
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:24,831
Few things that I'm going to bring up

1557
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:25,599
From Pauls

1558
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,623
Appearance

1559
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,671
Interesting

1560
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,439
Here's the first

1561
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,231
And then you look at the New York

1562
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:33,791
The day after

1563
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,839
Play put it on paper

1564
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,375
22

1565
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,143
The news

1566
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:39,935
Can you imagine it

1567
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,983
A white supremacist

1568
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:44,543
Trailer black lives matter

1569
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:45,567
SUV

1570
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:49,919
Yes 5 people potentially more than 45 people

1571
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:56,063
Would that be on page 22 remember when they psycho inshot poor innocent black people in South

1572
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:00,415
Guilty

1573
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:03,231
No that was one crazy person the point is

1574
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:05,535
It's a bad person was there black white whatever

1575
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,607
So the times may not have put the Walker

1576
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:11,679
Waukesha story on the front page of the following

1577
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:14,239
Because of the developing story and there were limited details

1578
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:17,567
They did publish an online article that day about the event though

1579
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:19,359
On August 26th

1580
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,407
2020 the day after the

1581
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:25,247
Those people that also wasn't on the front page of the time

1582
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:28,831
I guess what the Charleston shooting that Alex brings up that happened on

1583
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:31,647
June 17th 2015 in the next day

1584
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,951
It also wasn't on the front page of the time

1585
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,743
Probably because

1586
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:39,071
Those are upsetting things and you don't want them to be the first thing people see

1587
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,863
I don't know

1588
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:43,167
It feels like they would be on the front the next

1589
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,447
Paper but

1590
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,727
It's like that off in Ark

1591
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:51,103
It feels like they are only on the front page when it's an anti-white story people like Alex

1592
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:57,503
Cuz they're white identity adherence and they've created their own reality to live in where everything is secretly an attack on white people

1593
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:03,135
Bring up stuff like that like what what about like when those patrols to shooting happened

1594
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,439
I know that was not yours

1595
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:07,487
Your invalidating your own point

1596
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:11,327
By bringing up that example about how every Harry Potter book

1597
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:13,375
Is released on the summer solstice Dan

1598
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,143
Right

1599
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,167
It makes sense

1600
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:18,239
Being stupid

1601
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:19,775
Dad

1602
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:23,615
Dylann roof

1603
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:28,223
Disappeared

1604
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:29,503
By the way Wikipedia

1605
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:32,063
Change the description

1606
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:34,111
Wakisha Christmas parade at

1607
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,415
The wakisha Christmas

1608
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,183
Parade

1609
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,463
Call crash

1610
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,535
It was just a car crash Alex maybe an accident

1611
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:46,399
So I don't know if Paul knows that literally anyone can change things on Wikipedia but they can

1612
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:51,263
Also the headline is now back to 2021 Waukesha Christmas parade attack

1613
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:56,383
It's amazing that Paul seems to be acting like Wikipedia's run by the mainstream Media or like

1614
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:59,711
We're going to be anointed to be able to change something

1615
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:06,111
He could have changed it just so he could say it's the same way you know anything

1616
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,391
Play pull from like 4chan

1617
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:11,743
Could be something that someone that works at in for making report on

1618
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,791
I'm not saying that they do but they definitely

1619
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:14,559
Only could

1620
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,583
Anybody could

1621
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:20,191
To change anything change things as a joke

1622
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:26,591
Oh man also part of the reason that we knew the whole thing was a with dylann roof a really fast is cuz he wrote a super races

1623
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,639
This Manifesto that explains exactly why

1624
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,663
He did what he was doing

1625
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:33,759
If this guy in Waukesha dritan a manifest I think it would make the determining the

1626
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:36,575
Precise motiva little bit easier people probably would have been able to

1627
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:37,343
Determine

1628
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,647
Another bad example

1629
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,207
Pedia is dumb

1630
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:45,279
Yeah and the things that I hate most about it

1631
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,815
Beyond ever

1632
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,607
Every single tragedy that were

1633
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,399
I'm talking about all the time

1634
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:53,727
Is that this is another opportunity for them and you can

1635
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:54,495
Can see them take it

1636
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,543
Dylann roof is a lone wolf actor

1637
01:15:57,055 --> 01:16:00,383
He's a loan guy they're all loan guys they're all loners

1638
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:03,711
And how did they find out about his Manifesto they probably wrote it

1639
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:04,991
Putting all that stuff in there not

1640
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,783
Accepting that it is an entire

1641
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,551
Ecosystem

1642
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:09,855
I'm sure that creates deal dylann roof

1643
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:11,135
Not a lone gunman

1644
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,159
No no

1645
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,951
Alexander park

1646
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:19,327
And Alex is trying to play this game or it's like I was against it listen to those episodes

1647
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,607
You were not

1648
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,375
Really again

1649
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:25,727
You was trying to profit off it and manipulate

1650
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,263
Perception around it

1651
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,031
The next

1652
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:28,799
Day

1653
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:35,199
He started his show saying if his guy really wanted to kill black people should have committed

1654
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:35,967
Doctor

1655
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:38,527
It's it's nonsense for him to

1656
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,551
Pretend Piggy

1657
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:43,135
Was traumatized or like was on the against

1658
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,927
Dylann roof in any meaningful way

1659
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,463
I totally such b*******

1660
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,743
But it's fun

1661
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,023
What are you just rewrite your own his

1662
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:52,095
5 / Fun and Profit

1663
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:54,399
Feel shame about how you're a monster

1664
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,447
That's not an option

1665
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,735
Decides

1666
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:09,759
I got to get Rodger

1667
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:11,551
Exclusive

1668
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:13,599
About this whole subpoena thing

1669
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,391
What's first go

1670
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,183
Rodger Stone

1671
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,975
Explosively to give us

1672
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:20,511
Video statement

1673
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:23,071
On where he stands what's really going on Rodger

1674
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:24,863
Be here with you

1675
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,215
We're not in trouble because we're bad

1676
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:33,311
The evil

1677
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:38,431
Blalock's you're absolutely right this is my first

1678
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,247
National statement and any medium

1679
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,015
Right here

1680
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:44,575
I didn't Forge just as in the hours at

1681
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,599
After I was

1682
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:49,439
Framed and charged in the mother which on

1683
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:53,791
It was Infowars where I did my very first interview to lay out the truth

1684
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:57,119
That epic struggle and now Alex whether you like it or not

1685
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,143
Your connect

1686
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:58,911
Academy

1687
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:01,471
For the rest your life

1688
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,007
And the Sundance Kid

1689
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,287
That's really weird

1690
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,567
Rodger

1691
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:11,199
Go on Infowars first when he got indicted got subpoenaed but

1692
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:14,783
You know you didn't go on and forwards first-plymouth that we got pardon

1693
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:15,551
Yeah

1694
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:19,647
Alex is useful to Rodger when she it is bad

1695
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:26,303
Alex and his audience of people you can rely on to believe you and who angrily tell them that their enemies are oppressing you and your

1696
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,071
You need their help

1697
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,095
Their marks

1698
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:29,631
As a fundraising Ops

1699
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,679
Yep they aren't however the sort of audio

1700
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,447
Rodger wood

1701
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:35,007
Choose to be around or give a s*** about

1702
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:39,359
He wants to spend moments of bliss with people that he actually hook that is like

1703
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,127
Relevant

1704
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,711
. so anyway that's why you giving busy

1705
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:44,735
Exclusive to Alex

1706
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:48,063
Mainstream media Outlets would have Rodger on in both ends

1707
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:51,647
Instances anytime he wanted to cuz it's newsworthy stuff

1708
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:54,463
You wouldn't be able to get by

1709
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,303
Without the pushback on some Fox News shows

1710
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:01,119
Trouble he goes to Infowars and it makes sense

1711
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:04,959
Also Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid or Outlaws who died at the end of the movie

1712
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:10,335
Maybe I'll choose a different example

1713
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,895
Chuseok

1714
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,175
I

1715
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,455
It just occurred to

1716
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,759
How many years

1717
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,039
Of Rodger stones

1718
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:19,807
Adult life

1719
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,343
Has he been

1720
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,623
Not under

1721
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,159
From someone

1722
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:25,951
Right

1723
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:29,791
What can you order some years I think

1724
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,839
The majority

1725
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:36,191
Find me the early years probably were less focused on him

1726
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,471
He had

1727
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:40,799
Be the whole Watergate thing

1728
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:44,383
If you will of his career

1729
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,151
Yeah

1730
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:48,479
I would imagine there have been some times

1731
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:51,039
I swear he's dealing with foreign dictators

1732
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,575
Might have

1733
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:54,879
Been under some scrutiny

1734
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,719
He's been

1735
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,303
Just so many crimes

1736
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:06,655
How does one live their life like I said.

1737
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,703
For him it must be the only way he knows how to live

1738
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:10,239
Probably

1739
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,519
Pretty fun

1740
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:15,616
There's got to be some

1741
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:16,896
Open to that

1742
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:20,480
It's like those people who are so good and

1743
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,248
The crisis

1744
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:23,296
You know that when they're not in a crisis

1745
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,088
They almost trying manufacturer

1746
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,392
In order to feel

1747
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,160
Comfortable again

1748
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,696
He's like if I'm not

1749
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:36,096
Climbing I don't know what I'm doing with my life but I think they're what you might be describing as a mental illness

1750
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,400
Exactly describe about you

1751
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:44,800
Rodger doesn't want to deal with the reality of his own subpoena and so he has decided to create a strong

1752
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:45,568
Man about it

1753
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:46,848
I've been disparage

1754
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:49,408
And smeared as the promoter of

1755
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,712
American Capital

1756
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,992
On January 6th

1757
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,784
Despite the fact that I

1758
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:55,552
Wasn't there

1759
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,344
Any assertion

1760
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,112
Claim

1761
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,392
Or implication

1762
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,672
To the contrary

1763
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,440
It's Pat

1764
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,208
Oracle

1765
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:02,976
False

1766
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,512
There is no evidence

1767
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:05,792
Or any witness who can

1768
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:07,072
Ashley come forward

1769
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,120
Otherwise

1770
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:15,520
I would say that it's almost more damning that you're really specific about how you weren't there and maybe had people

1771
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,824
Around who can vouch the

1772
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,616
Wow almost makes me suspect

1773
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:24,480
But you intentionally working pre-made Alibis which means

1774
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:28,064
But no one's suggesting that Rodger was there any of that s***

1775
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:32,160
He's getting a subpoena because he ran an organization called stop the steel in the 20s

1776
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:36,000
16 election any work of Ali Alexander for the new stop Bastille

1777
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:39,328
Both him and Ali have said as much on Infowars

1778
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,352
We know this

1779
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,192
The committee's interest in Rodger is largely surrounding is involved

1780
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,216
Make It Stop Bastille

1781
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:47,008
As well as that whole thing about him having

1782
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:49,568
Earthkeepers as his personal security guards

1783
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:56,224
Quote several of whom were reportedly involved in the attack on the capital and at least one of whom has been in.

1784
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,040
Okay well there is that

1785
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:01,344
Tell you something

1786
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,648
You know what they cut they call the Avon box

1787
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,184
Oxtail a drug dealer

1788
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,512
But he was never touching the truck so you know he didn't deal drugs

1789
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:11,840
Then he wasn't there

1790
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:16,704
Yeah I don't I don't think that Rodger is like

1791
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,776
Any kind of orchestrator or ringleader

1792
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:23,872
But I do think that there's some shady business going on with the stop this feeling

1793
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:27,200
Anything that Alexander is involved with his shady as hell too

1794
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:27,968
The beginning

1795
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,248
So

1796
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:32,832
Think that there are some questions that I think it would be appropriate to ask him

1797
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:34,368
4

1798
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,160
For a guy like Rodger Stone

1799
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:40,000
Who has been under investigation let's call it most of his adult life

1800
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:41,792
I think he probably

1801
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,584
He has a good sense of when something

1802
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,608
Might go wrong

1803
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,656
Decided to stay away from

1804
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,448
Yeah

1805
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:52,032
Rodger doesn't know to that like

1806
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,568
Hey why would

1807
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,336
Could we do that

1808
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:56,896
Right medicine Congress is stupid

1809
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:58,688
Why would we do that right

1810
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:04,832
Right

1811
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:07,392
I'm many things Alex but I'm not

1812
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,160
Stupid

1813
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,816
Menacing lawmakers even though nobody was armed

1814
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:16,608
Donald Trump

1815
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,376
Politically

1816
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,656
Is either an idiot

1817
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,680
Or an amateur

1818
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:21,472
Why would we

1819
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:26,080
Motive for this

1820
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:29,664
Well in my place it would take a very large

1821
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:31,968
Garbage disposal

1822
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,160
I'm not going there

1823
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,744
What are we doing

1824
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,912
That's all sad Tire plugs

1825
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:55,520
Satire satire

1826
01:23:56,032 --> 01:24:02,176
That's not how fat tire where did I tell you that dick jokes are you can be

1827
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:03,968
No clue

1828
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:07,808
But let's try and imagine how they could be sexually

1829
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,368
What could that be satirize okay

1830
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:13,696
Him saying that he has a big dick

1831
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:15,744
What would the what's that sound people who have like

1832
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,792
Really bad talks

1833
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,072
Sick mask

1834
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:25,472
That would be the only way to consider that satires if what he's doing is lampooning

1835
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:29,056
Accepting the trappings of a fool who would

1836
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,336
Feel like you need

1837
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,616
To tell people how big is

1838
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:32,384
His dick is

1839
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:39,040
Conceivably could see that being interpreted as satire but that's not what Alex

1840
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:39,808
I can't let

1841
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:42,112
People think I have a small dick making a small dick

1842
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,136
Joke

1843
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:43,904
Which is

1844
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:49,536
Fun I guess get there talking about shooting your own feet off or whatever big feet big dick

1845
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:51,840
A joke that has a small dick right and then

1846
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:52,864
Handle that

1847
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:59,264
What if somebody thought he had a small victory what if somebody didn't understand it was a joke

1848
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,080
That's not satire and it's not even good comedy

1849
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:03,872
Dunedin

1850
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,152
So

1851
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,688
Brutal Alex's there

1852
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,224
Rodger is there

1853
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,296
I got a third partner in this interview

1854
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:17,696
And that is Mark Mendoza

1855
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:21,792
All the time is there and Alex

1856
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:22,560
The payroll

1857
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:23,840
A couple times

1858
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:28,448
He's like Mark am I not the most innocent person in the world

1859
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:33,056
When do you just stop and look around at who you surround yourself with goat

1860
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:34,336
Oh this was all a mistake

1861
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,712
Damn yeah

1862
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:44,320
Just sitting in that room looking at Rodger Stone and Mark Randazzo thinking

1863
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:48,416
I'm on the side of good Heroes really

1864
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:50,976
So Mark has some interesting ideas

1865
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,024
And then when I started studying the car

1866
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:53,792
Karthi is unwell

1867
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,584
ISM School

1868
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,352
Back at UMass

1869
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:59,424
I remember looking at that and thinking why you know

1870
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:02,496
Why weren't more people courageous enough to stand up

1871
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,264
Shop and Save

1872
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:04,800
I hate communism

1873
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,616
Approbation of civil liberties more

1874
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:09,664
Why

1875
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,200
It's a shame I wasn't alive back

1876
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:13,760
Wished

1877
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:15,040
But I would have the ability

1878
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,576
Be in a fight like that

1879
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:17,600
Because here I am

1880
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,136
Yeah right now

1881
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:22,208
I think that this is the closest thing to an impact

1882
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:25,280
It improves upon if you if you can use that word

1883
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:27,584
Improved upon how McCarthy did

1884
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:29,376
We have the same

1885
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:30,144
Exact

1886
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,424
Thing going on

1887
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:37,824
Terrible news the McCarthy era everyone Mark Randazzo is talking to Woodstown Chalisa poor

1888
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:44,224
McCarthy India caste mark would too but it depends on which side was

1889
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,248
Paying more right

1890
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:49,600
As for the question of why did more people stand up to McCarthy like a lot of people

1891
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:50,368
Did

1892
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:56,768
Now the exact thing that he's trying to present his like why did more people say I hate communism but this is bad

1893
01:26:57,024 --> 01:27:01,120
Or whatever it's because everybody who was super anti-communist

1894
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:05,728
Didn't give a s*** against communism

1895
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:11,616
And everyone who stood up to the McCarthy house American on American Activities Committee

1896
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,384
People that announce

1897
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:18,784
Around back then all those people who got blackballed in Hollywood

1898
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,808
For that

1899
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:24,928
They're the same ones who he says created all that this is such a stupid for them to try to walk

1900
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:31,328
Like I know they want to portray what's happening them as a Witch Hunt and all that but they just got to give up on the McCarthyism example cuz it

1901
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:32,864
Work

1902
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,680
Also this what's happening right now is nothing like

1903
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:36,960
McCarthyism because

1904
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:37,728
Batman vest

1905
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:38,496
Navigation into a

1906
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,520
Specific event

1907
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:45,664
If McCarthy was just subpoenaing a bunch of people who had physical or material connections to an event where communist

1908
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,200
That stormed the US Capitol

1909
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,480
This whole thing wouldn't

1910
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:50,528
Be looked at so poorly by history

1911
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:58,208
Except that now, his mistake was assuming that everyone he didn't like

1912
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,232
Was a commie

1913
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,096
Other than just subpoenaed whomever was that he felt like you didn't like it

1914
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:05,888
It's fun how like opposition

1915
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:06,656
To his

1916
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:08,704
Is committee actually made you a communist

1917
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:15,104
Yeah it is weird how if you were against him then he thought

1918
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:19,712
It sounds so familiar

1919
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:24,576
Democrats watch their own news feed their own

1920
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:26,368
And all that got regurgitated

1921
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:28,160
Back to them with water joke

1922
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:33,024
Campaign was what a joke people like you were what a joke all it was and they didn't

1923
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,608
They just weren't prepared for it they were as shocked as anybody was

1924
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,168
The next morning when they woke up and they saw

1925
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:44,288
And I think they looked at that and they swore they never be caught like that again

1926
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:47,616
At what a real American would do at that point is safe

1927
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:49,152
How did we lose in the market

1928
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,176
Play some ideas

1929
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:52,224
Are we retool our arguments

1930
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:52,992
How do we get

1931
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:55,296
To connect with the American people these people

1932
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:56,320
Patriotic

1933
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,136
Believe in America who believe in the Constitution

1934
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,416
But instead

1935
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:01,440
They looked

1936
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:03,488
Do the other direction and they decided

1937
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:06,560
That they were going to try to win the marketplace of ideas

1938
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:08,096
By shutting down the

1939
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,376
Clothing store in that Mark

1940
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:12,192
Authoritarian model

1941
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:12,960
Just come out

1942
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:15,008
Shut down opposing media

1943
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,288
And you noticed

1944
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,616
First they started with people that it was easy to start with

1945
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:22,432
Withdraw they tested the waters with Milo and then they

1946
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:28,832
Kept moving along and they kept hitting other people and has one by one

1947
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:31,648
Rodger Stone I got banned

1948
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:34,976
One by one

1949
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:41,376
I want to be like

1950
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:44,448
Hero of this thing

1951
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:50,848
Mark's talking about the really fun story but it actually kind of fails to take into account

1952
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:53,408
The first is that when Trump won

1953
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:55,968
There's a two-pronged approach the people felt they need

1954
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:56,736
The take

1955
01:29:56,992 --> 01:30:01,344
Warren was winning the Battle of ideas whatever the f*** that means but also there was a need

1956
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:02,624
To take action

1957
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,672
To try to help protect people who are

1958
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:06,720
Instantly in pretty serious real Danger

1959
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:11,328
This included immigrants refugees members of the lgbtq community women

1960
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:15,936
Hoops with face the real Prospect of having rights taken away from them by the

1961
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:18,240
Stated goals

1962
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,800
Trumps politics

1963
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,568
No

1964
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:27,968
Mark and folks like Alex don't really understand this dynamic because they constantly yell about Heather being pressed and rights taken away but the

1965
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:29,248
We also know that they're lying

1966
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,064
Which I suspect lead them to believe that everyone else is too

1967
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:38,976
The second thing that needs to be pointed out here is it what's going on and what has happened isn't an attempt

1968
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:41,792
Shut down the opposing side in a Marketplace of ideas

1969
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:44,096
Like through censorship or whatever

1970
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:46,144
People are facing the consequences of their actions

1971
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:48,448
It turns out a lot of the folks who decided

1972
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,984
The Grist on the Trump train

1973
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,032
Did some stuff that had consequences

1974
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:54,592
Milo wasn't kicked off Twitter cuz of his ideas

1975
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:57,152
It was because he was leading targeted harassment activity

1976
01:30:57,664 --> 01:31:02,528
Alex isn't being punished for his ideas he's facing the music for stuff he got away with for far too long

1977
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:05,344
Because people didn't want to deal with the hassle of holding him accountable

1978
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:09,184
And also let's not forget Milo got kicked off Twitter

1979
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:09,952
For the f***

1980
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:14,304
Cool promise being put forth by Mark is absolutely flawed

1981
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,352
Something to think about in situation

1982
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:20,192
Like this is how people like Alex legitimately are trying to shut down

1983
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:21,728
An opposing idea

1984
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,264
In the marketplace of ideas

1985
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:29,920
What does opposition to critical race theory if it's not an attempt to ban ideas you don't like

1986
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:31,712
Get the f*** out of here

1987
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:32,736
Anyway

1988
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:35,296
F*** background I love this whole thing is dumb

1989
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:37,344
Making

1990
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,136
He's making comment to that

1991
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:41,184
You're more reasonable than Alex

1992
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:44,000
But in actuality or based on completely stupid

1993
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:45,024
False premise

1994
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,304
And I would our

1995
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:49,376
That's people were correct when they said

1996
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:50,400
The Trump campaign

1997
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,168
And those people were

1998
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:53,728
You're stupid they were right

1999
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:55,264
And

2000
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,056
I would say that the Four Seasons

2001
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,848
Is all the evidence you need

2002
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,128
All the other day

2003
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:04,992
So Rogers got some more ideas actually kind of agree with part of

2004
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:06,784
We have become

2005
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,880
We're being attacked cuz it's just makes the left

2006
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:11,904
Drool

2007
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,952
The reason my wife was attacked

2008
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:16,000
Outside our home

2009
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:17,024
Abaya

2010
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,816
Play some left

2011
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:22,144
The reason that there's so much hatred of me literally

2012
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:22,912
AAA

2013
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:24,960
Aaja Sanam

2014
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:29,568
Owen Shroyer

2015
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:31,616
Is because we are cutting

2016
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:32,896
True

2017
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:33,920
To tell

2018
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:34,944
People the truth

2019
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:41,088
I don't I don't agree with that part but I do kind of agree with Rodger that Alex and his wives are kind of clickbait

2020
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,160
You know but at the same time I also believe that they're getting the jester

2021
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:44,928
Desserts with their act

2022
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,976
They aren't just being subpoenaed for the sake of

2023
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,000
Creative clickbait

2024
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,024
Is that ideas

2025
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:54,400
Yeah yeah I kind of I kind of get what he saying I think that

2026
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:57,472
A lot of times maybe headlines about vembar

2027
01:32:57,728 --> 01:33:00,544
Not representative of the full story and a lot of times people can

2028
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,848
Maybe get false perceptions

2029
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:04,128
Slightly inaccurate perception

2030
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:05,664
Depends on social media but

2031
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:06,944
That's true of

2032
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:07,712
A lot of people

2033
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:11,040
It's always it's always fun to exaggerate things

2034
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:15,648
I also think that they only make money by being click-baiting so I think they're kind of

2035
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:16,672
Real Spider-Man

2036
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,696
For sure

2037
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:19,744
But I agree

2038
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,280
Statement that his life is clickbait

2039
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,048
I mean

2040
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:22,816
It's sad

2041
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:29,216
You can't hear Alexei all they're going to cut this out and play this all over the news that big dick without without being like

2042
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:30,240
You really were

2043
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:34,080
So Alex Rambles here a little bit

2044
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:37,152
And it would probably surprise you to learn that

2045
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:39,200
A lot of the interview with Rodger

2046
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:42,016
Is less about like a statement and more about like

2047
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:42,784
We need money

2048
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:48,416
Nice guy

2049
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:50,464
I want his money

2050
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,680
Meaning powerful rich people

2051
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:03,008
Tyranny

2052
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:12,480
Rockstars

2053
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,552
Music

2054
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,024
About

2055
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:37,824
Is one back for a pension after being fired under Trump

2056
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:42,176
My legal bills paid

2057
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:44,224
Democratic Party

2058
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:48,320
6

2059
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:01,632
You want us to keep fighting

2060
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:09,312
If you want us to Stand-Up it mean we are the champions of Freedom out of there like some arrogant son of a b**** going

2061
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:17,504
Thank you art

2062
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:23,904
Some kind of guy yelling of the Big Daddy

2063
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,976
Right but he also constantly talks about how like I'm

2064
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:29,536
Standard error of God

2065
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:35,936
I think that's a little bit big daddy asked

2066
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:37,472
I think that

2067
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,240
It's fun

2068
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:42,592
For him to claim that the Democratic party is doing these lawsuits against him

2069
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:45,152
Because then at that allows him to yell about them

2070
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,688
I wish you would look really

2071
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:47,712
Kind of gross

2072
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:51,552
If you had to deal with the reality that it's the victims families

2073
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,344
That are suing him

2074
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,160
Cuz it looks like it's more of an a******

2075
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:58,976
These lawsuits

2076
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:05,632
S*** people who are actually

2077
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:07,424
Why you've actually getting Subaru

2078
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,192
It might

2079
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:08,960
It might

2080
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:11,776
Lead to

2081
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:12,544
Yeah

2082
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:14,336
Yeah

2083
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:17,664
Linklater is cool I guess

2084
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:18,688
Ted Nugent

2085
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,456
Not

2086
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:21,248
Definitely not

2087
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,016
No guessing

2088
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,088
Mrs.

2089
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:28,416
Star-Lord you know we used to like Chris but now he's gone

2090
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:29,952
Ondiem sucks now

2091
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:30,976
Who else sucks

2092
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:39,424
Mark Randazzo Rodger Rodger sex

2093
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,984
Just this b*******

2094
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:43,776
I'm only here

2095
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,056
By the grace of God

2096
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,920
Because I reaffirm my commitment to Jesus Christ

2097
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:54,272
I'm only here because I confess that I was a sinner and I got right with Christ

2098
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:56,576
Because they were going.

2099
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:57,600
And Jaime

2100
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:59,136
After gagging me

2101
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:00,160
In Soviet

2102
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:00,928
Style

2103
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:01,952
Trial

2104
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:03,488
God is good

2105
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:06,048
Protection of this nation

2106
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:08,096
We do know how this comes out

2107
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:09,888
Weary

2108
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:10,656
The Bible

2109
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:12,960
That's why I know that good

2110
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:15,776
Triamcinolone end

2111
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:17,312
We just don't know how it happened

2112
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,360
You want to make God laugh

2113
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:21,152
Tell him you have a plan

2114
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:22,176
Oh okay

2115
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:27,296
Noted schemer and plan maker Russia

2116
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:30,368
Subway

2117
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,928
I mean it could not be more

2118
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:34,208
The Playbook

2119
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:36,512
Being a

2120
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:37,792
National

2121
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:39,584
Global ratfucker

2122
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,864
For your entire life

2123
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:43,168
Get a presidential pardon

2124
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,192
And then fight.

2125
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,728
That's good playbook

2126
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:46,752
Bright but also

2127
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:53,408
Finding God is part of you getting apart into thanks for the perfect Redemption Arc

2128
01:37:54,688 --> 01:38:00,832
The conman 101 I also really enjoy how Rodger cost in the middle of saying the good guys win

2129
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:01,856
And if you read the Bible

2130
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:05,184
Cuz it almost was like his body wouldn't allow him

2131
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:08,512
Bevis blow Hardy

2132
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:11,840
Part of me thinks he had to stop and think like wait

2133
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:13,120
Do the good guys win at the end

2134
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:15,424
The Bible never ride a bush

2135
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,240
Catholic Bible

2136
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,800
Now they're murdered by the next

2137
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:23,872
So Alex has some

2138
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:28,736
Spend that he needs to put on Mike Flynn's comments

2139
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:32,576
About how we need A-1 government 313

2140
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:36,672
That was interpreted those comments a little differently and I would say

2141
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:40,256
Incorrectly not not accurate based on the words that were said

2142
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:51,776
Guana State religion

2143
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:52,800
Say that

2144
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:58,432
No General Flynn is one of the greatest men of this century is a man of Destiny

2145
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:00,480
He's a man of the Constitution

2146
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:02,016
Eden Eden

2147
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:02,784
Say that

2148
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,600
No matter what religion you are do you need to have God

2149
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:06,624
Nope said that is

2150
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,440
It's fun though

2151
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,464
Way better than what he

2152
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:14,048
He said yeah cuz if you have to take him based on what he said you have to

2153
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:20,448
Really ask yourself if he's the man of the Constitution then you might even have to say that man is fundamentally trying to destroy the

2154
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,496
Institution

2155
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:28,384
January 6th

2156
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:30,432
Is that even that big of a deal at all

2157
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:31,456
But hey

2158
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:32,736
Here's the man

2159
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:37,344
Wow Court not in condition of him going and testify me they would be

2160
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:40,416
Hasn't he has Adam and just more generally

2161
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:52,960
Obama to come to this committee because it's a kangaroo

2162
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:57,568
Lied about being the past and the people connected to the Russia gate hub

2163
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,872
But it was a real Congressional committee

2164
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:12,928
I want to know all that

2165
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:14,976
Clearly they were trying to set us up

2166
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:18,816
Mission of the Secret Service

2167
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:21,120
What about who wanted me to be at the front

2168
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:21,888
Stupid now

2169
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:30,080
New January 6th investigation

2170
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:31,872
I totally agree with that

2171
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:38,272
I would love an investigation as long as it frames me as the main victim

2172
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:45,184
I wanted true investigation of very real and not the definition of a true investigation

2173
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:51,328
I was set up by the Secret Service obviously if there was an honest

2174
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:52,096
Investigation

2175
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:54,656
I think that if Alex word

2176
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:56,704
To go and appear before the house

2177
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:57,728
Committee

2178
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:00,544
Heat would be more than welcome to bring up some of these

2179
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:03,104
Conspiracy theories that he has and they would be

2180
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,664
Dealt with within 5 minutes and then

2181
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,992
It would get to the questions that he can't answer without incriminating himself

2182
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,784
I want I want

2183
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:11,808
What's one of those

2184
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:15,136
God I want a Committee hearing that we get to see because you always

2185
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:17,696
Seems like you anytime you see those committee hearings you see

2186
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:21,536
Whoever the political side is that against it

2187
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:25,120
Is asking questions and the other side is like

2188
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:27,168
You're a great person and I love

2189
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:30,752
But your hair you smell nice favor cookie just tell us all

2190
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:35,360
Why why is everyone against you because you're right all the time correct anyways next question

2191
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:41,760
On a scale of big two huge where to take ass I want to see all of those right-wing idiot

2192
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:48,160
It's have to be like Alex you're a hero I think there's only two Republicans on the committee

2193
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:51,232
It's not going to say anything nice

2194
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:56,864
That is true it's not like he's got Jim Jordan and on there.

2195
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,400
That would help him out

2196
01:41:58,656 --> 01:41:59,424
I would have been fun

2197
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:04,032
I think the Republicans that are on that committee would disown out

2198
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:07,616
So Rogers one last little thing to say about about his

2199
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:09,664
Subpoena before

2200
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,944
We get out of here

2201
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:13,504
This is the ABC News tecnico

2202
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:15,552
Guilt by association

2203
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:18,368
Here's a picture of Rodger stone with one of The Proud boys out

2204
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:20,672
Yeah

2205
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:26,048
So what does that prove that the bank

2206
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:32,192
No that's your for McCarthy

2207
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:36,288
This isn't

2208
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:37,056
Accurate

2209
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:39,104
Association is one thing

2210
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,408
Rodger was using the proud boys

2211
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,176
As

2212
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:43,712
No keepers

2213
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:44,736
Is a security

2214
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,832
Is that something that's very well-established he's talked about that in the past

2215
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,624
And

2216
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:51,904
Then out they were

2217
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:52,928
People who got indicted

2218
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:53,952
First

2219
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:57,024
I mean I would say Not Guilty By Association

2220
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:59,328
Strong connection

2221
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,864
He's he's correct

2222
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:04,192
A picture of him with a proud boy leader doesn't prove any

2223
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:08,800
The fact that he has said multiple times that he loves the proud boys

2224
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,080
I has them work for him

2225
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:12,896
PS4s for

2226
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:14,944
And I love everything that they do

2227
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:15,968
That prove

2228
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:20,576
Pictures that say with the Oath Keepers

2229
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:21,600
Is doesn't mean

2230
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:23,648
Rogers

2231
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:27,744
Presumably been on Infowars when Stewart Roads was around or whatever

2232
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,536
There is a connection

2233
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:31,328
Between I'm sure that doesn't matter

2234
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:32,864
You never get two charged

2235
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,400
By the committee for that

2236
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:36,960
But if you're employing Oak

2237
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:40,288
Keepers Azure security and they also

2238
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:42,848
They broke into the capitol

2239
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:45,152
Stand maybe there's some questions that should be asked

2240
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:47,456
Maybe they're not about

2241
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:48,224
You

2242
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,504
Specifically

2243
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,296
Maybe they're about a what's going on with this guy

2244
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:53,856
Now the problem is if you're right

2245
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:58,720
Stone answering any question honestly the only lead to

2246
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:03,072
So after this interview with the reptiles and Rodger

2247
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:05,632
Alex Goes to talking to another guy

2248
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:08,704
Guy by the name of Jake Ducey who appears to have

2249
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:11,520
A whole bunch with the recent Wars stuff

2250
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:12,800
In the interest

2251
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:16,384
Keeping things somewhat separated I'm going to hold off on covering this interview

2252
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:20,224
Because ideally by the time we need to record Mondays episode

2253
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,248
We will have somebody

2254
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:27,648
Actual reset Wars content available

2255
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:32,768
Costas interview with a guy who I'm going to call The Duce

2256
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:34,560
No spelled differently

2257
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:37,120
It just seems like anybody is due to sound

2258
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:38,400
Spoiler alert

2259
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:42,240
Lucy is a mess

2260
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:56,832
Our next episode will cover whatever is available out the recent Wars

2261
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:59,648
Yeah and we will do this as if it is the Gate of gay

2262
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:03,232
It's at great as this is important Alex's most important

2263
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:06,560
Today I mean that there's only one with the great reset Wars

2264
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,352
To take it over

2265
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:13,728
So I think is it at the end of the day what he's doing with reset Wars is a pathetic

2266
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:16,032
Attempt to create a new business entity

2267
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:19,360
The six-hour course

2268
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:20,128
This is going to be

2269
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:21,664
So much fun for me

2270
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,224
I've been needing something like this cuz all of it like

2271
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:26,016
A lot of the older documentaries

2272
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:26,784
He has our

2273
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:27,552
Useless

2274
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:29,856
Like I don't want to force you to watch

2275
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:30,880
2 hours of

2276
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:33,440
Alex sitting at a desk saying thing

2277
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:36,000
I already saw him bitching about a road for an hour

2278
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:38,560
That's true

2279
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:43,168
Which we got to hear a little bit of today

2280
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:45,472
AAA

2281
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:49,056
They look forward to some of that being released and being able to

2282
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:49,824
To get into it

2283
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:50,592
I love a good tease

2284
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,360
CIA

2285
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:57,760
Did the deuce will not disappoint disappoint

2286
01:45:58,016 --> 01:46:01,088

Dot-com us on Twitter

2289
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:12,096
We're also at

2290
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:16,192
This response to the January 6th subpoena with disappointment

2291
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:19,264

Thanks for holding

2297
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:34,880
Alexandra Thurston color
