This episode

00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,431
Trying to race on people's very exciting

89
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,527

00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
Explain partially one of the reasons

91
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,927
A bit of a

92
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
Of

93
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
Doing an audiobook

To go and

101
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311

00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,431
Secured the text twice

103
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,807
It's not possible

104
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,879
That's what we'd intended to start putting out on

105
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
Weird

106
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
We tried for the second time

107
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,255
To get through it and it is just

108
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,279
Some of the most

109
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,815
How awful

110
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Nonsense

00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
Really really bad

112
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,703
It's really boring

113
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,335
What is it

114
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
The room

115
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:11,199
It is ultimately

116
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,015
Very very very funny

117
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,807
Credibly boring at the same time

118
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:22,207
Turn on some of the funny stuff

119
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:28,607
Wings

120
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:35,007
Is a human or cat being buried

121
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,591
Nope nope

122
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
It's on

123
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:44,991
Worth it's not worth it to find out though

124
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,903
Cuz we got like 45 minutes has Pages through this

125
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:57,023
It's very log into putting out

126
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,071
80 Hour audiobook of it

127
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
No good

128
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
Not going to work

129
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,191
Not that kind of torpedo.

130
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:15,199
Apologies for this episode and the fact that we just can't

131
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
It was

132
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
Really really horny

133
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:27,487
Play keyboard Prison from listening to a dude

134
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:33,887
It is the perfect intersection of mail message

135
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,983
Up and down repeatedly

136
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263
No good

137
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,591
So today we are back in the prison

138
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
Cuz we got a

139
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:50,527
Experience The Fallout

140
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,903

Council

145
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
And

146
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
Alex very clearly was

147
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
Applying for x

148
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,823
Against the guy appropriate

149
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,615
Filed a motion

150
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,175
Alex got some

151
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,967
Against

152
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,039
Yes pay the attorneys fees for the

153
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
Airport

154
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,855
Situation

155
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,159
He can only

156
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
Bio-Oil

157
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
I'm sorry Arabia now

158
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
From Iran

159
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,631
More to the point a lot of people has gone away

160
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:42,239
And I want

161
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
Terrapin

162
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,359
Alex did his whole thing on Friday

163
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:54,015
Immediately The Daily Beast a number of stories about how Alex

164
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,087
Billion dollars

165
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,135
More information about who had

166
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,439
His email a

167
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
All good and well

168
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,839
I think that's fairly fine

169
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:20,639
100000 Cal and took away the stipulation that

170
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,991
Call back

171
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,599
On Monday

172
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,647
The Connecticut Post

173
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,183
I believe is the publication

174
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:38,047
Paper out of Connecticut or publication out of Connecticut put out a story where the headlight

175
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,327
Lawyer Alex

176
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
Text Jones.

177
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,375
Vocaloid

178
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
Pornography

179
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,751
Because of the way it was framed in the headline

180
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,103
It made it appear that Alex had maliciously

181
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,479
Send a batch of things in Discovery

182
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,807
Illegal pornography

183
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,087
So

184
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
The problem is

185
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
Alex only understand

186
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,951
Answer when you

187
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
Have the headline like that

188
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,023
It's going to cause trouble

189
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
And prepare things

190
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,959
So we're going to go over there at work experience

191
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751
Experiences the media coverage of

192
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
The situation that

193
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,823
Important lesson

194
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,127
Someday we will learn in the middle of this episode

195
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,175
Some funny stuff

196
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:31,807
I have tried to make this as not painful as possible nearly as bad as Monday

197
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,599
Okay brochure

198
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,927

00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
Soundly funny

200
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
But before

201
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,375
We have an out-of-context drop

202
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
Is Alex Jones

203
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
One of the greatest

204
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,055
70

205
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
If anybody

206
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:08,671
If anybody have any questions about Alex Jones is loyalties to Russia

207
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:13,023
We have just thought that

208
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,423
Wait what

209
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,311
That's not fair at all but

210
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:30,175
The fall of the Soviet Union may or may not

211
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,807
Yeah by understanding the public character is that he wrote

212
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,903
Heights

213
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
Through 90

214
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,487
Wednesday of this past

215
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,279
And Alex

216
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
Start off by talking about

217
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
Tony Rizzo

218
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
Jessica

219
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,799
That's pretty short Forest clip

220
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
Quick

221
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
Short

222
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:10,111
To sort of set-up he talks about the stacks quite a bit

223
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,415
About the house

224
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
Videos covering

225
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
Situation

226
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
Sailfin

227
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,559
I will find out

228
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
Finger at himself

229
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,239
By the FBI

230
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,079
Victim

231
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,687
Someone sitting

232
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:42,623
Piece of crap

233
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,279
Infected with malware was c*********

234
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,359
Alex Jones

235
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,831
All the articles that talked about malware we're literally quoting Norm pad

236
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,647
Alex's lawyer said it was malware

237
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:22,047
It was clumsy phrasing on that part

238
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,655
Alex is playing the character thing

239
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
Sslikeyesss

240
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,519
Reporting on what your lawyer said defending you and child custody

241
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,823
Shut up with your lawyer.

242
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,431
Completely

243
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,575
Characterized

244
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,367
Really trying to

245
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
Get

246
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
Fingers around

247
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,279
This trend is going to go through

248
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
Rufus episode

249
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
Very consist

250
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
But his main story

251
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
270 is not his own

252
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
It is not

253
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,239
Ron

254
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Which I don't

255
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,055
Think he cares all that much about anymore

256
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:11,455
It's not Ebola forgotten about the Ebola on the southern border

257
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:23,231
Not really care anymore

258
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,839
0 because you have to move on

259
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,631
Facebook

260
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
As mentioned

261
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,495
Is the mark of the beast

262
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,055
And Alex

263
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:44,479
Facebook or shell

264
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,551
Yes biblical prophecy is

265
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,647
Again

266
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
Facebook currency

267
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
Attract

268
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
One ring

269
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,095
Two Worlds

270
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:04,191
Nice

271
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,007
One small stacking

272
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:13,919
3456

273
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
He doesn't get to those 27

274
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:40,799
Believe that

275
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
Chipmunk surfboards that is nuts

276
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,887
I read that Libras like

277
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,703
Call for fucksake see you assholes

278
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,031
Yeah it's one of those things where it's like hey this is stupid

279
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,591
Terrible but I think

280
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:20,223
Some common ground on this one being against

281
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,295
A cryptocurrency

282
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:29,183
Facebook named Mark Zuckerberg could go bad pretty easily

283
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,487
So good enjoy

284
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,815
Still think you're going to do this poorly but despite that Noble fight

285
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,119
I think we should all team up

286
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
Yeah

287
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,447
Another trend

288
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
Is it goes throughout

289
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,031
These here episodes

290
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,895
What are described as a moreover gesturing towards

291
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,527
I know that we have no bones about the fact that Alex

292
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,087
Comes from a white supremacist white nationalist

293
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,135
In place

294
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
He says

295
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
Episode

296
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
AR

297
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,815
Profoundly

298
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
Disgusting

299
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,167
Talking to the guy who runs Europe Wars

300
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,983
Which is the offshoot that you're up of

301
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
Infowars

302
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Delicious

303
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
Lemon lime

304
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,711
Alignment

305
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,575
Today lyman's on guess I'm thoughts

306
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,855
About Africa

307
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
Can immigrants

308
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,999
I wouldn't say this is a win

309
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
Soca

310
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,703
Especially with with a lot of the African migrants

311
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:51,359
A dominance of of the western

312
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,303
So I mean

313
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,607
Wow

314
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,679
Something like that. Just think like

315
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,335
You're showing your own cards there

316
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,407
Alphalete

317
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:32,063
Crazy everywhere

318
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
Black women is insanely High

319
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,975
Sort of language is the way you described

320
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,767
Yeah it's not

321
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
They come here and they breed

322
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
You're a rapist

323
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,399
I would say so

324
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,359
Play this about

325
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,207
Cam

326
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,199
Google Express

327
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,791
Emigrate

328
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:55,519
Fireworks

329
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,543
Good sarcasm

330
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,919
I took Alex this long to

331
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:08,319
Figure out that there are social media Networks

332
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,391
Gabon the show before and they've talked about how he's on

333
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:16,767
But like the G word a lot of these other folks have ended up like

334
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,815
Over there

335
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
I think it's interesting

336
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,119
Just trying to

337
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
Spread

338
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
Temporal

339
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
I think he's going to pay

340
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,775
Yeah I think the events of the last

341
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
Never really

342
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
Driven home

343
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,615
To him

344
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,895
Sound devices

345
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,687
He is dead in the water

346
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,527
Google child pronography

347
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
Is

348
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:43,391
What is a horrible crime

349
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,183
He is the victim

350
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,655
Whatever you're fine

351
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,215
Because Alex has such a reaction

352
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
Enraged

353
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,567
Spilled monster getting on Aaron started

354
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,847
Screaming about this guy

355
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
You created the world

356
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,943
His own devices that

357
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
He will behave

358
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:12,319
Right he's going to completely destroy

359
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,135
What do you got so in order to compensate for that

360
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,928
He knows he needs more right

361
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,864
Plug my Telegram

It says there's not a whole lot there

365
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,712
Summer videos

366
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,272
Stewardess settings

00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,064
Received

368
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,856
Can feelings of these desires to

369
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
New social media

370

Video spaces

371
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
Dwight's

372
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,232
Supremacy

373
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,768
Trends are important

374
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,536
Cuz they build

375
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,632
Is it probably I got to stop using MedExpress

376
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,192
Left to his own devices

377
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,984
All on its own

378
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,008
I don't think the 17

379
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:08,640
It's fine for the beginning of this episode

380
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
Great about

381
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,992
Is it Alex

382
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,552
Calls prank calls

383
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,488
Arizona

384
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
Alex

385
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,864
Or I get to my point

386
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,216
We're overdue for a American

387
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,240
Canelo

388
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,312
I want to call you out as a caller

389
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,360
You are a coward

390
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,664
Not to allow this one

391
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,200
Listener

392
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480

393
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,528
And express his opinion

394
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
About

395
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,576
The rapture

396
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,672
He deserves to come on the show

397
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:09,056
12

398
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:13,664
Bad guy just call in a bit

399
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,504
He always wants to argue Priam post-trib rapture

400
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,528
That's

401
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:24,160
I don't know why Alex let him talk so loud

402
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,304
Something pretty Charming

403
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,032
Great great about calling intuition like you're a coward cuz you won't talk to

404
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,872
I'm on the show right now

405
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,736
Unfortunately

406
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
It's not also

407
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,576
Because towards the end of this episode you're on the 7th

408
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,856
Alex said something

409
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,624
But his

410
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:56,928
Violent

411
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,232
This is this is

412
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
The scale of like

413
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
They shouldn't say

414
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,120
Muscat

415
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,600
Kayak accidents

416
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:36,096
So basically

417
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:39,424
The only one of them come back

418
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,448
I mean

419
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,288
No bones about it literally calling for it

420
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,080
Sophia's political

421
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,944
He was specifically talking about is John Bolton

422
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,736
And as much as I hate John

423
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,760
I still don't think

424
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:58,880
Be able you shouldn't behave like that on a national radio show

425
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,416
Irresponsible

426
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
Sure

427
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:09,888
That seems like a board legal way to go about that

428
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,704
When is real f*****-up headspace

429
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:21,920
But on Monday

430
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,736
The blowback from his Friday

431
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,552
Feels like all right I did that

432
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,112
Crazy nonsense on Friday

433
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:35,232
And then I got back with norm and I walked it back to 100,000 I made the

434
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:41,632
Deal legal overall good

435
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,656
You seen that too

436
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:48,288
Connecticut Post article on Monday even though it came out on Monday

437
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,360
Or something like that

438
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:57,248
Yeah yeah

439
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,296
After it got released

440
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,368
Call around social media

441
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:06,208
That would slow down

442
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,000
Telegram

443
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
Probably not

444
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,680
Clearly has

445
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,448
Heard about it

446
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,776
Wow

447
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,592
Where he goes isn't good

448
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,640
Yeah I do think

449
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,432
Starting from

450
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,992
Kind of a fair position

451
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:36,160
Ladies and gentlemen it's Tuesday June 18th 2019

452
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:42,560
Europe

453
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:48,960
DeGraw

454
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:54,848
Fake news finale obviously

455
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,712
C*********

456
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:10,208
Hundreds of articles

457
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,024
Both the local papers here in Central Texas

458
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,936
Alex Jones

459
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,984
Shin c*********

460
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
Total

461
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
Lie

462
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:34,528
Reported that we were the victims of someone sending

463
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
Coded c*********

464
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,112
Email

465
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,648
That had nothing

466
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:48,096
So the part that is fair here is again this headlines

467
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Assertive

468
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
Turtle weed even

469
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,448
Call it insinuation

470
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:06,016
All the time

471
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
This is Hulk

472
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000
Right it's not it's hard

473
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:21,120
It's hard to be like but at the same time as

474
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,144
External Observer

475
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,680
Overly

476
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,704
Be fair about this

477
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,544
It is

478
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,016
Do you know that is what the lawyer

479
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,320
Technically in Discovery

480
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,112
He sent those emails over

481
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:42,880
So it's

482
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,208
It's true and it's false

483
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,512
I would never written that headline

484
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,792
Because it allows Alex

485
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:55,680
To do that yeah I would never have allowed that headline too if I was I would never have been like

486
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,728
Call it's a

487
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,264
It's kind of a really interesting

488
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:04,640
Rico's by writing I had probably got way more

489
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:08,992
Visibility on your on your publication probably got way more traffic

490
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:15,392
More restrained headline

491
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:18,720
Way more traffic and

492
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,936
Right where the struggle comes in

493
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,520
Okay I don't I can't pretend

494
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,800
Understand exactly what

495
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
The Connecticut Post

496
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,360
Motivation

497
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:40,224
Ensworth weather in whatever

498
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:46,880
Rephrase this

499
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,160
In interest of some

500
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
Sensationalism

501
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,464
Salacious

502
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,744
Element

503
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,072
Similarly to

504
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:02,752
It doesn't matter that it's being used against Alex or by Alex

505
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,056
I'm very conflicted about it

506
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:12,736
The list of things that I

507
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:13,760
Like

508
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:20,160
Allocating a lot of energy I think it's more frustrating from

509
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,696
Restroom like a personal

510
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
Standpoint of life

511
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:27,840
God dammit guys we have done everything possible to do

512
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,864
Even though we spent

513
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:35,264
300

514
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:42,944
I want to try to listen to our show

515
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,648
Second bother you

516
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,672
The primary resource

517
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,696
Come on you got to ask

518
00:30:53,952 --> 00:31:00,096
I'm conflicted on the one hand of like understanding what you doing

519
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,144
The other part of my brain that's just like

520
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,168
Stop

521
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,496
Sprite

522
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,800
Lakers

523
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
And if

524
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,872
Not play into

525
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,968
I guess what I'm saying is I could do it

526
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,272
If I were running

527
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,344
I could have navigated this minefield

528
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,392
But I'm also glad that I'm not enough

529
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:30,304
We talked about it after we tried and failed to record that

530
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,328
Audiobook

531
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,400
You can't

532
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,168
Play his

533
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,728
Because he's been playing it for

534
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,800
For twenty years and you're just now

535
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,872
He's got you but you know if you're going to come hackleme

536
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,432
From a crowd you're fighting

537
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,968
Not against me you're fighting against

538
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,528
Every Heckler that I've dealt with over

539
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:56,928
10 years or whatever likes their strength

540
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:04,864
If you have an off-day

541
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,424
But it's locked

542
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,448
It's not a good strategy

543
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:12,032
Sensationalism

544
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,568
Is generally going

545
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,848
Going to be a losing proposition

546
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,152
For you and it's the nature of

547
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,200
Mixing it up with a profit

548
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,736
You don't want to do it

549
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,344
That being said

550
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,392
Alex is in real trouble

551
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
Because

552
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,696
What did

553
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,464
Is

554
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,256
Very much

555
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
Close to

556
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
Threatening

557
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
Is opposing counsel

558
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,120
I would say it was that

559
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,936
Question

560
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,728
Right

561
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,360
We'll try and I know he will cuz later clip you'll try to wiggle around

562
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:54,272
And baby you can get off on a technicality in Earnest and in reality was threatened

563
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,296
Chris Matic

564
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,832
That is what he was doing

565
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,928
Whether or not that will end up bison record against

566
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,720
Whether or not it will come

567
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,000
Up in his

568
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,792
Legal troubles

569
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,584
Things much harder for him

570
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,888
Because

571
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,424
What you guess he's appealing but

572
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
Series9

573
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,264
Because of the sex

574
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,312
He has to pay more he has to pay attorney

575
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:20,640
Not for the entire case but for abortion

576
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,944
So that is an additional expense

577
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,224
You can't

578
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,528
Emotions

579
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,576
To dismiss the case was thrown out

580
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,368
Telecare archons

581
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,136
Consequences

582
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,208
And I think Alex realizes

583
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,280
I got myself in that trouble

584
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
Whether he's able

585
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,632
To vocalize

586
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,912
Help people understand

587
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,704
This is my fault

588
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,008
Freak out on air

589
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,800
Screamed about this guy for no reason

590
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
And it all

591
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:58,528
I just hear him being I'm in trouble and I have to do whatever I can to make sure I don't do the

592
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:12,352
I don't want to let the enemy know there's a war when you

593
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,752
Bora Bora

594
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,080
You're losing you got to call for reinforcements

595
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,360
Got to call Pharrell

596
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,368
Consciously

597
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,696
Shuttered comes out

598
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:43,072
Call the crew

599
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
Default position

600
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:47,936
So he's had to tell his staff

601
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,704
Turn off

602
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,056
That's all

603
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,616
I cannot control myself I am going to

604
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,664
To sync my own ship

605
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:02,528
That is exactly what I need help from the button

606
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:07,136
Is if you are doing your job and you have

607
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,440
To order other people to

608
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,720
Stop

609
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,744
You need help

610
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,512
Bright

611
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:17,376
You know in the middle of this episode Alex gets

612
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,400
The text from Norm

613
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,472
Who is in Connecticut

614
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:26,336
Court and it's regarding this motion because of his Friday

615
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,640
Episode I guess what after he gets that text

616
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,992
Broadcast you are

617
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,016
Space f*****

618
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:40,416
Text yeah I mean it's it's it's weird to have him say like whatever

619
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:44,256
Automatically go to rebroadcast and then like an hour and a half later today

620
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,280
I heard

621
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:49,120
Before

622
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:52,960
Oh no

623
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:57,824
Needed to deal with it.

624
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,848
Whatever

625
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,712
Earlier on in the episode even on the Monday

626
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:07,040
Because I speculated on the last episode

627
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,832
Him having this

628
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,368
Bulshit attack on him

629
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,672
Should have made him overjoyed

630
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:18,816
Cuz this is something where he can really sink

631
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:23,936
Bluetooth.

632
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,008
His anger took him to a place that is legally ask

633
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,800
Whereas before

634
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:35,200
Smooth sailing you could have created a fun Contest out of this I've gotten a lot of publicity out of playing the victim

635
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,856
Maybe was overdoing it a little but

636
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,184
Whatever

637
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,000
Yeah I agree I agree I think

638
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,328
His feelings of transformed great right

639
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,352
Over the weekend

640
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
Into now like

641
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,192
This is like

642
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:00,544
Who knows how much like the Borg

643
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,360
That is a

644
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,432
Just could have been so good

645
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,504
Unforced error

646
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,296
Coming into play

647
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:15,392
Like I said like I don't know how much the legal fees could have been

648
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,184
Substantial amount

649
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,280
Quite frankly I have no idea

650
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
What an ass

651
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,096
Yeah

652
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,120
I wonder if

653
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:31,520
Cuz Norma said on Friday's episode 100000 dollars to go over there

654
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:39,968
For this portion of the investigation seems like that.

655
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:44,576
From Norwood

656
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,344
Number

657
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,952
Really

658
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,744
Really Fox

659
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:57,120
Alex's talking more about this headline

660
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
From

661
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,656
Repost

662
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,240
I think he has a

663
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,264
The Cradle of

664
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:04,800
Being right

665
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,872
And then a whole pound of Beacon Rock

666
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,832
Here's one of the former Federal prosecutor

667
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,856
Democratic

668
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,136
Of course

669
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,696
Material

670
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,232
BFDI

671
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:27,584
Horses were getting ready for the

672
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,656
Somebody planted it

673
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,520
But not physically

674
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,968
I have no record

675
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:47,552
Anybody record

676
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:56,768
Calling for all sorts of charges against

677
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,048
Okay

678
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,424
It's all a lie

679
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,192
And I

680
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,520
So I think that this

681
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,800
Trying to repackage

682
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,336
Do the threat is probably a

683
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,104
Exasperation

684
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:13,920
Because

685
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,736
If anybody heard what he did on Friday

686
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:20,320
And just had a normal human understanding of line

687
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:26,208
He was heavily apply again

688
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,256
That Chris Maddie and

689
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:31,328
Opposing counsel for the people who are suing him

690
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,096
Sandy Hook

691
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,376
Were the people who play

692
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,424
Like that is not

693
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,728
Up for grabs

694
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:42,336
Norm pattis his lawyer was on the show

695
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,128
He even with

696
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:50,016
Alex you're showing Chris

697
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,088
Voyeurism

698
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:01,024
Picture on the wall of on top of a shooting

699
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,656
Heatedly in been like this

700
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,472
Like when

701
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,776
Show because it is own behavior and because

702
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,312
How Norm responded to him

703
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,920
Exactly what people's accusations are

704
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,736
Alex away from

705
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,784
Going too far with it

706
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,832
Like maybe he got it out of

707
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,624
The territory where it be like

708
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:30,464
You work tonight

709
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,256
Or whatever but

710
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,048
It's really hard for Alex

711
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:34,816
2

712
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,352
Guys with a straight face

713
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,888
Sit here and say

714
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:45,824
Physically

715
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,848
Bright

716
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:51,456
So it would not matter what even if he is now trying to make the argument that I wasn't

717
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,832
My email

718
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,112
I still think that there's a

719
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,816
Jobs

720
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,632
$100,000 in legal fees just for that

721
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,288
Then they wanted to meditate

722
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,896
Dover

723
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:23,968
What was your nose

724
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:39,584
And then somebody up hardship we can't have this

725
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,288
So you even playing now there's even like a more Broad

726
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,848
Conspiracy about this Gazette

727
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,872
The event

728
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,431
Anybody believe there was a setup

729
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,455
Yeah

730
00:41:55,967 --> 00:42:02,111
People reported on it well and then the globalists are like

731
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:07,999
Reebok

732
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:08,767
Crush

733
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,815
I think this is

734
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
Insane

735
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
Waiting

736
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,727
But every episode

737
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,263
Auto guess what

738
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:23,871
We get another movie reference there because I guarantee about the maitre

739
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:29,503
When you talk about metadata all that weird little stuff that you can't read

740
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,551
Yeah cuz I wouldn't describe metadata

741
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,367
Squiggly stuff

742
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,903
You might be right

743
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,023
Broad

744
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,863
The argument

745
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,887
Set up

746
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,447
Yeah

747
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,727
One of the things

748
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,751
Uses

749
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,055
Is to argue that is the idea

750
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,359
The court told him he should be aware of what

751
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,383
He's turning over

752
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,431
2

753
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:04,831
Silver for Discovery it's generally

754
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,999
Emprise by Discovery in court

755
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:18,911
There's a spreadsheet where I have all of my Sandy Hook

756
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,471
Money

757
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,519
Should have known about that ahead of time

758
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,639
The people telling him he should have been aware of that

759
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,967
That they wanted him to open the email

760
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,247
So he would have

761
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:38,623
P***

762
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
Never

763
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:47,327
Lawyers specifically

764
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,775
Email

765
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,407
I told them all

766
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,455
What's a good God I should Norm

767
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,295
That we don't know about

768
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,831
Parallel Construction

769
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:13,183
You watch

770
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:29,311
Winning all of these cases

771
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,359
Add so in order to

772
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
2

773
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,943
Derail the case

774
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,503
Real 100%

775
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,295
Parallel

776
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,087
Construction using fun words

777
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:44,671
He's so all over the place in terms of like I'm saying I'm saying

778
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,207
I'm not hold on

779
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:49,535
I kind of am saying that

780
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:55,935
Turning read any of the ship that I gave to them

781
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:02,847
See how smart I am for not reading any of the s*** I gave

782
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,127
That's not bad

783
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,175
If I had hired a real lawyer

784
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:13,855
Nothing stupid for hiring Barnes now

785
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:23,583
This next clip reinforces my argument that I think Alex is in a really terrible place

786
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,423
We had that clip earlier were you saying that we're in real trouble we need to

787
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,983
Get the the armies coming around

788
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,287
Next clip Alex predict

789
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:44,575
Trophy

790
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:58,399
That's a tough out to break

791
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:05,311
Can you can tell the audio guy was here real soon

792
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,079
Yeah

793
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,103
I mean what would you

794
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:12,735
What would you do my bosses screaming on air

795
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,271
Book remember me find

796
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,391
Carte blanche

797
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:25,791
Rebroadcast Alex

798
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:29,375
Who has the true power now

799
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,983
What I've described as a

800
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,615
Ironic

801
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,223
On the show

802
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,271
Constitutional lawyer

803
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:51,647
A successful free-speech lawyer represents

804
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:59,839
Also very confident top lawyers representing mean

805
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,703
Weather Friday

806
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:08,031
True

807
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,559
It's all for the theater

808
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:35,167
He's going to have to be brought back to Connecticut

809
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:39,263
Connecticut to give a deposition on

810
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:44,127
Understand the last I read he has a deposition

811
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,151
Somebody has to give

812
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,175
On July 5th

813
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:50,015
So go to Connecticut for that

814
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,807
I believe

815
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,599
The trial itself

816
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,927
The trial is always off

817
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,255
I might be misremembering appetite

818
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,535
I swear I read something

819
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,839
About them setting a date and it's like

820
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
November 2020

821
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,935
I might be completely off

822
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,263
Course

823
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,847
Ridiculous spectacle

824
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,919
People who are running this trial org

825
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:21,247
I don't know if you

826
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,015
You can

827
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,087
Put everyone in isolation

828
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:27,647
But you need to

829
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:34,047
Really does seem like this this case should be held in like a on a different Island somewhere

830
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:39,935
No media no nothing record all of it Siri is 12 Birds

831
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,471
Like there's no human being

832
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,495
Should be involved

833
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:46,079
Record all of it but don't tell anyone about what happened to tell us over

834
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,967
There's no shenanigans

835
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:56,063
No one should be able to interfere

836
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,927
I'm here on that June

837
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,207
June 7th 18th

838
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,255
Alex comes in

839
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,023
For break with some

840
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,559
Terrifying noises

841
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,839
CityPlace very often

842
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:09,887
Never place

843
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:20,639
25 years

844
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,271
Barking dogs

845
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,415
Panera

846
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,695
He plays are Ritz IRA

847
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,327
So that's

848
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,095
That's good presentation

849
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,399
He talks about

850
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,679
Connecticut

851
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,215
I'm a

852
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:48,031
You know arguably misleading headline

853
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:54,943
What's interesting about this one of the criticisms we have about Alex the show

854
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:57,759
Is Vicki engages with news

855
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,039
Media on

856
00:49:59,295 --> 00:49:59,807
Headlines

857
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,343
He doesn't read

858
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,159
Only knows maybe a sentence

859
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,511
Whatever it is is a fact

860
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,815
Projector

861
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,351
Everybody else

862
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,143
Which I think is a rationalization

863
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:17,727
Infer why he does what he does

864
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,519
Makes it sound like

865
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,871
There's just so much happening and then meanwhile

866
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:27,199
The Wall Street Journal

867
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,319
Alex Jones

868
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:42,047
That's all

869
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,583
It says

870
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,655
VI says the emails were sent to Jones

871
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:50,495
But

872
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,567
They do it at the bottom knowing full well

873
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,615
Organized fraud

874
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,455
Almost

875
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,551
Both people

876
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,439
25%

877
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,975
Erratic

878
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,511
Article

879
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,559
No faith in your audience

880
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,119
If that's the position

881
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,703
I am I mean like if the article is

882
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,471
Fair

883
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,751
It's actually reporting

884
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,287
Then

885
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,567
I don't

886
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,335
I don't know

887
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:28,639
I have I have little patience

888
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,687
But it's what Alex is at Iraq

889
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,527
I do find one thing that he said.

890
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,831
Which is

891
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,599
Articles

892
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,671
And the way that their heads

893
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,695
And operate

894
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,231
That does

895
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,303
Because if you're for sure

896
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,863
Alex Jones

897
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,471
And you're talking about it from The New York Times or the post

898
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,519
That is b******* I did not

899
00:51:55,775 --> 00:52:00,895
Consider that whatsoever

900
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:04,479
Play I can't imagine someone

901
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:10,111
Seeing that headline not being able to read the article and not hunting down another article they could read

902
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:14,719
With the same primary reporting

903
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:19,071
A surprising number of people

904
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,863
Right it's that whole thing

905
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,631
The second step

906
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,655
Most people don't take

907
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:26,495
Possibly but I also think

908
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:31,103
Maybe a hundred articles I've never read because they're on the Washington Post

909
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,407
I still know what they say cuz I found

910
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:36,735
Another article the person

911
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,551
Who's receiving the information it's unfortunate

912
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,111
New York Times and Washington Post business model

913
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:44,927
Understand what

914
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:50,815
I don't know if they were the only f****** news outlets that this would be a good Ark

915
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,351
Of course but I don't think it is

916
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:58,751
I'm just saying that I had not considered that as a side effect

917
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,847
You just scroll through headlines

918
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:09,503
I agree I agree on that

919
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,271
Name articles

920
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:13,855
Because there is too much of the

921
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:19,999
Scroll through effects or whatever you know you see the headline you internalize whatever it says that fact

922
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:20,767
To getting

923
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:21,791
Astoria

924
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,815
Guilty of that

925
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,911
I tried to be more aware that now but like yeah absolutely

926
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,447
Susceptible

927
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,215
Just like

928
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:39,199
Where they share an article after only a couple of paragraphs

929
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,247
Sure

930
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,271
It happens

931
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,063
So in the next

932
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,111
Insult

933
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,135
Flying around about this

934
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:57,119
Erroneously

935
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,751
Serious publication

936
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:14,015
It already reported days before

937
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:15,807
Spell situation

938
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:21,439
And big influential social media

939
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,231
Unnoticed

940
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,631
For the New York Times

941
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,983
Currently only respected publication

942
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:51,391
Some local publication to print some headline

943
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:03,423
Weigel's Halfway Around the World

944
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,287
Whatever

945
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:11,359
Bums me out that bothers me is that like

946
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,663
Most of the information

947
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,431
Is the sea

948
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,503
Of those stories that came out on Friday

949
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,783
From The Daily Beast

950
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,063
Easton other Publications

951
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,087
Reporting on Alex

952
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,903
And the ones that were recording

953
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,183
On Monday

954
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,975
Just with a different headline

955
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:29,023
The 8th of the same information

956
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,559
I'm just from a slightly different angle

957
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:36,703
Alex is I'm the victim of a conspiracy or someone set the illegal pornography it was discovered by

958
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,751
These lawyers in the Epic

959
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,543
Then on Monday

960
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,847
Velour

961
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,615
Discovery

962
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:46,175
Information that got sent over Alex

963
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:52,831
Illegal pornography we went over it and there's no indication that he met or anything

964
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:53,599
Like that

965
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,159
The same information

966
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,695
Is presented slightly different

967
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,047
It's it's

968
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,071
It's annoying

969
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,935
Down one level and then I understand that it's also probably annoying as our show

970
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:08,959
But it's just

971
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,983
Constantly

972
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,263
Him and Barnes

973
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,543
And Alex

974
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,567
And Alex

975
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:15,871
Send Alex repeating that over and over again

976
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,151
But it did that intention

977
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,943
Because I think it isn't

978
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:21,247
To know

979
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,295
This is what being driven into his body

980
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:26,367
But it's not as important

981
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,159
The point behind it

982
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,975
Is that out loud

983
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,743
In this next

984
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,095
Everybody's not having to ask a question

985
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:40,447
Complete fabrication by the most powerfulest

986
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,575
So

987
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,855
Did on ironic

988
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,879
Goodwork Barn

989
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:02,719
This is what it's all about it's the idea of creating

990
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:04,511
Plausible

991
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,791
Reasonable Doubt

992
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,095
Or something like that

993
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,631
The idea of

994
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,679
This headline was Miss

995
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:18,079
Information

996
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,359
It's all fake

997
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:25,759
How much do you really know about Alex everything probably alive right now

998
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:28,063
Right now this is the joy that should have

999
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,087
Come on Friday

1000
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:31,903
This is what this is what he would have

1001
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:37,279
F****** dined out on because

1002
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,303
What'd

1003
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:44,703
I'm here just trying to lay low for a few days and then I'll bring it back and I'll slam it

1004
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,751
I have no Epic

1005
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:53,407
I mean is why you pay Barnes

1006
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:58,527
And it's so manipulative awesome

1007
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:02,367
In terms of

1008
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:06,207
Elation is about deep down

1009
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:09,023
Creating the idea about Alex Jones

1010
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:12,351
Headline

1011
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,679
Sticky Lips

1012
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,703
She doesn't actually

1013
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:19,775
I don't know I'm trying to come up with absurd examples of like

1014
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,823
Blow your mind facts about Alex

1015
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,199
It's very

1016
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,223
Yeah

1017
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:31,551
A lot of My Cousin Vinny

1018
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:36,927
I just like

1019
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,999
I don't think this is going to help

1020
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:41,023
At all

1021
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,815
But it's very

1022
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,351
Good for retain

1023
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,887
The author business

1024
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,191
Squaw Valley

1025
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:48,959
Makes an announcement

1026
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,519
About another sort of social me

1027
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,287
Media things

1028
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,055
Reviews on

1029
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,615
This led me down a rabbit hole

1030
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,551
Cubs.com

1031
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,575
Forward slash

1032
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,879
Alex Jones.

1033
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,415
Subscribestar

1034
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,023
Please go there

1035
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:25,823
$15,000 or $20,000

1036
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:29,407
But you're something else

1037
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,943
Real money

1038
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,783
When you subscribe

1039
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,815
You don't need a hotel room

1040
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:48,607
Silly

1041
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:51,423
Successive

1042
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,447
Yeah

1043
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:59,103
So this is this is another piece

1044
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,127
Another one

1045
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,151
Subscribestar

1046
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:01,919
What is

1047
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,711
Episode

1048
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:07,039
Recently talking about being a really bad financial

1049
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,087
On all three of these episodes

1050
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,879
He's doing so many goddamn commercial

1051
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,671
Ads are flying around like

1052
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:14,975
Nuts

1053
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:19,583
And he's even started a save Infowars emergency sale where everything is

1054
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,887
Everything is free shipping

1055
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,423
Aunt double Patriot points

1056
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:26,239
No way wow listen

1057
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,519
This is not good

1058
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,311
The cash that's not good

1059
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:34,175
Perhaps even worse than all that is this news that he's decided to join a crowdfunding web

1060
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,223
That's for people like us

1061
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:36,991
Who don't pretend

1062
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:37,759
4 second

1063
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:38,527
To be successful

1064
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40,831
And who advertisers have no interest in

1065
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:42,111
It's not for the alleged

1066
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,135
King of ratings

1067
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,951
The biggest thing in the world like Alex Jones presents

1068
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:51,071
Subscribestar is a patreon for people who are too big of assholes to be on paper

1069
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:56,703
You might find people like Sargon of akkad there that that variety of folk

1070
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:59,775
I'm sure there are some other people who use the site who are

1071
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,055
Crazy racist

1072
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,591
Buckhead lunatic

1073
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,895
But until its most prominent

1074
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,663
People's consciousness

1075
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,943
Because it's become the home

1076
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:10,527
For people who've been kicked off other crowdfunding websites because they're too big

1077
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:13,087
Witches says all you need to know about

1078
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:17,951
I don't know I actually don't know that I wouldn't be surprised but I don't know enough about it

1079
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,999
I would imagine

1080
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,559
At least

1081
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:29,471
I understand why people like Sargon would try to rebuild their crowdfunding on a new platform

1082
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,751
Because it all he's got

1083
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,823
He's someone who's in desperate need of a way to monetize it

1084
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,919
And if this is the place that happened

1085
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,503
Alex Jones is a million-dollar Studio

1086
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,807
He's presumably operation

1087
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,599
It's very Unbecoming for him

1088
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:48,159
The crowdfunding website to run his s***

1089
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,975
Go go to make a movie

1090
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:51,999
Doesn't feel like

1091
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:52,767
The proper use of

1092
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:58,143
I decided to check in on Alex's subscribestar account

1093
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:01,215
If things don't look great for him over there

1094
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:04,287
Has been active since at least May 15th

1095
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,055
2019

1096
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,591
As of this Thursday

1097
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,895
He is only 129 people

1098
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:09,663
Subscribing to him

1099
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:13,503
Open shared on social media

1100
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,271
12 time

1101
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:17,087
This is almost non-existent engaged

1102
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,135
Consider how large

1103
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:19,903
Pretences audio

1104
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,743
He claims he has millions upon millions of listeners

1105
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:27,583
Right now Alex is all over the cultural zeitgeist

1106
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:32,191
Very very aware that he's in the middle of a legal battle

1107
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,727
Video sing without it

1108
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,519
Will support his days are numbered

1109
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:42,687
People out of them 129

1110
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,223
Have answered the call to action

1111
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:47,039
They're probably already

1112
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,319
Auto-ship

1113
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,599
You don't know

1114
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:51,391
It's true Garrison has a

1115
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,415
Subscribestar

1116
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,951
Downers

1117
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,487
Owen Shroyer has 50

1118
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:58,303
T3 Jordan Peterson has 65

1119
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,863
Mark Dice is coming into the hot 36

1120
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,655
Stefan molyneux has 20

1121
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,423
7

1122
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,983
Laura lubbers got 29 people on board

1123
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:09,823
S*** subscribestar itself has a subscribestar account

1124
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:13,407
Subscribers

1125
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:18,015
Tehran

1126
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:20,063
They will all work for subscribestar

1127
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:20,831
Perhaps

1128
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:25,695
Given those numbers you might be inclined to say what that website clearly has 130 people on it

1129
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:32,607
Do you know the ones on there

1130
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:34,911
Got 53 people but if that's out of 100

1131
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:38,239
A huge percentage

1132
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,591
Cuz there's some people who are doing pretty well on there

1133
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:46,687
Paul Joseph Watson has 1992 subscribers

1134
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,479
And Sargon has something around

1135
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:52,575
3000 interesting about that is that there exists

1136
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,111
Proves that success is

1137
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:58,975
Possible on that platform and there are more people then are subscribing

1138
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:00,767
Suit

1139
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:03,327
Interesting

1140
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,119
Doesn't have a monopoly

1141
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:07,167
Because of their success

1142
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,959
They disapprove

1143
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,239
The very idea

1144
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:16,639
Of their assumed

1145
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:23,039
They proved that none of these other people who are listed are in anyway

1146
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,087
The victims of some sort of a

1147
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,879
Tech Monopoly or anything

1148
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:29,951
Like that if they had active engaged

1149
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:30,975
Who's like Sargon

1150
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,511
And Paul Joseph Watson

1151
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:34,559
They would probably be able to rise

1152
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,607
And they just don't

1153
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:37,887
Yeah that's

1154
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,655
Not surprising

1155
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:39,935
It's interesting

1156
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,471
The victim

1157
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:43,775
Fellow Travelers

1158
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,567
Of Sargon and Paul Joseph Watson

1159
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,103
Is he

1160
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:48,383
By their own success

1161
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,199
They have really demonstrated

1162
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,015
All those arguments are silly

1163
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:59,647
On the other hand

1164
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,695
Such a huge

1165
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,975
Because

1166
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,255
It's really Ali has

1167
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:10,655
So he has to pimp that out quite a bit more where is Alex I noticed

1168
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,959
Until

1169
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:16,799
Reasons for pushing.

1170
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,079
Right

1171
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:18,847
Heavily

1172
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:21,407
Yeah I were talking

1173
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,687
Even now they're still

1174
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:27,295
Least two days later from one that episode aired

1175
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,183
I come from a land of

1176
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,719
Expecting nothing

1177
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,863
You do a comedy show

1178
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:45,727
People show up to a bar if you have millions

1179
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:49,055
Digital 100

1180
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,079
Very different

1181
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:52,383
Then 129 people in a bar

1182
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:58,783
People show up

1183
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,343
That's great

1184
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,415
It's real it's real interesting

1185
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,951
To me this this order thing

1186
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:08,511
It leads me to have some

1187
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,047
Pretty serious suspicion

1188
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:10,815
It's about the size of

1189
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:14,655
We could be

1190
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:17,215
I'm punching down territory

1191
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,751
I don't know it's

1192
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:21,823
It's one of those things

1193
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,103
You would expect

1194
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:27,455
Be very different if the reality

1195
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,247
I don't know what to do

1196
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,527
That looks more concert

1197
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,295
6 Clues

1198
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,831
But in the snow

1199
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,599
Text Cliff Alex

1200
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,623
Drive home

1201
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:35,647
The point that Norm

1202
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:37,951
Barn

1203
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,999
The Barnes has made about this

1204
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,839
Calling into question everything

1205
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,399
You think you know you have no idea

1206
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,423
Dakota MTV

1207
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:00,223
Is totally false

1208
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,759
Is there someone who is the victim

1209
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:06,623
It was completely

1210
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:13,791
Is it raise questions because

1211
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:19,935
Various members of the dissident president pointing out his this is exactly what

1212
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:30,431
Illicit activity being covered up by those

1213
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:32,479
Institutional power

1214
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,343
But often do more harm than good

1215
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:49,631
Institutional members of the brat

1216
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:06,015
So I apologize I thought that

1217
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:08,831
Express

1218
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:15,487
But that's why this distinction is really important at the headline is technically correct

1219
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:20,095
Post has lied about Alex

1220
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,119
Fair

1221
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,399
It's all about the U

1222
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,751
Responding to what is it

1223
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:27,775
People's minds

1224
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:30,335
As opposed to what the Connecticut Post actually

1225
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,895
That distinction is very important

1226
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,711
Yeah I have a newfound respect for

1227
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,623
I just

1228
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,951
Exactly like a

1229
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,487
Evil lawyer

1230
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:49,279
Like he is he is

1231
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:51,839
Hamming up his part

1232
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,399
I thought it was just kind of

1233
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:55,167
Bloviating

1234
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:04,895
I know that there are multiple facets

1235
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,199
Hours of him

1236
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:09,503
The first time today

1237
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:17,695
Yeah cuz this is mrs. the ANS far as pain goes this is pretty good I do still think it's

1238
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,231
To claim victory from the jaws of defeat

1239
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,583
Alright

1240
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,351
Dave

1241
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:26,655
Beta

1242
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,935
Misleading

1243
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:30,495
Potentially misleading headlight about you

1244
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,031
How do we

1245
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,055
Spins

1246
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,079
Into

1247
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:40,479
Everything you've ever said is actually accurate

1248
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,247
Little thread

1249
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:45,343
Tapestry of b*******

1250
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,623
It's a big swing

1251
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,439
So

1252
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:51,999
Text Clint we get off all this stuff Barnes leaves

1253
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:54,303
Alex is going to come back with a coup de gras

1254
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,071
Photograph

1255
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,631
Recovering the news

1256
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,167
Okay

1257
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:02,751
Not too long ago and he said that

1258
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:05,311
Michelle Obama's going to come out of nowhere be the Democratic

1259
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:10,431
Alex is still focused on Joe Biden

1260
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,199
Pool

1261
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,735
I enjoy Joe

1262
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,015
Had a

1263
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:15,039
Little little little

1264
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:16,831
Recently

1265
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:31,167
This is one you can hear

1266
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:34,495
That's Amore

1267
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:41,663
There's nothing you can do

1268
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:48,063
Start a real physical Revolution to do talking about it

1269
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,343
Narcissist

1270
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:54,975
Cut off real quick real quick

1271
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,047
So

1272
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:03,423
First of all I have zero interest in defending to buy

1273
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:09,567
It's going on and on about the media dishonestly characterizing the situation

1274
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:15,967
Immediately preceding to dishonestly characterized by standing

1275
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:18,527
Send the problem

1276
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:22,367
Edit clip and took it out of I think someone else

1277
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:25,951
He just was like

1278
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:32,351
Fair enough specifically let's start a real physical Revolution as an example of something

1279
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:35,935
It's going to do that was a bad idea

1280
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,215
Who's the contact with him

1281
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:41,311
Explaining that there's a whole lot of negotiating that could be done with a GOP

1282
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,591
What we do

1283
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:46,431
Specifically while doing the quote within our system cutouts

1284
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:48,223
Let's start

1285
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:50,271
Real physical Revolution is almost

1286
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,551
Insult coming out of Biden

1287
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:56,671
That is exactly what he might as well

1288
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:59,999
That's exactly what I read that headline

1289
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,791
Yeah he's doing one of the

1290
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,839
Strong defense

1291
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:04,607
Compromising

1292
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,375
GOP

1293
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:08,447
This is covered by someone like Alex Jones

1294
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:12,031
As if you were triggering a literal communist violent

1295
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:12,799
Yeah

1296
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:13,823
This is the perfect

1297
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,663
They will go on for an

1298
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,711
Our about how they're the victim of the

1299
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:22,527
The media then without missing a Beat

1300
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:27,391
Just targeting the person that there are

1301
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,159
Indigo actor

1302
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:33,279
It's hypocrisy on wardline will put more accurately its profound level of psychological abuse

1303
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:35,071
To subject anyone who trusts

1304
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:39,423
Two completely separate realities are created just by edit exact clip

1305
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:41,471
People who see Biden's.

1306
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,007
To see a guy who forbetterorworse

1307
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,055
Probably worse isn't dorson copper

1308
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,591
Working within the system

1309
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,383
The people who see the right-wing

1310
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:49,919
Reverse like the one Alex

1311
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,711
Display

1312
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:55,295
Will think the lamest of all candidates of the democratic field

1313
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:58,623
Is an out-and-out radical just waiting to let loose his shocked

1314
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:00,671
This

1315
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,951
Separation of folk

1316
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:04,511
Is all Alex's ever really itchy

1317
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:05,535
His life

1318
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:09,119
All the more ironic

1319
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:12,447
Coming from comments of

1320
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:14,751
We need to reach across the aisle and work with these

1321
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:20,639
Across the island work with the guy who literally just cut you saying

1322
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,407
That

1323
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:27,807
Incorrect statement

1324
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,831
Right

1325
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:34,975
You're not going to reach across the aisle by there's an even more interesting Dynamic to it

1326
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:40,095
Calling for a violent revolution

1327
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:46,239
Sushi mischaracterizing the actual like

1328
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:49,311
Everyone

1329
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:55,711
Every one of his basement characters

1330
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:59,295
Further mischaracterize by Alex

1331
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,575
Apply the jokes

1332
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:03,647
Is the violent communist uprising

1333
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:11,839
Yeah it's not it's just the same s*** from the Obama

1334
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:12,607
Matter

1335
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,375
How hard

1336
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:16,703
Compromise

1337
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,983
It doesn't matter

1338
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:21,567
They are going to call you a violent evil social

1339
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,591
The road must

1340
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:25,663
Twisted for some reason

1341
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:31,551
Unpleasant

1342
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:34,367
It's it really only like

1343
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:36,415
Just f****** lean into it man

1344
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:39,999
Say what you think is the right thing to do and don't give up

1345
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,791
What they're going to call it

1346
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:44,607
Yeah cuz they're just going to call it something

1347
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:50,495
So b a violent revolution

1348
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,031
So now when did

1349
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,311
Revolution.com

1350
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,359
I mean you got to be worried about the

1351
01:14:58,687 --> 01:14:59,199
I think you should

1352
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,991
You don't need to

1353
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:04,063
Because the globalist who found a way to paralyze

1354
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,439
People fighting Lucian

1355
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:16,095
Because they tried to make it along racial lines so that minorities were the majority of us.

1356
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,375
Don't feel like

1357
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,911
They could be part of Americana

1358
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,479
It's just a

1359
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:37,343
Shut down so very very very very quiet everybody

1360
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,207
Everybody

1361
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:43,999
About all of this

1362
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,815
We're going into the season of War

1363
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,119
And

1364
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:55,263
Fraud

1365
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:56,543
And

1366
01:15:56,799 --> 01:16:00,127
Monster Gear

1367
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:09,855
Broadcast exactly what you wanted that's not crazy if that's

1368
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:18,303
Start a revolution Reddit

1369
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:29,055
What he just did right there should be like blaming the globalist

1370
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:33,663
Characterizing all of this

1371
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:38,271
That's why the minorities don't get it right

1372
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,039
Being a

1373
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:42,623
Perfect transaction that is perpetrated on a daily basis

1374
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,463
You have an interesting perspective

1375
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,999
It's disgusting

1376
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,279
That is so

1377
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:58,751
Sort of white

1378
01:16:59,007 --> 01:16:59,775
Going to get way worse

1379
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,335
Riverside School

1380
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:04,127
Pretend he's going to

1381
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:04,895
2

1382
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:06,687
Connecticut Post

1383
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,223
Which is

1384
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:18,463
Idle threats but Alex makes about lawcraft

1385
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:21,023
Dishwasher

1386
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,839
Eh

1387
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,935
They're the ones

1388
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,727
But pulled out

1389
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:33,567
Information statement

1390
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:36,639
Another judge whether she's

1391
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:39,711
Goes with it as if it came out of the mouth of God

1392
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,759
That's not a good idea to insult the judge

1393
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:46,367
Million dollars for the head of this lawyer

1394
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:53,535
The child born

1395
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,839
We don't know who it is

1396
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:58,911
That I'm mad at them

1397
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,447
Because

1398
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:03,007
The discovery process

1399
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,543
Calling

1400
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:09,151
Manipulate

1401
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:12,991
Nigeria

1402
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:16,319
Jen says apology from here

1403
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,391
Falls chart

1404
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:24,511
Oh I'm sorry

1405
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:30,911
The family

1406
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:40,895
The lawyer sent that very suspicious

1407
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:46,783
The figure of speech okay

1408
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:51,903
Anybody who got the message the idea that

1409
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,927
The families

1410
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,535
Misreading of

1411
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:02,399
About that appearance

1412
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:05,727
Because that would be a profoundly f***** up

1413
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:08,287
So if people were accusing them

1414
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,311
Above that

1415
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:10,847
The paper was actually saying

1416
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:11,871
I would

1417
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:16,735
Responding very poorly today

1418
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:21,599
Yeah yeah

1419
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:28,255
More information about that idea

1420
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,279
Threaten this lawyer

1421
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,303
Chris Madden

1422
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,679
I think this would be tough

1423
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,447
To argue

1424
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,471
Not on the radio

1425
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,775
The Connecticut

1426
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:41,567
Post

1427
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,895
I was talking about this

1428
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:59,999
Yes face with all the table give me a break

1429
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:09,215
Give me a break here that again for Friday's show

1430
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,775
Just to show how much is a f****** b*******

1431
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:17,920
The point is somebody directed child pronography into your email account

1432
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:21,504
Hoping that you would open it so that when you opened it there would be direct

1433
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:26,880
Evidence that you would viewed knowingly and his board

1434
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:29,440
Out of hundreds of thousands of emails they got

1435
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:35,072
And I know right where to go what a nice group of Democrats how surprising

1436
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:38,400
What nice people Chris married

1437
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:41,472
Chris Maddie zoom in on

1438
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:47,360
Careers Maddie

1439
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:55,040
What a good boy

1440
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:57,600
You think you'll put on me

1441
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:06,048
Happened to be on the

1442
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:08,096
Free poster that anyone would say

1443
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:11,680
Target

1444
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:16,032
He literally stopped himself from saying I'm going to kill it

1445
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,712
Aii wouldn't

1446
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:29,600
I Wouldn't Die on that hill but it does sound more like a probably

1447
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,904
This is

1448
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:36,768
The idea that the article just happened to be on camera

1449
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:41,632
I also you are going to Alex

1450
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:45,216
This to me is indicative of how serious you realized

1451
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:45,984
This is this is

1452
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,032
Like he really needs

1453
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,056
To try and dance

1454
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:53,408
I was implying that the opposing counsel should be

1455
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,712
Killed for a million-dollar

1456
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,528
I need that

1457
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:00,064
Because otherwise

1458
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:15,168
Unfortunately

1459
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:25,152
Really really

1460
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:30,528
Is bleak

1461
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:34,624
What happened on Friday

1462
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,904
On his Friday show

1463
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,208
And in this new retelling

1464
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:42,304
He was behind it it was the global life

1465
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:48,960
DJ support our reporters

1466
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:51,776
Mix everything together

1467
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,848
Persecuted

1468
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:05,600
You know like like I knew what was going off on email somebody sent me on Spotify.

1469
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,792
And because of the

1470
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:21,728
Come out

1471
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,032
They're trying to get me charged

1472
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:27,360
About Sandy Hook

1473
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:29,152
Never opened

1474
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,528
Scared

1475
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,768
Add look at the hundred-thousand-dollar reward

1476
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,960
What is approved for the temperature

1477
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:54,752
Dollars extra

1478
01:23:59,104 --> 01:23:59,872
So I mean

1479
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:02,688
Like if that

1480
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,736
But they never

1481
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,528
Listen to that I think

1482
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,624
Here's what I figure Rises what's going on

1483
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,416
Right now through that

1484
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:13,952
He has had it

1485
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:14,720
Clearly

1486
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:16,512
Explain to him the consequences

1487
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:17,792
For what

1488
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,584
But he cannot

1489
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,608
Comprehend

1490
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,680
What he did to me on Friday

1491
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:27,776
He's had it explained it clearly comprehend

1492
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:29,824
What he did that was wrong

1493
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,616
He has to like

1494
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:34,176
This isn't him spinning I don't think I think

1495
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,480
That they are

1496
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:38,528
Doing that they planted the

1497
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:39,808
The child Corner whatever

1498
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:42,624
And that's what they're doing with everything else

1499
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,232
He still thinks

1500
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:48,512
The people who are trying

1501
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:49,792
Because he thinks that

1502
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:55,424
Running the law firm that suing him

1503
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:58,752
I think he has to

1504
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,800
I just don't know if

1505
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:06,688
I don't know what he believes is going on it and one of the difficulties is like

1506
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,224
These nuts

1507
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:12,064
Yeah I mean how delusional is

1508
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:16,672
That's a difficult line to figure out exactly

1509
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:17,440
Tuna steak

1510
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:18,976
Spend

1511
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:20,768
Don't know

1512
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,328
But if you just go based on the things

1513
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,120
He believes

1514
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,144
Yeah Hillary Clinton

1515
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,472
And the globalist are behind the law firms that are suing

1516
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:35,616
So even if you shifted from I don't believe it's these lawyers butts part of the

1517
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:38,688
Still the people who are suing

1518
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,992
Spirit victimization

1519
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:44,320
Fabfitfun that even if he is apologizing

1520
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:47,136
Or trying to deflect blame back to the globalist

1521
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,928
He's already called them global

1522
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:52,768
Escape

1523
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,560
No just rephrase

1524
01:25:54,816 --> 01:26:00,192
There's one party that does get the blame and maybe accurately so and that is

1525
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,216
You cut them French

1526
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:08,896
Well you can call on our Monday episode going over his Friday episode

1527
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:14,528
These French people are there

1528
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:19,136
I just thought it was the weirdest non-sequitur Friday's episode.

1529
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:23,232
If you'd let a fridge grew in there that he regretted

1530
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,072
How do you

1531
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:31,680
Talked a little bit more about that okay

1532
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:34,496
He was too much French vanilla French people

1533
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:50,880
Play Slayer

1534
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:59,328
They said they were coming here

1535
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:08,288
Projo

1536
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:18,272
What's the volcano goes off

1537
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,856
You need help

1538
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:24,160
Really real

1539
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:26,720
Field merchandise

1540
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:27,488
Psychiatric

1541
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:30,304
Or

1542
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,072
Yoga

1543
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:39,008
Fix Scott Hall up

1544
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:40,032
You can help Alex

1545
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:42,080
Does miracle

1546
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:47,712
Oh my god let's start this

1547
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:52,320
Be crazy if that

1548
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:54,112
Like really turned him around

1549
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:57,696
That's a big baby.

1550
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:59,488
I know that we have

1551
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:02,304
The wrestling fan but I don't know what time

1552
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:03,584
Does

1553
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,352
Got a request

1554
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,888
How about

1555
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:11,008
Because it's already pretty earlier

1556
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,152
He talks very fatalistically a lot of

1557
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:17,920
The time

1558
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:22,784
Is where I really feel like this is this feels like a real can

1559
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:31,744
Listeners

1560
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:38,144
Oh boy

1561
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:45,312
Amethyst is dark dark days

1562
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,848
I can't really feel again but

1563
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:51,456
So I think

1564
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:53,760
In line with your ideas like

1565
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:56,064
He does understand the severity of the situation

1566
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:57,088
But he can't

1567
01:28:57,344 --> 01:29:00,416
Yeah you can't show us to admit responsibility

1568
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,976
There is a Feeling

1569
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:07,328
Might be about it

1570
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:09,120
About it

1571
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:12,192
Like far off from the actual trial

1572
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:13,984
And he's freaking out like this

1573
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,776
About something that he is

1574
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:16,800
About

1575
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,592
Like the ideas

1576
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:20,384
Emails being sent to him

1577
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,944
What the f*** is he going to do on the stand

1578
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:23,968
What the f*** is

1579
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:26,272
You going to do as the trial date gets

1580
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:29,600
Closer

1581
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:30,880
Now

1582
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,904
He's going to

1583
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:32,672
Intensify

1584
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:33,952
Like

1585
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:39,840
I think on some level what year there I have to prepare for not being on the air is

1586
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:41,376
I got to take myself out of the game

1587
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,424
Pretty much

1588
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:49,568
I don't know I feel I feel the broadcast

1589
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,872
Trust himself on the air

1590
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:54,432
That means there have to be people who are like

1591
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,200
Hey

1592
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:57,248
Maybe you shouldn't be on the air

1593
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:59,296
Maybe you shouldn't be on the air

1594
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:02,112
Maybe those people

1595
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:04,672
Rightly pointed the finger at 4 not

1596
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,744
Notes topic am I finally been like

1597
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,024
We got it

1598
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:12,352
Galaxy

1599
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,888
Maybe I don't know

1600
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:14,912
Interesting

1601
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:15,936
That'll be trans

1602
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:17,728
Now

1603
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:18,752
Connecticut

1604
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:21,312
Post article with the misleading headline

1605
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,592
Was bad

1606
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,640
Productive

1607
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,688
It what they didn't do anything wrong

1608
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:28,992
Necessarily but it's that kind of coverage of Alex

1609
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,528
That I think is awful

1610
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:32,320
Unfortunate

1611
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,136
Later in the day on June 8th

1612
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:36,416
Alex

1613
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:37,696
Exactly what he

1614
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,256
And that is someone does

1615
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:41,536
Write a false

1616
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:44,352
No

1617
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:48,960
Experience

1618
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:59,200
Wash

1619
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:03,040
What is a gentleman the top

1620
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:04,320
Story

1621
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:15,584
Is father of Sandy Hook victims lawsuit against Alex Jones

1622
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:22,496
Call nobody.

1623
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:24,288
What is the gentleman that is

1624
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,312
Totally insane

1625
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:27,104
No one's won a lawsuit

1626
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:29,408
They got the name wrong

1627
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:34,016
So what's happening here

1628
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:39,392
Can talk about this a little bit more he's arguing put out that article about him

1629
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,792
That was written by James Fetzer

1630
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:52,192
And I'm not entirely sure that might have been more family

1631
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:54,496
Against

1632
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:59,104
The writers of that book

1633
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:02,688
The Associated Press article is about that

1634
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:03,712
Is about that case

1635
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,272
Right

1636
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,040
Now

1637
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,064
MarketWatch

1638
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:10,880
Reposted the article

1639
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:11,648
Message

1640
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,952
The headline was Rewritten

1641
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:16,768
And then inviso headline

1642
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:18,048
It says ouch

1643
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:20,096
Conspiracy theorist and wrote the book

1644
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:22,656
Completely

1645
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:23,680
F***** up

1646
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:27,776
Totally wrong yet the body

1647
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:30,336
Adjust

1648
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,616
Rewrote the headline

1649
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:33,920
Did the worst job possible

1650
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:35,712
And I don't know how this is possible

1651
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:36,992
But

1652
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:40,064
Thursday morning

1653
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:40,832
I checked

1654
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:44,416
That article is still up on MarketWatch

1655
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,816
And I think there's a reason why

1656
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:52,096
We'll get to that here in a little bit

1657
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:53,632
But

1658
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,424
The globalist

1659
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:57,472
Wrote this story

1660
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:58,752
As a magical

1661
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,824
Okay it's lesser Magic

1662
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:07,456
Who's there

1663
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:10,016
Weird Harry Potter magic is only a call

1664
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:25,120
Level get Barnes on owassa taking over right now

1665
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:27,424
Or the judges try to figure out how to put me in jail

1666
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,496
Get me Robert Barr

1667
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:34,080
Just on

1668
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:35,872
I can get double billed

1669
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:38,944
City auditor

1670
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:39,968
Over at MarketWatch

1671
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:44,832
MarketWatch

1672
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:45,856
Dubious

1673
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:48,416
Stuff over there by Alex Jones

1674
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,720
Various topics

1675
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:52,512
Seat covers

1676
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:53,536
Barely

1677
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:54,816
Regularly

1678
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:55,840
So

1679
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,608
I don't know

1680
01:33:56,864 --> 01:34:00,960
I think it's just a huge backup on whoever is that a MarketWatch yeah

1681
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:02,496
Unacceptable

1682
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,360
Boneheads

1683
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:12,224
You just gave Alex exactly what you need

1684
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:19,392
If I were Alex I would say that they were working with Alex how do you justify you

1685
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:21,952
Victimhood

1686
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:27,328
Get one example of hundreds of Articles have the same headlight

1687
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:29,120
Not just that

1688
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:32,448
I'm guessing that is not

1689
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:34,240
Shooting at Thiessen

1690
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:35,008
Behcet's

1691
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:36,288
MarketWatch

1692
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,760
Okay because they

1693
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,320
They don't they don't follow the right

1694
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:52,160
Before we get to that we one more clip from the 18th

1695
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:53,184
It's just Alex

1696
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:59,840
And they say oh my God

1697
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,632
Will teach you Texans

1698
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:07,264
Big mouth

1699
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:15,200
Good

1700
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:22,368
Is gray Raiders

1701
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:27,488
Manly people

1702
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:37,216
Who wrote a book as an insult

1703
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:39,008
It's just MarketWatch man

1704
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:43,616
I mean it's not that I wouldn't put up with that either but like it's not everybody

1705
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:45,664
The f****** shity headline on MarketWatch

1706
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:50,784
The reasons I wanted play that clip was

1707
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:53,344
I think people could vary

1708
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:56,928
The audience

1709
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,720
Or someone in the audience

1710
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:00,000
But we take every time you

1711
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,024
Freaks out he's drunk

1712
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:02,048
That was so

1713
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:06,144
Yeah I just want to be clear that there is a very

1714
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:12,544
There's a distinction between like it's drunk

1715
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,592
Just has a little freaked out does a little voice

1716
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:16,128
Yeah very different

1717
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:20,736
So intimately familiar with somebody's quirks

1718
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:22,272
Despite having never met

1719
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:25,088
Audio is such a

1720
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:26,880
Medium you can

1721
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:28,928
You really get the sense for people's rhythms

1722
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:29,952
The pattern

1723
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,232
I think it's

1724
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,000
Alex

1725
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:33,536
He's no different

1726
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:35,328
No I think it's a common

1727
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:38,144
Experience

1728
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:42,752
You think you already know

1729
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:43,776
Yep

1730
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,568
So

1731
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:46,336
19th

1732
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:48,640
Evening of 18

1733
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,176
Trump had his rally

1734
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:52,480
Orlando

1735
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:53,760
Oh my God

1736
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:54,528
He was

1737
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:56,320
So true

1738
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:59,648
I can't wait for him to defeat Hillary in 2016

1739
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:02,464
It's going to be amazing

1740
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,024
You know he had his rally

1741
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,352
Just a bunch of clips

1742
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,120
Rally

1743
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:11,680
Start stalking

1744
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:12,704
About her Trump

1745
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:13,728
Throwback

1746
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:18,080
Three now

1747
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:23,456
From a very conservative family

1748
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:26,272
Old-fashioned is father and mother

1749
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:28,064
Nothing

1750
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:33,440
It's good to have

1751
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:34,976
Because

1752
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:41,632
What's a corrupt

1753
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,192
System cancer from within

1754
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,984
Sophie

1755
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:48,032
Part to square that

1756
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:50,080
Trump's dad

1757
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:51,104
Ideas

1758
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:51,872
Eugenics

1759
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:55,712
Lot of those other elements

1760
01:37:56,992 --> 01:38:00,320
He's a real throwback to Herbert Hoover

1761
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:01,600
Weasel

1762
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:03,904
Prices Express throwback

1763
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:10,304
To like the good part of America

1764
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:11,840
Does

1765
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:12,864
And the throwbacks

1766
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,400
To the good part of America is

1767
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,704
The part where Trump said that the Central Park five

1768
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,472
Should BX

1769
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:21,056
I think that's what I'm pretty sure

1770
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:25,152
So awesome. There's a lot of talk about whether or not

1771
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:26,176
Camp

1772
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:26,944
Where people are

1773
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:28,992
Weather there

1774
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:29,760
Concentration

1775
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,296
I have no

1776
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,832
I hate everyone

1777
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:38,976
I think Alex is probably be worse than go on it

1778
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:45,376
NBC and CNN

1779
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:49,984
That

1780
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:52,288
It's a giant concentration camp

1781
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,872
Another line

1782
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,504
Father the devil

1783
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:08,928
Concentration camp

1784
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:19,168
We got it

1785
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:20,960
Definition

1786
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:27,616
People are trying to emigrate here are go whatever happens so that is exactly

1787
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:33,760
I think I prefer that argument to split hairs over

1788
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:39,392
When you start to look at it a little bit more falls apart

1789
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:43,744
Because I mean like let's start killing

1790
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,024
People

1791
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:48,608
While they want to make

1792
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:51,680
Yeah it's stupid stupid

1793
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:53,216
German away that I prefer

1794
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,776
Sure I made it still just jumped

1795
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:56,544
Defying

1796
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,080
Atrocious

1797
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:02,944
Because

1798
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:06,272
The closest thing to Alex

1799
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:07,808
Expressing

1800
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:10,624
The white supremacy peeing mask

1801
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:11,392
Des

1802
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:15,232
I think

1803
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:21,632
You could make a pretty strong argument that this is even though Alex

1804
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:30,592
This is about Christianity versus Islam

1805
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:33,152
At the same time whatever it is

1806
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:33,920
If

1807
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:36,480
My team is superior

1808
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,440
Themselves

1809
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:48,768
If we were doing it to

1810
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:50,560
Thousand years before

1811
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:52,608
Christianity change that

1812
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:55,936
And then due process rule of law changed all that

1813
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:57,984
Fourth hour today I'm going to be hosting

1814
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,264
I'm going to get into

1815
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:00,544
The rule of law

1816
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:07,712
Is committing suicide and maybe too far gone but can we can still have

1817
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:08,992
Pockets of the West

1818
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:11,552
Ultra

1819
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:14,624
But if you don't show up

1820
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:17,952
You will be destroyed

1821
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:18,976
Bye

1822
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:21,536
The system that are inferior

1823
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:27,168
Systems that are superior or be destroyed

1824
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:28,960
So f***** up

1825
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:32,544
Also did you just

1826
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:39,200
Always

1827
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,040
Jordan

1828
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:47,392
That's white nationalist the s*** he's calling people Savages

1829
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:48,160
Christian

1830
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:50,208
Robin

1831
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:52,000
Is really like to just make up their own head

1832
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:56,608
Lovett they are big fan

1833
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:58,912
Did I really find the most troubling

1834
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:01,728
Is actually the part where he says it's not about

1835
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:05,824
Says

1836
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,616
You have to recognize that

1837
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:14,528
Superior systems celebrate

1838
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:16,576
You can hang

1839
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:19,648
But if you don't recognize

1840
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:20,928
That are westerns

1841
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:21,696
System

1842
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:23,744
Is this

1843
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:27,584
Winn-Dixie

1844
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,864
Lacquer

1845
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:33,984
Yep you got to understand that there's a hierarchy Dan and they truly believed

1846
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:36,800
It's the that's that's a troubling thing

1847
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:37,824
Here Express

1848
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:38,592
So

1849
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:39,360
Open

1850
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:40,384
Yeah

1851
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,920
That's

1852
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:50,624
For him

1853
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:57,792
For him to go.

1854
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:02,144
Prius versus Rollins slurs around like

1855
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:05,216
We got too much to cover

1856
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:08,544
So he gets back to this story here than

1857
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,336
So what about

1858
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,384
Setzer

1859
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:16,992
So you talk about

1860
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,112
Real good

1861
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:25,696
The front story

1862
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:36,192
And

1863
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:43,104
Call nobody.

1864
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:48,992
He's at gentleman

1865
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:51,296
What deception

1866
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,368
This is a whole globalist

1867
01:43:54,624 --> 01:44:00,000
What is the only thing you can prove you know like you got to make this look so important

1868
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:04,352
Like this is actually true

1869
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:06,400
It's really disappointing

1870
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:07,936
All in all

1871
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:09,216
But

1872
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:12,800
Is implying that there's a

1873
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:16,384
Conspiracy around pushing this one article that has a badass

1874
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:18,432
I don't know that

1875
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:22,016
That certainly was the headline I saw popping up

1876
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:22,784
Love the most

1877
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:25,344

It rhymes with

1886
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:45,568
He thinks he's doing it

1887
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,336

01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:58,784
Top of

1910
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:01,344
We're talkin 24 hours later

1911
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,368
Turn off screen

1912
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:04,416
Quitter

1913
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:06,720
The fake

1914
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:08,000
New story

1915
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:13,120
Father Sandy Hook

1916
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:19,520
So

1917
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:23,104
Either so Syracuse attributing this to the Associated Press

1918
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,384
Which is not correct

1919
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,920
Absolutely

1920
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:32,064
Which I am

1921
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:33,600
So tired of hearing

1922
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:35,392
Alex's said that

1923
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:38,464
Literally anytime looks a little bad for him

1924
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:41,024
It's an indication the Trump is about to be taken

1925
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:47,424
Fly helicopters

1926
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:53,824
Haven't heard much about that

1927
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:54,848
.

1928
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:55,872
So

1929
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:57,920
If it's nightclub it gets even more

1930
01:46:58,944 --> 01:47:01,248
What's going to happen

1931
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:03,296
Because of this one headline

1932
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:04,576
Being evidence

1933
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:05,600
Of

1934
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:06,624
The tide

1935
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:20,448
About

1936
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:25,568
None of it is true ladies and gentlemen

1937
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:27,616
What does that mean

1938
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:35,552
Do stuff like that

1939
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,744
That was a lawsuit and they go

1940
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:46,304
We called up to her if they just say staying up

1941
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:48,352
But you know it's not true

1942
01:47:57,568 --> 01:48:01,152
Associated Press

1943
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:03,456
When did marketwatch's headline

1944
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:09,856
There's nothing wrong with the Associated Press story from what I looked at it but there was a correction on it

1945
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:12,928
The story was updated like

1946
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:16,512
It's MarketWatch right you don't contact you Associated Press

1947
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:17,280
To get them to

1948
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,304
Vix

1949
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:21,632
Article that someone took from the Associated Press

1950
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:22,656
Contact

1951
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:26,496
Outlet and Alex doesn't want to do that because he walked the MarketWatch headlines

1952
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:28,288
If you want

1953
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:29,312
His cake and eat it

1954
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:35,712
No yeah that has to be it otherwise

1955
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:37,504
Otherwise his lawyers are

1956
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:43,904
Really really stupid

1957
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:52,096
Right he wants to do everything in his power to first of all

1958
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:53,888
Not mention that it's a MarketWatch

1959
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:57,984
Make sure no one contact

1960
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,032
Do you want to share a contact

1961
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:01,312
Piazza formality

1962
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:05,408
In the victimhood of a poorly-written

1963
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:09,504
Either that or his lawyers are exactly like those dumb dumb Chris

1964
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,296
Listen to email Netflix

1965
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:13,856
To try and get Amazon good Omens

1966
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:18,976
So Barnes is back

1967
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:21,280
Here on the 19th is on every day

1968
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:22,304
What is he doing

1969
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:24,096
Is raking it in

1970
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:25,632
So

1971
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:27,424
Alex

1972
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:28,960
Misrepresent

1973
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:30,752
The nature of this

1974
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:32,544
This being an Associated Press headline

1975
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:38,944
Because

1976
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:40,992
Barnes doesn't correct

1977
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:43,040
Pretty sure it's Olive

1978
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:50,464
Forest

1979
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,256
I on the other side but first off

1980
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,544
Sonos

1981
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:05,824
No doubt No Doubt

1982
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:11,968
About misrepresent MarketWatch

1983
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:13,760
Conversation of what is the

1984
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:14,784
Twitter

1985
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:18,368
I think it's all a charade

1986
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,672
Barnes is such a f******

1987
01:50:20,928 --> 01:50:22,208
Scale lawyer

1988
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:25,280
I Canna imagine

1989
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:28,096
I cannot imagine a more f******

1990
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:29,632
Uncouth lawyer

1991
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:31,424
Yeah he's so

1992
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:33,728
Yeah these making is his box

1993
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:34,496
Today though

1994
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:36,544
Dislike the idea of allowing Alex

1995
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:42,944
Representatives like my lawyers called

1996
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,224
He doesn't

1997
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:48,832
You're implying that I called them and that's what I reported they told me that's f***** up

1998
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,392
He's able to

1999
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:52,928
To build that

2000
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:57,024
If this is not true about Alex all things are up for grabs

2001
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:58,816
Like that's good work

2002
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,656
And

2003
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:04,448
It's Alex

2004
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:05,216
For the fences

2005
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:06,752
Trying to argue

2006
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:07,520
But he didn't

2007
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:09,056
Mad Houston

2008
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:11,616
That stuff even though he's very

2009
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:12,896
Barry

2010
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:14,432
Heavily implied that it was

2011
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:26,208
Correct yesterday

2012
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:31,840
So even allowing Alex

2013
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:34,400
A big part of it is like

2014
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:36,448
What we keep sort of dancing around

2015
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:37,472
A little bit

2016
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:40,288
Turning it that the idea that I think Alex realizes that like

2017
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:42,336
If allowed to stand

2018
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:44,896
The idea that I did what I did

2019
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:45,664
Is

2020
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:47,200
So f***** up

2021
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:49,504
Consequences of that could be Sosa

2022
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:53,344
And if someone hit her Christmas

2023
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:56,160
Like this like it let's assume someone

2024
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:57,952
Like I don't know if there was a rock through his way

2025
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:03,584
Violet never

2026
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:06,912
Something like that could have happened

2027
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:09,472
Consequences Alex could have face

2028
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:11,008
Would have been

2029
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:12,288
So Siri

2030
01:52:13,824 --> 01:52:14,592
Blood knot

2031
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:16,640
Forget about the idea that

2032
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:17,408
Case

2033
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:18,688
Boxing the hook

2034
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:21,248
About people

2035
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:23,040
Harass to these families

2036
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:24,576
PID

2037
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:25,600
Would be

2038
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:30,208
Might Prejudice a quart

2039
01:52:30,464 --> 01:52:31,232
About like all

2040
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:35,840
That seems to be what you do defend yourself

2041
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:37,120
People to harass

2042
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:40,192
These families put in defending yourself yourself

2043
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:43,008
People to harass the lawyer who's defending this

2044
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:49,664
That's what happened

2045
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,712
Is Baidu

2046
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:54,784
I think he recognizes how f*** to you

2047
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,320
If that don't go right

2048
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:58,624
You starting to prepare a little bit

2049
01:52:59,136 --> 01:53:01,440
The preparations are sort of 3/4

2050
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:02,208
1

2051
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:03,488
Publicly

2052
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:06,816
Tip dipping his toe into the I might be dead in a year

2053
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:08,096
Prepare to get off air

2054
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:12,192
I told the staff if I stop freaking out

2055
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:14,752
I've not heard those

2056
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:17,312
I mean some of the fatalistic I'm going to be dead soon

2057
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:24,224
Dispersion

2058
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:24,992
Say like

2059
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:26,784
I've had to get I've had to tell people

2060
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:27,552
Save me from

2061
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:30,880
Giving away any of his authority

2062
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:32,672
Saying it so public

2063
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:34,208
Bananas

2064
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:36,256
First prong of it

2065
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:38,304
Intense

2066
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:39,840
Like ads

2067
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:40,864
And sale

2068
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:41,888
Desperate

2069
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:44,192
The crowdfunding

2070
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:47,776
And all of his reporters getting on trout.

2071
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:50,336
That's not good

2072
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:52,640
Insane

2073
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:54,688
Think that Barnes is

2074
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:06,720
He's going on the show every single time I have a few really feeling like

2075
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:07,488
Just going to be like

2076
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:10,816
Hey man you got to take some time

2077
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:13,376
Best skin defense

2078
01:54:13,888 --> 01:54:17,728
I can't you know well be hosting the first three hours for the next week

2079
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:19,008
Alex Diaz

2080
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:21,312
Say getting ready to give Barnes

2081
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:27,712
C u b b right

2082
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:34,368
Might be might be trying to take over the operation

2083
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:40,768
Boris is the most evil person in this entire f****** stores

2084
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:42,560
Publication

2085
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:46,400
So that maybe

2086
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:49,984
I find this very boring

2087
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:51,776
On one level

2088
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:53,056
His response

2089
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:55,360
I think of some flare-ups that are kind of interesting

2090
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:57,664
This

2091
01:54:58,432 --> 01:54:58,944
Is

2092
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:00,224
Like a real

2093
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:04,064
Calm before something really bad

2094
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:07,136
These Trends do not go in a good direction

2095
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:09,440
The overt nest of some of this

2096
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:11,232
This white nationalism

2097
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:12,512
Is jarring

2098
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:13,536
Ring and on

2099
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:14,304
Pleasant

2100
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:19,424
Par for the course

2101
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,496
Different about it than any other time

2102
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:25,312
First of all very rare for him to

2103
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:27,104
To have a legitimate defense

2104
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:30,944
MarketWatch article and then be possibly misleading

2105
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:32,480
Connecticut Post headline

2106
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:34,528
Inaccurate

2107
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:35,296
Whatever

2108
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:42,720
I meant it's also rare

2109
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:43,744
To really

2110
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:44,768
See what appears

2111
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:47,840
Yeah like that's exactly what I was thinking

2112
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:50,144
Sincere fear he really does

2113
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:56,544
A black cuz he's not pulling the Blustery like

2114
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:58,336
This is like genuinely like

2115
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:01,152
Made

2116
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:02,688
A huge Miss

2117
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:05,248
Had

2118
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:06,016
Something

2119
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:07,808
I never have

2120
01:56:08,576 --> 01:56:09,088
I have

2121
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:11,648
Nothing and I have turn nothing into a mountain

2122
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:12,928
F****** gold

2123
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:15,744
And a one-time I am handed a layup

2124
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:20,608
Nail in the coffin

2125
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:22,144
Opposite direction

2126
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,960
Yeah

2127
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:29,824
He's going to be reliving that day for the rest of his life

2128
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,920
Like that poker hands

2129
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:37,248
100% what happens but I am now

2130
01:56:38,016 --> 01:56:38,784
Getting out of the press

2131
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:41,856
On Monday we will be back in the past

2132
01:56:42,112 --> 01:56:43,904
Cuz I'm sick of this s***

2133
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:47,488
Bahrain

2134
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:53,888
Going to have to

List of the audience

2136
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:56,960
We will not become a Robert Barnes podcast

2137
01:56:57,472 --> 01:57:00,800
I assure you of that

2138
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:05,408
We should do some more donors

2139
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:08,992
Agree with you

2140
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:10,272
First gym

2141

Not Gorka

2147
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:33,312
And that Robert could be Barnes

2148
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:39,712
Donating to our podcast just in the hopes of these diversifying

2149
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:40,736
In any way

2150
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:42,016
Take him down in anyway

2151
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:45,344
But if it is

2152
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:49,184
Goodworks

2153
