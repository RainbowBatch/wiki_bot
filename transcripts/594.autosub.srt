00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:21,248
Air Jordan

00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:25,600
I have great respect for knowledge b b

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:02,976
Dot-com

5
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:06,560

00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,912
Indeed we are dads

7
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,984
Getting a little bit of work done

8
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,264
This morning and

9
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,056
2

10
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,080
Take a little break

11
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:23,200
And I looked on YouTube and I saw that there was a new trailer for the new Matrix

12
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,248
Movie that just got released

13
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:29,856
Is today and I watched it

14
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,136
And I have some

15
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,672
Interesting thoughts about it

16
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,976
But they're the reason to Bright Spot is because

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,792
I can't wait for Alex's review

18
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:44,448
Immediately I saw this trailer on my car

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,776
Be great yeah we're going to be there

20
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,592
Yeah into now I feel like it's my responsibility

21
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,384
You would have I have to fund

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
Infowars

23
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:58,272
I have to keep them on the air if so we will buy them tickets to The Matrix

24
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:03,136
Resurrection I have been a show on the air at least until the end of the year

25
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,208
Like we can't deprive the World of Alex Jones is Mayfair

26
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:13,632
Counting down the minute when is it Wednesday so that means that we

27
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,656
We're going to get

28
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
Alex's

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
Doom review

30
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,752
We're going to get his

31
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:23,360
Matrix review I assume he's going to watch Calvin what about the live-action one

32
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:29,760
The brunette one movie no they don't even have a second movie deal yet

33
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:36,160
And he's just like I can only make the first half of this movie so I can only make the first fifteen patients f*** it I don't care

34
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,184
Don't watch it

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,232
You're not going to see how it is good f****** luck

36
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,536
I like that strategy

37
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
Yeah it was going to be

38
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:49,216
The banner end-of-the-year for Alex's Carly Rae reviews have been like

39
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:49,984
Dune

40
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
Is the movie

41
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,848
That you've always wanted to see dude made into

42
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,688
Batman excited

43
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,504
I don't know how much you can tell from

44
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,576
A single trailer but I will say

45
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:10,976
That I don't know if I need another Matrix movie that wrestles with whether or not the things he's experiencing or

46
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:15,072
Oh I can see the look that was established

47
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,144
I read a big couple time

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,984
Double back around and I like now it's actually a double secret Matrix

49
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:26,336
I'm out are you insane I just wrote that Rodger Stone

50
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:30,432
Is that the counter counter counter cool narrative that would be

51
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:31,968
Clancy

52
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
Tom Clancy

53
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
Temperature

54
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,808
FairPoint

55
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
I think they made

56
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,672
I think they wrote a spec script and it got rejected

57
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
Cuz it probably sucks

58
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:48,864
Set strip to replace Keanu Reeves character Thomas Anderson with dzx Clark

59
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:55,520
Intrepid psychologists f****** machine

60
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
Himself

61
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
That's 55

62
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,152
Dan is the

63
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,944
TV show Taskmaster

64
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,784
You mentioned this the other day I think I might have

65
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,344
So I wanted to

66
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,720
To do something out about wanting to do a British panel game show of Love qi

67
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:19,327
I was a huge fan of Stephen Fry for I will be rhyming the rest of the show

68
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,911
And get out of here

69
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,775
Taskmaster is another Bridge

70
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,335
British panel game show but the conceit behind it

71
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,871
Is this guy gets a bunch

72
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,943
New comics and it gives them this very open-ended tasks like

73
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,247
Open this thing

74
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,295
Or whatever and then they have to

75
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,599
Do it in an interesting and creative way

76
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,695
Yeah and the combination of like different personalities that they get ever

77
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,975
Retirement shares that

78
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,535
There will be Creative Solutions that are like

79
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,863
Out-of-left-field in also they'll be Solutions where somebody's like

80
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:58,751
Okay and in two seconds just two matches it with a f****** hammer and you're like well that is opening the jar that's fair

81
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:06,687
I'm freaking out right now because I legitimately can't remember if you brought this upon the show or in casual social

82
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:13,087
Conversation can't remember either way it out and I'm glad for the

83
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,159
The reminder really great it really is

84
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,975
Episode

85
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:25,119
To get into I think it's one of the weirder ones I've heard quite a while its September

86
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,703
That was pretty close that was pretty close

87
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
Yeah it's

88
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,287
Wild business episodes nuts

89
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,847
I don't know I don't know how else to put it

90
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
It's just it's just nuts

91
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
Unaccept

92
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,111
That's better than

93
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:52,511

Also

112
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,767
I don't know I don't know what I

113
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:03,167
Conclude this ass like a policy wonk shout-out or a hostile threat that we're sending over

114
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:09,567
But Villa Ville I don't know

00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,967
Let her DND characters

116
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:22,367
Should quote be prepared for an unconventional family reunions that definitely sounds like

117
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:28,767
A threat right no that's not a threat that's a tease that means that they're going to in the game at look as a form

118
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,351
Dungeon master myself

119
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:38,751
Something for the past is going to come up and there's going to be an exciting new scenario for them to play out

120
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,591
I disagree I think that same as characters family is dead

121
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:48,991
And there's going to be joining them

122
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,759
Roseola

123
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:55,647
Super clear about this threats for other people

124
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:02,303
This is not going to become a thing weird

125
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,327
Prison Architect dropped

126
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
From Today Show

127
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,887

128
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
You're not stupid

129
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,079
I disagree with all the way

130
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,871
That's over six

131
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,175
Strongly disagree with all of this

132
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,479
I was listening to this episode

133
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,783
The up to a lot of places and there's a lot of things

134
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,343
Musica covered

135
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,367
Being covered my thought was

136
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
Going to Stranges

137
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,207
Is Owen Shroyer still a political prisoner

138
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,743
Is he still alive

139
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:38,143
Money and now he's going to hang out about that

140
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,935
I went to the go give fun

141
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:45,567
Whatever this alternative GoFundMe

00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
Yeah

144
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:55,551
Do they have not even if it yet that's fantastic

145
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,367
This is not something they're talkin about as much if you don't

146
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
Hit your goal do you not

147
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
Get the money

148
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,207
I think you still do I don't think it's

149
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
Kickstarter

150
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:09,119
David Gray Plumbing really f****** great if they if it that the last second there just like sorry man

If that were the case then every one of these grapefruit Style with just haven't Nicole of $1

153
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,431
But more importantly get the money you had maybe a lot

154
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,783
So we start off the show here in this is this is a trend that I've been noticing

155
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
And I don't know what to think of it

156
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
But it might be worried

157
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:02,623
Alright that Wolf Blitzer with the Nightly News

158
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,023
Next

159
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
Tuesday

160
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:16,191
Alex has been using send in the clowns cuz Bumper Music

161
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,239
More regularly

162
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:23,615
And this is how he starts the show starts to show this is what an old man plays before they die

163
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,919
The day before you die

164
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:32,319
Close to record

165
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,671
Losing my timing this late in my career like ugly it's grim

166
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,255
It's on the nose that leads

167
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
Yeah

168
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,863
Introspective when he starts off

169
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,423
The episode obviously I mean if you start with

170
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
Sinatra's

171
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,751
Version of send in the clowns

172
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
You're in a mood

173
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:58,431
Yeah it's like playing only the first 10 minutes of It's a Wonderful Life and being like that was a great movie right

174
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:05,087
Always try to be calm those are really my best broadcast

175
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,671
But the mainstream media

176
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,791
Pigeonhole.

177
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
It was Barry Goldwater

178
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,167
Famous maniacs

179
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,823
Help build that Ron Paul and Donald Trump and others stood on top oven

180
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,615
Myself as well with his shoulders

181
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
Is no Vice

182
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,135
First very important point

183
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,463
The shows were Alex's, are not the best ones

184
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,815
The ones that where you drunkenly throws hatchets at one of them cameras those of the best choice

185
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:51,423
And it's not even close

186
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,751
Oh yeah second this is an interesting that Barry Goldwater

187
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,543
Quote because Alex isn't wrong

188
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,591
The Goldwater did say those words

189
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,407
However they were written by his speech writer a big big toe

190
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,455
Time Lincoln scholar name

191
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,783
Goldwater many times falsely attributed the quote to Cicero

192
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,831
Sure most importantly though

193
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,903
Just because Barry Goldwater said something that doesn't make it

194
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
True

195
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:17,791
Oh well it's a it's a well-written sense because it was written by a speechwriter but that doesn't mean that it

196
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Expresses of accurate

197
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
Point

198
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,631
It really just a pissy way of saying like

199
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:27,263
If you bomb something for a good reason and you also kind of seemed to enjoy bombing things that you shouldn't be judged

200
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,639
Just because you secretly enjoy bombing things you doing it for a good reason

201
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
Is it is what it is

202
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
Yeah but it's a little bit sounds better than

203
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,855
The Goldwater not only sadness

204
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
Folks

205
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
I'm going to do whatever the f*** I want

206
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,951
It's better if I say it like

207
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:51,071
Extremism in the service of good it's fine to quote Barry Goldwater do what thou wilt

208
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
Mother quotes

209
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:59,007
I'll go along with that would you like to buy antsy pants

210
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,823
Extremism in defense of Liberty is no Vice

211
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,871
This one isn't one of them

212
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
He also said

213
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
Sometimes silence

214
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
Is it golden

215
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
It's yellow

216
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,551
That was Alex's presenting that is Goldwater

217
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
It is it is

218
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,087
Is not

219
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,671
It's most famously attributed to Georgia Senator Zell Miller

220
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,487
Who was the Democrat named but was basically a Republican

221
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
You can find the trans

222
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,327
In front of the Congressional Record what Miller said these words

223
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,679
February 12th 2004 if you read them in their full context they are

224
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,703
Bucking absurd

225
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
This whole thing

226
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,287
Is about how the US isn't immoral

227
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,823
The client it's going to collapse

228
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,847
Because of it okay

229
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
The proof

230
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:43,295
The culture of the far-left America was displayed in a startling way during the Super Bowls now-infamous halftime show

231
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,879
Show brought to us on behalf of value Les moonves

232
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,695
And the Pagan Temple of Viacom Babylon

233
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,535
I am really bummed out

234
00:13:54,047 --> 00:14:00,191
The far-right can somehow lionize in history another old man

235
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Bitching in the

236
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:07,615
Back same way they do now about the Super Bowl halftime show

237
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
He goes on to say quote

238
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,735
How many of you have ever run over a skunk with your car

239
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,319
I know the president has somewhere over there around Frog Hollow

240
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,599
I have many times

241
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,135
I can tell you that the stink

242
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,671
Stays around for a long time

243
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,231
You can take the car through the carwash and it's still there

244
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:29,887
So the scent of this event will long linger in the nostrils of America

245
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,191
Legislation

246
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:41,407
We will be dealing with this brat in Congress the job you were clearly meant to have

247
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,759
He swore that he wasn't just talking about a titty going on to say quote

248
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,295
Wouldn't you expect

249
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,879
Bumping humping trashy routine and titled I'm going to get you naked

250
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
The end of that way

251
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
A point of order this outfit

252
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:58,303
Responsible adult ever listen to the words of crap crap

253
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,703
I would quote years ago and I'm already mad.

254
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,519
Call Dad call Dad

255
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
There's more to close

256
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,359
I would put you some of the the lyrics

257
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:16,223
You some of it but the sergeant-at-arms at throw me out of this chamber as well he should

258
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,319
Then there was that prancing dancing strutting running guy

259
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
Evidently suffering from jock itch

260
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,903
Because he kept yelling and grabbing his crotch

261
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,999
Maybe there's a culture of crotch-grabbing in this country I don't know about

262
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
What is bad as all that was

263
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,375
My chain the hardest was seeing

264
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,215
This ignoramus with his pointed head sticking up through a hole that he

265
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,775
The flag of United States of America screaming about having

266
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,591
A bottle of scotch and wanting lots of crotch

267
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,895
What is it about old white people

268
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,687
That just makes them the worst

269
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:52,575
I went back and I watch that halftime show cuz I certainly haven't watch

270
00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:00,511
Sticking his head toward American flag and yellow gajewski

271
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:05,887
I didn't see it in there maybe there was a part with like Littlejohn that got edited out now why not

272
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,679
Why not who cares

273
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:12,799
Who cares that up either direction he's just going to whine about it and I saw it

274
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,615
The performance of Rhythm Nation was pretty good

275
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,687
Piti

276
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991
2400 like

277
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,807
Have you heard some of these lyrics these men

278
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,623
Boys would say

279
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
Buchheit

280
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,463
Why you apologize rap crap

281
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,511
So this dude was on one

282
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,535
In the Senate chamber

283
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:37,119
You might be confused about what he was actually speaking about because he doesn't

284
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
Get to that point until later on

285
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
Quote

286
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,727
The desire in Wheel of this Congress

287
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:47,103
Demeaning Polly do anything about any of these so-called social issues as non-existent embarrassingly

288
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
Disgraceful

289
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,687
The American people are waiting and growing impatient with us

290
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,223
They want something done

291
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:56,063
I'm pleased to be a co-sponsor of SJ resolution 26

292
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831

00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,879
Siri's a real sj-r

00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
Sjr

00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:05,279
Guitar you us there was something there a nice try

296
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,351
Couldn't remember what that is

297
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:13,471
26 Constitutional Amendment defining marriage

298
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,263
Between

299
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
There we go

300
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,359
The rest of his speech literally flows around this topic from the Superbowl

301
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,407
Complaints to not liking rap music

302
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,199
What a f****** a******

303
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,295
Speaking alongside to do do it later be outed as a pedophile

304
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
Oh no hold on

305
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:34,975
I stay in shoulder-to-shoulder not only with my Senate co-sponsors and chief justice Roy Moore of Alabama

306
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,535
More importantly with our company

307
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
Great

308
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:42,399
Great. Sounds really good when you isolated

309
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:49,055
It's not hard to agree with a point that sometimes being silent is the equivalent of being cowardly sure

310
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
Pretty important

311
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,663
Alex's got the speaker wrong

312
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,943
For the quote

313
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,711
The quote itself

314
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,271
Is a ridiculous piece

315
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
Zell Miller

316
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:04,927
Very very dumb

317
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,463
Gay people can't get married

318
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:12,351
Good-looking five-minute serovital from Senator Jordan from the great state of Illinois

319
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,167
Let the record show Jordan is making the

320
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:21,567
Jerk-off motion and he is see this is a floor would like to remind

321
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:25,151
Senator from Jordan that neighbor

322
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,199
We want people to hear you in Maryland

323
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
Sometimes it's yellow

324
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,415
To be silent

325
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,463
Play golzar interfreight Yellow

326
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,303
SanDisk italics on another etymological

327
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
Ambivalent

328
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
Grounding

329
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,983
Competition and urinate on themselves

330
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
People pissing themselves

331
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,871
Is that where the term yellow-bellied come

332
00:18:56,127 --> 00:19:02,271
Comes from I understand how it seems like I'm just nitpicking things Alex says that he's wrong about but I need to stress that this

333
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
As part of demonstrating a pattern

334
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,671
Alex doesn't know anything he's just repeating things he's heard as if they're the product of excellent

335
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Domestication or

336
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,743
Some sort of knowledge on his part

337
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,071
I'm he's just hoping that you as a listener will be fooled into weeks

338
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,119
Stepping is confident words as truth

339
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
They're not

340
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,031
In the specific case he's just imagine that the term yellow-bellied comes from soldiers who pissed on themselves in war because

341
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:28,383
That's something he's decided cowards do and yellow-bellied is a term of a coward

342
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,967
Brave I do I do appreciate that I know for a

343
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,991
Facts like what

344
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:38,367
He just starts talking that he's making that up completely out of his ass but it does sound like he knows what he's talkin

345
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
About

346
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,695
Actually kind of

347
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,511
Would be willing to believe that he think

348
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:49,119
Except that he's actually the apology up

349
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,423
Fascinating

350
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,471
The history of this because no one

351
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
Actually knows where the term comes from

352
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,103
Right they can't really trace it down

353
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
Direct

354
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
Route

355
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,479
There's a derogatory usage of the term yellow bellies from England

356
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,039
And in the late 1700s to refer to people from the

357
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,575
The fans which is Mary around

358
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
Coastal East

359
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
Country

360
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,695
It's talking about like they're they're like they're real

361
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
Is that there

362
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:21,887
Weaken brother in the US

363
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,423
Apartment newspaper

364
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,959
I was referring to Mexico

365
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,495
Soldiers is yellow-belly

366
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,543
It's unclear this is

367
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,103
Something that's racist or about a uniform

368
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,455
Its history is kind of Forgotten a bit of the context of that isolated

369
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,575
Instance of the term could literally be their uniform what had

370
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,343
Yellow

371
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,647
Black circle possibility

372
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,671
Does the word I thought of

373
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,207
There are some people who

374
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:50,815
Suggest that the root of the term has to do with the days when doctors believe that medical issues were all traced back to

375
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,583
The humors

376
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,399
And one of the four humors is yellow bile

377
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:58,239
Is true

378
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:03,103
But there is one of the four

379
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,639
Yeah I believe in the humors

380
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
Why not

381
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,551
This is a complicated ml edible logical history that you have going on here and it's not something that has it

382
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,087
Definitive answer

383
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,879
Explanation that no one gives

384
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,560
Yep he just made it up as he was talking

385
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:26,400
Astonishing that he could really say that out loud

386
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:30,496
With no context or even background for it and just go with it

387
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
It's such a confidence

388
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:37,920
Manor I don't know I feel like if you go see enough improv shows you see people say things that are incorrect a lot and they just have to learn

389
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:44,320
Keep moving you know if you stop and you're likely hold onto second that doesn't make any sense at all

390
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:48,160
Not actually driving a car

391
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,232
The show is over

392
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,048
So look dude

393
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,096
Alex is not wanted

394
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,912
But he did a lot of work

395
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
I'm not mad at

396
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,496
Prepared

397
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:10,432
Complaining I did probably 3 hours research last night about 4 hours research earlier than

398
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,760
Several hours of research

399
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,088
Myself

400
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,952
Orders

401
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,840
I think I have a responsibility to really try to cover all this

402
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,632
I'm nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom

403
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,680
He couldn't help himself it was like a buffet oven

404
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
Information

405
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,056
So what's going on is he's got so much paper on the table which is evidence of

406
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:37,824
How much

407
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
Brookies

408
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,384
Johnny's got so much favor

409
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,712
So if he realizes that in his metaphor

410
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,760
Ordering those 20 plates

411
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040
He is insured

412
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,368
He cannot consume all of the food on

413
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,904
Can any of those Play-Doh

414
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:56,512
Thus making the matter for him not being able to consume the information

415
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:01,376
Daisy ostensibly going to regurgitate towards out almost like

416
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,704
He's lost his timing this late in his career

417
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,824
Well I mean somebody sent in the clouds

418
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,408
Alex introduces what like the

419
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
MacGuffin

420
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,784
Is that what it's called like the driving force

421
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,064
Yeah the things that

422
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,904
Would explain why he's done so much research but obviously

423
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,720
Is not at all true right whatever is in that

424
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Open Suitcase

425
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,280
It's just the prop that he's using

426
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,560
End

427
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,864
It has to do with story from the intercept

428
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,448
Let me just do this before I drill into the top stories

429
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,752
Let me just give you some big announcements

430
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,360
Major journalistic organizations will get into the interception others

431
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,944
For your request fauci

432
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,528
Salon in Chapel Hill

433
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,552
North Carolina

434
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,344
USA in China

435
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,648
Hundreds of pages

436
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,440
A fallacy directing

437
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,024
Murder of five viruses into a

438
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,304
Covid SARS

439
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,400
Do they make a super vaccine

440
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,192
For something that didn't exist

441
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,008
The entire evolutionary system of this planet

442
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,568
So Alex is literally all the details wrong

443
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,592
About this intercept

444
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
Story

445
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,176
They've got a Freedom of Information Act request going against

446
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:18,944
The national

447
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,712
Roots of Health

448
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,760
Imperative

449
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,808
Two really long

450
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,088
Grant contract

451
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
Between the NIH

452
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,904
Ecohealth Alliance

453
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,208
Involving coronavirus related work

454
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,512
Some of which did involve

455
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
Do the virologist

456
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:39,168
Hundreds of pages but that's because one grand is 528 pages long

457
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,704
And the other is 380

458
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
He's our long-ass document

459
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,568
What are the problems that comes from using a document like

460
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
Like this at 7

461
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,360
Conspiracy

462
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,408
Is it there super granular

463
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,432
In terms of detail

464
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,480
For instance on page 7

465
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,760
92 of the first grade

466
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,320
Which cover the project was ongoing from 24

467
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
The 2019

468
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,416
Breakdown of expenses related to

469
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,464
Two doctors who are part of the support team

470
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,512
Like for their phone and internet

471
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,096
This amounts to $47 per month but it merits

472
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,864
The paragraph

473
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,400
In this grant proposal

474
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:13,216
If you can't find specifics on this document with

475
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,496
This many specifics

476
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,520
Conspiracy

477
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,568
Yeah it's bad

478
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
Not good

479
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:22,688
So there to Grant's here but one of them doesn't even begin until July twenty

480
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:26,016
20 so I'm not going to consider it in terms of

481
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,296
The conspiracy that Alex

482
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,576
Suspense

483
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:33,184
The other one is for this one that I mentioned from 2014 to 2019

484
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,488
The actual details of it are pretty fascinating

485
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,072
I ran over a bunch of it like you brought this to my attention

486
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:45,472
Cuz you do you stay up on The Intercept a little more than I do

487
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,664
Sneaky Snake episode this Wednesday partially because of Labor Day mostly because of Labor Day

488
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,480
Also because I was reading

489
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
These G

490
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,576
Yeah they were excited

491
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:06,464
Ultimately a lot of it got really technical so I called them they help of our friend who's not a health Ranger

492
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,280
And I got to clarify.

493
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,048
This project

494
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,840
What they were up to was to

495
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
To prompt

496
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,704
The first part of the research was to go out and find samples to test for Coronavirus

497
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,776
Either one's we previously identified or new one

498
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,872
This would be done by going out to wild bat populations and take

499
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,944
Examples from Human to have interactions with wild animal population

500
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,248
And from people who work in

501
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,296
And animals at live animal Market

502
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,416
These samples and sequence brna of the coronavirus as they found him

503
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,976
They take this are in a to make samples

504
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,816
In Petri dish that would go on to it

505
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
Express this virus

506
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
And these work

507
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,912
Exposed to other cell

508
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,216
That were expressing ace2 receptor

509
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,776
The reason to do this is because if

510
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,360
The animal to human transmission of any of these viruses

511
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,176
It would most likely happen by way of The ace2 receptors

512
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,712
So this was a way to

513
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,992
Hancock circumstances

514
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,856
Where they could test whether or not the wild viruses they found would be something

515
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,648
It could possibly be transmitted to

516
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,952
So it doesn't make sense to you

517
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,072
And two I would argue almost all of the extreme-right has

518
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
Exploiting this

519
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,400
That is Arthur C Clarke's

520
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,424
Magic

521
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
Attitude

522
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,008
What is willemstad like

523
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,896
They take the virus from space and they put it into a hole and then the whole turns more virus around

524
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,200
And nothing is being created

525
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,504
That's one of the really important

526
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,320
Function this is not

527
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:42,720
They're not ripping the RNA apart milk in their own genetically created sequences do then create a stir

528
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:46,560
Stronger virus and then tested on the H2 receptors in order to

529
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,584
Destroy the

530
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,632
F****** population

531
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,168
Part of this one gram

532
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,960
Write the second part of the research

533
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,264
Because basically the phylogenetic research

534
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,872
Where they were trying to place evolutionary roots of the coronavirus as the paved

535
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
Discovered

536
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:05,248
The reason for doing this research is because there are some of these viruses they find it only info

537
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,016
Affect bats

538
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,064
A song that only infect humans

539
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,184
And there are some that are in the middle like more likely to infect humans less likely to infect

540
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,256
By studying the variations in these viruses

541
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:20,352
Different about them between them on Lauren a level

542
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,936
These scientists might be able to make some progress in terms of isolating

543
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,752
The part of a virus that makes it dangerous to human right

544
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,288
Very important research

545
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,896
You can easily see the reasons of these types of Grantswood

546
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,920
Things they were aiming to look

547
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,688
Into where

548
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,504
Here's some of the corrections

549
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,320
From just the last clip that we heard

550
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,648
The foia request

551
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,184
Did not volcano function Reeser

552
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,232
The grants are not touchy Direct

553
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:53,632
Chimeric emerging of five viruses into one Coronavirus

554
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:56,192
To create that

555
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,520
The end goal of the grant was not to make a super vaccine

556
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,568
All that stuff is just ask

557
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:06,688
Alex is made up and he's using the Specter of this intercept article to lend credibility to his

558
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,992
His Notions but none of it's real

559
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,040
Timer backed up by the article that has reference

560
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:17,696
Alex is making up these details cuz he doesn't care about the truth about what's going on he just saw a headline that look useful to him

561
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,976
He's filling in the details

562
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,512
The pieces of his already exist

563
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,280
Narratives

564
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,072
Not while we're on the subject

565
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,120
I'd like to take a moment to scold the intercept

566
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,448
Just for this article

567
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,752
Together support journalistic

568
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:34,848
Dushyanth exploring unlikely or even sometimes derided possibilities

569
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,128
I have no problem

570
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,176
At all the people sending for your request

571
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,712
To learn more about the research

572
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,736
That our government phone

573
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,528
Totally appropriate

574
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,808
Great

575
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
For instance

576
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,720
If they were jamming five viruses together into one super coronavirus and order to make a super vaccine

577
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:57,376
I think it would be good for somebody with a little bit of credibility to dig into it and try and figure out if there's any proof of then I would like

578
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:02,240
I would like a journalistic outlet with standards to take a real look at

579
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,824
I take issue with the framing

580
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,848
Of this article.

581
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,944
These grants but they found in there for your requests are not having a

582
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,736
Should we use any kind of Justice

583
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:15,296
Application for even slightly shifting closer to

584
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
Accepting

585
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,088
The lab leak

586
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,624
Theory

587
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:22,208
Hypothesis that the virus could have escaped from a lab accident

588
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
Which is

589
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,280
Still way different than Alex's story

590
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,560
That is pasa

591
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,144
Current weight of evidence leans more toward the natural or

592
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:35,776
On page 38 of the grant proposal in the section where the participants give their personal state

593
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,080
Wondery researcher said

594
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:42,432
Quote my work on Starz coronavirus ecology in collaboration

595
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:45,248
With co-investigators dacic

596
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
Let me to the

597
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,088
Discovery of several sars-like coronavirus is in bats

598
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:52,928
Which appeared to be an stress ancestral to SARS Coronavirus

599
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,720
And most recently which

600
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,024
Utilize the same ace2 receptor

601
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
I sorry

602
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,584
Suggesting direct spillover to

603
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,608
The humans as possible

604
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,168
Part of the justification for this grant

605
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,472
To be worth funding is that at this point

606
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:12,128
With 2014 when they're applying for the grant that they'd already discovered previously unknown sars-like virus as they could

607
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:12,896
Statically

608
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:18,784
Directly infect humans there is a very real impetus behind this happening

609
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,904
When you're coming off SARS and MERS exactly they were like let's not do it

610
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,928
Yeah they wouldn't be good

611
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,952
Yeah it was

612
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
Really would

613
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,792
Yeah it's almost like if you let it go wild

614
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,816
It would go bad

615
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:34,912
I understand that Alex is insane but the Interceptor Interceptor do better

616
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,448
Interview have a friend that story

617
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,520
They're boarding on these grants being released by a foia request

618
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,080
Shouldn't have a headline as vague as quote

619
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,896
New details emerge about coronavirus research

620
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,992
Chinese lab that is not a good headline to accurately

621
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
Portray

622
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,320
What's going on in the story mediate insinuate

623
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,880
I would allow for this just to be bad like a click

624
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,160
Activate type headline

625
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,464
Except for the tone of this article is incredibly so

626
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,488
Suggestive

627
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,072
Sources

628
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:09,216
This is a roadmap to the high-risk research that could have led to the current pandemic said Gary Ruskin

629
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:14,080
Executive director of us right to know a group that's been investigating the origins of covid-19

630
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,616
That's great

631
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,640
But the way this is written

632
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,456
Suggest that us right to know is an impartial Group B

633
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,992
Just trying to get to the bottom of this stuff

634
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,576
It's the voice of clarity on the issue of the origin of covid

635
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,856
That's not true

636
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,952
U.s. right2know is largely funded by the organic consumers Association

637
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,232
Haitian which is a naturopathic

638
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
Kind of outlets

639
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,560
They don't seem to like mainstream medicine all that much

640
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,632
They have a post on their website about how they've been

641
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,680
Slandered by the media for me

642
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,520
Quote row vaccine safety

643
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,080
That's the same Dodge that literally every anti-vax

644
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
Century makes when things

645
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,872
You get tough

646
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,152
In the middle of a pandemic

647
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,224
Basically the way you keep your auntie expositions

648
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,808
Don't look too ridiculous and Pablo

649
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:59,648
Asking questions of the medical establishment

650
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,672
Here's a little bit

651
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:03,744
From that post on the organic consumers association website

652
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,096
Why should we be injecting experimental drugs into people at all when there are safe

653
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
Effective

654
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,144
True preventive measures

655
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,472
Seven parentheses healthy food and natural health supplementation

656
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:17,056
The strengthen our immune system and generic drugs are at home or outpatient treatment

657
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:21,408
To reduce the chances of hospitalization or death and there was the series pre-existing Medical

658
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
Call conditions

659
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:27,040
A slightly better written version of Alex's positions without any fun gallon

660
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:31,648
Oh also on their website they're promoting a tribunal that they held in April to

661
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,672
Get to the bottom of the roots of

662
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,232
Covid-19 also served as a way to promote

663
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,048
Dr. Joseph mercola's newest book

664
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:38,816
Titled

665
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,840
The truth about covid

Impact their blog routinely repost things

669
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,312
That were originally posted

670
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,848
Humber College website

671
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,128
And if you don't know Joseph

672
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,408
McCulloch is one of the

673
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,968
Biggest anti-vax figures that exist

674
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,992
The media

675
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,016
Dispute

676
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:01,600
I've checked out their site and the organic consumers Association

677
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,880
Hard to tell apart

678
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,440
For Mike Adams natural news and they are by

679
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
Far

680
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,512
The largest funder of us rate

681
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:13,120
To know we're being presented as impartial investigators into the roots of covid in this article

682
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,400
That's

683
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:17,984
Not recognizing the person they're citing as a neutral source

684
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,592
Is essentially an advocate for the unproven position that this article is insinuating

685
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,616
Is not

686
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,384
Good Yelp

687
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,944
That said probably the thing that made me most

688
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,992
Disappointed about this article is the last paragraph

689
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,600
Quote the second Grant understanding risk of zoonotic virus emergent

690
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
Emerging

691
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:40,768
Infectious disease hotspots in Southeast Asia

692
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,352
The Proposal written in 2019 often seems prescient

693
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,632
Focusing on scaling up

694
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,960
Open to playing resources in Asia in case of an outbreak of an

695
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,240
Infectious disease

696
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:53,824
In referring to Asia is quote the hottest of the Eid hotspot

697
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
Here's the deal

698
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,736
This article is about the conflicting hypotheses about the origin of the novel Coronavirus

699
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,528
The underlying documents

700
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,064
GameFly the foia request

701
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,648
Aren't really Bombshells or evidence that makes the lab Theory

702
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:12,000
Compelling as if they should be seeing that way

703
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,280
This grant is

704
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
Prescient

705
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:19,936
As opposed to reflecting the well-documented history that many emerging infectious diseases pop up in Asia

706
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:26,336
Yippee huge, I was going to say though the ideas like that was one word that I read and I was like this whole

707
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:30,432
Thing can be f****** tossed away if you say prescient on a thing that is

708
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:35,296
Israeli Wyoming League happened a million times in the past your f****** wrong

709
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,088
Incentive

710
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,392
To the point where it's psilostachya out of

711
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,416
Play Yeah Yeah Yeahs

712
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,720
It was a group that investigated The Roots

713
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:49,120
To covet not an advocacy group primarily funded by an anti-vaxxer I'm sorry pro-vaccine safety

714
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,400
Outlet of weirdos

715
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
This isn't

716
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,192
Good

717
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,984
We were in normal time

718
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,776
I wouldn't really care that much

719
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,568
This wouldn't be that huge of a screw-up

720
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:02,432
Yeah maybe a little misses from time to time sometimes you interview but somebody and you don't

721
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,736
Check in all the possible,

722
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,760
Play Aventuras course

723
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,088
Problem is

00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,624
But the stakes are too high

725
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:15,488
Free of The Intercept to lend its credibility to this s*** is

726
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
Damaging

727
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,304
I'm Not Lisa

728
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,864
How is it that you can be a journalist

729
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,144
In 2021

730
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,960
And actually hear the name us right

731
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,776
To know and not immediately go wonder who that is

732
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:33,664
Obviously that's an anti-vaxxer I mean I saw the quote from US1

733
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,224
Clicked on the link and immediately I was like

734
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,504
What am I doing here

735
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,856
I know what this shouldn't to know is is a little bit broader in their scope

736
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,536
Some of that

737
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:57,472
There's a global pandemic and the connection to reality surrounding that

738
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,032
Extremists to radicalize people into their ranks

739
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:05,152
This is not a time to make unforced errors and play directly into the hands of the fairies actors

740
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:08,224
If I were the editor at The Intercept I might

741
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,040
Give it another go on this one before I sent it to print

742
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,064
Oh yeah

743
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,832
F*** Alex

744
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:20,256
Three interceptions different responses with a good ruler

745
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,840
Who's all bulshit the hypothesis

746
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:27,680
He does remain an outside possibility that just hasn't been shown to be likely

747
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,216
So

748
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,496
That's his big story

749
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,544
He doesn't spend much time on it

750
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,824
Irreverence is it a bit

751
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:34,848
And

752
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,896
I will see we spent this time on

753
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,688
Other than that

754
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,344
Noboru Jordan I over-prepared Ono Ono

755
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,160
I over prepare don't know I'm not able to make any points

756
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
Too much

757
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,208
Too much information

758
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,232
Consumed burp

759
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,512
Infobear

760
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,328
That is a good name for the info

761
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,376
I think that's better

762
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
Yeah I mean

763
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,448
The more I read

764
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:04,032
The sourcing for that intercept article the more I got to the opposite

765
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,080
The conclusion that it's less likely

766
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,872
Like the more I read that tomorrow I'm like

767
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,152
You guys should have made this

768
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,224
Look at how reasonable everybody is act

769
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,528
That's the headliners

770
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,600
Everybody acting reasonably in best interest

771
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,160
Yeah it's crazy contacts

772
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:24,256
Is absolutely missing a lot of it

773
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,048
Scapula

774
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,864
Alex talks more about two things that are true

775
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,192
Also scientific facts

776
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,984
Literature literature

777
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,384
Virus vaccine

778
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:46,784
Carrie

779
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,320
When the body

780
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,392
Created in response to that was also very poisonous

781
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,208
Indiana

782
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,280
Add

783
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,168
So interesting

784
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,192
Sing I'm not true

785
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:07,776
If you go to India's Ministry of Health and Family welfare website you can

786
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,592
Define they're offering AstraZeneca and Kovacs

787
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
Some vaccines

788
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,408
They also approve Russia's Sputnik

789
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,200
View vaccine back in April

790
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,992
None of these are mRNA

791
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:20,320
Talking about is almost certainly the Kovacs in

792
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,112
That was made by India's own

793
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,648
Bharat biotech

794
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,696
I have no idea where Alex

795
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,232
Just coming up with all the other stuff though

796
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:32,096
Kovacs and recently released data showing their vaccine is 65.2% effective against

797
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,424
Hey 93.4% effective against

798
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,192
Severe

799
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:36,960
Symptomatic covid

800
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,544
Hindi currently also has a 12% vaccination rate in his work

801
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,592
Not getting that number higher so I don't

802
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,872
Nobody's talked about with

803
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:44,896
Suspended

804
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:49,504
Campaigns whatever I'm just so you just say whatever you want just so Furious

805
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,784
I don't

806
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,576
I don't I know it's

807
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,344
Easy

808
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,112
For him

809
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:57,184
But you can't say the virus is quota quotes

810
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
So deadly

811
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
Like that's unfair

812
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,048
You've spent the past

813
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,328
How many months

814
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,400
Telling me that the virus either doesn't exist or isn't

815
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,424
Deadly as they say

816
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,496
That the virus is a bioweapon

817
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,800
But it's a fake by a weapon

818
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:18,944
And the vaccine is the real thing that

819
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,504
India vaccine program is in Port

820
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,856
To talk about what you're not taking into account is that Alex had a

821
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,880
Mild case of

822
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,672
Covid-19

823
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:32,256
Any other more serious one

824
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,560
I'm so it's real serious.

825
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,656
Just get to get away with

826
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,960
You don't think I saw that go around

827
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:45,056
Yeah

828
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,688
Madison not is penetrated as Joe Rogan or Alex is dumb

829
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:55,552
Bulshit stunts of taking covid on are there

830
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:58,880
Evil

831
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,672
Created the virus

832
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,976
It released it intentionally

833
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:07,072
It's not even

834
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:11,936
It's super debate it's not give you a rebuttal

835
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,216
It's not fair.

836
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:19,872
It's like what temperature water freezes at you don't debate

837
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,152
Temperature

838
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,272
Or

839
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,624
Why would you make that or fluoride

840
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,928
These are known things

841
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,232
Spell incredible

842
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,304
Fauci created this and then released in Odyssey on purpose

843
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,864
No

844
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,424
That they knew that if they created a vaccine

845
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,216
Common cold

846
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,104
70 years

847
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
All of that is

848
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,175
Anderlecht

849
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,735
The temperature that water boils is like a scientific

850
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,271
Exact but it also depends on

851
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:04,671
All of the things that he just describer variables that we know are only what we know

852
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,487
You know in relation to other circumstances

853
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:12,095
In these environments we do know that

854
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,143
We also know that they change

855
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,959
So I know we mentioned this earlier

856
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,751
But Alex

857
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,775
Stacks of paper

858
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,335
Yeah he does have a lot of

859
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,871
Do any of them say that they

860
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,407
The speed of light is

861
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,687
Actually

862
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,711
Money stack okay

863
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,783
How many you know what they probably have a definite weight

864
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,063
It's not debated

865
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:39,999
Facts of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

866
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,791
13 14 15 16

867
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,655
Pablo Escobar

868
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,447
2122

869
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,239
22 stocks

870
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,335
You could do a whole show on

871
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:58,943
So do a whole show on 100 fish Ali announcing

872
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,575
Via covid

873
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,855
Including the US

874
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,951
Is the end of the family and the family band

875
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,023
Officially from the UN I'm going to show you the

876
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,303
Official

877
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,327
Government document

878
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,631
1

879
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:25,055
Listen to the rest of the show and I don't think that he ever provided evidence that the UN has decided to end family

880
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,615
Such a huge official announcement

881
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,431
That word that to be an official announcement

882
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:35,807
Next thing you should show me the secretary-general being like

883
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,623
Like look family suck

884
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,159
My family sucks

885
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:40,927
Guess what

886
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,695
No family

887
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,975
All my friends

888
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,511
Complain about going home for Thanksgiving

889
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:47,583
Annoying it is what

890
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:52,191
You know what my dad was a real dick when I was a child so let's just end family

891
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,775
Also leaving that aside here's a good rule for you

892
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:59,615
Don't measure something like the news you have to cover by volume

893
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:02,687
Haven't more paper or presumably more stories

894
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,967
That's not navigation.

895
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,247
The better or borax

896
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,039
Important stories to cover or

897
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:09,087
That you are stories that you understand or can even

898
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:12,927
Communicate to an audience I'm better than mainstream news I have more sex

899
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,743
Typically when someone's trying to sell you something in bulk

900
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:21,375
It's not a high-quality item come on Sam's Club Kirkland you know it's great stuff

901
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,935
I don't know man multiple meal

902
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,007
Often isn't as good as

903
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,799
More expensive materials

904
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
Now

905
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,359
Just saying

906
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,431
Anyway Alex is a little bit mobile

907
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,479
Yeah it's a little bit sad share

908
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,759
You know they're bending the class

909
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,295

00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,623
There should be clowns

912
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:46,463
He's in that mood because he realizes like

913
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,487
Man

914
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:52,607
I used to have a website prisonplanet.com used to update that website

915
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,887
No One updates that web

916
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,471

Infowars.com

918

And Paul Watson

919
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,639
Quasi doesn't work with us

920
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,943
Really doesn't need more so no one even update

921
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,759
Prisonplanet.com

922
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
On screen

923
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,599
You know the last time it was updated

924
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,207
Five bucks says you don't

925
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,999
Twenty-something years ago

926
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:23,327
He's going to get a bunch of callers to decide

927
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:28,447
People quit using inside forgot a month ago I directed people

928
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,519
We're going to resurrect

929
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
Why

930
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,943
So that's where we are

931
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:42,015
We don't even have the money or the crew

932
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,855
To be able

933
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,159
Even

934
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,279
Everything even stay up

935
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,303
Update

936
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,095
I'm not complaining

937
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,471
Platform

938
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,799
Got to run just kind of stood back

939
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,823
Yeah they all left

940
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,103
They all laughed

941
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,127
Oh boy

942
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,151
Society

943
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,967
This is

944
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,735
Also

945
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:16,831
Generally prisonplanet and Infowars we're kind of like

946
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:21,951
Duplicate website content with posted on both ends

947
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:22,975
Infowars

948
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:25,279
As the website goes back to 1999

949
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,095
Like if you can find stuff on the Wayback machine

950
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:28,863
Combat Barbie

951
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,167
Yeah so I don't I don't know what the

952
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:37,567
The pointed-toe URL the now it's a redirect on your video site for wistful reminiscence

953
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,103
About websites that I didn't

954
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
Care about the first

955
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:46,527
And outside you are doesn't really do anything for you anymore

956
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,343
Directed it's abandoned video

957
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,463
Yes clearly you had a staff there who did it for you

958
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,231
You're fine

959
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,255
So

960
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,791
We got send in the clowns

961
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,351
It started to become more of the rotation

962
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,167
I noticed another song goes like what you doing

963
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:25,695
Police running over people all over the Western world

964
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,719
Horses

965
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,279
What

966
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,095
Alex is clearly an eagle's guy

967
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:38,495
It's happening he constantly rants Over You Belong To The City by Glenn Frey now we have Dirty Laundry by Don Henley

968
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,263
Emily coming out

969
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,055
If we get life's been good

970
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:46,175
To me so far it's not going to be an accident but that's one comes in

971
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:51,039
I'm sick of the Eagles I don't have any solo hits

972
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:57,439
Did not also Alex playing dirty laundry is bumper music while he launches into a string of Sensational headlines about people getting run

973
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,463
Run over by horses

974
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,255
All across the Western world

975
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:04,607
And all that kind of bulshit that's honestly entering the territory of stuff they could

976
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,631
Possibly be set

977
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,911
Yeah it's 2 on the

978
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:13,311
This absolutely isn't the case but it's Alex where performance artist desperately trying to clue his audience and that he's doing a

979
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,127
A bit this is exactly the song he would choose

980
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:22,015
Dirty Laundry the song where Don Henley is complaining about the way the news become more sensationalized

981
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:22,783
Tabloid

982
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,855
Focused in the early 80s

983
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:29,951
Here's some lyrics on that song it really imagine if you were doing satire

984
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,999
How this would be hilarious theme music

985
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,279
Play on The Alex Jones Show

986
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:36,607
We can do the innuendo we can dance and sing

987
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:39,167
When it said and done we haven't told you a thing

988
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,007
We all know that crap is King give us dirty laundry

989
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:49,919
Exactly what you would play for Alex if it was a joke about to get a divorce

990
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:54,527
I said just be like hey listen to Rumours by Fleetwood Mac and then leave the room that's all you need to do

991
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,807
If somebody like it

992
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,599
The evidence is mounting

993
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:03,999
Of a rogue board operators

994
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:13,471
Well done the most romantic romantic

995
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,239
Comedy Zaika

996
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,007
Can think of

997
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:20,895
Is the board operator trying to send you messages

998
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:24,735
Eventually after the whole thing's over you guys reconnect 20 years

999
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:27,295
Start playing

1000
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,087
So far

1001
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:34,719
Absolutely we made a real signal

1002
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:41,119
So a little bit about how population that's what's going on

1003
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,935
And generally I would say that

1004
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,959
But your position should be

1005
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
Against

1006
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,263
Depopulation Wars

1007
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,543
Should be conditional

1008
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,079
It should not be

1009
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:54,687
Conditional 4 hours organized the population

1010
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:58,527
You're saying we're overpopulated like gear in the city

1011
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,831
Predator

1012
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,879
So they're naturally going to create

1013
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,415
Artificial

1014
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,719
Closings for the viruses in

1015
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:09,279
Conflict information that get rid of it

1016
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:12,607
And you can even argue that in the survival of the fittest mode

1017
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,423
There's a place

1018
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,495
But you see the people running this your pedophile

1019
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,287
And Satan the center the worst

1020
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,079
Greediest people

1021
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:25,407
The problem

1022
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,687
Oh boy

1023
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:33,343
I mean obviously our population should be controlled by natural predators

1024
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,975
I think keep us from starving to death

1025
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:42,303
I don't want pedophile Predators doing it

1026
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,327
I don't want Satanist

1027
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:46,143
Look if I was being hunted by a

1028
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:48,703
You f****** tiger in the jungle

1029
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,775
I would be furious if I found out it was a pedophile tiger

1030
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,823
It would be like what's the f****** point

1031
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,615
I think that whenever

1032
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:56,895
You talk about like

1033
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,199
Believing in humanity and

1034
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,735
No like liking

1035
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,271
Shod

1036
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:08,671
I think that generally typically that doesn't include

1037
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,719
Also the weak should die

1038
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,279
Look

1039
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,303
I think it's

1040
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,583
A bad thing

1041
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,471
Giant herons have started eating human than pulling them out of their office

1042
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,775
There's a better adapted

1043
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,799
I will say that

1044
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:30,175
The humans who survive are going to be a lot stronger fighting those herons in about a hundred years if not

1045
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:35,551
The herons have shown that they are the ones

1046
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:38,623
Souderton B plan as you probably know

1047
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,159
Kill everyone

1048
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,183
Right I mean

1049
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,975
Sort of well not every

1050
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,255
Maybe it's

1051
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,535
Call the stock market

1052
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,815
Collapse once everybody

1053
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,375
You got it

1054
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:53,215
I don't know they're going to kill everybody clap

1055
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,495
During everybody paid

1056
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,775
And killed probably

1057
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
Kelly Brook

1058
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,151
Actually get us in a position

1059
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:07,039
Address for under attack by we must address for in a war

1060
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,855
Intuit

1061
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:14,719
Going further I'm really excited about this I told you

1062
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,023
That we're going to have a lot of products coming out

1063
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,351
A lot

1064
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,215
Process of selling my house

1065
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,519
Even more products

1066
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:33,151
Does the problem Schroeder's house shows up again

1067
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:39,551
Who knows we're on year 4 of house watch also not entirely sure how selling your house resolved

1068
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:46,975
Supply chain issues if I sell my house I can bribe

1069
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,511
Truck driver gas

1070
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,535
To bypass

1071
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,607
From like

1072
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,655
We're all going to die can talk

1073
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,191
2

1074
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,471
Exciting new product

1075
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:03,871
Fun 4 years ago

1076
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,991
Look we're all about to die

1077
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:11,551
Look forward to my new product

1078
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:14,623
It's coming up so crass inoffensive

1079
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,159
Eso Just

1080
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:16,927
Boring and

1081
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,207
Normal brows

1082
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:22,303
Yeah so

1083
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,071
You can still come

1084
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:29,471
Consume before you die capitalism will be here for you

1085
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,751
You got to get right with God

1086
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:37,919
I'm really close to God I've gotten right

1087
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,527
Never been closer to

1088
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:51,487
I'm not some goody-two-shoes up here on some high horse. No released

1089
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,255
Fake preachers

1090
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,631
This is good versus evil

1091
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:00,191
Millions of supporters in u.s.

1092
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,031

Know if you don't have any proof

1103
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,519
How could you say something like that

1104
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,567

That's just like having prestigious doctor

1109
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,367
You can't just have a under-the-radar

1110
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,903
Indie film

1111
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,671
Movie

1112
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,695
Of Satan

1113
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:56,511
It's got to be f****** Billboard charts

1114
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:00,351
And anything that Alex has been into the huge into

1115
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:04,447
Scanner Darkly was one of the biggest box office manager

1116
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,239
Steps are God's real

1117
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,287
And you got a

1118
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:14,687
Stand up cuz you don't want to be yellow you want to be golden or silencer Goldwater quotes

1119
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,455
Father quote

1120
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,759
Hero

1121
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,295
God is real

1122
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,319
This is a test

1123
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,111
You better well stand up

1124
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,159
I'll tell you what I'm going to do to you

1125
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:32,095
Nothing of God God is going to push you into The Phantom Zone with the 5th

1126
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,679
28

1127
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:40,543
Dishonorable

1128
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,871
People that are into betrayal and manipulation because there we

1129
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,455
Power from indominus world

1130
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,479
Sold out

1131
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,527
Weather 15 minutes of power

1132
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:54,879
Nothing

1133
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:59,743
The Phantom Zone of course it be parallel Dimension from Superman comics where folks

1134
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,511
Getting prison

1135
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:03,839
Real fun how Alex relates to his holy concept

1136
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:08,959
Next thing you know he's going to be on the show referring to Heaven is Xavier school for gifted youngsters

1137
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:15,359
Honestly I really like the moment I heard that I would immediately was transported really real

1138
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,383
Realizing like how much

1139
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,455
Power hell had over me as a child

1140
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,223
And if

1141
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,503
1.8

1142
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,271
Any point

1143
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:24,319
Time the pastor just been like

1144
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,111
Hell is the apps

1145
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:30,207
Essence of God and if you don't get right with God he will send you to the Phantom Zone

1146
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:33,279
All of my fears would disappear not be like

1147
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,559
You're right hell is he

1148
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:40,959
Exactly as stupid as the Phantom you're going to hang out with General Zod

1149
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,007
Job

1150
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:47,103
Ultimately this show is about

1151
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:51,455
If you want to pretend he knows anything about the news topics he's covering you're making no f******

1152
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,479
Can fool out of yourself

1153
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,015
This is about

1154
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,295
Talking about this

1155
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,439
Self mythologize at work

1156
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,767
I've been around there real Nazis

1157
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,559
Garden-variety pops

1158
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:10,911
I hate garden-variety about sickness

1159
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,471
I've been there

1160
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,543
When the rich people the billionaire

1161
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:19,871
To watch a ticket sacrifice

1162
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,175
Long-term

1163
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,967
Omnipresent

1164
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:24,735
What

1165
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,759
Does have

1166
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,575
Computer

1167
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,367
Direct the lines in the future

1168
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:35,487
Matter where I went or what I did

1169
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,767
When I was young

1170
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,815
I was going to end up

1171
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,839
God

1172
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:43,423
And thank God I did but let's take a moment really let that soak in

1173
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:48,031
When Joe Rogan has Alex Jones

1174
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:48,799
Seriously

1175
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:55,199
What he's doing is a validating and tacitly condoning this person who claims on are that Satan must have been trying to recruit in his

1176
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:55,967
School life

1177
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:57,759
Because Satan can see the future

1178
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:00,063
And he knew that eventually Alex would be important

1179
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,623
Infer God's plans for the site it's like the battle

1180
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,671
Now unfortunately for Satan

1181
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:07,999
Not have long-term

1182
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,535
Any presidents true

1183
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:13,887
Power set deal

1184
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,679
Rule over the Phantom

1185
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:23,871
And if you managed to say his name backwards

1186
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:29,247
That's my power

1187
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:36,159
And my limitation is never being able to catch up Alex doesn't say stuff like that on Joe Rogan show beak

1188
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,951
Because it would turn off the broader audio

1189
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:41,023
People would laugh at him having seen him for what he really is

1190
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,303
As a raving idiot

1191
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:45,119
This kind of talk is for Alex's show because it's

1192
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:49,471
We're pretty safe assumption that anyone is going to make it 45 minutes into this s***

1193
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,263
They're already fairly accurate

1194
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:57,919
Essentially is recruiting an army of idiots who will never listen to his show but who are willing to post

1195
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,455
Snarky b******* about how like

1196
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,503
Actually Alex Jones is more right

1197
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,783
Did they use wrong often

1198
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,367
Super worried about government corruption

1199
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:11,487
These f****** Rubes provide Alex and Infowars the tons of Free Press and make it so the message

1200
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:13,279
You know we'll get out to a wider audience

1201
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:18,655
The odds of sucking in people who will resume with the idea of fighting the literal devil

1202
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:21,983
Will increase and those people will get sucked into Alex's Revenue stream

1203
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,775
Nothing really else to say but

1204
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:26,335
Shame on you Joe Rogan how dare you

1205
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,871
Yeah here you know

1206
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,919
You have every reason to know

1207
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,967
That the show that your friend does

1208
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,015
That you give support to

1209
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,039
Is this

1210
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,831
He talks about the devil

1211
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:39,903
Trying to recruit him and his entire life

1212
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:43,231
Because the devil can see the future bright and he knew that Alex would be important

1213
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,767
The gods battle planet

1214
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,303
That's f***** up

1215
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:49,375
Don't forget to treat him like he's a guy who's read documents

1216
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,655
How dare you

1217
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,727
Anyway Alex

1218
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:54,495
Enjoyed

1219
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,543
Enjoyed the wrong word

1220
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,823
He's experience

1221
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,127
Some of the energy of Satan

1222
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,151
Right

1223
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,735
Yeah he's experienced some of the satanic energy

1224
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,015
I'm so

1225
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,295
Annoyed

1226
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,135
I mean think about think about

1227
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,159
Listening to

1228
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,695
Alexei

1229
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,279
What Satan can and cannot do

1230
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:19,839
Like

1231
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,423
What are you doing with a deity at all

1232
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,191
At all

1233
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:26,495
At all if you're going to claim that you can talk

1234
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,799
To God and God told you that Satan

1235
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:32,895
Can only do certain things and you know it and that you are allowed to tell everybody

1236
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:36,991
Just give up on God just just just go to the books

1237
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:37,759
Float

1238
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:39,295
But it can't fly

1239
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:42,879
What are we doing what are we f****** doing here just give up

1240
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,951
Just give up and read your mind but he can't implant thoughts

1241
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,743
Who's your mom

1242
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,535
What

1243
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:52,607
What what else

1244
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,703
Cuz he's actually felt

1245
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,239
Power of sage

1246
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,775
I thought it was cuz he read the dark

1247
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,311
Phoenix storyline

1248
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:04,383
He probably had this real

1249
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,223
Enforce

1250
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,599
And I got to have sex with it

1251
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:14,879
Piss God off

1252
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,671
And moved himself further from God

1253
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,975
Trying to get his pond

1254
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,511
Do bad things to

1255
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:24,607
Zombie

1256
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,703
Again I do seriously wonder what Rogan takes about having a giant world

1257
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,471
Play making it

1258
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,751
Acceptable an edgy

1259
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:33,567
To say things like Alex's right about a lot of stuff

1260
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,847
I thought hope he feels like

1261
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,127
Like a big pile of s***

1262
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:42,015
Hey and while we're at it I'm going to toss Tim building in there to Figueroa

1263
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:42,783
Piece of s***

1264
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:49,439
Yeah I don't know I don't know him personally but he certainly yeah

1265
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:53,279
Also I would ask Alex what he had to do

1266
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:55,583
To feel that satanic energy for like a minute

1267
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:57,119
If the Satanist get this

1268
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,423
From killing kids did he like kill a kid

1269
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:02,239
Or did he get a mini rush from that time he killed his dog

1270
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:05,823
Inquiring-minds-want-to-know also what does

1271
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,359
Does Satan give you the rush

1272
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,663
And if so why does Satan make

1273
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:15,551
So short is it like is it like a Reagan and trying to get people to Dick's

1274
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,343
I think it must be

1275
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,623
Could be

1276
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,647
Oh yeah

1277
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:23,231
They sound similar

1278
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,511
Done

1279
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,279
Truth

1280
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,815
And things that kind of rhyme

1281
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:28,607
If it's a slant rhyme it's

1282
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,655
What's my fourth at

1283
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,191
Barry Goldwater said

1284
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:36,543
So goes out to

1285
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:37,823
Do things

1286
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,359
Wherever he goes

1287
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,223
Burnout

1288
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:46,271
Holyshit

1289
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,039
Temporary

1290
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:50,111
Nope cuz I'm depressed until temporary that doesn't

1291
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,391
I don't even know what that means

1292
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,415
It means that there's

1293
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,439
The temporary end

1294
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:58,047
If you have temporary presents for a while

1295
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:03,167
And then you also have presents at the other times right

1296
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:11,871
Also temporary omnipresence does not imply or it doesn't it doesn't require

1297
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,687
That when you're not omnipresent you are not

1298
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:18,015
I mean if you are omnipresent

1299
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,295
You can always

1300
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,367
Infinite Space

1301
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:25,183
I'm in space and time are the exact same thing

1302
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:26,719
Sacrilege

1303
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,047
FaceTime

1304
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:34,399
I don't really care to tell me what the devil

1305
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:38,751
I need to really nail down what the. I want a stat sheet for the devil

1306
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,031
I would be in

1307
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:42,335
YouTube mad as well

1308
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:44,639
Is buff star

1309
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:50,015
He's like a little bit of magic

1310
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:53,343
Like a gigantosaurus

1311
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,391
Absolutely there's no way you can talk to them

1312
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:00,255
So anyway here's a story about Alex saying alright

1313
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:01,791
Go to the Capitol

1314
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:08,191
On a separate issue what's this it's a pro-life saying it was all these Democrat

1315
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,895
Booties women

1316
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:22,271
Abortion law pro-life

1317
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,135
Like Bigfoot

1318
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:34,559
And then all the sudden and I walk into the hallway and the women are going like this

1319
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:52,735
Video

1320
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:08,095
Ran into the other hot daughters whatever when I was young

1321
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,775
They were all in control

1322
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,639
So when you look at the British royal family

1323
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:23,455
Those are devil worshippers

1324
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:26,271
Who's come out

1325
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,575
Them

1326
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:30,111
Their selfishness

1327
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:33,951
The Rothschilds The Rockefellers all of their selfishness

1328
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:36,767
I don't want your old baby

1329
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:43,167
What's going on in really horrified of course

1330
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,447
That makes sense

1331
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,567
You're not worried about this

1332
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,359
Ghetto

1333
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,175
Guillotines

1334
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:57,247
About your soul

1335
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:00,831
And you need

1336
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:04,671
They found the clips

1337
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:11,839
That was it that was a repulsive display on his part

1338
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:14,655
Interesting Lee he does get to the end he says he has one of the

1339
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,679
Eclipse

1340
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,983
And I've only

1341
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,519
Seeing him threaten

1342
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,543
Play View

1343
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,567
4

1344
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,383
As one clip

1345
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:26,175
Someone clearly f****** with

1346
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:29,247
The protesters telling him that he's evil and then he needs to repent

1347
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,039
An abortion of course

1348
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:36,159
This is dr. Robert Santella Planning Center in San Diego

1349
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:39,231
4017 santello lost his medical license

1350
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,279
Partially due to claims that he quote

1351
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:44,095
Over prescribe narcotics 26 patient sandbox

1352
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,375
In the portion on another page

1353
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,167
However another part of

1354
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:51,775
The Judgment by the medical board of California was that he engaged in unprofessional conduct

1355
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:54,847
Based on his behavior in that video

1356
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,895
The protester who confronted

1357
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:59,711
Santella claimed that he was acting hyper aggressively

1358
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,503
And threatening him with a pair of scissors

1359
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:02,783
Whatever the case

1360
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,879
Quote in a brief phone conversation Santella told NBC 7 invest

1361
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:10,207
Navigate he lost his composure that day and he regrets his behave

1362
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:14,815
As it turns out it was a doctor with a couple of reprimands and his past

1363
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:18,143
85 year probation stretch in the mid-80s

1364
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,679
Her quote gross negligence

1365
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,447
Stanton carpet

1366
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:23,775
Overall it seems like he was kind of a s*******

1367
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,823
Exactly the sort of doctor you might expect the f***

1368
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,871
The protester by pretending to be a demon

1369
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,663
Instead of just leaving them alone

1370
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,943
But what he wasn't wasn't

1371
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,711
Actual

1372
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,735
Demon

1373
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:33,759
Answer this

1374
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:37,087
This is something that I have these kind of what a demon

1375
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:39,391
Maybe that's

1376
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,695
Just like how raptors go around with

1377
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,719
The Jurassic Park

1378
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,791
Yeah demons go around making

1379
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,351
Idaho.

1380
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,119
I don't know

1381
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,911
I was I was shocked

1382
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:57,567
I was talked about this all the time and he very rarely plays any specific

1383
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,615
And this is one specific that

1384
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,895
Do you like this is a flying.

1385
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,943
This is a faint this is

1386
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,223
Borderline

1387
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:04,991
Quote unquote

1388
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,271
Famous yeah

1389
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:08,063
High-profile video

1390
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:11,135
Of this doctor he got in trouble

1391
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:14,463
I mean granted he also was overprescribing

1392
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,487
Narcotics

1393
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:19,071
But they're still consequences for his actions in that video

1394
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:21,631
That's still part of what he was reprimanded

1395
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,911
4 +

1396
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:27,775
It's interesting to me that there was one side that has consequences

1397
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:30,079
And there's one that does not

1398
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:34,687
88 and almost seems like when there's consequences

1399
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,735
Does her negative behavior people

1400
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,319
Put to learn a lot

1401
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,111
But you thought you'd think

1402
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:46,463
You know what one thing there's no consequences for

1403
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:52,095
Alex not getting to the news

1404
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:55,167
I'm going to try to know if I can do this

1405
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,015
Satan

1406
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,279
Alright

1407
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,303
Well I mean

1408
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,631
I like that moment of Crisis that he had

1409
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:27,679
Clearly very authentically

1410
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:29,215
Momento

1411
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:34,591
I cannot get all this no I can't do it I'm going to expose it all album everyday

1412
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:36,127

01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:39,967
Talk about this intercept articles

1414
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:46,879
All right I will be lost

1415
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:57,119
Okay well we'll get to that eventually

1416
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,143
To get to First

1417
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:00,191
Are there is one thing that's really important

1418
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:03,519
I am so busy not complaining this is true

1419
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,799
But I have not tried

1420
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,335
A new ad

1421
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,127
For a week

1422
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:10,431
And we were supposed to launch it last week but

1423
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:17,087
5 minutes

1424
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,159
Plug

1425
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:23,487
Honoring the network brakes

1426
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,023
Operation

1427
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:25,791
And so

1428
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:26,559
You can get a

1429
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,095
Product

1430
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,375
The same

1431
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:31,935
Time so I don't have to do any work off air

1432
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:35,519

I was talking to a lot of the top developers out their high-end supplements

1435
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,271
Just staggering

1436
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:48,063
Staggeringly lazy

1437
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,087

1438
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,111

1441
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:58,559
Leprechaun commercial on air

1442
01:10:58,815 --> 01:10:59,327
Because

1443
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:02,655
Want to stay past 5

1444
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:09,055
This is a no-man's-land some Stations don't carry this water reveal the truth it's station

1445
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,591

I don't want to

1447
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,431
I want to do work

01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,199

01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,223
Stay past 5

1450

So he talks about this product for a bit

1451
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:23,391
Unfortunately

1452
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:26,719
Some stray names of things in this

1453
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:28,767
The ad read that he was unprepared for

1454
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,655
Botanical name

1455
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,471

Now

1458
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:45,919
Exclusive

1459
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,967

01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:48,735
Flip the switch

Supercharged

1462
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:55,135
I'll just be honest but y'all have to recut this and later by 1

1463
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,743
Read out that almost took off today I'm not complaining

1464
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:02,559
I just

1465
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,655
Alex

1466
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:13,567
This is just so horrible

1467
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,103
Do you think it's a

1468
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:18,175
Optimistic

1469
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:18,943
Deposit

1470
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:22,015
This is just G

1471
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:25,087
Seems like it seems like a sketchy

1472
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,367
You and I wrote yeah

1473
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:29,439
Trying to do an ad

1474
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:31,487
He doesn't have to do it later

1475
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,255
A fuc

1476
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,047
What's up you can't read the copy

1477
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:40,447
I would have to redo this I just wasted ever

1478
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,031
It's just it's just unreal

1479
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:44,799
Yeah

1480
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:47,615
It really doesn't work if it doesn't seem like a

1481
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,663
I mean there's no way that they brought

1482
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,431
Cats that

1483
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:52,223
And then you stop for a second

1484
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:52,991
That was live

1485
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,271
Is all there

1486
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:57,343
You know what

1487
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,367
What sucks

1488
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,159
About being me

1489
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,183
Is

1490
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,463
I think that's

1491
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:05,279
The funniest thick sort of thing I could

1492
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:07,327
Possibly imagine

1493
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:11,167
Cuz it's not trying to be funny not pay those in it

1494
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:17,567
You don't feel that bad cuz he's a monster every bit of it is both in character and 100% in

1495
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,335
Possible to believe

1496
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:20,639
You couldn't believe it

1497
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,407
I love it

1498
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,711
Is in blank do you know the difference

1499
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:27,039
Flavors of this show already just as one episode

1500
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:29,343
They're all over the place

1501
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:31,903
Screaming about the f****** devil and his power set

1502
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:36,511
Refusing to actually cover this intercept article that proves

1503
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:39,071
Custom order to bio-weapon

1504
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:45,983
Him been failing to do it ad reads heater lazy-ass can go home and get drunk I just can't I mean can you imagine.

1505
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:50,335
Dan Rather just all the sudden being like hey I got to cut this Lifeline commercial

1506
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:55,455
And I don't have the time for it after the show my little kids playing at a baseball game

1507
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,735
So real quick

1508
01:13:56,991 --> 01:14:03,135
Lifeline have you fallen down or something so I'm going to say Eliza dirty laundry

1509
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:09,535
I don't think I'm ready to do this commercial right now to take the next week off

1510
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:13,631
No I'm just going to go talk to my

1511
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,655
What

1512
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:20,799
He sounds like maybe he's got covid again

1513
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:24,127
I'm coughing pretty heavily on my chest

1514
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,407
Yeah I should take the

1515
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,175
I should really

1516
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,455
Get over this

1517
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,223
If you will

1518
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:31,039
So instead of actually covering

1519
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,319
The Intercept story

1520
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:34,111
You'll notice the way that he does this

1521
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:37,695
Cuz if you look at the intercept story it's based on two documents

1522
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,719
That they

1523
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,511
Have posted in their entirety

1524
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,535
Available

1525
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,327
That they got the report

1526
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:45,375
Instead of covering the

1527
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:48,191
Some people might cover the intercept

1528
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:51,007
And I think that would be a way to go about

1529
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,543
Instead

1530
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:53,823
Alex covers

1531
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:56,383
The American Journal coverage of

1532
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,151
The intercept

1533
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:59,455
Story The Boy Like Me

1534
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:02,271
Oia Freedom formation

1535
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:04,063
Confirmed fauci

1536
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,623
Funded construction of chimera

1537
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:09,951
Coronavirus is that was the headline for American

1538
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,231
Journal today

1539
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:13,023
So that's the American Journal

1540
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,047
Coverage

1541
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:14,815
Study

1542
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:19,679
He he he reads this and then there's a bit from The Intercept article that he

1543
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,447
He's reading

1544
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:22,751
And it's just not enough for him

1545
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:29,663
It's not salacious and I have a lot of insinuation that is inappropriate I believe

1546
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:33,247
At no point does it claim that the royal family has

1547
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,271
F*** the child

1548
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:38,623
So it is kind of dry

1549
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,903
So Alex's is

1550
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,439
It's going through like looking

1551
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,975
Through the actual

1552
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,511
Text of The Intercept article

1553
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,535
Bored

1554
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:50,911
Information

1555
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:55,007
Intercept is making the full document

1556
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,031
To the public

1557
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:03,455
Real journalist

1558
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,087
Right here

1559
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,367
Oh I

1560
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,647
A release

1561
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,951
Fauci funded Coronavirus

1562
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:15,999
A quote

1563
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:18,047
Chimeric coronavirus is

1564
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,679
Material

1565
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:27,263
Aaron here we know this place

1566
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:31,103
Augusta zerohedge coverage of the intercept article

1567
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:34,943
Because it's a he needs the filter of some other s*** head

1568
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:38,527
Coming up with the angle for him or else like he doesn't know what he's doing

1569
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:41,855
He has no context for the story he hasn't read

1570
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,903
Any of these documents he hasn't read

1571
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,695
Probably even The Intercept article

1572
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:49,535
Please read the American Journal headline and

1573
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,303
Excited

1574
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,863
Pretty good I mean you can

1575
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:57,471
Jesus Lizard thing running surface of the water

1576
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,775
And you can hear how slow it is

1577
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:00,543
C-cold raids

1578
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,311
So you know

1579
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,079
So you're like

1580
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,615
I can see you maybe

1581
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:05,151
Maybe spending 3 hours trying to

1582
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,175
To finish the intercept

1583
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:06,943
SEPTA article

1584
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,735
If that's your research level

1585
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:09,759
If your ability to

1586
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:11,807
Then they

1587
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:13,599
Okay

1588
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,951
The Intercept articles not that long

1589
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:20,511
Maybe 1,000

1590
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:21,791
Maybe maybe

1591
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:24,351
Are pretty long

1592
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,375
I would not fault

1593
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,959
Sorry I made it through about 50 page

1594
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,983
And I was like what am I

1595
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,775
I didn't write this

1596
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:35,359
It's Grant and I don't need a considerably more but

1597
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,127
At the same time

1598
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,919
I think it would be silly to demand

1599
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,711
Someone who is not

1600
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,503
Super literate in those

1601
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:49,951
230 you didn't read all of it

1602
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:52,255
Whatsoever

1603
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:55,583
That's why Paul Paul Joseph Watson has been such an important

1604
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,375
Piece of his workflow for so long

1605
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,679
Paul comes up with these framing

1606
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:06,079
For him to get the article or like annadanam Salazar at these people do do the writing for Alex

1607
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:08,639
They get the story they posted on Infowars

1608
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:09,919
In his voice

1609
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:15,551
End in the way that he can Hughes get the Angle Inlet me embellish on top of it out but I can't

1610
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:20,927
Self generate a good angle cuz I'm a moron generate an angle from

1611
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:22,975
The Intercept Artica

1612
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:28,095
That's not even enough for him he's so lazy

1613
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:30,143
You need that be stopped in there

1614
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:34,751
And zerohedge does that

1615
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:37,567
American Eagle

1616
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:43,455
So anyway Alex cold reads a bit of the screenshot that Cindy Zero Hedge article

1617
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:45,247
From the other Grant

1618
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:48,063

Is like

1640
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:44,383
What is he saying

1641
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:49,503
I don't know I don't know I did nothing out of this other than knowing that

1642
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,271
He can't read

1643
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:51,039
Yeah

1644
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:53,599
Straight up not being able to read

1645
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,647
Grant is a little bit more complicated

1646
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,207
Grainger

1647
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,511
Did describe this to me it again it's

1648
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,303
It's kind of the same thing

1649
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:06,399
Taking viruses that are found in the wild

1650
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,167
From sampling

1651
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,471
And putting them in

1652
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,007
A laboratory setting

1653
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:13,311
Where you can see if they can in fact

1654
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,080
Sal's

1655
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:16,384
With a stew

1656
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,664
Recite

1657
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:18,688
It's

1658
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,248
It's more complicated but it's very similar

1659
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:23,808
In terms of goal and scope

1660
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:27,904
And do some of the language used sounds like

1661
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:28,928
Okay Mary

1662
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,720
Oh that sounds like

1663
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,608
Still this isn't Gano function research

1664
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,400
This is not at all but Alex

1665
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,936
Is pretending that it is

1666
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,216
Has nothing to do with like

1667
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,008
Fauci being like

1668
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:45,312
I'll order this one

1669
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:46,848
Ridiculous

1670
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:48,896
That was another thing that I learned

1671
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,176
Raptor reading like that

1672
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:53,760
The pages of the grant proposal is just reading that language is going like

1673
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:56,064
Even if I read all of this

1674
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,880
It is not my area of under

1675
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,416
Standing

1676
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:03,232
Reading all of this information is not going to help me

1677
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:09,632
Be whatsoever just like calling somebody who is not a health Ranger is going to be the best way to figure out how the Grinch

1678
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:12,960
Incredibly helpful

1679
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:14,496
Southside

1680
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,264
Confirmed

1681
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,056
In my consult was

1682
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:17,824
How

1683
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:18,848
Not

1684
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:23,456
A lot of money every time people

1685
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:27,040
Liquid Alex been like all they're killing people for 60g it's like

1686
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,904
They wouldn't beat you wouldn't be able to get

1687
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,440
These people to like

1688
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,464
Design

1689
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,512
A world-destroying bio-weapon

1690
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:37,280
Free

1691
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:40,352
$600,000

1692
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:46,752
Kind of silly telling me that they wouldn't spend at least a billion on a world ended virus

1693
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:53,408
Let me know. I feel games could spend a billion tomorrow until everybody why would they do it

1694
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,504
Cheap places the same thing as those fake antifa contract to like

1695
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,784
There wouldn't be a grant

1696
01:21:59,040 --> 01:21:59,552
For this

1697
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,600
If someone works out

1698
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:04,160
Cooking up a

1699
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,440
Spell supervisor weapon

1700
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:07,488
It kind of imagined maybe they would

1701
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:08,768
Wouldn't leave a paper tree

1702
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,304
Anyway

1703
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,584
Alberto's

1704
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:12,864
Bombshell staff

1705
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,680
Put on screen

1706
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,448
Body

1707
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,752
The show headline today

1708
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:21,056
Just think about what a bombshell

1709
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:21,824
That is

1710
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,640
Maybe Riddler

1711
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,968
Freedom of Information Act. Confirm

1712
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,760
Galaxy created covid-19

1713
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:31,040
Team chimera

1714
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,576
Bio weapon

1715
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:35,136
And lied to Congress

1716
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:39,488
This is an emergency broadcast

1717
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:41,024
It's probably going to need to

1718
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:41,792
Retract that

1719
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:46,912
How is it that you can call your own headline of bombshell

1720
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:47,680
F******

1721
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:54,336
But you'll get the headline I mailed out of the made-up information that I made

1722
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:58,176
Also because it's really fun

1723
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:00,224
In that first

1724
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,016
528 pages long

1725
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,832
How many times do you think I'll choose name is in it

1726
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,136
3

1727
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:11,744
Zero so close

1728
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,584
So outside of cold reading and yelling a little bit

1729
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,888
Alex does not cover these documents

1730
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:18,912
At all

1731
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:21,984
Of course not there's no wrestling with what the actual

1732
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:26,336
Research they were doing was actually

1733
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:28,384
I thought it hyper disappointing

1734
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:31,456
Because I think mostly what do you think could be rebutted

1735
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,224
Just by saying

1736
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:33,248
Nope

1737
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:37,088
Yep I fell really pissed off

1738
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,112
But I tried

1739
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:38,880
Yeah

1740
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:41,952
Yeah that is that's a massive

1741
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,232
Massive disappointment

1742
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:49,376
There's just nothing to hang your hat on man there's no there's no juice

1743
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:52,960
Even The Intercept was trying to be

1744
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:58,336
Insinuated because probably is just so f****** boring I'm not I'm not sure if

1745
01:23:58,848 --> 01:23:59,360
You know you could

1746
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:06,016
Reply emotive to them I have no idea what led that coverage to be what it was

1747
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:10,368
It's got a thing like we got

1748
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,392
Document

1749
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,184
Yeah we might as well put something

1750
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,720
Sing out about it

1751
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:20,608
Could see another angle of it to being like well if we have these documents that we got through our foia lawsuit

1752
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:22,912
And we don't report on them

1753
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:25,728
People will think we're covering something up

1754
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:27,008
I could see all kinds

1755
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:29,824
Different thought processes he's going it but I just still

1756
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:30,848
Take another path

1757
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,128
Yeah

1758
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:34,688
You know what's bad news though

1759
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:36,992
Headliner

1760
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,296
Will that do it would be

1761
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:41,088
It's not true that

1762
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:42,880
Got the bad news is that everybody's going to

1763
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:46,976
Mismatch

1764
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,328
Last year was a hoe

1765
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,608
Last year was fear-mongering

1766
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:55,936
This year from Indy up with the Delta Marriott

1767
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:59,776
He's super infested there's no way to hide it no way to get away with

1768
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:02,336
If you haven't already had, before you're going to get it

1769
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:03,360
You better

1770
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:06,176
Have your vitamins and minerals in your water in your sunshine

1771
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:08,224
Early treatment

1772
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:09,504
We going to the hospital

1773
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:13,600
My head is security I had security guy at a really good friends was in great shape

1774
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:15,648
Amanda's use a nurse

1775
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,696
North Austin

1776
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,152
That's a bummer

1777
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:39,456
If it is life-in-death Alex

1778
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:42,016
Then you are responsible for the deaths

1779
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,552
Quite a few

1780
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,856
Yeah and I mean this

1781
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:47,904
This blase everyone

1782
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:48,928
When's going to get it

1783
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:49,952
Attitude

1784
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,768
Is not something that he's had

1785
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:53,792
4

1786
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:55,584
A long. Of time

1787
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:58,144
And that attitude

1788
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,704
If he had that attitude

1789
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,520
During some of the other stages of his coverage

1790
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,800
That's a problem

1791
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:07,104
Who's the real problem

1792
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:10,176
Anyways a liar and day-to-day doesn't actually believe any

1793
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,200
You saying so who gives a

1794
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,504
You want some more bad news

1795
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:15,040
Usher

1796
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,320
I'm not busy

1797
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:19,392
Oz is a fraud

1798
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:22,464
Okay rainforest Ultra or Ultra

1799
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,256
Alright how's this supply chain

1800
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:27,840
Add device oldest house so it's fine

1801
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:29,120
But the product

1802
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,144
Might be too strong

1803
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:35,520
I said I want to make something even stronger super clean

1804
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:37,568
What is the best strongest formula out there

1805
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,360
Kill people

1806
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:42,176
Tell me how

1807
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,224
They're quite

1808
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,784
Of the product total

1809
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,576
Twice as strong

1810
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:49,856
Charles

1811
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:50,880
Twice as much

1812
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,672
And twice as strong as four times

1813
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:56,768
It may be too strong for some people

1814
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:01,120
The first time it's a few drops

1815
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,168
It's got

1816
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,448
Everything in it

1817
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,312
Guarana seed

1818
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,080
Oh boy

1819
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:15,200
Okay

1820
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:16,480
Twice as strong

1821
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,016
And you take a

1822
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:18,784
Fifth Third of it

1823
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:24,160
Aren't you only taking two thirds of your regular about

1824
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:26,464
Twice as strong and there's

1825
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,488
Double the amount

1826
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,536
So if you take a third of it

1827
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:30,816
Actually

1828
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:32,096

01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:56,160
Let's double it

1841
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,208
Yeah

1842
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:00,512

Going through this product read about house

1844
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,352
Maybe it's too strong

1845
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,120
To f***

1846
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:07,424
I had a realization

1847
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,984
Mike down for this cuz you may have the same realization

1848
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:10,752

Don't use this product it'll turn all your clothes White

1850
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:17,664
Please don't you tell you why that's so powerful

1851
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:19,712
Green tea leaves you tell you about that

1852
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:20,992
Antioxidant

1853
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,272

Potassium magnesium

1855
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:33,536
Content

1856
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,168
That has been the focus of both ancient and modern fascination with science

1857
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,704
Ashwagandha root

1858
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:42,752

4 inch mini beneficial properties

1860
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:52,992
That's the line that Alex f***** up in the read that he did earlier

1861
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:59,392
He's doing it again he's not saying it at this time

1862
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:03,744
What a f****** a****** I love it I hate him so much

1863
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,512
It's

1864
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,560
It's the only way that comedy could be hiding

1865
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:12,960
Next step in the game it really is trying to do the same.

1866
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:17,312
5 minutes after he gets off air

1867
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:18,848
Oh my God

1868
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:19,616
I I think

1869
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,896
I think he's trying

1870
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:22,432
How to kill me

1871
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:27,296
He's trying to see if he can make one person so angry that person

1872
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:28,064
Explodes

1873
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,856
That is all that I can

1874
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:30,624
Process

1875
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:35,232
Through all of this

1876
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:38,048
The part of a blood pressure medication trial

1877
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,608
He's really good at

1878
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:42,656
I love you

1879
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:44,704
I loved it so f****** great

1880
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,776
Pretty obvious to your product

1881
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:54,176
It's just that you might as well just say we crammed a bunch of s*** in there

1882
01:29:54,944 --> 01:30:00,320
We put out if we put all this crap in a blender and turned it into a pill

1883
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:04,160
That's how little we care about what it is we do as somebody who listen

1884
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:06,208
Do a lot of Alex's show

1885
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:07,488
Relish those moments

1886
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:14,144
Ashwagandha root is 548

1887
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,936
Chaga mushroom

1888
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:19,008
You're right that is fun

1889
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,544
So look

1890
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:22,592
Alex has not done his job

1891
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,896
We're pretty clear on this

1892
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:29,248
He struggled and then he swear to God that he was going to reveal it all and

1893
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,272
Tell them every

1894
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,064
And then he pried

1895
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,856
Twice to record a

1896
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:40,256
New commercials they didn't have to do it later

1897
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:46,656
4 hour left of the show Ono

1898
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:47,936
Owen Shroyer

1899
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,984
But I definitely

1900
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:54,592
Use yes right now

1901
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:58,944
Emergency reporting

1902
01:30:59,456 --> 01:30:59,968
Michelle today

1903
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:07,648
Everything breaking right now is totally insane

1904
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,208
It came out today

1905
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:11,744
Perception of God

1906
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:14,816
F*** off

1907
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:18,400
Where fauci is in hundreds of pages of documents we showed earlier

1908
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:26,336
I want all these viruses to buy you a chimera Force for a new SARS virus

1909
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:37,856
Yes sir Alex is going to need to take an hour of o in the show because he hasn't covered this news that he has

1910
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:40,416
Rambled about

1911
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,440
He doesn't know

1912
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:43,488
How to cover this

1913
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:44,768
So he can't do it

1914
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:45,536
What no

1915
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,304
If he cannot

1916
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:47,584
It's a fascinating

1917
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:50,144
Thing where he's unable to do it

1918
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,960
But he's calling out that he hasn't done it

1919
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:56,800
But he has done it as well as he ever covers any other news story witches

1920
01:31:57,312 --> 01:32:00,384
Say a headline from zero Edge and then yellow B

1921
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:02,688
I think I think what's going on

1922
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:04,224
Is the intercept

1923
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:07,808
Appears to have way more credibility than all of his other

1924
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:09,344
Dumb dumb s*** yes right

1925
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:14,720
So he knows that he's got to talk about this because it's a big

1926
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,256
For his b*******

1927
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,560
It's as close to a get as he's going to be

1928
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:19,584
And then

1929
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,888
He thought well just do it like

1930
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,680
I do my other regular

1931
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:26,240
So we didn't really do any prep

1932
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,264
Britney thought he could do

1933
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,800
Just Spin A Yarn out of it however my

1934
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:29,568
What you want

1935
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:32,128
And then because it's actual

1936
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,408
Did journalism

1937
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:39,808
It's written very drily with information and he doesn't really know how to deal with that are too high

1938
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:40,576
Right because

1939
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,856
Like when

1940
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:45,184
Zero Hedge or Infowars is reporting that fauci

1941
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,720
She created a bio-weapon

1942
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:47,488
Or whatever

1943
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,536
It doesn't really

1944
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:53,632
Rise any alarms when nothing happened right

1945
01:32:53,888 --> 01:33:00,032
Who treats them as if they're actual journalism reporting

1946
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,056
Used to like

1947
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:03,360
Oh wow another cover-up

1948
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:04,640
Or whatever

1949
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:06,432
The Intercept is

1950
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,456
At least

1951
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:09,248
An outlet

1952
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,272
Get something

1953
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:13,856
And they've done actual cover-ups

1954
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:18,720
Stories where you been like holyshit has been

1955
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:19,744
Attached to someone

1956
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,536
Important pieces of Journalism

1957
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:24,352
And the stakes are really high for Alex

1958
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:25,376
Pretend

1959
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:27,424
That The Intercept is reporting

1960
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:32,544
Documents that prove that fauci created a bioweapon out of like

1961
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:36,896
Uptown menu the cool little bit of this Coronavirus

1962
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:38,688
Who were Liberty

1963
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:42,528
Some mustard you know what it is it's almost like a canker sore you know like

1964
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,320
He keeps he doesn't know how to do it

1965
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:46,624
He doesn't feel like he can do it

1966
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,416
But he can't leave it alone

1967
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:53,280
Just keeps tapping it and going like maybe if maybe I've got it in this time and maybe I'll get her shot

1968
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,048
And then every

1969
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:56,352
Every time it just looks like he's spending his wheels like an

1970
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:58,144
And what I mean by the states

1971
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,496
Being too high like there's no explanation for why if that is the case nothingness have

1972
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:04,288
Because

1973
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,080
Snowden

1974
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,152
Yeah

1975
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:13,248
Cuz everybody

1976
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,272
King insane

1977
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:17,344
What if your Alex you can't really explain like

1978
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:19,904
This isn't

1979
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,184
Infowars

1980
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:25,024
Guys this is real busy these people are real

1981
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:29,120
These people do like what I would do but sometimes it's real

1982
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:32,192
I imagine I'm doing what the intercept

1983
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,216
Was doing

1984
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:33,984
Snow

1985
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:34,752
The intercept

1986
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,544
Friday weather report

1987
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,312
What they have

1988
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:38,592
But I will say

1989
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:39,360
To their credit

1990
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,384
They wouldn't do that

1991
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:43,968
So we've got a very special guest I really wanted to get on

1992
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:47,296
She really helped expose hydroxychloroquine

1993
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,720
One-hundred-percent Freeman train

What

1998
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,264
Stella Immanuel

1999
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:12,640
MD is the successful physician with an active practice in Houston as well as the founder of

2000

Power Ministries in Cheney

2001
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:21,856
So Stella Immanuel is one of the doctors who was Oprah molding hydroxychloroquine as part of their big push last year by that

2002
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,136
Mysterious group America

2003

Cuz Frontline doctors

2004
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:30,816
Almost immediately after she appeared in a video endorsing hydroxychloroquine people began looking into who this doctor was

2005
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,096
Nevada gold mines

2006

Ultimately they could be having a dream sex with a human witch instead of a demon

2022
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,360
Deposits

2023
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:17,408
She has some ideas

2024
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:21,248

She is said that the government is run in part not by humans but by reptilian

2033
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:44,800
Other

2034

Aliens

2035
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,872
Okay so here's why I

2036
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:48,640

2037
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:52,224

We had a pretty good balance going for a while

2042
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:07,840
Black people that go to Roswell and

2043
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:10,144
Just go leave us alone after Facebook

2044
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:12,448

01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:41,120
In addition to all this nonsense she's claimed that scientist to found a gene that makes people religious

2052
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:43,168
And they're trying to find a vaccine against it

2053
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:46,496
She seems to think that magic eight ball toys are in the farias bottom

2054
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:47,520
Make children witches

2055
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:48,800
And she is super

2056
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:50,336
Super anti-lgbt

2057
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,104
Atq

2058
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:51,872
She's quote

2059
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,152
Accused gay Americans

2060
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:55,456
Practicing quote homosexual terrorism

2061
01:37:56,224 --> 01:38:00,320
In the same sermon she praised the father's decision not to love his transgender son

2062
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,600
After a gender

2063
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,464
Stella Immanuel is not a serious person and has a ton of

2064
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,512
Very seriously f***** up beliefs

2065
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:12,864
A year ago she had a video that went viral so Alex is going to bend over

2066
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:15,168
See if you can squeeze any of that attention

2067
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:18,240
He can get out of her cool this is a sad book

2068
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:21,824
Looking for both of them not good

2069
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:22,592
Not good

2070
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,920
Associate to please don't like demon

2071
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:31,552
Insects and stuff like that and I mean but that's every time I've ever had Morningwood I've known that I was

2072
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:34,112
Sleeping with a demon in my dream

2073
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:36,416
And that's why I am such a happy person

2074
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:38,464
Has she ever wreck

2075
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,488
Recognize that

2076
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,048
Sleeping with demons in your dreams brings happiness

2077
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,864
Demons are freely

2078
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:54,336
Their conversation is not to be believed and one of the things

2079
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,384
The reasons today

2080
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:57,408
Demodex

2081
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:59,456
Episode unacceptable

2082
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:04,320
There is one thing that comes up that's like well maybe this explains something

2083
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:09,696
I'm putting the genomes of dead babies

2084
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:14,304
Bizarre cells never Diana's isn't satanic I don't know what it is

2085
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:20,192
Children

2086
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:21,472
I don't know what

2087
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:24,032
60

2088
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:28,128
Is it possible that this whole time the issues that Alex's.

2089
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:28,896
But satanic

2090
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:29,920
Just means that some

2091
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:30,688
Things bad

2092
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:32,224
Do you think that

2093
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,504
Maybe he has like

2094
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:35,552
That level Lowe's

2095
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,344
That level of just like

2096
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,392
Childish morality

2097
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:40,416
You're just leaving

2098
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:42,720
Like not understanding terms

2099
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:43,488
Yeah

2100
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,864
Asking me whether he

2101
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:50,144
He understands work

2102
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:52,704
I think we both know the answer to that

2103
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:57,312
I lack the words to describe this be

2104
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:58,080
Pacific

2105
01:39:58,336 --> 01:40:00,640
Lack of understanding of words

2106
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:01,920
Yes

2107
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:06,272
I mean cuz childish doesn't describe it now could ask

2108
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:09,856
The four-year-old if satanic means bad in a four-year-old would say

2109
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:14,720
Why would we need the word satanic if it's just a longer version of Bad

2110
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,256
Yeah there's other

2111
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:18,816
Other characters in other other

2112
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,352
2 satanic

2113
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:21,888
Yep anyway

2114
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,704
This interview is out of

2115
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,984
Out there man

2116
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:27,520
To something else

2117
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,568
This is dependent

2118
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,432
Trying to make money

2119
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,968
It's

2120
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,248
Genesis 6

2121
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,040
Einstein Hospital

2122
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:45,440
Humanity

2123
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:49,280
I'm creating a new being might they say that humans are obsolete

2124
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:52,608
What happened the days of Noah

2125
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,144
Yes

2126
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:54,912
Wow

2127
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,192
Okay

2128
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:56,960
So

2129
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:58,240
Class Schwab

2130
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:00,032
And all these people

2131
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:02,080
Gates fauci all them together

2132
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:03,872
They're having these

2133
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:05,664
Who's covid pandemic

2134
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,432
In order to

2135
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:08,480
Forget the vaccines at the people with

2136
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:09,504
Will turn them into a

2137
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,808
Completely new thing not human anymore

2138
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:13,856
Which is

2139
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:15,392
I guess going to cause a stock market

2140
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:16,160
Crash

2141
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:18,464
The collapse of the dollar or something

2142
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:20,768
I don't know anymore but look

2143
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:22,304
This happened back when Noah was for

2144
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,120
That was my conclusion as well

2145
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:27,936
Highways are specifically thinking man

2146
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:28,960
History repeats

2147
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:30,752
It's out this is exactly what

2148
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:31,520
When did Noah

2149
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:33,056
As I was

2150
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:34,080
Thinking about

2151
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:35,872
The stock market collapsing

2152
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:37,408
I was like man

2153
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,944
Noah's going to need

2154
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:45,088
Two of every currency with a as the world is Left Behind do we have any reports of any like

2155
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:48,928
Cryptocurrency billionaires trying to build a giant

2156
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:49,696
Boat

2157
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,464
Cuz if so

2158
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:52,000
Let's make him serious

2159
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:53,280
I have another question

2160
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:57,632
How do we reconcile viruses with the Noah story

2161
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:58,656
You know what I'm saying

2162
01:41:59,168 --> 01:41:59,680
We don't

2163
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:04,800
Farpoint story is really more about there being giant that's

2164
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:06,336
Didn't you know that

2165
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,184
Fowling

2166
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:27,584
Genesis 6

2167
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:29,120
But we also

2168
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:32,704
Double really wanted to

2169
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:37,056
By the way all the other ancient cultures have this in their in their text

2170
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:40,384
And all the other ancient culture

2171
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,016
Psychotic

2172
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,088
So apparently were talking Nephilim here

2173
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:49,856
We're talkin about

2174
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:51,392
The Giants in like

2175
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,928
Show Angels Came Down at sex

2176
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:54,720
Human women that created hybrids

2177
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:56,256
That's why she had a flood

2178
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:59,072
Oh boy so weird

2179
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:00,352
We're doing that again

2180
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:01,120
Apparently

2181
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,704
I I mean yeah you know

2182
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:06,240
You know I

2183
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,264
Fine

2184
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:11,616
With people believe I don't think you are God

2185
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:16,480
This is exactly like you telling me that

2186
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:20,320
Zeus really had sex with people

2187
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:21,088
As a swan

2188
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:23,136
Yeah and it's like

2189
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:24,160
No

2190
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:24,928
No he didn't

2191
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:25,952
Nope

2192
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:27,232
I feel like

2193
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:28,768
I feel like you

2194
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:30,304
True

2195
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:35,936
You know you might be shooting your shot a little bit too early cuz this is just the beginning of the interview

2196
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:36,704
No

2197
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:37,472
No

2198
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:38,240
Nose

2199
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:39,520
Strong no slapping

2200
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:40,544
In the face swell

2201
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:42,336
Sounds to me like you're a naysayer

2202
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:44,896
I'm a super huge naysayer

2203
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:51,808
You telling me that people got off of ships and interbred with humans sacrificed and that's

2204
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:55,136
It's all God's plan

2205
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:56,928
Stella Immanuel

2206
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:57,696
But pray for you

2207
01:43:57,952 --> 01:43:58,976
To be quiet no

2208
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,656
See what I'm saying

2209
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:15,872
Any boys that wants to jump Island

2210
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:19,456
Name of Jesus

2211
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:23,808
Silence

2212
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:27,392
Antifa

2213
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:29,440
I need to pay that.

2214
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:33,280
Amen to that.

2215
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:42,240
I do I do enjoy the combination of Amen to that and Doc

2216
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:45,824
So now you're going to have to be quiet

2217
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:49,920
Once again degrades at rivermill annoys making the

2218
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:51,456
Jerk-off motion

2219
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:53,248
Yeah so we come back from break

2220
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:58,880
We get an interesting Theory presented

2221
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:03,744
And that seems to be that there are inhuman vampires that walk among us

2222
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:05,792
But appear to be human

2223
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:07,072
Come on Irene

2224
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:09,888
Kathy told me that forever ago

2225
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:13,728
What is going on right now Alexander we have

2226
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:18,080
I'm just going to stay on somebody wake up on GFS

2227
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:20,384
Which people were dealing with

2228
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:22,432
Human beings

2229
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:23,968
We are dealing with

2230
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:25,760
Evil seat in the land

2231
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:26,784
Human

2232
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,112
Hoverboard

2233
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:32,160
So we got an evil seed in the land

2234
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:32,928
Another vampire

2235
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,488
Sure it's a little bit after this

2236
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:36,768
Astellas Skype goes out

2237
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:39,072
Alex takes this opportunity to

2238
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:40,096
Try and be ration

2239
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:46,496
Who did God take her Skype out is retribution for Facebook not putting her page back

2240
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:48,288
Someone probably hacked

2241
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:50,080
In the back end

2242
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:51,872
Taylor Swift

2243
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:54,176
Mingle

2244
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:01,344
Skype Roku

2245
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:03,392
I think you need to hear this phone

2246
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:13,376
The voice of reason

2247
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:15,424
There'd even is that how you

2248
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:21,568
Interpret right I know this might sound a little bit out there that there is any human vampires walking around

2249
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:22,336
But let me

2250
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,616
Credibly

2251
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:26,432
And responsibly discuss this their demon

2252
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:27,200
Possessed

2253
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:30,528
Obviously I agree with you

2254
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:35,392
Miss that disagrees with me right and they are working for the devil

2255
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:37,184
About what you're saying

2256
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:40,256
That might seem a little out there for some people

2257
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:44,096
These people are just demon-possessed come on

2258
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:49,472
You really have to recognize that what's going on is there's an interview where they conservative

2259
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:51,520
Rational position The Voice

2260
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:55,104
Open Center is maybe they're just demon-possessed

2261
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,968
It's just suck we've gone so far

2262
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,016
Rich has gone so far

2263
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:02,784
Eastman's

2264
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:05,856
Hour on this interview instead of covering the intercept

2265
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,416
That's right I completely forgot

2266
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:12,000
I didn't try and cut it add in the middle of neck is well

2267
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:15,328
Excuse me I'm sorry doc

2268
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:18,144
This is our favorite new

2269
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:22,240
Formula too strong for demon

2270
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:27,104
So the Skype is out Alex's trying to reframe the conversation a little bit

2271
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,408
But Stella stays on point

2272
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,432
She has a point

2273
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:31,200
That you wants to make

2274
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:32,992
And is not going to be

2275
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,648
Or are you saying that it is a spiritual

2276
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:45,536
Come out and say abortion is our ritual

2277
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:46,816
Do you want to kill babies

2278
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:50,144
Let me ask you this why do you think they're revealing themselves right now

2279
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:53,216
Alex you don't understand

2280
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:56,800
They are not human beings this is not station

2281
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,176
So we have not human

2282
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,968
Yep that are walking around

2283
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:07,040
How to keep appealing to bib Bible verses

2284
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:08,064
Is it don't seem too

2285
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,088
Make her point

2286
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,392
It is really funny cuz Alex can't argue again

2287
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:15,488
Cancel Bible whenever people are making

2288
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:21,888
You're using your own power against you you can't make up quotes from the Bible I make up quotes from the Bible

2289
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:26,240
Otherwise I can't make them up anymore

2290
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:28,288
This is this was a little bit

2291
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:30,080
Tough to understand exactly the point

2292
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:30,848
That was being

2293
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:31,616
Made

2294
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:39,040
No

2295
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:40,064
Complicated

2296
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:40,832
Xan

2297
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:42,112
The grant.

2298
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:43,392
Quite frankly

2299
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:45,184
Do to get to the bottom of

2300
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:46,720
As it turns out

2301
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:49,024
Stella believes essentially

2302
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,816
The people are being cloned

2303
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:52,608
And then these clones

2304
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:56,960
Being taken over by the devil or something

2305
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:59,008
It's a little bit convoluted

2306
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:01,312
But it'll become more clear as we go along

2307
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:06,432
Tell you guys

2308
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:09,248
Worried about

2309
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,624
Who sing that

2310
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:19,488
Images onto the base

2311
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,024
You people like gif

2312
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,864
You made them live forever

2313
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:27,680
Die

2314
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:29,472
Themself

2315
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:37,664
Microsoft has right here

2316
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,968
Common ground

2317
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:40,736
Frontier

2318
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:43,296
So now the global is still being told by the devil

2319
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:45,856
Right that they're going to make this clone

2320
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:47,136
That'll be immortal

2321
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:49,184
Download the brain into it

2322
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:51,488
Alex I was like alright

2323
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:54,048
And these clothes are not human

2324
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:56,608
My phones are not human vampire

2325
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:58,400
I just don't

2326
01:49:58,656 --> 01:49:59,424
I don't like

2327
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:01,728
Listening to all of that and actually

2328
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:04,032
Hearing in my brain Alex go

2329
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,568
I got a handhold here

2330
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:11,968
I can jump on this weekend

2331
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:21,184
A little glimmer of

2332
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:25,280
F****** light at the end of the tunnel is like let's roll baby

2333
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:26,816
Really pathetic

2334
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:34,496
Phantom Zone

2335
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,288
It's a demonic

2336
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:39,104
Why you're so blood test

2337
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:41,664
What is living in this preacher

2338
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:46,784
We don't even know what else

2339
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:53,696
Evil

2340
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:59,328
I know that's definitely the future plan that's how I interpret Revelation as well definitely wow

2341
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:01,376
That's exactly how I interpreted revelation

2342
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:07,776
Yep The Book of Revelations dangerous thought process that she's

2343
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:08,544
Advancing

2344
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,336
Alex is agreeing with

2345
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:12,384
Is that right

2346
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:16,992
There's really no way to definitively know if let's say Bill Gates

2347
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,272
Is a human

2348
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:20,320
Or if he's a clone that's

2349
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:21,856
It's been taken over by a demon

2350
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:25,184
I didn't really even human and if he's not human I mean he doesn't really

2351
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:25,952
Amorites

2352
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:26,976
And you know what

2353
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:28,768
There's really no way to tell about

2354
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:29,536
Anybody

2355
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:32,608
I think there is a way to tell

2356
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:33,888
Advantage there

2357
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:35,936
Showing signs of demons

2358
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:38,496
Well

2359
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:39,264
Demon real

2360
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:40,544
Well I think

2361
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:43,616
The only person who could possibly tell me exactly

2362
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:44,896
Who is the Satan

2363
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:46,176
Nesting who is a demon

2364
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:46,944
Is somebody

2365
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:52,320
He was so confident and who's willing to pray for me to just listen to her have somebody who has discerned

2366
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:56,928
I think I think I'm any different people with

2367
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:58,976
Discernment will have different conclusions

2368
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:02,560
And yet somehow they'll all look like they care about

2369
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:04,096
My town for this

2370
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:06,144
Is it going to really piss you off

2371
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:08,448
Stella discusses how she had a vision

2372
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:14,080
No

2373
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,408
All of these people have something

2374
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:19,200
Very specific in common

2375
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:26,624
People

2376
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:33,280
Ministry

2377
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:41,216
Oh yes

2378
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:42,752
But really

2379
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:44,544
In the Bible the Bible talks about

2380
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:46,592
The problem is

2381
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:48,896
Right now

2382
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:54,528
Genetically modified human being

2383
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:57,344
Zodiac loans

2384
01:52:59,392 --> 01:52:59,904
Containers

2385
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:01,440
Intermountain looking fontanez

2386
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:05,024
Watch a movie called The late because when they gave me this bitching

2387
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:13,472
Advanced Eyecare in the movie theater

2388
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:15,520
Always

2389
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:17,312
It's always a movie always a movie

2390
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:18,336
Exactly like iMovie

2391
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,640
Every single

2392
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:23,200
It's so consistent

2393
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:26,784
These people who have these conspiratorial views

2394
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:27,552
And

2395
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:29,856
Bizarre theories that are

2396
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:33,184
Distinct from reality ultimately they just can't tell the difference

2397
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:35,488
It does seem like that is a very

2398
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:36,256
Consistent

2399
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:37,024
Feature

2400
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:40,864
Thinking that just like a movie 18 ability to grasp

2401
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:44,192
Sort of themes inability to grasp

2402
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:45,472
Metaphor

2403
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:47,776
Symbolism

2404
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:50,336
That kind of stuff is

2405
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:51,360
Is it really

2406
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:52,128
Does

2407
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:55,968
I'm becoming more and more convinced

2408
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:58,528
Stated that kind of concrete thinking

2409
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:00,064
He's kind of

2410
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,624
It like not

2411
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:05,696
Not indicative where are diagnostic of

2412
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:07,232
Having

2413
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:08,256
Kind of

2414
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:09,280
Worldview

2415
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:10,560
It's something

2416
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:11,584
Is shared

2417
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,608
Between a lot of folks

2418
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:15,680
In what would appear to be separate

2419
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:17,216
Branches of

2420
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:18,496
Yeah

2421
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:22,848
Conspiracy you know I mean we've talked a lot about like

2422
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,896
Ways to avoid search

2423
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:25,920
Certain things and

2424
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:28,992
And for me I think there's a really easy balance

2425
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:30,272
Between free speech

2426
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:31,552
And kind of controlling

2427
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:32,832
This

2428
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:34,112
Angela

2429
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:35,136
Propaganda

2430
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:38,208
And I think it's so simple really and it's just like

2431
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:39,232
You can't

2432
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:40,768
Call other people not here

2433
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:44,096
Like I feel like that's so simple any

2434
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:47,680
Isn't it at the heart of literally every genocide

2435
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:52,800
The propaganda almost always begins with dividing people into who is real

2436
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:53,568
And who's not

2437
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:55,360
Who counts and who doesn't

2438
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:58,176
Who's that human being and who's in human form

2439
01:54:58,432 --> 01:55:03,552
Subhuman werbelow human and the Only Rule was you just cannot go

2440
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:05,600
On the radio or on TV

2441
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:06,368
And say

2442
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,672
And claimed that these people are not

2443
01:55:08,928 --> 01:55:09,696
Human

2444
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:12,000
Yeah water a lot of the justice

2445
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:12,768
Suffocation

2446
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:13,536
4

2447
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:16,352
Massive violent campaign

2448
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:18,400
Have been predicated on the idea

2449
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:19,936
Of people being less than human

2450
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:23,008
Various groups for whatever reason

2451
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:26,080
Yeah it I mean I don't I don't know if

2452
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:31,200
That's the Only Rule I would have but I certainly would have that as a rule

2453
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:35,808
It just really does and it what I like I'm sure I've called somebody

2454
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:40,416
Inhuman worser something along those lines behavior is that

2455
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:42,464
There is a

2456
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:48,608
But even then I am totally willing to change my communication style because I feel like

2457
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:50,144
100% volume

2458
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:56,544
Instances where you have behaved that way I'm sure you'd be willing to apologize for

2459
01:55:59,104 --> 01:55:59,872
Anyway

2460
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:01,152
Look globalist

2461
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:02,944
Think of brains are going to be redownload it

2462
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:03,712
The body is

2463
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:04,480
Did the trick

2464
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:07,552
What you doing

2465
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,816
If you die

2466
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:35,200
Demonic spirits

2467
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:36,736
Windows

2468
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:39,552
Demonic spirits inside them

2469
01:56:51,584 --> 01:56:52,096
The new blood

2470
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:55,936
If demons can possess the spirit

2471
01:56:56,704 --> 01:56:59,264
Possess a body that hasn't been cloned

2472
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:01,056
Why would they need to clone

2473
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:03,360
The body secondary question

2474
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:04,384
What's that what

2475
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:07,200
Consent is necessary to make a club

2476
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:12,832
There's no reason why human Bill Gates would need to be involved in the plan to make

2477
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:19,488
Kill Bill Gaither make a clone pod people situation because

2478
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:21,536
Do you have to get their consent

2479
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:24,864
And even if you're tricking do you have to go along with the

2480
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:26,400
The plan wear your promise

2481
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:29,216
Your brain will go into a clown later with seams

2482
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:30,496
Stupid

2483
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:33,568
For someone to be like

2484
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:35,616
Utrecht

2485
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:36,640
The smartest

2486
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,432
And most

2487
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:40,992
Entrepreneurial mind

2488
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:42,272
Yeah around

2489
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:47,392
Just clone them after you

2490
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:48,928
After they were dead and put a demon in

2491
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:49,696
Yeah

2492
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:50,464
I don't understand

2493
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:56,608
This is really dumb think I think what's fascinating is that all of their Devil's arak

2494
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:59,424
Exactly exactly to the

2495
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:01,472
T as stupid

2496
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:03,008
As they are

2497
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:05,824
I mean I would be insulted

2498
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:06,592
If I was

2499
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:07,616
God because they

2500
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:10,432
I think my photo is so dumb

2501
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:13,760
What's the point of even having a large enemy if he

2502
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:16,320
This stupid well I mean you know

2503
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:19,136
Actually you know this wedding

2504
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:20,672
But the example I was going to use

2505
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:22,208
Brings up a very calm

2506
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:23,232
Placated

2507
01:58:23,744 --> 01:58:27,328
I was going to say like you know the the Harlem Globetrotters playing against the washer

2508
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:28,864
Generals cuz they like to

2509
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:29,632
Should be fancy

2510
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:34,752
The people who are the Washington generals have to be very talented

2511
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:41,408
Really dude

2512
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:45,248
What's funny to me is that

2513
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:49,344
The God Satan Dynamic that they have created in their minds

2514
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:51,136
Is exactly like pink

2515
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:52,160
Pinky and the Brain

2516
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:54,976
Snowboards what's going on

2517
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,792
Do clones need blood

2518
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:58,816
Show me plush

2519
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:01,632
Yeah

2520
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:02,912
This idea

2521
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:04,448
Fairly expensive

2522
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:05,728
And that is that like

2523
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:07,776
A hospital administrators

2524
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:09,568
Possibly

2525
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:10,592
Clone

2526
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:11,360
Themselves

2527
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:14,688
And that's why people are dying in the hospitals of like covid and

2528
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:18,528
And stuff and that's why they won't give people hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin

2529
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:21,088
Because they want people died in the hospital because they need blood

2530
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:32,864
Something we need to realize that in the hospital

2531
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:37,216
Beautiful and kill them

2532
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:42,848
Let me say this

2533
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:44,640
What what the f***

2534
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:53,088
Hey listen that sounds pretty far out it sounds like it could get some people killed, so go for it

2535
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:56,160
Possibly some Hospital

2536
01:59:56,416 --> 02:00:02,560
Traders are clones that if somebody doesn't give you Hydrochloric win that probably be

2537
02:00:02,816 --> 02:00:08,960
Because the CEO of the hospitals that closed and if it's a clone who wants your blood f*** it go kill him who gives a s***

2538
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:13,568
Going to kill you and steal your

2539
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:14,336
Jesus

2540
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:20,480
Is Christ these people have no real clue how dangerous it's outrageous

2541
02:00:20,736 --> 02:00:22,784
Stella has made her points and

2542
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:23,552
Alex

2543
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:24,320
As a

2544
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:26,624
Responsible engager in

2545
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:28,160
The public discourse

2546
02:00:28,416 --> 02:00:33,280
Yeah conversation responsibility to probably end by saying

2547
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:36,096
A lot of the stuff has been really dumb

2548
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:38,400
Also dangerous

2549
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:39,168
I hope they

2550
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:45,568
By having this conversation by audience has been exposed to these ideas and knows that you're not someone to be taken seriously

2551
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:47,360
Instead

2552
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:48,128
He says this

2553
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:50,944
Craziest sounds weather

2554
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:51,712
She's pick

2555
02:00:51,968 --> 02:00:52,736
Catching up on this site

2556
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:55,040
Louis.

2557
02:00:55,808 --> 02:00:56,576
In the future

2558
02:00:57,344 --> 02:01:00,416
Whether it's actually happening

2559
02:01:00,928 --> 02:01:02,464
How crazy this is

2560
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:03,232
Damn

2561
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:04,000
So

2562
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:05,024
Either

2563
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:08,096
You know things are crazier than we know and she's right

2564
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:11,168
Or the holy spirit is giving her a vision of the future

2565
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:11,936
And this is what

2566
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:12,704
What's coming

2567
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:15,264
That's not a good way to wrap up the interview

2568
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,848
Irresponsible

2569
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:19,616
Yep yep

2570
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:20,640
But we're not done

2571
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:21,920
I don't

2572
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:22,944
See how that's f***

2573
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:23,712
Kim Possible

2574
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:25,248
That lady

2575
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:26,272
Is nuts

2576
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:28,832
What's that straight-up lunacy

2577
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:29,856
Project Camelot

2578
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:32,928
It's it's

2579
02:01:33,696 --> 02:01:36,512
Embarrassing I mean it's a problem is if exact

2580
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:40,608
Ugliest stupidest stuff that you hear from like Joe Rogan or whatever

2581
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:45,472
You just get Nephilim so you're like oh well Giants are involved so I can just write it off

2582
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:47,008
If Joe Rogan just said

2583
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:49,568
I took Ivermectin because this guy who believes in

2584
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:54,432
F****** Nephilim told me it's a good idea we could all move the f*** on it would help

2585
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:55,456
It'll be easier

2586
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:57,248
Let me see this one thing

2587
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:59,808
They could Elevate The Comedy of this episode

2588
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:01,344
It's him doing that talk

2589
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:03,648
He's not going to know that that

2590
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:06,208
Alex Wassabi

2591
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:08,512
No he has to get creative

2592
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:13,120
Get mad about a random internet comment about an interview he did the table

2593
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:13,888
Get the f***

2594
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:15,936
Yesterday

2595
02:02:16,448 --> 02:02:17,728
Dr. McCullough

2596
02:02:19,008 --> 02:02:20,288
It was very powerful and Luke

2597
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:21,312
86ed

2598
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:24,128
You're the salon

2599
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:29,248
It's been nine years and I'm done with

2600
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:33,856
We still keep pushing the virus narrative

2601
02:02:34,368 --> 02:02:35,904
Anything he is

2602
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:37,440
Muddying the Waters of Truth

2603
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:38,976
Is changed

2604
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,792
What has happened to him.

2605
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:47,168
Car wrecks gunshot wounds

2606
02:02:49,472 --> 02:02:49,984
Delta

2607
02:02:52,288 --> 02:02:53,824
What hospital they were empty

2608
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:57,920
Totally overwhelmed

2609
02:02:58,432 --> 02:03:00,224
Almost died my mom almost died

2610
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:02,016
I bought it really was on my chest

2611
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:08,160
Mostar office

2612
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:09,184
That's had this

2613
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:16,096
I do of my own observation what kind of fun

2614
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:19,168
F****** denial has he been in about the

2615
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:24,032
The spreading of this virus that he's been actively participate

2616
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,592
His whole office had covid

2617
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:28,128
His parents had covid

2618
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:29,920
He said it multiple times

2619
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:32,736
I guarantee

2620
02:03:32,992 --> 02:03:34,784
There's someone in this chain that's dead

2621
02:03:35,296 --> 02:03:36,320
There we just don't know about

2622
02:03:36,576 --> 02:03:38,624
Totally there's somebody in this

2623
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:40,160
Cluster

2624
02:03:40,416 --> 02:03:41,440
Let's say this Hadley

2625
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:42,976
Serious complication

2626
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:46,048
Braum's there their irresponsible

2627
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:47,072
Handling a

2628
02:03:49,632 --> 02:03:50,912
Yeah and also just for fun

2629
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:52,448
He interviewed Joseph

2630
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:54,496
Mercola the day before

2631
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:56,800
Great Robert

2632
02:03:57,568 --> 02:03:58,848
I mean this is

2633
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:00,640
That's just

2634
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:02,688
I just so f***** up

2635
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:03,712
Fiance

2636
02:04:03,968 --> 02:04:08,576
I mean I don't know it's definitely not something

2637
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:10,368
Just about

2638
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:12,416
Fairly recently

2639
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:13,696
All these people who is

2640
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,488
I mean that

2641
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:17,024
That's just so f***** up

2642
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:22,144
That's just so f***** up it's also really funny that he's so mad about this internet

2643
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:25,472
I mean thirty-five-year-old Luke

2644
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:26,496
Has a lot to say

2645
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:28,544
Look

2646
02:04:29,824 --> 02:04:31,616
Some people on the internet who have

2647
02:04:31,872 --> 02:04:33,920
Usernames that I've no idea who they are

2648
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:35,200
Think I've changed

2649
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:40,832
Dick pics and 45 won't stop

2650
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:42,112
Claiming that I'm not

2651
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:43,904
The same person I used to be

2652
02:04:44,672 --> 02:04:45,440
So I'm going to have a

2653
02:04:45,696 --> 02:04:46,464
Real defense

2654
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:52,864
Meltdown over it while I tell people all the s*** that I did that I received the consequences for

2655
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:54,144
But I refuse to learn from

2656
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:55,936
So that's one way to add

2657
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:58,496
An extra layer of forests into the episode

2658
02:05:02,592 --> 02:05:04,128
I hate you don't know if you can handle this

2659
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:07,712
Doctor why don't you why don't you lead us in prayer

2660
02:05:07,968 --> 02:05:09,248
Definition for a couple minutes

2661
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:11,296
Yes thank you

2662
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:16,928
People

2663
02:05:17,184 --> 02:05:19,232
Gloria

2664
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:20,256
You're stupid

2665
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:22,304
The universe

2666
02:05:25,632 --> 02:05:27,424
Send it

2667
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,104
Poster in the name of

2668
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:37,152
Cancel

2669
02:05:37,408 --> 02:05:38,688
She prays for a while

2670
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:40,480
Close things out

2671
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:45,344
A prayer

2672
02:05:45,856 --> 02:05:50,720
Send in the clowns

2673
02:05:51,488 --> 02:05:54,304
I just think that a lot over

2674
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:55,840
The course of this episode has been a lot.

2675
02:05:56,096 --> 02:05:58,400
Disgusting

2676
02:05:58,656 --> 02:05:59,168
End

2677
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:00,192
Refocus

2678
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:01,472
Guess on

2679
02:06:01,984 --> 02:06:03,008
How proud Joe Rogan

2680
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:05,312
When should be convincing his audience

2681
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:09,920
That Alex is worthwhile things to say and that he's generally right about things

2682
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:16,320
You know what sometimes he's wrong and when he's wrong he apologizes

2683
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:22,720
Way more than these other people in the media

2684
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:29,120
A Outburst but he comes to me we talk privately and he's he's a good guy nothing that he's ever

2685
02:06:29,376 --> 02:06:35,520
Merced has actually been that crazy know I sound crazy out there

2686
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:38,080
Later on you see it happen and you know that it

2687
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:41,664
It's true. I got to get his words out like when you see

2688
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:46,272
Blood-drinking demon clones wandering Hospital hallways

2689
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:53,440
If people didn't know that when they go to the hospital there's a good chance that a saint evil clone

2690
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:55,488
Possessed by a demonic

2691
02:06:55,744 --> 02:06:57,280
Spirit trying to kill them

2692
02:06:57,536 --> 02:07:01,376
Well they might just be going to the hospital thinking that they're going to get medical care

2693
02:07:02,144 --> 02:07:05,216
I don't care who's on who's show and I don't care any of that stuff

2694
02:07:05,472 --> 02:07:07,264
A culture blah blah blah whatever the

2695
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:11,104
I don't care about any of that nonsense but I do want

2696
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:12,128
To be queer

2697
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:13,920
That being that effective

2698
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:17,504
And treating him as anything other

2699
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:18,272
Gavin

2700
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:21,344
A buffoon and a liar

2701
02:07:21,856 --> 02:07:23,136
And a dangerous

2702
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:23,904
This person

2703
02:07:25,696 --> 02:07:28,512
Lend credibility that is undeserved to things like

2704
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:30,048
What we've listened to on this show

2705
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:31,072
Yeah I mean it's

2706
02:07:31,328 --> 02:07:32,864
And just the level of like

2707
02:07:33,632 --> 02:07:39,264
Look at all these people trying to kill you as they waded through the blood of people that they have been

2708
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:41,056
Office

2709
02:07:41,312 --> 02:07:42,848
Like the whole f****** thing

2710
02:07:43,104 --> 02:07:44,384
Yeah and I

2711
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:46,176
Reflecting a little bit on like

2712
02:07:46,432 --> 02:07:47,200
What are we doing

2713
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:48,736
You know sometime

2714
02:07:48,992 --> 02:07:52,320
Listen to this stuff and I like what are we doing

2715
02:07:52,576 --> 02:07:57,440
Really worried that some people who listen to our shadow might have the idea that like

2716
02:07:58,208 --> 02:07:59,488
We could we have

2717
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,792
Any kind of ability to like

2718
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:03,840
Get Alex off a air or

2719
02:08:04,096 --> 02:08:04,608
Or

2720
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:08,960
Yeah he'll the damage that he's caused yeah I don't believe that at all

2721
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:11,776
And I am coming around to possibly

2722
02:08:12,288 --> 02:08:14,080
The things that we can do

2723
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:15,872
Is present something

2724
02:08:16,384 --> 02:08:17,664
They can hopefully

2725
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:18,944
Be a rebuttal

2726
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:19,968
To the point

2727
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:21,760
Of people who think

2728
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:22,528
Did Alex

2729
02:08:22,784 --> 02:08:23,296
Yeah something

2730
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:24,832
That's it

2731
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:26,368
That's the best I can do

2732
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:28,416
He's like abbv countervailing

2733
02:08:28,672 --> 02:08:29,184
Enforce

2734
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:31,232
Against that that flood of

2735
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:32,768
Actually Alex is right

2736
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:34,816
On my Galaxy

2737
02:08:35,072 --> 02:08:35,840
Unlock Galaxy

2738
02:08:36,096 --> 02:08:37,632
Two claims that world leaders listen to him

2739
02:08:38,144 --> 02:08:38,656
I can

2740
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:41,472
Guarantee to every one of our listeners

2741
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:43,520
0 World list
