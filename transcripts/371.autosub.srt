1
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge B

2
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
MoneyGram

3
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,088
Stripe.com

4
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
Everybody we're couple dudes like sit around and talk a little bit about Alex

5
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,888
Indeed we are. Jordan

6
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,728
Pickler song ever gotten you through a

7
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,384
Time yeah I mean hundreds of them hundreds of

8
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,504
Go to like some people like in the olden times would listen to Blood on the tracks whenever they got a breakup

9
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,088
Something something like that you don't like thing that

10
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,368
You zeroed in on

11
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,672
Not as your song You Know

12
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:37,024
No I meant to say I got something that I've had to the longer

13
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,424
Yeah but somebody Mighty Bosstones stuff you know

14
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,824
I want to listen to half of Eli question the answers album

15
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,224
Probably be kind of sentimental about like talking

16
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,624
Songs in the garbage is that on that album I can't remember how to party that's on a different

17
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,024
Gets one more noise and other disturbances still disturbed by Boston song YouTube

18
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,608
The whole track listing of some of those albums

19
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,912
Terrifying

20
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,752
Love those album wake up in a cold sweat knowing this

21
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,568
Still got me through some tough times when I was a much younger man

22
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:27,968
Junior High and high school really loved a lot of that and maybe that has more of a strong sentimental connection

23
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,112
It's me a little bit ugly that's from devil Devil's Night Out

24
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:37,952
I can probably I haven't listened to any of that in a long time

25
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,256
But I bet if I turned it on

26
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,792
It would be really great

27
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:47,424
Next time I go to the gym

28
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,824
The other thing that comes to mind is now like I are a lot on the side of things like Kesha and Carly Rae Jepsen

29
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,152
And not in that stuff but that's not like as long-standing

30
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:00,224
Domino's pop

31
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,624
Is that like a counteracting allylic when you're feeling down you want to listen to bright shiny pop music

32
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
Like more than

33
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
Look up right now

34
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,864
I think it's because I listen to Tonto Alex Jones like I have a lot of toxic things coming in

35
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,168
Brightside

36
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
Siri

37
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,568
That's interested in a lot of cash isn't really bright and cheery

38
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
That's true

39
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:30,432
I know I don't have a song

40
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
Yeah that's right

41
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,112
So Jordan today

42
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
Situational irony

43
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
As I told you

44
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,952
Before we started recording he

45
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,792
I spent all day yesterday listening to Alec

46
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,096
What to drink to prepare an episode

47
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Sunday

48
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,424
And Monday episodes from this week

49
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,984
And it's just it was one of the

50
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,056
I haven't had in a long time of just like

51
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,080
Feeling like it

52
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,104
All the with

53
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
Yeah I think it's just

54
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
Who cares

55
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,296
Sunday is it feels like him going back to his roots a little bit but it's just

56
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
Just kind of boring

57
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
Conspiracy stuff I just

58
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:15,232
It feels untethered and it Like Larry Nichols didn't come back on like he said he might have course

59
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:19,583
And listening to Monday and he's just talking about Trump going to Walter Reed hospital

60
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,167
Right okay and so it's all just drop is being poisoned

61
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:34,431
Poison on top of that I just felt like real

62
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,223
Inspired by it I felt like I

63
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,551
I did think it was a little bit interest

64
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,135
Only in so much as back the last time

65
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
Alex covered this

66
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,487
Poisoning narrative videos doing

67
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,511
The weather

68
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,815
The way he presented it was

69
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
They're trying to kill our president

70
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:59,007
You know it was very much alike Rodger calling for Global has blood

71
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,383
And the way I was I heard this

72
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,455
On Mondays show was much more like

73
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,759
Why what you going to do

74
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,879
What's the sense of Life president again

75
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,439
What do you expect from the globalist

76
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:22,047
There are people in their bags would be mad at them but it was almost like a prop

77
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:28,447
Yeah I just been was being done to him as opposed to like we've got to stop this from happening

78
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,519
Nothing but I also feel like I'm probably reading too much into

79
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Smitty's just

80
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,127
I feel a little bit gun-shy about being too

81
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,199
Like over-the-top about anything but

82
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:43,039
I do think there's some friends easy as Alex was introducing

83
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:48,159
The narratives about is Trump there

84
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,183
The globalist

85
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,231
Stooges in here to make

86
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:57,631
Do to neutralize too much into that

87
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,655
Does going to like it

88
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
It's easy

89
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,727
Need to take Alex at his word and then be like

90
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,031
A couple months later

91
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:10,431
Shoot them they were talking about he was going to be going on to newer thing

92
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:17,855
Who burned by that a tiny bit in terms like oh I believe you

93
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:24,255
That's not fair no it's In fairness to us there's every reason to think like why this might be real but I don't want to

94
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,023
I don't want to jump

95
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
Too far into like

96
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:32,191
This time he's talking about poisoning he's doing

97
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,983
Anyway I listen to these episodes

98
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,031
Clips from that man like

99
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
Trying to find

100
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
Have to get into us

101
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,895
I feel like I was walking through mud and is like

102
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,919
I can't do this

103
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:47,295
So I've decided that we're going to do an episode today about a certain question

104
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,135
That I have been wrestling with and we brought up on the show before

105
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,999
It'll be sort of Wacky Wednesday issue as it's fairly wacky we are going to

106
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
Lord this question

107
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
I will get into that

108
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583

00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,703

Business heroin

124
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,695
So good

125
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,743
Freakishly large

126
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:08,959
Thank you so much gravity head zero

127
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:15,359
These gents to do that but be very helpful

128
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,151
So Jordan like I said

129
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
I have a question

130
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,223
Has been wrestling with

131
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,783
And the last time we dipped our little toes and

132
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,319
Project Camelot world

133
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,367
It was a question that was coming up

134
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,415
And insult

135
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
Important

136
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
And that is

137
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,535
Why is Kevin Moore doing what he's

138
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,935
He's doing right right alright he is the guy if you do not recall he's a guy who's producing and directing the doctor

139
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,007
Comentari about Kerry Cassidy of Project Camelot

140
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
And Mark Richards

141
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
And his actions seem

142
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
Very suspicious to me

143
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:52,223
So I want to give a little bit of an introduction for everybody needs a little bit of quick reference

144
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:57,343
On what has happened are you going to channel previously

145
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,879
You're going to need to do a voicemail

146
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,927
Word

147
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
World you've got to do the voice

148
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,791
So for those like a refresher

149
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:12,191
Early on in this doing this podcast this knowledge fight here we realize that talk about Alex Jones all the time

150
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
Good for anyone

151
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:19,615
To give ourselves in the audience a break we would take periodic little trips little Excursion

152
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,175
To talk about people who claim to have been to space

153
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,455
And claimed to talk to alien

154
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,271
You've been interviewed on a show called Project Camelot

155
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,879
Project Camelot is hosted by Kerry Cassidy the least credulous woman on the planet

156
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:35,743
Initially it was all a lot of fun with super soldiers and chocolate stealing Raptors

157
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
Until overtime at bake

158
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,607
Came clear that Kerry was holding some of the same underlying bigotry

159
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,935
We see and other right-wing Outlet

160
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,751
We're like this is fun

161
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:53,151
It's always her support for the protocols of the Elders of Zion was certainly troubling and I can't

162
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,223
I'm thrilled with some of her other comments about Jews generally speak

163
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,503
And suspicion

164
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,647
So over time it became less Whimsical and fun to listen to her show but her interviews with

165
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,719
Captain Mark Richards were still required viewing

166
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:11,327
Mark Richards is a man who paid a teenager to kill a guy who owed him money back in the 80s

167
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
Has been imprisoned ever since

168
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:19,775
Well in prison Houston talked it an elaborate story about how he's innocent because he was secretly off-planet at the time of the murder

169
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,615
Doing a space mission and its sentient spacecraft whose name is Minerva

170
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,919
And so far there are no holes in that Hill

171
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:32,831
He knows everything about human politics right Galactic Affairs and the only journalist he'll talk to is Terry Kath

172
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:39,999
Because he's in prison carry can't really interview him so she just goes to the jail talks to him then sits down in front of a webcam

173
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
When she gets home and reviews her notes

174
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,863
That's the name of her series about Mark Richards

175
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,887
Total Recall

176
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:52,799
Leave aside for a moment that the reference to a movie based on Philip K Dick's short story that plays with the idea whether or not Memories

177
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,567
These are real

178
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,847
That's not important

179
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,175
Over the years markets will carry some absolutely insane

180
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,991
Well she at which she then reports to her audience

181
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:05,855
Is Gospel coming to the very real and very reliable source who definitely isn't the murderer

182
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,695
He's a noble space Captain whose friends of raptors in the enemy of the evil Reptoid

183
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,511
He's got a you got a hell of a resume

184
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,863
You. I will give him a fake resume as long as the day

185
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
Enter Kevin Moore

186
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,447
A British documentarian

187
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
And Chandler

188
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,543
4 years Kevin hosted a program called

189
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,591
It still does to in some fashion

190
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
Call the Kevin Moore Show

191
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,759
Where he interviews some of dubious dubious people about paranormal and new-age kinds of topics

192
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,623
He's head Kerry Cassidy on as a guest and even interviewed Mark's wife Joanne Richard

193
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
You showed no signs

194
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,487
Thinking that what they were doing was absurd

195
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,279
Anthony's interview with Joanne

196
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:49,887
He completely white along with her stories about Mark being a secret space Captain who was framed for murder

197
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,447
But something changed at some point

198
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,799
And now Kevin is directing a documentary series about Mark Richards being a murderer

199
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,639
And how Carrie Joanne and another promark figure named Simon Park

200
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
Are all basically in a cult

201
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:08,063
Obviously Kevin is right about that

202
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:12,927
It's somebody's finally tackling this subject Richards being a liar

203
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:17,535
Because for the longest time when we've talked about it we both assumed he was telling the truth

204
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,095
He's really opened my eyes on the subject

205
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
Isabella's right

206
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,471
Mark is definitely murder and his Defenders are all delusional to send

207
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:31,359
But even if I agree with that conclusion something doesn't sit right with me about how Kevin reached the conclusion

208
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:37,247
You have no credentials as being a person who would have Scruples but now he's positioning himself as someone who's going to

209
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
Expose a major fraud

210
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,831
The Paranormal in UFO community

211
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
I didn't get it

212
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
I started looking into it

213
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
And this is all still reek

214
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,999
Well let's not forget

215
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,303
He still does not have any scruples

216
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,095
No

217
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,375
This is not a sea change

218
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:57,215
This is an isolated incident of him trying to do here

219
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:02,335
I suppose good thing still surrounded with scamming people for hundreds and

220
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
The dollars

221
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,919
It looking into Kevin Moore so far

222
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:10,527
No in the past I see nothing but a picture of a completely uncompelling charlatan

223
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,855
Like he has videos that we've talked about where he channels alien

224
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
Like this

225
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,903
We come to you

226
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
Many

227
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
The gift

228
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
Off Kevin

229
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,167
Is the gift to be able to channel

230
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
Triple

231
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
Entities

232
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,823
Multiple

233
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
Being

234
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
And that is

235
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
Kruger

236
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
In this special

237
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
Google timer

238
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
Canada's right now

239
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,023
He doesn't need to change his voice

240
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,607
Or accident different way

241
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,423
This is an agreement we have with him

242
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:06,079
Okay so he never is never going to get tired of that

243
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:12,479
Channeling aliens there's no rigorous standards of proof of what he's doing the psychic hotline

244
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:18,879
Use the show to give largely uncritical interviews to all manner of dubious folks like the employees of his psychic hotline

245
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:25,279
Or the guy from Apex TV who claims to talk to Time Travelers with really easy really just creating viral hoax content

246
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559
Probably for ad Revenue

247
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:32,959
Kevin claims that he's making this documentary series because what. Marker doing is bad for the community of alternative Folk

248
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,287
Because they don't do their research they haven't done that there

249
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
Giving it a bad name absolutely

250
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,871
What they're doing is not real

251
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,943
Where is presumably what Kevin is doing is based on reality

252
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
It's an absurd just

253
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,527
Application for the documentary so I rejected

254
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,623
If we accept that can't possibly be why he's doing what he's doing

255
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,159
We're left to ask

256
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,951
What's really going on

257
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,023
I can't pretend to tell you that I solve this mystery

258
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,815
But I had a little bit of a theory

259
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
And I explored it

260
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,887
I'm going to present that theory to

261
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
Alright

262
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,007
What are the primary things that bothered me about this whole thing is worth some money coming

263
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,287
Who bigger Quest

264
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
Is Carrie his mom

265
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,663
No okay nevermind you already pitched at Marcus's dad

266
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,759
I know I've got one Theory

267
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,319
Where's the money coming from Jordan

268
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,367
Is Kevin more independently wealthy

269
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,951
Resale of a business ten years ago thats funding this whole thing

270
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,743
It's a relevant question because he's

271
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,791
Clearly traveling all over the place

272
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:34,399
Videos of him flying around he's going to California

273
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,983
Need to try and track down people involved in marks Casey's jetset

274
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,543
You're open for this documentary

275
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,103
He's gone all over the place and I will say that he has

276
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:49,503
Way higher production value than a lot of the folks I come across that this face weirdo Community was producing

277
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,111
Even assuming he look naturally talented video producer

278
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,647
There's still some money going in

279
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:00,511
Answer that question let me back to a video that Kevin posted

280
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,791
2013

281
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,351
Introducing a new partnership

282
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
Withey Kevin Moore

283
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,751
Osho is in partnership with Ozark Mountain publishing

284
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
Taking weed

285
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
Beyond

286
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
Unexplained

287
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,919
Hello I'm Kevin Moore

288
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,711
And I host the mall show

289
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,247
Alternative late night talk

290
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,527
On radio

291
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
TV

292
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,319
And online

293
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
And I'm doing

294
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
Picture of Damaris

295
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
That's Amore

296
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
Now

297
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,583
The Marshall alternative

298
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,143
The edge of

299
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
Alternative

300
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
Radioactive

301
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
Programming

302
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
The show's mission

303
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
Is the ugly

304
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
Unawakened

305
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
Inhumans

306
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,687
Turnover researches

307
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,087
This goes on for a while about

308
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,135
All the books of Ozark Mountain publishing

309
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,975
And we're going to launch a platform where you can buy advertise

310
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
So it's

311
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,535
Comprehensive partnership

312
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,071
Do this is interesting

313
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,167
Ozark Mountain publishing is not a super huge publishing Outlet

314
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:18,079
So it seems strange that they would be partnering up with a not super huge paranormal show all the way across the Atlantic

315
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,847
Goshen

316
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:25,247
It's hard to say exactly what kind of Revenue Ozark Mountain publishing is pulling in put a review on Glassdoor from my former

317
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,599
Employee complaints that working there involves a quote crazy family managed environment

318
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,927
And says that it's a small company with less than 50 employees

319
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
It sounds right

320
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,743
I don't know why I think

321
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,815
For some reason I'm prejudiced against any company that is like

322
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,119
Ozark Mountain Air Ozark

323
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,167
About the Ozark water bottle

324
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,239
Singapore Mei you mean they make water bottles so they're bad

325
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,615
Lake of the Ozarks ever been there

326
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,151
Gorgeous like have you ever

327
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,199
Yes in the middle of Missouri

328
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,527
I think my buddy his parents had a lake house

329
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,575
We went tubing

330
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,367
Alright good time

331
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,183
Alright well then I retract my Ozarka prejudiced

332
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,255
Ozark is a big broad term don't be so bias okay

333
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:13,375
It was founded in 1992 by woman named Dolores Cannon

334
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:18,751
Doris passed in 2014 but prior to that she was a bit of a player in the world of the Paranormal

335
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:25,407
He's written a ton of books she put out the she put on the Ozark UFO conference which is allegedly currently

336
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,759
Right now in its 33rd Year I'm not sure that's true but it could be

337
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,343
I mean yeah the fire Fest is in its third year right something like

338
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
30 ER

339
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
I was being nevermind

340
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,511
Dolores was a doing hypnosis Back In The Sticks

341
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
What's Ryan help page

342
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,071
Listen to things like smoking

343
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
Hanover

344
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
Behavioral

345
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,655
Okay so she wasn't scamming

346
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,727
It's hard to say but I don't have a

347
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,543
I don't have a gigantic Lee negative

348
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:59,199
Sense about Dolores although I do think she's a little Scamp

349
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
But if you're trying to help people

350
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:06,623
Quit smoking with hypnosis that's way better than if you're charged $90 in a minute to get

351
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,927
Psychic reader 70 years

352
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,999
To cover

353
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,583
In the course of doing her work she stumbled upon a woman in 19 6

354
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,399
Regaled me with stories of a past life

355
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
When she was hypnotized

356
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:26,079
Dolores's workout interrupted when her husband got injured and she had to care for him and the family had to locate to the Ozarks

357
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,151
But by the late 70s he was back up and running hypnotize

358
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:33,247
I got a particular line and Dolores is bio pretty fun

359
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,087
Quote her early work was heavily focused on reincarnation

360
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,391
Which I got her acquainted and comfortable with

361
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
The concept of time travel

362
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,511
How could it not I mean

363
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,815
So many reasons

364
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,863
Sure I feel like those two things are not related

365
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,655
Not necessarily

366
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,727
So her work began is past life regression

367
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,775
But eventually grew into what she calls

368
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,079
Quantum healing hypnosis technique

369
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:02,687
Which is the name that you have trademark all right now

370
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
Little

371
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:10,111
And she continued to work in the field she found resistance on the part of the mainstream book houses to publisher writing and that she's

372
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:16,511
Started up Ozark Ozark Mountain publishing in 1992 of books of her own as well as those

373
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,559
Tons of other New Age sort of writer

374
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,655
Three of the books you put out where of her own

375
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:28,031
Victor they purport to be the authoritative interpretations of Nostradamus prophecy

376
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,055
Three of those

377
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,871
Well it's a three-part series

378
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:37,503
You can be certain that they are authoritative because Nostradamus himself tools are so

379
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
Alright

380
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:44,671
She was having her patient began speaking as Nostradamus and told her that everyone was getting his s*** wrong right

381
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,231
Because of changes to the french-language overtime

382
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,535
I need a Delores to write a book to correct the record

383
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,095
Of course you did I don't believe any of that

384
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,631
Course he didn't only writing

385
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,911
French but who cares

386
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,471
So Dolores Cannon runs this Publishing House

387
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,055
And they've entered into a partnership with the Maury Show in 2013

388
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,103
Which is kind of weird

389
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
What's up Thailand

390
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:11,039
I know how it can be when you're trying to get your name out there sometimes you make marketing decisions that seem strange to external Observers

391
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,343
Like a couple years ago I bought a Facebook ad

392
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,135
Princeton

393
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
But here's the thing

394
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:21,536
This wasn't just Ozark Mountain publishing buying an ad on Kevin's show

395
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
This was a partnership

396
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:29,216
Like in that ad that we was at that announcement it's a business integration sort of thing

397
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,544
You can tell I guess what this was not short-term

398
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:36,128
I were you two ton of Kevin's videos from the past few months

399
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
In 2019

400
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,736
And most of them start with an ad for Dolores Cannon

401
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,512
A great ad for deluxe

402
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,048
Define the power

403
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,328
To heal themselves

404
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,120
Physically

405
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
Emotionally

406
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Spiritually

407
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:05,824
When I started teaching my classes it was in 2002

408
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
And I was just doing

409
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,176
The past life regression

410
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
And

411
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,224
Contacting Visa

412
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
Conscious Park

413
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,832
But then as the time went on and we found

414
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,112
Powerfulest

415
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,416
Do with it

416
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,328
A lot of the students begin progression doesn't really tell

417
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,864
What it's all about

418
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,192
This is so much more than that we think you

419
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
Change the name

420
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:38,336
So was a few years ago we decided to change the name

421
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,896
Quantum healing

422
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
Hypnosis

423
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
Technique

424
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:47,808
And this is the healing technique that reason album teaching it

425
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,136
Hortense 2002-12 year

426
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,952
What if you could time travel with them

427
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:58,560
Visit mythical places or Angelic Realms of a Wills

428
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,584
All the gallic

429
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,888
Help others

430
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,680
To speak to the highest selves

431
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
Yukon

432
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,544
Dolores has 2,000 people from

433
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,568
McChrystal

434
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336
How to use

435
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,872
Qhht

436
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,920
I know you can learn her method

437
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
But going directly

438
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
To Dolores

439
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
Dot-com

440
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
And don't forget

441
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,552
Dimension the discount code

442
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
Mortal

443
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:28,256
So that's six years that the Maury show has been in partnership with the Dolores Cannon

444
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,560
/ Ozark Mountain publishing business

445
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,120
And that seems interesting to me yeah

446
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
Yeah

447
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:40,288
Having a coupon code for time travel seems very interesting to me it's not so much time travel for yourself it's the

448
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,312
Quantum technique

449
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:44,640
That allows you to help other people time travel

450
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:51,040
No I get that I think is even more irresponsible because you're teaching people how to do a weird therapy

451
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,320
Two other people

452
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,112
I'm not comfortable with any of this

453
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,160
Franchising your time-travel therapy

454
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,184
Borderline

455
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,768
I've got through tons of Kevin's videos and I can find no evidence

456
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:05,632
Do any other sponsors other than Dolores Cannon extending to the Ozark Mountain publishing

457
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:10,240
And his own website channeling.com which is little more than a front for Kevin psychic

458
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:15,360
So I don't see where any other income or flow of money is coming from

459
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:20,736
Accept this long-standing partnership with Dolores Cannon and Ozark Mountain publishing

460
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,552
These videos on his channel also have

461
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,832
Pretty low engagement

462
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,392
So be completely unbelievable for me to imagine

463
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,464
He's making any real money on YouTube monetizing

464
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,560
These documentaries but he's putting out like channel that what they call us channelers

465
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:40,960
This new documentary that he's put out that's not being sold anywhere maybe it's unlike real Boutique shop

466
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,800
Real

467
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,848
I doubt it I doubt even that

468
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,688
I can't see that that that being a strong Revenue stream

469
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:54,016
But he flew all over the place to interview these Channel

470
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,808
Like there is money

471
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,344
Flow something is happening

472
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,648
Right I just don't know exactly what it is

473
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,184
It makes me think

474
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:05,792
Live based on this he's either making a killing on that psychic hotline

475
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,816
Probably

476
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,632
I imagine there's no money coming in there but it can't

477
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,656
Possibly be enough

478
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,448
I just don't see you being enough

479
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,312
I think a lot of this money's got to be coming from Ozark Mountain publisher okay and from the Dolores Cannon

480
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
Branch

481
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,872
So that raises the question

482
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,920
Is there any reason to suspect

483
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,944
But there would be beef

484
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,736
Between Kerry Cassidy

485
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,760
And Dolores Cannon

486
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:30,112
I think that there is publish carries book

487
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,928
I don't know I don't know I know that you wouldn't

488
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,744
Bright-eyed I don't publish

489
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,304
I know that he would

490
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,144
She wouldn't do that either he was like no no Marco sharp cramping my house

491
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,032
No but he was writing that book Joe and his dad to be a soon-to-be wife

492
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,824
Was working in Publisher

493
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,128
Why was I was questioning this

494
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,944
Possibility there might be some sort of

495
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
Isuzu

496
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,528
Yeah between Cary and Dolores Cannon

497
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
And that led me

498
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:04,928
2A May 3rd 2010 video the Kerry Cassidy posted on Project Camelot

499
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,976
Of her interview and Dolores Cannon

500
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:11,328
Okay this is Rebecca in 2010 Dolores is Carrie's mom

501
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,608
Oh okay damn

502
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,680
If you watch this video

503
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:19,776
There's a very good reason to believe that these two Dolores and carry

504
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,312
Are not nearly

505
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,848
On the same page

506
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,896
Hear Carrie giving an introduction

507
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
Dolores

508
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,456
Services Kerry Cassidy

509
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,504
Project Camelot

510
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,528
Dolores Cannon

511
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,808
I'm very pleased

512
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,600
To introduce our audience

513
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,624
To Dolores Cannon

514
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,928
I have been

515
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Studying your work

516
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
Quite some time

517
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
Read several of your books

518
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,560
And I'm very impressed

519
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,096
With your diligence

520
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,632
Carry you take

521
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,168
Each and every

522
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,448
Person that you read

523
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,240
And

524
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
And I know

525
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,544
Really want to

526
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
Thank you very

527
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,784
This is very friendly and jovial

528
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:09,184
It doesn't go off the rails or anything it doesn't turn into a fight right but if you know anything about Carrie

529
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,512
If you know anything about the world that she believes in

530
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:18,656
You will hear certain things along the way through this interview yeah that are gigantic

531
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,704
Things that she disagrees

532
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,496
This first one that comes up

533
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,056
Is a discussion of alien abduction

534
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,896
Dolores has an interesting take

535
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,432
On alien abduction

536
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,200
That is

537
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,736
100%

538
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,760
Counter to Gary

539
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,064
It was just

540
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,368
Taking them on board the craft

541
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,184
I've written about this

542
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
85 years

543
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
Call dacus

544
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
Custodian

545
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
Because all

546
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,096
Through my work I have not seen

547
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,400
It's always been

548
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,704
This is the way I see that

549
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,056
The first book Coronavirus

550
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,688
And I've never found that

551
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,736
Because I can

552
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,272
Why they were doing

553
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
Okay and when you say they

554
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,024
So up to this point the interview Dolores has just been explaining her backstory

555
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,424
To carry and describing how she's discovered through hypnotizing people that they've been abducted by aliens but that was always a positive

556
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,240
This is a major major

557
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,544
Departure from the worldview of Project Camelot

558
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:34,944
We're pretty much all alien abduction is nefarious and likely the work of the evil reptilians or their Associates in the human

559
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,968
Secret space

560
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,088
Even if they're good ostensibly in in her Pantheon

561
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:46,208
They're abducting people evil Masters don't kidnap people for good yeah

562
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:52,608
Chocolate Carrie believes that a lot of this stuff is done to like the abductions is done to harvest material from us

563
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,912
In order to produce clones are hybrids that can

564
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:59,008
I guess we used to better take over Society or something

565
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,056
Yeah they're made of chocolate

566
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,104
But Dolores doesn't believe that

567
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,688
And her experience all interactions with ET have been positive ones

568
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:09,504
And she professes to have an understanding of their purpose

569
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,576
Which is something that you know

570
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,112
Carrier can't argue with

571
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:20,512
If she has like I spoken to the aliens I know why they're doing what they're doing.

572
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:25,120
A dead-end is that there is a little bit of

573
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,144
It's like

574
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,728
Two people arguing over what houses look like in heaven where you're like

575
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
Shut up

576
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:38,176
So as Dolores lays out the interview these aliens are just the custodians of the planet

577
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,224
I want they have duck somebody they're doing it

578
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
The help them

579
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:46,368
There are these adjustments that need to be made humans in the ET or there to make those adjust

580
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,952
So the person can live up to the arrangements that they made before being

581
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:54,304
Inborn so they can carry out their mission in life this is

582
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,144
Great fantastic it's a large

583
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,960
Borden it's more new age

584
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,032
Inspired then a lot of work.

585
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:10,432
Yeah I know your soul and like before and after you die you and your soul group or together

586
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,968
Guys all make

587
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,248
What you're going to do in the neck

588
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,552
Life and then once you're boring your mind is wiped

589
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:21,696
You can't remember anything that's impossible have you ever tried to get for five people to go out for dinner making a rainbow

590
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:25,536
What you going to do in the next life is never going to happen. Your inability

591
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:32,192
Create those dinner plans it's something you agreed on before you were born

592
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:37,824
Remember you at your soul group agreed to make it impossible to make dinner plans

593
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,224
Coordinated on earth right you and your friends could grow through that frustration that created your own challenge

594
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,016
Freebirth in order

595
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,064
It's a new waves yeah yeah

596
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,136
Pretty common I got a lot of these circles after you

597
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:56,512
It's a predestination but also free well there's a lot like the other Minds wiped

598
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,584
It allows for both to sort of coexist

599
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,656
It it's where Dolores is at for sure and it is

600
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,960
Not work area

601
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:09,056
So when we see here is the first indication of a fundamental difference in the world

602
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,616
On small-scale

603
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:17,504
There's the different takes on alien abduction but if you zoom out this is a microcosm of a much larger disagreement

604
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,832
Primarily about what the character of the universe is

605
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,208
Mercury space is a Place full of war and different races of aliens doing battle for

606
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:26,976
Control of

607
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,768
I guess space resources

608
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,328
Dolores face is full of love and

609
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:36,448
Here it's just an extension of something that all about us but also much larger than us

610
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,800
There's a game going on involving Us and other alien races

611
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,592
But we're playing it together

612
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,640
And it's about Cooperative advancement

613
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,664
Keller

614
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:50,016
These are entirely incompatible views of the Galaxy

615
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,296
These two people have

616
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,600
I know what she would be called if Larry Nichols

617
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,880
Which

618
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,000
So we get to little bit later in the

619
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,072
In the interview and

620
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:06,912
They talk they start talking about like what aliens are you talkin

621
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,984
And we instantly find another branching

622
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,008
Between these

623
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:14,336
To that I don't know how they could possibly Bridget

624
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,152
You were talking to which group

625
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,944
Now they don't have

626
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:23,808
Okay they wouldn't tell you I'm going to do but as far as We Know

627
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,344
In other words we know about

628
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,880
For example

629
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,160
Santa General category

630
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,440
We know about Greg

631
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,000
Even reptilians

632
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:35,840
Have you gotten you've gotten a different charger do with all of them

633
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,912
Open

634
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,936
Where were you

635
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,312
You humans have

636
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,432
I needed we will give you a label

637
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,040
But they said if we told you we were from the planet out there to the north

638
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,368
Star you wouldn't know

639
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,160
Because it's not even

640
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,440
Calculator

641
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,000
But they don't come from

642
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,328
Picture of the Galaxy

643
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
440

644
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
Because they

645
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
Go to tell you where we are

646
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
And on board the craft store

647
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
Just like star

648
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,176
Just like star

649
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:26,528
So here we have another fundamental disagreement between Cary and Dolores Cannon

650
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:33,184
What are the things that most characterizes carries view the folks from space is that they all belong to rigidly defined

651
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,952
Find groups

652
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,768
And they are defined by the group's characteristics

653
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:40,096
The reptilians are Draco there.

654
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,168
Spider leadership are bad and their meddling on Earth

655
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:49,056
The mantids were formally bad but they've made an alliance and they might be on our side now according to Simon Park source

656
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:55,200
The Raptors are good and they're our allies though they will lie babies on occasion and will kill you for chocolate which

657
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,480
It's like sometimes you got to make a

658
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,760
Look I mean

659
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:02,624
You know Saudi Arabia is technically our Ally you know what I'm saying naturally the Nordic

660
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,768
The alien the most like white people are unassailable good and the Palladium that is true

661
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:12,608
Delores he's a far more Multicultural universe

662
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:15,424
Compared to carry her view is downright Progressive

663
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:22,080
The labels of alien group names are meaningless in the larger picture they only exist because humans have a need to put labels

664
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:22,848
Nothing

665
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:29,248
In the real world of space nordics work alongside Raptors mantids in reptilians all the same space crap

666
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,040
It's a It's like Star Trek

667
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,600
Obviously since I don't believe any of this

668
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,648
I'm left to try and find meaning in subbed

669
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:40,000
I feel like the world that Dolores believes in is one where there's Unity

670
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:43,584
Where everyone can be valued in collaborate where group labels are meaning

671
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:50,240
Conversely Carrie seems trapped in a mode of thinking where what what group someone is apart of dictate

672
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,288
Intrinsic characteristics about

673
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,080
Applied to humans

674
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,360
This is what you might call Race

675
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,896
Yeah

676
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:01,248
The way Carrie engages in the stuff it's not necessarily fair to call it race

677
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,904
Because she could easily say that human is the group that that we would apply Universal characteristics to invest

678
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,208
Same way she does with raptor or reptilian

679
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,744
The problem is

680
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:16,352
And how accepting that kind of thinking allows a person to apply it to subgroups

681
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,376
Pretty easily

682
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:23,520
Carrie May believe its species is the smallest possible group where these kinds of generalizations can be made

683
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,568
But I don't trust that position to hold

684
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:29,152
Nor have I ever really heard her articulate that kind of hard and fast line

685
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,432
That kind of rule look like

686
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:33,504
This kind of thinking only applies this far

687
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,136
Reply to you need to be responsible if you're going to be like

688
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:44,000
This group is intrinsically this way this group is intrinsically this way

689
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,792
You got to be real clear about like

690
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:50,144
You better not apply this elsewhere dealing with here

691
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,168
Here is a clue

692
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:51,936
Classic

693
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:57,568
Did Bill & Ted win or did Bill & Ted lose Intergalactic governments

694
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,384
When it's

695
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,736
Why have you never seen it everybody are guitars it's fantastic it's amazing

696
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:09,344
But in Bogus Journey whenever they evil Bill and Ted around there

697
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,112
They're just cause

698
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,416
Destruction there just ruining everything

699
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:17,280
Carrie is the evil Bill and Ted this is unassailable lodgings as an interesting case

700
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,840
I'll say that what my perspective is

701
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,912
I appreciate you

702
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,448
But what I'm saying is this

703
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,800
I'm not trying to call Kerry's view racist and Dolores is view not racist

704
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:35,456
But I think what we see you're still indicates a profoundly Divergent view of the universe between their two were

705
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:40,320
Carrie sees a Galaxy sees the Galaxy as a war zone between distinct

706
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,600
Groups of alien races

707
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:47,744
Where is Delores easy to place it is a place of growth and evolution where different groups don't see themselves as different

708
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,280
And work towards shared goals

709
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:53,376
It's the difference between sees universe as primarily conflict

710
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:56,704
I am seeing it as primarily cooperation

711
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,288
It's difficult for me to stress how at odds their positions are

712
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,568
Which is very interest

713
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,640
Terry and Dolores don't seem to hate each other

714
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,432
And their interviews polite enough

715
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,224
But they have nothing in common

716
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,992
Yeah that isn't

717
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,040
Although

718
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,416
Dolores losses may actually and I don't even know if

719
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:20,512
This is brilliant within the context of her statement or if it's a

720
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,792
Exactly stupid as

721
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
It sounds

722
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:25,376
But the idea of an alien race being like

723
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,680
Yeah we're north of that star

724
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,264
North North North

725
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,408
In space your North in space North I think that you was saying that as a absurd way to look at it

726
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,456
In the contact sheet

727
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:45,856
She wasn't saying it like she was saying it like the alien race told her that I said you'll get better

728
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:50,976
I think she was using that as an example of what you would want

729
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,768
Figure from an alien and it being mean

730
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,328
Yeah that's what that's how I heard okay

731
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:59,168
Everything is open to interpretation or criticisms

732
00:37:59,424 --> 00:37:59,936
All of these

733
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:05,312
People but I think that's nitpicky hard sci-fi

734
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,080
Alright

735
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,640
We're back to alien abduction

736
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,408
Your narrator

737
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,968
And Delores says something really interesting

738
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,248
That I could see Carrie take

739
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,016
Personally

740
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,552
The ideal situation

741
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
Should be the

742
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,600
The person never

743
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,184
Because they have been

744
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,512
Taking care of

745
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,584
And they don't want

746
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,608
Interfere with

747
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,424
We should cousin

748
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
Free will

749
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,472
You should be allowed to just

750
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,008
Levana

751
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,032
Scrooge's life

752
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
Cold

753
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
The chemistry

754
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,992
The pollutants

755
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:45,760
In the air

756
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,576
CID additives to the food

757
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,856
If the person is

758
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,136
On drugs

759
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
Define Recreation

760
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,256
Alcohol

761
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,304
It changes the chemistry of

762
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,864
Doss when the person

763
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
Remember

764
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,448
They don't remember at all usually

765
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:05,984
Port Arthur

766
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:07,776
Green

767
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,312
They'll remember you

768
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,360
Store

769
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:13,920
Correct

770
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,944
And their Fighters

771
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,528
The horrible things

772
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,296
What happened to the

773
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,856
And this is what the

774
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,136
Computer to UFO

775
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,208
Their speakers

776
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,744
Come and talk about all the harm

777
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,584
Well I can have the same

778
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,120
Person that somebody else

779
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
I do them

780
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,496
Story

781
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,032
Cuz we find out what

782
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,312
So close

783
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,592
And it's not

784
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:47,712
So Dolores is expressing that these people because they have

785
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:52,576
Ideally the aliens brain-wipe or whatever would hold

786
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:56,672
Because of environmental changes or drugs or whatever

787
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,512
Choose these people have a partial memory of something

788
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:06,912
And they're exploited by the UFO community that UFO community

789
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
At 1

790
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:13,568
Everything that she believes is actually true is a shity distortion of what's real right into

791
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:19,968
She's part of a group of people exploiting people paragraphs

792
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:24,576
Invalidating all of Carrie without being

793
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:29,184
Super or hyper confrontational she is saying

794
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,976
She just said everything you do is b*******

795
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,792
So I mean that's

796
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,072
Gotta be tough

797
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,376
Tahir

798
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
Firstleaf

799
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:47,360
He's pretty interested in this interview about the like we talked about a lot and I've already brought up this is

800
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,896
Obsession almost with

801
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,688
Categorizing the Azalea

802
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,784
And Delores seems to think that she's focusing on the wrong thing

803
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,624
Braces

804
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
IPad mini dirt

805
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,744
You wouldn't even break

806
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,840
But they're able to do

807
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,864
Communicate

808
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,264
And we have

809
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,664
Well okay

810
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,944
Will be happy to hear

811
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,224
Information I wouldn't

812
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,016
You think

813
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:32,416
I think I think there's a little bit of Carrie taking that as condescension absolutely

814
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:38,816
I could sense a bit of that through the interview although like I said it doesn't turn into a fight or anything

815
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,912
He might in the present or whatever they're still a bit of

816
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:46,496
Arrowroot respect between the two of them

817
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:52,895
And I think some of that might be a product of his being in 2010's things were quite

818
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:59,295
We're still free 2012 prediction was really excited about

819
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,343
This this world of s***

820
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,487
I'm getting a very maternal vibe from Dolores controlled relay in this interview vibing just in the way that she

821
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,303
She is interacting with Carrie as being lecture

822
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:16,191
You're you're young you've got a lot more to learn about this you're focusing on all of this

823
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,263
You're obviously take that is condescension

824
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,335
Mildly Maybe

825
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:27,199
I think it's more like I have a prospective about this that explains your purse

826
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:27,967
Perspective

827
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,759
And you could easily see that it.

828
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:30,783
But also

829
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,087
I mean Dolores has been doing this since the 7th

830
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,367
You know she's been

831
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:40,767
Even in this game a lot longer than carry

832
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,071
Sitting here talking about how great Dolores Cannon is

833
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:47,167
Later in the episode was talking to Carrie she's a pretty anti-vax

834
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,447
So

835
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:53,055
So I'm not I'm not I'm not here to say that she's a hero or anything

836
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,847
But the point is

837
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,151
These two people both believe in aliens

838
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:00,991
And all that s*** but have completely different perspectives on WhatsApp

839
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,807
Their disagreements about the nature of

840
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:07,647
The nature of alien life the value of dividing aliens into different groups

841
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:12,511
Whether or not the behavior of the UFO Community is actually making things worse for abductees

842
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:16,607
There's very little that they seem to have agreement on other than junk it back

843
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,399
Great

844
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:21,471
Good good way to come together on the right issue there

845
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:25,823
But I don't know if I can find any evidence of an actual public feud between the

846
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:29,663
I think the Dolores Cannon seems like a woman who wouldn't stoop to that

847
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:36,063
And I don't know if I've seen too many examples of carry directly attacking someone unless you perceive them to be

848
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,087
Attacking her

849
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,391
As in the case with Kevin Moore currently

850
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,695
If I were to make my

851
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:45,535
It would make my theory a lot simpler if I could point to a long-standing

852
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,815
Flame war between them

853
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,607
But I don't think that's ever happened

854
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,191
It seems like this is a case where there are two camps

855
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,263
The Canon side and the Camelot side

856
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:00,383
And they're just ideological Rivals vying for position in the Paranormal New Age community

857
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,943
Cannons work reflects a message of Hope

858
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:07,039
Of the new age ideals of human evolution and expansion of consciousness

859
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:10,367
Ozark Mountain publishing put out books with titles like

860
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,415
Dance of heavenly Bliss

861
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,951
Heaven here on Earth

862
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,743
And reconnecting to the Earth

863
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,583
Scrolling through the catalog it's more less devoid of fear

864
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,399
Selling the audience instead on messages of Hope

865
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:29,311
Conversely everything the Camelot puts out provide the Eldritch glimpse into a secret world of space combat

866
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:33,151
Secret technology being hidden from humans for evil reasons

867
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,711
And Grand nefarious conspiracy

868
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:40,831
Every natural disaster is just aliens eating people the government needs to cover up

869
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,623
Gore's their Temps

870
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,439
To stop Alien Invasion coming through Stargates

871
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:50,559
Secretly bombing the Stargate dealing with space Marianne Williamson versus Space Trump

872
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,583
That's what we're

873
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:55,423
Better that's our worldview ideological divide here

874
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:01,311
I didn't want to let that commercial for 2013 play all the way it was for Marion with no

875
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:07,711
But in Hidden Kevin list of people he's interviewed one of them was Marietta

876
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:12,319
Find that on his YouTube page

877
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:18,975
Also Two Carries World human tragedies that happened like mass shootings

878
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,767
Some things built those are false Flags

879
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,071
Being carried out by The Reptilian bloodline

880
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,119
Conquer the planet already through subterfuge

881
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,655
Everything is

882
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:31,519
Anyone who's spent any time trafficking in conspiracy in paranormal message

883
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,543
Boards are communities

884
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:35,871
Understands that these are kind of the two poles in that world

885
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,407
What kind of makes sense

886
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,943
Yoda perspective thing

887
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:42,783
How you could see the same glass as half-full or half-empty but just

888
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,063
Reply to secret alien

889
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,647
And all that now it's kind of

890
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,415
Fictional

891
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,207
The situation

892
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,535
But those that hypothetical glass we always talk about

893
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,095
So Dolores Cannon passed away in 2014

894
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,631
And her daughter Julia Cannon

895
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,655
And took over

896
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:04,031
I'm pretty sure that Julia was involved and maybe even running Ozark Mountain publishing previous to that point

897
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:07,871
But I can't say for sure cuz her LinkedIn page doesn't have any dates on it

898
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,639
No

899
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,431
I assume Dolores was

900
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,967
Very old

901
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:17,087
Like something like that videos

902
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,367
Confined pretty

903
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:21,951
Closter passing word white loose

904
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:24,767
Oh no I'm not saying that I'm just sold

905
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,559
You're 84 near me

906
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,327
Daughters

907
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,351
Going to run the

908
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,399
Operation

909
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,959
I would assume so you do that

910
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:38,847
Kevin is known both Dolores and her daughter Julia throughout his career in the Paranormal community

911
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,711
The first interview he had with Delores was posted on his channel on December 3rd 2011

912
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,783
And yes interviews with Julie are going back to 2013

913
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,343
I was wondering about this

914
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,135
That's because there seems to be a shift

915
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,415
In the present

916
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,719
Like a do Noah fairly

917
00:46:55,999 --> 00:47:02,143
He's doing these interviews like with these time-traveler people

918
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:05,983
Got a call out the frauds in our community

919
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:06,751
If the

920
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,775
Possible

921
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,591
That there is anything to do with

922
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,359
Julia

923
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,383
Okay if

924
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,175
He's had this Patron

925
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,223
Over the years in the Ozark Mountain

926
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:16,991
Publishing

927
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:23,391
And he's doing and how he's doing what he's doing in partnership with them Dolores passes away right

928
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,951
Leah comes around and maybe she hates Carrie

929
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,719
Okay

930
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,255
Julia

931
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,279
Is

932
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,559
Officially

933
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,095
A loose cannon

934
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:36,191
I don't I like your pain but no that was just

935
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:40,287
That was just a thought that I'm tired and so what I wanted to do was

936
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:45,663
I wanted to check in with an interview that he did with Julia so I found this one here

937
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,199
From July 26th

938
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:47,967
28

939
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,503
This is

940
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,063
Mere months before he announces

941
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,623
Is Mark Richards documentary

942
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,159
I figured like is there going to be

943
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,439
Some Clues

944
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,743
Yeah you might think you'd find them in here

945
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,535
Enter this first clip

946
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,583
Kevin's talking to Julia

947
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,935
I feel like he's asking her about what her mother would think

948
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,239
About the state of the Paranormal community

949
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,055
Are that your mom did move

950
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,615
Solo

951
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,383
You know

952
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,663
Well

953
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:22,783
I started off for a late it was many years but I was going to let that such a touchy move it to

954
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,063
The era of

955
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:24,831
The myth

956
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,855
2000

957
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,391
2005

958
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,183
I think you know

959
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:29,951
It was

960
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,231
Pretty grounded in

961
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,511
Information that was out begging

962
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,047
You know the UFO field was

963
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,631
You know this field will most definitely

964
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,911
You know

965
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,191
A level that people

966
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,239
You know it was

967
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,287
It wasn't too far out there

968
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,823
In some ways right at

969
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,359
You know

970
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,151
My point is right now it's

971
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:49,919
Just feels that

972
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:50,943
A community

973
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,503
Such

974
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,039
Of such

975
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,063
Streams

976
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,087
And

977
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:57,855
Offset

978
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,647
Almost falling

979
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,415
The pot in summer

980
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,975
I wonder what Mom was think

981
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,839
I think

982
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:08,863
She would think it's

983
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,631
It's right on

984
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,471
You know this is how it's supposed to be

985
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,519
And

986
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,079
EOS

987
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,431
Gross

988
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,223
In a while

989
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,247
Like this

990
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
Like this

991
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:33,439
So she's doing gestures with her hands of like you think it's going to grow straight like

992
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,743
It's actually growing as two separate branches

993
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:39,839
Okay is almost like a Que Sera Sera

994
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:45,983
Kevin's being like what we got all this b******* going on any movement that sufficiently

995
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:46,751
Desplinter off

996
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,543
Series of different groups

997
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,823
Is her her basic

998
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,407
Got a threats there so it is inevitable why you're going to be

999
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,175
He worried about it

1000
00:49:54,431 --> 00:50:00,575
Yeah yeah that doesn't feel like what you'd expect if you were if my theory was to hold

1001
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,903
Don't seem to be bothered in the slightest by the fact that like

1002
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:07,487
Wow there's this but there's also this

1003
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,559
And it went like you know that grows into differ

1004
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:14,911
Print directions by the way f*** Kerry Cassidy but

1005
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,191
Yeah

1006
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,471
That's weird

1007
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,775
So Kevin tries to regroup

1008
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:22,591
A little bit here and reframe what he's asking of

1009
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,639
It is almost like right

1010
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,663
That you eat

1011
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,687
The UFO

1012
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
Text with your mom

1013
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,735
I know work always

1014
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,295
She was a very early

1015
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:33,855
Promoting that

1016
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,391
And that's exact

1017
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,415
I think we're a little V

1018
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,439
Either you are

1019
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,719
Burnouts

1020
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,511
Freeman that right he'll say

1021
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,535
Absolutely

1022
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,303
What about

1023
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,095
That's right that's what it works gone

1024
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,655
So so now we've got the country

1025
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
Dismiss someone

1026
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,959
Is the feel that I've loved

1027
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:49,727
Episode long

1028
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:50,751
The UFO

1029
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,799
Wfo field on the other side

1030
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,079
So long

1031
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:57,919
And that there's you know there's a breach of the kid there's a gap in the connect that there's a connection

1032
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,687
In between them

1033
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,759
But as you said that they've gone this

1034
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,319
We've got a secret

1035
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,087
Space probe

1036
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,135
Yeah

1037
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:07,903
Coming out for

1038
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,927
Language

1039
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,207
Indeed

1040
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:10,975
The

1041
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,255
Stores that they

1042
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
Telling

1043
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:13,791
And the

1044
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:14,815
Division in

1045
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:15,839
Community

1046
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
And

1047
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,239
Desert

1048
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,007
So cold

1049
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,287
Is going on in the

1050
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,567
Cotijas wellright

1051
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,103
Recitative

1052
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,943
I hate you

1053
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:31,967
Never seen it

1054
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:32,991
Divide it

1055
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,039
Well

1056
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,831
And I think that's another thing

1057
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,599
That's

1058
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,671
You know that's

1059
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,439
Recently

1060
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
Watching

1061
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,535
A video they were just talking about how right now

1062
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,607
Has always been the

1063
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,911
And it's just the light is shining

1064
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,447
Brighter and brighter

1065
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,775
That's all it is

1066
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,335
Oozing

1067
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,615
Now we're just aware of it

1068
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,175
So

1069
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,199
Now

1070
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,223
It's choices

1071
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,063
You know you going to

1072
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,535
Choices

1073
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,327
Heathens all being exposed

1074
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,375
It's wonderful

1075
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,447
Not now people know about it

1076
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,775
Yet. What were they were all hidden

1077
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:32,639
She seems very Zen

1078
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:35,199
About

1079
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:41,599
Yeah I'm liking her vibe it won't I can't lie I came away from this liking Julie again in a bit

1080
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:50,815
I look at this b******* always been there now they're people

1081
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:57,215
Number one shining on this and they can't hide the certain things anymore

1082
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:03,615
Fuller talking about it but she does not seem motivated in any way to be like today

1083
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:06,175
There's no ruthlessness who's out

1084
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,455
Addictive element there's no

1085
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,223
Nothing it's just

1086
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,503
You just kind of like

1087
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:14,879
What do you get through life there's more information and then you have choices

1088
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,159
I don't I don't know

1089
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:22,815
It's insane she's very that could be the new version of the threat right there that we have

1090
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:26,399
We have things that we can or do we have to choose

1091
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,703
Crush those Dum Dums

1092
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,495
Over there by 8

1093
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:37,151
I think that's a giant leap but I don't think it's impossible.

1094
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:41,759
In my mind that if you remember that Phil Hartman sketch on.snl where he's playing Reagan

1095
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:42,783
And he was like

1096
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,831
Who you're so little girl in

1097
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:48,415
All that and then she leaves

1098
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:55,071
Like that kind of thing yeah I understand that image can come up in your head but I would need immediately if not

1099
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,863
Done like tons of

1100
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,679
Research on Julia Cannon

1101
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:05,823
A bit more information about her to be like alright secretly like a

1102
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:06,847
Possible

1103
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,383
So

1104
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:11,455
Kevin gets to complaining some more in Julia's defusing

1105
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,247
More when rubbish does

1106
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,271
Microcytic

1107
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,295
Or

1108
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:16,831
Purposeful dissing

1109
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,599
Information

1110
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,135
That people feel as though it

1111
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,159
It's real

1112
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,207
Right and they going along with it

1113
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,511
Where is p

1114
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,839
Did I hate that word

1115
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,607
It's almost like

1116
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,631
Conspiracy

1117
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,167
Infiltrated

1118
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,447
Spiritual

1119
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,727
That's how I

1120
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,079
You know you got this

1121
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,663
You know

1122
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,039
I do just listen to everything

1123
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:51,647
But that is that is what's going on though as a community

1124
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,951
Right now there are people gaining

1125
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,231
Seeing a lot of power in

1126
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:56,767
Who are Mick

1127
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,047
The spiritual

1128
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,071
Conspiracy

1129
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,119
Define do what you want to do

1130
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:01,887
But then

1131
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,423
As soon as you start state

1132
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,191
Hang on a minute

1133
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,471
Cuz it's going to be

1134
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:08,031
270 we went weekend ungrounded head

1135
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:08,799
Completely

1136
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,335
Then they were there alternative

1137
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,127
Did you do that

1138
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:12,895
And it's like

1139
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,919
Wow it's

1140
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:19,551
Probably worth noting that this conversation with Julia was posted to Kevin's YouTube page about 2 months

1141
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:23,391
After he had that interview with Kerry Cassidy where you tried to ask her about ink

1142
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,671
Inconsistencies in Mark Richards

1143
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,463
Story and she got pretty mad at him

1144
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:32,607
When he's talking about people turning on you when you ask for better discernment he's absolutely talking about that conversation

1145
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,935
He's very clearly talking about Carrie

1146
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:40,799
Secret space program

1147
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,871
Just complaining about Kerry Cassidy

1148
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:46,175
Project Camelot Julia's response

1149
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,455
Spell people got a thing

1150
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,479
For themselves

1151
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:53,343
There's almost Dolores item Eternal quality to carry

1152
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,927
Julia has a bit of a maternal thing going on here with Kevin or it's like

1153
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,951
Quit whining you

1154
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:04,351
Crying teenager you're going to you're going to gyro older than this it's going to you're going to get past it you'll have some Wiz

1155
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:07,679
Zumba.com from recognizing that people have choices

1156
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:12,287
Sure there's more information that they can take that information to make a choice that they need to make with it

1157
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:19,199
Open UFO Community we don't bitching about people because we're all lying

1158
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,735
You're the worst

1159
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,271
He's the worst I hate

1160
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:26,111
He's the worst he's a shity interview earlier

1161
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,671
Sucks that every time he tries to ask a question

1162
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,439
Wind-up asking

1163
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,463
For questions and

1164
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,231
Not a bean

1165
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:35,327
I know that

1166
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,375
From the spirits that he channels

1167
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:42,751
They've told me he's very good at it so

1168
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,567
Yeah so it is next Clipper Kevin

1169
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,591
Expresses shock

1170
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:51,199
That some of his audiences interested in Project Camelot which I would say

1171
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:55,551
Wow why I was shocked at where some of my audience was

1172
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,087
I did not know

1173
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,367
That we were

1174
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,159
My admit myself my orders

1175
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:01,951
Dividing so much

1176
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,743
And how we felt about

1177
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,071
Well then that might

1178
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,095
Indicator

1179
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,031
Yeah

1180
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:18,847
I think

1181
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,127
And I'm going to do that

1182
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,151
That my next.

1183
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,431
He's going to

1184
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:24,991
Note Chocolat

1185
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:25,759
Well yeah.

1186
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,599
My next iPad 2

1187
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,647
Coming

1188
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,415
A journalist

1189
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,231
If I'm unhappy with

1190
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:35,999
With what's going on in

1191
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,839
I think I've got two

1192
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:41,631
Myself

1193
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,167
Shine some light

1194
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,447
And help people

1195
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,495
What type of people but help

1196
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:48,799
Chili's

1197
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:49,567
Let's look at the

1198
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,335
Stories of some

1199
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,151
Black smoke cat

1200
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:53,919
Where the f

1201
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,711
I never thought

1202
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
He going down that

1203
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:04,671
So I mean there I think you you see that Kevin's deciding to be the change you wish to see in the world

1204
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:11,583
Can't rely on anybody else to do this for me I got to do it I got a

1205
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,351
Yeah but this

1206
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:15,935
Still seems weirdly personal it is is it just

1207
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:18,239
He is it just that she like

1208
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,263
She didn't like his question

1209
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:25,663
So now he's like I'm going to f****** take her down then that's what I'm happy because he's interviewed her in the past

1210
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,479
Wayne Richards about Mark Richards

1211
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:31,295
He has no standards video poles like

1212
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:34,111
It was very recent to this

1213
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,159
That he talked to those Time Travelers

1214
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:36,927
Yay

1215
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:42,559
Nothing about like people putting this information out seems to bother him generally

1216
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,863
I don't know it has to just be personal

1217
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,679
I think he just got annoyed with her and then he's

1218
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,727
God he's the worst

1219
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,751
Zagweb

1220
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:54,847
The petty Grudge maybe or maybe not because I think in this neck

1221
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:55,871
Text Cliff we get

1222
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,151
Something that I think is

1223
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:57,919
Crucial

1224
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:00,991
In terms of understanding what's going on here

1225
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,527
Unfortunately

1226
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,551
These areas

1227
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,087
Like you said they've just been

1228
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:05,855
Prime

1229
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,159
Find fields

1230
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:09,951
You know

1231
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,231
People that just come in

1232
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,023
Do all car

1233
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,167
I just put all this

1234
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,031
Put so much power in

1235
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,151
You know that

1236
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,967
Text Darren dear to my heart

1237
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:36,319
Note you know about Judith Judith let me just say something

1238
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,111
You hit the nail on the head.

1239
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,135
That is it

1240
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,159
I'm going to use the woods

1241
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,951
There is so much

1242
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,999
Out there right now

1243
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:44,767
Right in this

1244
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,535
Field

1245
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,303
So

1246
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:52,703
I think the Julia again is is nailing it on some in some sense

1247
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:55,775
Like she said you know you what you're seeing is

1248
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:58,335
This world that we traffic in is

1249
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,871
It's been primed

1250
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:02,687
For people to be bad actors

1251
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:05,759
So obviously there's going to be some negative things

1252
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:09,087
And then they nailed down that like what it is is fear

1253
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,623
The fear is the bad thing

1254
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:17,023
They're creating fear in people in order to move whatever

1255
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:19,071
But who believes that there are a lot of alien of the

1256
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,095
What's going on in p

1257
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,119
Can't remember them

1258
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:24,703
I 14 remember them because

1259
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,543
You'd assume that she believes

1260
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:34,431
The same stuff is Dolores seeing as use her daughter and she's carried on her work

1261
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:36,735
Is there a her daughter but that she still running the publisher

1262
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:41,087
Shane Company suggests that yeah and the I believe that she also

1263
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:44,159
Runs the Dolores Cannon hypnosis thing

1264
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,183
Okay will do

1265
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,743
You have to assume there's over

1266
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,047
I got Kevin.

1267
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,327
This really is trying to talk

1268
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,375
Himself into this look like

1269
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:59,775
Not that he's psyching himself up and wants her to give him the go-ahead he's begging for

1270
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:06,175
Approval and

1271
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:08,991
Started when they were talking about like

1272
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:11,295
What would your mom think of this is almost like

1273
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:14,367
Looking for the blessing of Dolores from Beyond the Grave

1274
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,159
A t e k a

1275
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,255
A truth that was a

1276
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,279
Grounded in

1277
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,559
Going to be getting

1278
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:23,583
People that power back

1279
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,119
But what's going on right

1280
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:25,887
Now with this

1281
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,679
I'm about to taking sides

1282
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,727
Something

1283
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,495
Go to

1284
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:31,519
Pete makanji

1285
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,543
Just sit there and do not

1286
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,103
That's okay

1287
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:35,871
But I'm

1288
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,151
I'm saying right now I'm not

1289
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,455
Going to do that because

1290
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,503
The fear is golden

1291
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,295
Destroying a lot of the

1292
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,063
Goodwill

1293
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:46,623
Good for you

1294
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,415
See that's that's the lightbringer

1295
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,559
That's your job that's why you're

1296
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,375
When I preach

1297
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,935
So I guess he's got some approval

1298
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,983
But still he was

1299
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:06,079
This is no definitely has no

1300
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:09,919
Connotation towards that at all still doesn't feel like directions

1301
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:16,319
Right like I can identify that obviously he's been in partnership with this company that's run by the Cannon family

1302
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,367
Over 6 years

1303
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:20,159
At least 6 years at this point

1304
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:25,535
But it doesn't feel like when he's talking about what he feels drawn to do

1305
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,119
Exposed Project Camelot

1306
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,143
I I don't

1307
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:30,911
Feel like it

1308
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:35,263
This would be what the interview would be like if there was an interest in that

1309
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,567
Just weird

1310
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,127
Thermoflask Lapeer Kevin

1311
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,151
Jesus is Project

1312
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:46,527
Would you already know what it's going to turn into but she talked about it yet

1313
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,599
Thanks Julia for being so

1314
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,367
Supportive

1315
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,903
We never know where we're going

1316
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:52,927
Guided and

1317
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,255
That's what's

1318
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,047
Getting asked to do

1319
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,351
Yes yes

1320
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,375
Said that that.

1321
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:02,655
End

1322
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,703
Yep

1323
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:08,799
And and

1324
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,567
You know

1325
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:13,407
I wish I could say more right now about what I'm working

1326
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,735
But all I know is that when

1327
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:17,503
Is finished

1328
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,039
Going to be at least

1329
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,575
My first bit of light work

1330
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:21,599
The shine light

1331
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,367
On this subject

1332
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,135
Dot-dot-dot

1333
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,439
So I don't say it

1334
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,719
You've been doing

1335
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,487
Lightworks

1336
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,327
Was so abusive of you.

1337
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:34,143
Go to sleep

1338
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,959
This is our journey

1339
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,239
Yes it is

1340
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,799
Is it really is so

1341
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:42,847
Surprise me

1342
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:43,615
Sometimes

1343
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:46,943
Yes it does

1344
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,015
So

1345
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:52,319
We're not even aware of it

1346
01:03:56,927 --> 01:04:00,255
That's what I like about you right I can get on here right

1347
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,023
I can

1348
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,559
Have a little bit of ammonia

1349
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:05,119
Screen write about whatever I hate you

1350
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,703
You just kind of 11 out of it you know what I mean

1351
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:12,287
And then you get that from your mom as well I'm sure

1352
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,055
Show you do

1353
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,079
And

1354
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,103
That that

1355
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:17,663
That that is

1356
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:20,735
Yeah

1357
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,015
Thank you

1358
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:24,575
That's weird

1359
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:27,391
Wow that is weird I love her I love her

1360
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:30,207
He comes off quite well

1361
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,487
Is killing it

1362
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:37,375
The listening to this interview with Julia Cannon I'm left with the impression that she and Ozark Mountain publishing are not

1363
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,935
What's motivating Kevin to attack Harry and Mark

1364
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:43,007
She doesn't seem overly interested in Kevin's new project

1365
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:47,103
Liquor interested in a polite way and I don't know whatever but not overly so

1366
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:52,991
And when he tries to complain about the scism in the UFO Community Julia tries to contextualize it by saying that

1367
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:56,831
That's how it's supposed to be this is just what is this is a part of growth

1368
01:04:57,087 --> 01:05:00,415
Is Humanity learns and grows it encompasses many things

1369
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,439
Some good

1370
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,463
I'm not as good

1371
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:05,023
He just doesn't feel like she's pulling any strings

1372
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:09,631
This feels like it's entirely a cat she sounds super benign

1373
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,423
Downright kind

1374
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:16,031
Deescalate

1375
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:21,663
I entered this episode kind of thinking that we would look at this clear source of funding of Kevin

1376
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:26,783
New Age self-help book publisher with a polar opposite view on the Paranormal UFO world

1377
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:32,159
Carrie's and I would come away with the scent if they were behind this documentary as of crass business move

1378
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,207
But I don't feel that way now

1379
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:37,279
I think this is actually a thing that ideological

1380
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:43,423
But we've been missing the forest for the trees when we were trying to figure out what the ideology was up till this point

1381
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:48,543
Before I heard Kevin talk about how this misinformation in the community was

1382
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,335
You know it's you wanted

1383
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,871
You wanted better discernment

1384
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:55,967
I heard him talk about that stuff and I interpreted it to literally

1385
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:59,551
I thought you was offended by people being full of s***

1386
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,599
And that was what he wanted to push back again

1387
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:08,511
That's why it was absurd that he could present himself that way and then do an interview with the fake time travel.

1388
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:14,655
That's why it's comical that he would pretend to care about rigorous standards of proof while channeling aliens an offworld intelligence

1389
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,703
But I had it wrong

1390
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,239
It's about fear

1391
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:22,591
Kevin doesn't have a problem with the fact that carry can't prove a damn thing she says

1392
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:24,639
Because he can't prove anything he says either

1393
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,175
It's not about research

1394
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:29,247
The issue is that carry a Project Camelot are using

1395
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,551
Fear is the primary element of their content

1396
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,575
Where is what ring

1397
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:36,415
True to him about the universe is messages of hope and love

1398
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,719
He comes from the Cannon School

1399
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,511
They've been his Patron for years now

1400
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,327
And obviously he looks up to Dolores quite a bit

1401
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:47,935
Even seemingly trying to ask for the daughters blessing what he's embarking on this new project

1402
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:50,495
His ideological problem with Mark

1403
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,799
I'm curious in this dichotomy of stressing

1404
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,335
Fear or stressing hope

1405
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,383
But you being dishonest about that

1406
01:06:56,895 --> 01:07:01,759
He's presenting things as being about how Carrie doesn't do our due diligence about the gas she has on

1407
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:06,367
As he expresses in the video that he put out when he was explaining his purpose

1408
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,927
This is the first docu-series

1409
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:09,951
Of its kind

1410
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:14,559
Looking into frogs in the UFO and alternative communities that are reps

1411
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:19,423
Can't think of any other documentaries about fraud the UFO

1412
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:22,495
Is not a credible research has

1413
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:25,567
A sorcerer damage into people's awake

1414
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,871
When people trying to

1415
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,663
The idea that

1416
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,455
There's a greater reality

1417
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:35,295
And when it's met with misinformation and disinformation

1418
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,575
You know that

1419
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,599
Something that icons

1420
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,623
Said so

1421
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,439
I made it my coil right now

1422
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,463
My calling

1423
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,767
To show the opposite side

1424
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:47,071
Of some of these so-called whistleblowers

1425
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:53,727
So the way he's framing this is like exposing frauds in the community to do a disservice to legitimate research

1426
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,775
He presented like that

1427
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:56,799
So much

1428
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:58,079
But underneath it

1429
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,871
I don't believe that's the case

1430
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:03,455
I think it's that he resents that they're not on the

1431
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,991
Canon side of the things

1432
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,015
Because he

1433
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:10,879
Resonates more with the new AG stuff

1434
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:17,279
The secret space program and that holographic Med beds and super soldiers of it all sides of this

1435
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:21,887
Nothing much like Julia was expressing these two branches coming off the trunk

1436
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:24,447
As things grow as the community grows

1437
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:27,519
Obviously they're going to be these different offshoot rent Kevin

1438
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,567
Handle that you can't stand it

1439
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:33,919
Each sense to rejection from that side of the F4 asking questions

1440
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,455
Yeah

1441
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:39,039
I don't think he's I don't think he's ideologically against

1442
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,575
No I think he is

1443
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,367
I think in the general sense

1444
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:43,391
Yes

1445
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:47,231
I don't think he is above

1446
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:50,559
Disregarding his ideology

1447
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,839
Carrie likes a boy

1448
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:58,495
Buttegieg his ideology ideology kicks in real hard whenever somebody doesn't like

1449
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:04,127
But if you take a closer examination of the videos that he puts out on his channel you will see

1450
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,407
A massive

1451
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:09,503
Erring on the side of these messages of Hope

1452
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,831
These non fear-based messages

1453
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,647
So it's clear that his body of work does

1454
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:20,511
Lean towards that side there is a clear ideological distinction

1455
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,815
That is interesting you you

1456
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:25,375
Reframed it obviously I took a

1457
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:32,031
My numbing Lee literally the idea of it me to it's about research

1458
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:39,199
You know like it well if you say you're trying to debunked

1459
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,735
And you are

1460
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,039
Then you have to up course look back

1461
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,575
Get yourself and think what if

1462
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:47,903
What what do you remove the Splinter from your eye etcetera

1463
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,695
Spider-Man

1464
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:58,911
But you can present it as I'm exposing fraud and not get into the

1465
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:01,471
The fact that you have no proof of anything you're talkin about

1466
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:02,495
It's because what

1467
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:08,895
The exposure is really deep down on a visceral emotional level it's V they use fear

1468
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,431
I use hope

1469
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,967
More or less

1470
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:18,623
Now the other thing to do is I mean you can't get away from it is there is clearly a personal thing like you

1471
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,671
He has said in some of those things that we

1472
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,695
Recover do you like

1473
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:25,279
I'm going to make more documentaries in the future but these ones about like

1474
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:30,399
Kerry Markin Simon parks are there more personal they're based in something

1475
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,679
He's mad about

1476
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:35,519
I feel like I have a better understanding of where Kevin's coming from now

1477
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,311
But I still think he's an a******

1478
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:43,967
He explicitly said nobody's talking to Julia that is concern is that there's fear p*** and negativity does

1479
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,503
Biting the UFO community

1480
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,527
And it's not about

1481
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:49,855
Consciousness enough where you think that's the root of all this stuff

1482
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:53,951
But then what he's trying to sell his documentary pushing it as an expose about fraud

1483
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:57,535
What are you talkin to Julie are you said he's not attacking carry

1484
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:00,095
Or the Richards is the mark and Joanne

1485
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:06,239
But any promotional videos he f****** talk to Joanne by threatening to expose details about her previous marriages

1486
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:12,639
Like this is bulshit you behave that way and pretend that you're like I'm not going to go about attacking people and then attacked

1487
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:15,711
Yeah you can't pretend that this is about love and fear

1488
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:20,319
Splitting of the UFO community and then sell it as like

1489
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:22,367
They don't let their guests yeah

1490
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,391
You can't

1491
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,927
It's so Dishonored

1492
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:27,999
Yeah it is but at the same time I don't think he could actually

1493
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,583
I don't think you I don't think anybody

1494
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,351
Like

1495
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:37,215
If Julie is talking to me I'm going to be like I'm going to save the nicest possible things that I can

1496
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,775
And then peep down inside I'm going to be filled with

1497
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:40,799
Rage and hatred

1498
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,335
But to her I'm going to be like

1499
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,895
You know what you're absolutely right we should

1500
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,431
Should forgive everybody

1501
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,967
We should all do the stuff

1502
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:50,015
What I set out to do this

1503
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:55,391
Or this episode in particular it was looking into that element of this that I think is

1504
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,463
Dangling thread

1505
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:02,559
Trying to figure out why my bike hasn't did this

1506
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:05,631
Any other question of you think it has anything to

1507
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,935
To do with his sponsor

1508
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:11,775
And at the end of this I feel pretty confident that this is not a follow the money

1509
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,055
Situation

1510
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:15,615
I think it's a Kevin Morris and assholes situation

1511
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:20,991
Also I feel like if I'm ever mad I want to call Julia and I'm sure she'll be able to talk me down

1512
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:26,111
Try an email or so you can consult

1513
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,903
Jordan no matter what

1514
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:32,511
No matter how many times Kevin wants to say that he wants good research in the UFO community

1515
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:35,071
He's also a guy who runs a psychic hotline

1516
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:39,679
And will straight-up face serious look on his face

1517
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:44,031
He doesn't need to change his voice

1518
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,567
Different way

1519
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,407
Do better research on Mac

1520
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,943
He's not a very good

1521
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:52,991
Impressionist

1522
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:54,783
He doesn't good

1523
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:57,343
Jack Nicholson have you heard of

1524
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:58,879
Maurice

1525
01:12:59,135 --> 01:12:59,647
Lamar's

1526
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:02,719
Once Jack Nicholson dies we will handle him

1527
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:06,047
You can handle zexion on

1528
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,911
I also don't forget.

1529
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:12,703
I like that I like that

1530
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:16,543
I think that's a good Nicholson

1531
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:19,359
So anyway I

1532
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:24,735
I needed something to that would be interested me a little bit to really get the juices going after that disappointing

1533
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,271
Chunk of listening to Alex

1534
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,831
Got to get out of present-day do little Wacky Wednesday thing

1535
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:31,903
I wanted things it was really sticking in my craw was that question

1536
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:34,719
The money and looking into that a little bit more

1537
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:36,511
I think it's fascinating that this

1538
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,303
Is clearly

1539
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:41,631
An organization the Ozark Mountain publishing

1540
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,655
Aunt Laura's Kitchen

1541
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,447
It's clearly

1542
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,983
And opposing

1543
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,799
Worldview of the space nonsense weirdos

1544
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:50,335
And it's interesting

1545
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,639
They have been funding Kevin

1546
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,431
For as long as they have

1547
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,735
But I don't know if that's related

1548
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:59,807
I don't think it is I still I still have no

1549
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:03,647
Concrete answer is to why he's doing this that doesn't go back to

1550
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:08,511
Ideological opposition of like him being a part of that camp

1551
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:11,327
It is opposite to Project Camelot scam

1552
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,095
And

1553
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:12,863
Him

1554
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,143
Being mad

1555
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:20,799
This is really good for me because I ate in all of our

1556
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,591
Project Camelot excursions

1557
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:26,175
It never really never even thought that there was

1558
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:28,991
Thought about the new AG wing

1559
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,783
Of that whole you apply

1560
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,319
I've always been in this

1561
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,599
In the space of like

1562
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:36,415
My viewpoint on that UFO Community is

1563
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,439
There's a guy with the Telus

1564
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:39,999
You know like that kind of thing is so Broad

1565
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:43,327
That's where it's always been in my in my mind so this is really into

1566
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:49,215
There's the new AG side there's the the hard sci-fi siderite like mortgages more about like

1567
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:54,591
The machines

1568
01:14:56,383 --> 01:15:01,759
What do you use a combustion engine better than a hundred percent

1569
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:04,831
That's not actually true they fly with their minds they all know that

1570
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:09,439
So anyway we'll be back here on Friday with a non

1571
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:14,047
Space episode but until then Rick website Twitter

1572
