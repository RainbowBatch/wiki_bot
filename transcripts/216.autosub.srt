Do every question that I want to know the answer is that right

6
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,560
You would wanted to ask me

7
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,096
Swim first

8
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,120
Eclectic

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,240
Slime

10
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:49,152
Today

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,064
Two months ago before you started doing that

12
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,648
Michelle

13
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,976
Is today that I know a lot about Alex

14
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,560
That's correct

15
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,288
Episodes

16
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,128
To take a little moment to end up in supporting

17
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,736
First of all

18
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,760
Policy wonk

19
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
I'm a policy wonk

20
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,112
We appreciate it very much

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,304
I'm a policy wonk

22
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,096
Welcome aboard

23
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,192
Seaworthy vessel

24
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,800
The fairy difference

25
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
We do not

26
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,640
Throw anybody off this vessel

27
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,432
But

28
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,856
Nautical Showdown

29
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,160
We got to give a couple

30
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,560
You were once

31
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,840
A policy wonk

32
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
But you are now

33
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,912
A globalist thank you so much Andrew

34
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,568
Don't get mad until you're brilliant someone sodomites

35
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,504
Bumped it up in your globalist

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,296
Even if you are Andrew right

37
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696
Braham Elementary

38
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:42,048
Need to talk to somebody about that Andrew Guy

39
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:47,424
You cannot hear the name without getting mad about elementary school or some s***

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,104
Andrew has come from the larval stage grown into a butterfly that is a globe

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,176
Thank you so very much

42
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,456
You are now a globalist

43
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
Don't get mad until you're brilliant someone sodomites

44
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
Grow into butter

45
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
It requires a

46
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
A small amount

47
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:25,312
Caterpillar

48
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,104
Natureworks

49
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,456
Thank you so very much

50
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,760
I've been thinking about you

51
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,040
Beginning of H2

52
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
To the Izzo

53
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,672
You know that's okay

54
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,464
Listen to and

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
Spending that time

56
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,792
It means a lot

57
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Take your time with us

58
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,680
We appreciate y'all out there

59
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
Anyway Jordan

60
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
Suck

61
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,224
Brick

62
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,992
We had a good run

63
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,040
No

64
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,600
Doing today quite frankly

65
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:15,488
And it's because here we are starting this is Monday episode starting off the week lot of the time

66
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,791
We'll start off with 1,000

67
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
Talk too much

68
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,703
Auburn

69
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,751
Some of March 2000

70
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,871
Alex immediately has jumped into

71
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
Territory

72
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,759
I am prepared to do the next 2009 episode without reading

73
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
A couple bucks

74
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
Because

75
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,575
He said some really

76
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
Pacific bulshit

77
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:46,719
Gets into some World War I need to dig my teeth into

78
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,023
Before we go over

79
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
Purcell

80
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,863
But I'm not prepared

81
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
Also I don't want to start the week off

82
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
For the project

83
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
Aw episode

84
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:03,103
Call Dad

85
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,175
Women either Spirits race so I was

86
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,711
Quite a quandary

87
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
To what I should

88
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
To do

89
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
I started

90
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
Attention

91
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
Thesaurus Smith

92
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
In other media

93
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,511
There's a number of other

94
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,047
Bow tie

95
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
Audi

96
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583
Soros

97
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,143
Soros

98
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
This is just

99
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
Hey

100
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,727
New new updated version of

101
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
Going on forever

102
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:37,407
We talked about it a couple of years

103
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,991
I'm not saying that they haven't pointed out some stuff

104
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,039
Like that before but it wasn't new article

105
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,319
And there's another

106
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,343
Argument that

107
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
It could eventually

108
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,695
Called thesaurus era event

109
00:05:54,559 --> 00:06:00,703
We make it out of this thing will look back and be like me

110
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:07,359
Thoreau's narrative in the same like

111
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
Kind of like

112
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,943
We will if we get our bearings

113
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,087
Things back because the Koch brothers will also have paid for the end of the world

114
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,463
Maybe we'll have

115
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:29,631
Things are Written upon stones

116
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,471
About the Jews

117
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,567
These articles and then there was also course

118
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,103
It was last week

119
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,895
Week might have been a little bit before that time

120
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,967
These days

121
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
Lawyer

122
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,783
The president of the United States

123
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,879
Retweeted about how soros's demonic

124
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:59,327
Adorable with socially are you telling me

125
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:08,287
Trump gossip trailer

126
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
We just all have to deal with it

127
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
Why are we even bothering

128
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
Throw

129
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,175
Throw tomatoes at him and then

130
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:19,039
Sure Kavanaugh hearings

131
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
With that

132
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,367
Court nomination there were a lot of people coming out of

133
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Sometimes done

134
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
The idea that serosa

135
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
Does paying off

136
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
Which is been a trophy

137
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
If it's been used

138
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
Free single

139
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
Left-leaning

140
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
Cause

141
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,495
Of the last

142
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,311
Apartment the Parkland March for our lives

143
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
The women's March

144
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
Especially

145
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,895
The age of trump we've seen

146
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
Soros gets

147
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
Thrown under

148
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
This is all just because of his jumoney

149
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,319
Aruba subbed

150
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
Text that's what

151
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,695
Protests in a violent manner

152
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
You could even say

153
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,327
Cause physical harm to anybody who disagrees

154
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:09,727
But whenever say millions of women get together to call for an end to

155
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,031
What is Ben

156
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:19,455
2 million years of sexual abuse

157
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:27,391
70 something year old Hungarian

158
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,719
I started to realize that

159
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
We're going through 2009

160
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
And there is

161
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
Do you know.

162
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
The biggest

163
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,631
Reasons to do it

164
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,679
To find out when Alex started talking about

165
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,751
I meant secondarily what was the deal with

166
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,615
And so far we've gone through almost two-and-a-half months of

167
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
2009

168
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,687
Beginning starting in January

169
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
He has not

170
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,527
Register

171
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:01,951
It's easy to forget

172
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:08,095
I forgot entirely what do you keep finding these weird things that happen

173
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,399
The avian flu

174
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,519
People like Rebecca Carly that show up to learn about

175
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
We have

176
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:19,871
Had a lot of things that have sidetracked Us in 2000

177
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
Focus health

178
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,663
Generally bent

179
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,711
Try and learn more about those two things

180
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
Essential

181
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
Things to nail down

182
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,599
In terms of figuring out

183
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,647
Who is really influential to Alex

184
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,183
Where are the

185
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
The threads

186
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,719
You can pull

187
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,279
Lead you to unraveling sweater

188
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,303
As opposed to

189
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
Just being like

190
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
So

191
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,911
We've gotten nowhere with either

192
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
Quite frankly

193
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
We've heard Alex

194
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
Bring up

195
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
Soros in two

196
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,311
But only because of

197
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
The one clip that

198
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
He's heard

199
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
He doesn't see

200
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Seem to know Bowie

201
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,967
The really at all

202
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
So I'm

203
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
I want to know

204
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,551
I really do want to know these things

205
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,367
I'm not saying we're leaving 2009

206
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
But because

207
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
These

208
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
Stories are popping up

209
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
The mainstream Concha

210
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,535
Dismiss a lot more people to talk about it

211
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
I feel a greater pressure

212
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
To learn a little bit

213
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
And I decided

214
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,703
Skip to the end

215
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,519
I don't know the address that's the problem

216
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
I don't know what the end

217
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,359
What did you go with

218
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,367
Here's a f****** date let's see what's going on then

219
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,159
And the odds are that I would find some

220
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,439
But who knows if it would be

221
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
Useful

222
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
To Ferrari for me

223
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,791
I started to think that I realized the most

224
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,095
Disgraceful thing that's ever been done publicly

225
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,887
Media about

226
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
Is

227
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,703
On November 9th

228
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,031
Rudy Giuliani

229
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:56,639
That was that one

230
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,687
Scrapes

231
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,735
On November 9th

232
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
2010

233
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
Glenn Beck air date

234
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,319
Tonight

235
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,367
Expose

236
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,183
Of George Soros the Puppet Master

237
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,023
Not the first time that George Soros

238
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
To come up

239
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Boogeyman

240
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,631
But it was one of the most overt

241
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
And one of the most

242
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
Deeply a

243
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
He was pulling on Alt

244
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
Tropes from

245
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
They haven't necessarily

246
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,151
Eat when we heard Alex talking about that clip

247
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
In 2000

248
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,015
He's not talking about anything about Soros except for

249
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:38,367
He said he was going to crash oil when

250
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,647
He's not using any of his

251
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
He's like

252
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Globalist

253
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,255
Blood-drinking poisoning the well

254
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,815
Protocols of the Elders of Zion

255
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:53,215
Inspired

256
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
He's not

257
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
He's not down that road at all

258
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,639
I believe a couple years prior Bill O'Reilly

259
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
Argan oil

260
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Is Joe and pets

261
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:06,783
Scales

262
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
Glenn Beck

263
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,111
Zummo's

264
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Flagrant

265
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,183
The most outrageous

266
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
Things that has ever been

267
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
Done

268
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,559
And the mentality that it embodies

269
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
Is exactly where I live

270
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
Call Jones's today

271
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,655
In terms of George Soros

272
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
Being the Puppet Master

273
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,263
He's the one who calling all the strings he's paying the protesters

274
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,543
He's Satan

275
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,103
He's behind Hillary he's behind Obama

276
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
All of that stuff

277
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
These spiritual

278
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
Or

279
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
Of What Glenn Beck was talking about

280
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
Tonight is that

281
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,551
Is where Alex Jones ends up

282
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
So

283
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,367
I thought it would be interesting

284
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
Listen to Alex Jones

285
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
Show

286
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,463
On those next day

287
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
The 11th

288
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
November 2000

289
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
What happened

290
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:58,495
Listen to that Glenn Beck a little clip of it

291
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
The 10th

292
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,079
Of November

293
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
2010

294
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Talk about

295
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
Is it all

296
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,223
You talk about TSA being

297
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,015
Evil people

298
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,319
And how are there taking pictures of your dick

299
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:27,167
It's not my favorite thing I will say that listening to it was a little bit

300
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
Because it was like

301
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,983
It was someone

302
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
Making an argument

303
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,991
I don't want to waste 3 hours

304
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,271
Here on the off-chance

305
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,087
The two hours into this you like you know who sucks Glenn Beck

306
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,623
And unfortunately

307
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
We didn't say a word about

308
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
3 hours left

309
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Flown

310
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:01,727
Realize you're doing

311
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
Whatever

312
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
Profound talk

313
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
But

314
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
He does good at Miguel

315
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
Now that my

316
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
Sometimes because maybe hours

317
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
Giving him the benefit

318
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,279
You have a two-night series I'm not going to comment until the end

319
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
I highly

320
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
I doubt that

321
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,631
I think it just came to his attention

322
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
On the

323
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
Little bit of context

324
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
Here is a clip of Alex Jones

325
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
September 13th

326
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
28

327
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
Talking about his relation

328
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
What's George Soros

329
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,367
What's George Soros

330
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,679
My mom always said PBS on cooking dinner

331
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,775
Directions to Monmouth football whatever she was always there

332
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
856

333
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
Gourmet food

334
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,743
It was always on PBS in

335
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535
George Soros

336
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
The overthrow countries

337
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,543
He's the sweet little Nazi collaborator you almost kiss his little wart-covered booty

338
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:46,431
Implying Immaculate that he's known since childhood what is gourmet dinners

339
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:52,831
What is embalming even have to make gourmet irrelevant irrelevant

340
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:58,207
About doesn't also have to be legendary

341
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:02,303
Worthy of woman as we learned episode

342
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
Because he's a

343
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,727
Mom makes

344
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:14,847
Only coming from him in another context it might seem better

345
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
Far from the

346
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
The point is that

347
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,943
Expressing this idea that he's known about the Roses

348
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,479
Country collapser

349
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,759
Extraordinaire

350
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,855
I mean what would that be he was born in 1974

351
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159

352
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:34,303

Son-of-a-gun also on his business card

Here we jumping

362
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,111

00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,511
The early in the episode

366
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,559
Alex

367
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,375
Cuz if you didn't I was going to throw something across the river

368
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,479
Today

369
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,527
Handle the New World Order

370

The Puppet Master

371
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,487
Not just because

372
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
Could guess that

373
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,495
Beforehand

374
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,895
I have multiple sources at the highest levels

375
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,967
You got mold

376
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:02,623
Predicted ahead of time that Glenn Beck would say that George Soros is

377
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,743
He has sources inside

378
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,047
Not inside the new world

379
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:17,727
Levels of the New World Order who are in contact with George Soros

380
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
All this information

381
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,823
Business execs at Fox

You get that information from

384
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
Page

Undercut his like predictive abilities

387
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,535
You saying like

388
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
So

389
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,399
I don't know if you

390
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,471
He's talking about Soros

391
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,263
Mikey talks about him now

392
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,031
Here in Twin

393
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,015
He's going to say Glenn Beck

394
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,063
Over exaggerating

395
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,367
Soros

396
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,671
Interesting you should think that's the way this is

397
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:13,279
Is going to go or not going to find out for now because I have to talk about how absurd

398
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,303
With Alex Jones

399
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
Glenn Beck

400
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,519
What would

401
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,599
I particularly don't want

402
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,815
But he's doing more harm

403
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,375
He's going to be

404
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:01,663
20%

405
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:08,319
18%

406
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,607
What's up what are you doing

407
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,143
Alright

408
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,799
For the guy who's supposed to be obsessed with you

409
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,919
You're the one talking about him a lot

410
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
No

411
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:41,599
That's true

412
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
To talk about him

413
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,071
Because he's always watching me

414
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,119
There's a little bit of that feel to that

415
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,935
But he's done something that's got him 80%

416
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,983
Is 80% on his side

417
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:04,639
He did this

418
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:11,039
I like him right with him 80%

419
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:19,488
I'd like to 80%

420
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,048
60% nonsense talk

421
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
Kismet meaning

422
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,936
But it does well I like that

423
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,752
It does seem to lead you to assume

424
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:35,360
After you know what happens the last

425
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:41,760
Year before this maybe Alex is already onboard with Soros being the Puppet Master

426
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,064
He predicted ahead of time because you know like

427
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,392
Affected any research this is what he would find

428
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,720
It turns out that what he liked about Glenn Beck

429
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,792
Here is what he has to say

430
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,840
About the idea of Soros being the puppet

431
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,888
I will reveal

432
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,728
Puppet Masters in 2 hours and 15 minutes

433
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
Give me

434
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
Give me a break

435
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:14,016
Wake me up piece of that George Soros bar

436
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,576
Is not the dark Sauron of the left

437
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,648
Give me a break

438
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:25,280
Since 1988 that George Soros was the biggest demon

439
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:31,680
Collapse

440
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,008
Goodnight

441
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,032
Is pretending that he's known for

442
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:41,408
He's giving himself a little bit of a mythological backstory

443
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,944
Whereas

444
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
We see here

445
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,248
Very clearly

446
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
Alex Jones

447
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,832
Is not on a George Soros tip

448
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,112
Herein

449
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,880
20

450
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
Yeah

451
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,744
Did anybody ever like

452
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,048
George Soros from the beginning

453
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,096
Was there like 60

454
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:04,704
Or is it just like somebody found out that a Jew was a billionaire so they were like what we got

455
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,472
Stop this

456
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:10,080
I think generally speaking as is the case with

457
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,640
The protocols of the Elders of Zion itself

458
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,176
There is probably a

459
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,504
A Russian influence that leads people down

460
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,784
Specific

461
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,808
The cast of

462
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:23,904
Destruction

463
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,256
Plot basically population

464
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,536
Wildfire

465
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,888
And in this case

466
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,680
It seems very clear that

467
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,520
One person in the entire world

468
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:43,104
Who would have a vested interest in demonizing George Soros

469
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
Is Vladimir Putin

470
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,664
Inasmuch

471
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,944
Is George Soros

472
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
The open Society

473
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
Have been in

474
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,040
Instrumental in trying to bring

475
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
Democracy

476
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Do a lot of the parts

477
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
The former Soviet

478
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,648
He's he's trying to help

479
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,672
Democratizing

480
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Liberate

481
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
A number place

482
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,000
Not by overthrowing governments

483
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,328
Do democratic

484
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,656
Innovation whether it's through financial support

485
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,216
Or logistical support giving them printers

486
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,008
Print off material

487
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,288
To give to people

488
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,336
That is one of his big

489
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
You things

490
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,920
It does make sense

491
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,224
Well it's impossible necessarily for us

492
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,272
Without knowing

493
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,576
Much more behind-the-scenes

494
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,952
No that is a very

495
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,976
Reasonable I think

496
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
Conclusion to make

497
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,328
Suspect number one

498
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,864
It demonizing Soros

499
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
Putin

500
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,264
It's clear is that here 22

501
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
Thesaurus

502
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,592
He is very much

503
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
Another tip

504
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,664
He's promised

505
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,712
At this point that at the end of the show

506
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,736
The truth

507
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
He teases that

508
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,880
Throughout the entire episode because of course he wants to stick around

509
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
Find lessons

510
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
We still don't know at this point

511
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
Okay

512
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,072
If you don't agree with his

513
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,144
You know a certain that Soros is the Puppet Master

514
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
What is it that you

515
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
About that quote

516
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Glenn Beck

517
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
Text work

518
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,568
Let me find out in this

519
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:23,200
Has coming out and talked about government-sponsored terrorism

520
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:33,952
Prison

521
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,632
Why does the left knee this violence will listen to

522
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:47,264
From a democratic pollster mark

523
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,056
How can the left

524
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,104
Win country

525
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
Watch

526
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,176
Cabinet stones

527
00:25:54,432 --> 00:26:00,576
Don't really sell thanks president of South have to reconnect for the people remember

528
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:04,416
Oklahoma

529
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,096
Obama needs a similar a similar

530
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,168
Obama needs a similar kind of

531
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,960
Event right

532
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,752
City

533
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:25,152
Come home

534
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,712
Then he'll politically be in good shape

535
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,272
All right there I get what you doing

536
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
I got it

537
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:36,672
According correct

538
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,440
Because

539
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,232
It's All Coming Undone this week

540
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,816
I will be the guy who causes the neck

541
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
Oklahoma City

542
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,912
Veteran appeal to advertisers

543
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:51,264
I'll Fox deerfox advertisers this part of it

544
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
No one

545
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,944
Left another Oklahoma City the next assassin

546
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,504
They are setting up

547
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:05,088
Another Oklahoma City

548
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,624
And they already

549
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,416
The one who caused it

550
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,000
But don't you miss Wednesday show

551
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,264
Buddy pal

552
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:31,200
Exactly where you should have in exactly the right way

553
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:36,576
What we have is two fundamental intentional misunderstandings that Glenn Beck is perpetuated

554
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:40,416
The first is in that clip which is from Hardball with Chris Matthews

555
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:43,232
This guy Martin is making the argument

556
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:47,584
Speech made after Oklahoma City

557
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,912
Event it

558
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:54,496
Yeah he was saying a speech like that

559
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
If you want to make that argument

560
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
He needs a moment of

561
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:03,200
Connection not necessarily that there needs to be a terrorist attack

562
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,416
Buddy buddy pal

563
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,208
You are

564
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,024
A part of the system

565
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,376
To be radicalized in such a way that leads

566
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,752
This person thing the next time something happens

567
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,800
Will have blood on their hands

568
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,824
Is Knox

569
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,640
Preemptive blaming for a false flag attack

570
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
It's

571
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,272
Warning people logical consequences of the rhetoric

572
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,808
Demagogue

573
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,600
Inflamed

574
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,392
White nationalist

575
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,256
And have the capability

576
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:52,864
They're usually the ones pushing people towards the capability

577
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,728
Sort of modus operandi is also 2

578
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:01,568
I'm inflamed feelings of deprivation or victimhood

579
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:05,408
That are lying right behind or perceptions of equality

580
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
And plurality

581
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:11,808
Which is a good game because it's very profitable to assholes

582
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,344
I am making

583
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,160
Terror attack

584
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,744
And because

585
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,608
Can stay there

586
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,144
Planning

587
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,424
In order to blame

588
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,264
Right

589
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,848
By being guilty of it I can claim that I am guilty of it

590
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:38,432
Brighton State and it works really well

591
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:41,504
Really well like it almost

592
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,784
Cannot be

593
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
Coincidence

594
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,112
Unintentional

595
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,464
Can't wrap my head around the idea that they would just

596
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,864
Jambalaya backwards into something Ironclad Behavior

597
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,888
InTouch way it's amazing

598
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,936
It really it really

599
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,960
My hat

600
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,824
Bora Bora

601
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,360
Stupid right and propaganda

602
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,640
These are the two

603
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,688
Like really essential misunderstand

604
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,480
Alex

605
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,504
Transversal

606
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,088
Reversing the association

607
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,880
Of the logic of

608
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:25,280
A lot of people who are in militias like Ron Paul

609
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,424
Demon

610
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,240
The same sort of misunderstanding is being done here

611
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,312
It willingly with this Hardball clip where the guy is saying

612
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,336
Bill Clinton

613
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,664
People back on his side with that great speech that he gave

614
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,736
Praslin back is arguing

615
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,760
Do we need a terrorist attack

616
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,040
People backs

617
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,648
Can get

618
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,952
It's okay

619
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:59,328
The government which is the misrepresentation

620
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,216
If I had to guess I would say that Alex's theme be tremendous

621
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,264
Glenn Beck has been having

622
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,544
Since 2009

623
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,384
Because of the like freedomworks money that's blowing into him

624
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,504
Because of the 912 movement because of the Tea Party

625
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,296
And I think that Alex

626
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,576
Probably like

627
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,136
There's a way that I can have an olive branch

628
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,696
I can say that

629
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:30,048
Another Oklahoma City let's see if I can get some of that money

630
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:35,936
I think that's kind of what's going on I'm getting released the vibe

631
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,288
Like that I wanted play this next

632
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,128
We aren't being unfair

633
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:47,968
Not interested really talking about Soros

634
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:54,880
I can find no fault with what he's doing other than the fact of

635
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,648
Roast

636
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,208
Puppet Master

637
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,536
They are getting ready to stage

638
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
Fair enough

639
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:11,520
Coffee with way too much milk

640
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,288
You piece of s***

641
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,080
Find no fault

642
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:19,200
Glenn Beck Behavior here in November of 2010 with the exception of

643
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:19,968
Of him saying that

644
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,904
He should have just said all the juice

645
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
Not just one

646
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,976
Lame

647
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:36,096
Clipit Alex play it is obvious interview on Hardball with Chris Matthews

648
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,912
Mark

649
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,448
And

650
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
Previously posted

651
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,824
Glenn Beck

652
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,872
Right

653
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,896
He's not mad about

654
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,992
He's not he's not really mad.

655
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,552
He f****** do we post that photo

656
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,856
Mischaracterizing

657
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,392
Cinemark 10

658
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,280
Exciting

659
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,888
On Monday

660
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,384
National Television

661
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,688
So you called him a Clinton

662
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,480
Kind of app

663
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,248
Problems

664
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,368
References

665
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,696
From Clinton campaign and is also a Democrat

666
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,232
The Sara Lee mean they are excellent

667
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,560
November 2010

668
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,936
MARC Penn was the chief strategist for Hillary Clinton

669
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,472
2008 run

670
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,800
Barack Obama

671
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:54,176
Guy out of nowhere

672
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,712
For a bit but then

673
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,992
I'm reading from source

674
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:03,648
On April 4th 2008 The Wall Street Journal reported Colombia's ambassador to the United

675
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:06,720
States on Monday to discuss

676
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,768
Apache the presidential candidate

677
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,304
Hillary Clinton opposed it

678
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
So

679
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,376
It turns out

680
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:18,240
This company that he works for

681
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,360
Would you call

682
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,640
Lobbying group

683
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,224
Text Kristen marsteller

684
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,624
Had been contracted in 2070 Lobby for Columbia on behalf of that by

685
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
Bilateral

686
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:41,024
US Department of Justice filings disclose it in March 2007 VM

687
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,792
Marsteller

688
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:45,376
Hundred thousand-dollar one-year contract at the Colombian Embassy

689
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:49,216
In March 2007 the managing director of burson-marsteller

690
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:55,360
Washington Regional Office in chairman of its issues and advocacy practice Roberts

691
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
Columbia

692
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,408
So

693
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,712
What was going on is this Mark

694
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,016
Was meeting with Colombian

695
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,576
It is at the embassy

696
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,856
The Colombian ambassador

697
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,624
Under the

698
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:12,256
His job with burson-marsteller in order to work on trying to

699
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,560
Path to this bilateral trade

700
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,608
That Clinton was supposed to

701
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,144
He was the chief strategist

702
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,544
4 at the time I'm not sure but it is very

703
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,944
Inappropriate on April 4th

704
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,760
2000 when the Wall Street Journal reported on it

705
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,832
You got that right

706
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:40,928
And so he gets kicked out as her Chief strategist

707
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:47,072
The meeting was an error in judgment and that will not be repeated I'm sorry for it

708
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:50,912
The Senators well-known opposition to the trade deal

709
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:51,936
Probably alive

710
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:57,568
Would modify the Clinton campaign But ultimately

711
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,616
I also

712
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:06,016
Columbia took offense to Penn State

713
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:12,160
The Columbia government considers this a lack of respect to Columbian

714
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,464
Response unacceptable

715
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:18,816
I'm a big fan of everybody

716
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:23,936
The guardian

717
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:33,664
Yeah because he was still you still like a fairly credible pollster

718
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,944
And like pulling out

719
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,224
This guy even after that

720
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,624
Used some of his pulling data

721
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,928
What is a high-level strategy

722
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:47,232
And he got booted for all this s***

723
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:51,584
He's not a very big Fall From Grace

724
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,960
Some sort of a liberal or anything like that

725
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:01,056
Is kind of disingenuous because he has links to let's say big

726
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824
Tobacco

727
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,360
Anti-union causes

728
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:07,712
Did Hitler

729
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,528
He has a deep history of working against

730
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,064
And lobbying against

731
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,600
What are

732
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,880
Traditional

733
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,904
Liberal colleges

734
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:18,208
I don't feel like

735
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:22,560
Inasmuch as he's on Hardball with Chris Matthews

736
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
He is

737
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,864
A talking head we talk

738
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,704
That's what he's doing

739
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:33,312
We we need a terrorist text get Obama up in the polls that kind of a speech

740
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:39,712
Bill Clinton gave in 95 after Oklahoma City

741
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,992
On as one of

742
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,040
The great speeches especially of our lifetime

743
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,344
A galvanizing moment that brought people

744
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,368
Altogether

745
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,136
So

746
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
I don't know

747
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,744
Even to Alex's

748
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,512
Pretending video

749
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,536
Nautical inn

750
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,608
You can't even get your Clinton pot shots

751
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,912
You can't say that he was an Obama strategy

752
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:02,496
Just cuz he was on the team that was against Obama in the primaries

753
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
Anyway

754
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,056
This is all to say that

755
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,640
There's very little for me to look into Ennis episode so I had to look

756
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,712
This this is all the say that

757
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,296
The chief strategist

758
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,088
Clinton's campaign

759
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,416
Associated with a lobbying firm in DC

760
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,000
Good graces of the Colombian government

761
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,816
Jessica

762
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:34,752
So in this position

763
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:40,384
I want to play this little 5-minute video, me

764
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,392
This Edition is carrion crow

765
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:56,000
On the left side

766
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,536
Carrion crow

767
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,608
PBS documentaries whereabouts

768
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:05,984
Whenever his mom was making those Gourmet balser bring his girlfriend over

769
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,032
They got PBS on there

770
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
PBS geyser

771
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
Just going like

772
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,128
Again tonight

773
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,176
Soros

774
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:21,600
Joshua

775
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:26,208
Make an argument that Alex

776
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,256
I would probably

777
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,304
Try to make

778
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,888
He would say that in 2010

779
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:39,008
What's the acceptance

780
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,800
Heroes through the ranks

781
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,080
Later

782
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,384
And the argument that I would make to that is easy

783
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,664
You study things the way

784
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,736
You have all this inside information

785
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,528
You would know in 20

786
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,320
The George Soros with earmark

787
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,344
To be the next

788
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,112
Puppet Master

789
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:58,720
Because this operation does not operate without a clear

790
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,488
Chain of command

791
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,512
There's not a

792
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,560
Continuity-of-government

793
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:07,680
If you allow that term to be used here

794
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,728
What are you say

795
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,032
Leadership of the globalist

796
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,104
I don't think they exist

797
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:20,480
What is Alex's version

798
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:25,600
Leaderless resistance kind of

799
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,928
Model absolutely hierarchical

800
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,208
2 is the answer

801
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,000
Someone at the top

802
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,280
Who else is going to review

803
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,584
This episode

804
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,448
Those guys all have a

805
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,984
DeKalb underneath

806
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:45,824
Sprite

807
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,640
Do a certain extent there's circles within circles

808
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,944
Inner and outer circles

809
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,736
Stuff like that

810
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,040
Besoros

811
00:40:55,296 --> 00:41:00,160
Right but right now it is stopped

812
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,208
Could be anybody

813
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,768
I must

814
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,072
That there is literally no way Alex

815
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:07,840
Can make the argument

816
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
Do you make

817
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,912
The world

818
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,960
That don't include that

819
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,984
If Soros

820
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,288
Puppet master of few years later

821
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,104
He would have been earmarked

822
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:26,272
It's not like whenever the Dalai Lama dies I got to go find them

823
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:32,672
With the globalist leadership structure

824
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,208
They know

825
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,864
Isn't there another guy

826
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,032
Which is probably better position to be in

827
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,080
Let's

828
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,640
You're not you're not

829
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:04,671
No way too much like

830
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:11,071
No accountability

831
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,655
But how many of those guys

832
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,727
Afterwards

833
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,775
I f*****

834
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,335
Broad Promenade

835
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,871
Brewing to accept

836
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:32,575
Buyer's remorse on the Dalai Lama

837
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,343
Grad school

838
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,903
Pennywise

839
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,951
Alex

840
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,975
The big good

841
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,143
That they're going to Stage the right way

842
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,239
And actually that's a little bit of a

843
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,519
Tell on Alex

844
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,799
How excited

845
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:55,615
He is the Glenn Beck said this on his show

846
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:59,199
Because I was also on this shows that Glenn Beck has three million viewers

847
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:04,063
Glenn Beck with three million viewers is saying this

848
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
He has less

849
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,647
Could say that

850
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
Property

851
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,231
Lucas Pizza

852
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,559
He also Alex Alex also realizes

853
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,167
If going back is staying

854
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:19,935
Bet the government

855
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,703
Is going to

856
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,727
Do another Oklahoma

857
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,495
City

858
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,799
Make fun of other things I say

859
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:30,431
Because now is glengoyne

860
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,039
Whoa

861
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,391
In 2010

862
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,951
Alex is critical of Glenn Beck

863
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,231
Because

864
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,023
Has a religion of hating Muslim

865
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:51,167
It's almost like everything he was mad at Glenn Beck about in 2010 is exactly who he became

866
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,959
The other religions are Muslim

867
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,495
He believes the George Soros is a puppy

868
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,591
Glenn Beck is obsessed with him

869
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,895
Unc's convex

870
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,479
Out of all the time

871
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:10,879
Sure Alex wants to be him with his listenership Alex is gradually turning into him in order

872
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:15,487
But that's because I don't think it's forwarding listeners

873
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,303
I think

874
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,095
Quite frankly

875
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:20,863
It's

876
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,423
Money

877
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,471
And whoever was

878
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,751
Influencing

879
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,519
Glenn Beck

880
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,823
Alex want

881
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,359
Piece of some of that simple

882
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,175
Or those people is already

883
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,759
Yeah and Alex

884
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,551
Maybe if it's point doesn't

885
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,575
Realize that

886
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,599
These are

887
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,367
Two hands of

888
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,439
Anybody going back or both being used

889
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,231
In order to radicalize the right-wing

890
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,303
Possible

891
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,631
Incredibly likely that the reason

892
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,679
The Glenn Beck goes this path

893
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,727
And then veers off

894
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,775
Last year was on Samantha Bee Apollo

895
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,359
Call Jason for s***

896
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,663
Because that gravy train ended for him

897
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,943
Whoever

898
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,711
Was trying

899
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,015
To get him

900
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,295
To do whatever he was doing

901
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:14,111
Decided he was no longer effective in what we need him

902
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,415
Interesting

903
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,439
Alex Jones

904
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,207
Become

905
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975
Him

906
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,511
Suspiciously

907
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,303
Almost

908
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,095
Is the new Glenn Beck

909
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,887
Baltimore

910
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
I don't know though

911
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,495
Dark Horse

912
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
Leader of the

913
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,591
The globalist

914
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:45,087
Mark Patton

915
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,159
Now

916
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:56,095
No I would like to be like you to give some

917
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:56,863
Legitimate

918
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,167
You'll never be able to guess

919
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,703
Suicides at the top

920
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,751
But I think

921
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,031
The round button

922
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,335
Quite frankly

923
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:09,663
Yeah

924
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,431
What about wrong

925
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:16,319
Tableland

926
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,623
Farted in Obama's face

927
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:22,975
Does it come up once

928
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,255
Nearest Obama

929
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:27,327
Okay

930
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,679
Nobody would ever

931
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,959
To be a puppet for the puppy

932
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:33,983
Master narrative

933
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,799
Plus that's one of the central conceits of the Obama

934
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,455
And it can't be

935
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,271
Still bva the Rockefellers

936
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,039
Isn't like cuz that's

937
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,319
Boring and not sexy

938
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,623
Throwing Soros in there

939
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,903
You can't then throw the Rock

940
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,671
Fellers back

941
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:58,303
That's no fun you're going back don't have Soros throne

942
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,631
That is true

943
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:02,911
Hey bad news

944
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:09,311
It's the Rothschilds and Rockefellers

945
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,103
Creative

946
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:18,527
Progression that is able to do on his own

947
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,551
Because

948
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,575
Thinking person who's ever lived

949
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,599
You are so should know that

950
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,135
Also

951
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,927
That's not who he says is at the top

952
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,655
It's pretty crazy

953
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,031
It would be absurd

954
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,055
For him to be the Puppet Man

955
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:54,879
George Soros is a bad guy

956
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,231
Exciting

957
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
Is it

958
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:00,767
Depop

959
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,071
The 80s movies

960
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,263
That guy who had madame

961
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,871
The puppet battle flowers

962
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:19,455
Is not is not whoever used

963
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,503
Howdy Doody

964
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:24,831
Navigate

965
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:29,183
None of those pompous of gold

966
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,207
Nope nope

967
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:39,935
No there was a ventriloquist

968
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,215
Syriza ventriloquist

969
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:44,287
I don't remember if there was ever actually

970
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,055
Ventriloquist

971
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,359
Did those or if it was just the

972
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,383
Builder Hatcher Bennett

973
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,687
Involved

974
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,527
Diesel power

975
00:48:55,039 --> 00:49:01,183
The spirit of stories involving Trula quisim

976
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:05,791
Situation without

977
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,839
That's where all ventriloquism acts are

978
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:13,983
The ventriloquist says dirty s*** in the games the puppet

979
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:18,335
Of course that's supposed to be about

980
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,639
Any does the voice of something else

981
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,175
So crazy

982
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:22,943
So crazy

983
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,991
So

984
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,295
Soros is a globalist

985
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:28,831
Sure

986
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,599
Fine

987
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,879
Yeah but he is

988
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:31,647
It would be

989
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,415
Razee

990
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,183
To call him

991
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:34,975
Crazy

992
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,791
Alex is like

993
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,839
So bad after all

994
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,919
And now he's being set up

995
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:56,223
For the next

996
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,343
Buildings

00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:24,895

998
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:29,247

Emerson wave catcher

1003
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,479
Using material

1004
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:06,367
That is not a cooking knife friend that is a 7-night

1005
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,159
Cool cool cool cool

1006
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:15,071
People who are super that I am with guns

1007
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:19,423
Because most people who are super into knives are just like those guys who are like

1008
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:22,751
Creepily in the butt nonviolent

1009
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:28,127
Around New York with a sword over the weekend

1010
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:33,503
Yeah I do

1011
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:38,367
To hang out with one very much

1012
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,671
But the people who are into knives are usually like

1013
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,439
Simmering

1014
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,327

1016
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:51,679
Better

1017
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,215
Display rooms than the

1018
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:53,983
The gun display

1019
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,775
You know what I mean like

1020
00:51:56,031 --> 00:52:00,127
When you go into a nightmare fuel to

1021
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,151
Craftsmanship

1022

Poquoson denies and stores and

1023
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,991
Words like what are you going to do with gun

1024
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,039
I forgot

1025
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,063
Parks

1026
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,391
To make it all that aesthetically pleasing

1027
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:14,719
Urien no matter what

1028
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:21,119
Making you a nice that's a nice

1029
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,167
Come on to make me

1030
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:26,239
Alex

1031
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,031
Is very clear

1032
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,055
About

1033
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,079
He's possessed

1034
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,615
Most

1035
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,663
To the rest of the clip

1036
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,687
Are going to

1037
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,455
Just Berrian

1038
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,735
Yes

1039
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,015
Soros is not

1040
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:38,783
They had the

1041
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,551
Globalist

1042
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,575
He is

1043
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,599
Down the totem

1044
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,391
He's not important

1045
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,671
And

1046
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,231
We'll deal with why he

1047
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,255
He's saying that at the end of

1048
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,559
Cuz I think there's actually

1049
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,351
We've hit on a couple reasons

1050
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,887
But I have an overarching

1051
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,447
Siri

1052
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,031
There's a little bit of that

1053
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,895
A outbreak more about his mole

1054
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,735
Exactly

1055
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:17,439
We are the true Liberty Movement

1056
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:31,775
If you immerse yourself in

1057
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:41,247
Start focusing on what you're doing is patient

1058
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,319
Bulshit

1059
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,623
What are you saying there is

1060
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,647
Is so invalid

1061
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:53,023
Tony bowls cuz I know everything

1062
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,303
If you know what's happened

1063
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,839
Then you should have been like you know what

1064
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,631
He's wrong

1065
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,679
Cirrhosis

1066
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,215
He will be right in the future

1067
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,031
Keep stressing

1068
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,823
If Alex has real information

1069
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,615
Then this shouldn't be this

1070
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,383
Response

1071
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,431
Soros isn't important

1072
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,199
HEB

1073
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,991
He's in line but

1074
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:15,039
He's still waiting for the Old Guard 2

1075
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:15,807
Disappear

1076
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,087
Rebuttal

1077
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,879
Alright let's talk

1078
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,927
Stalin

1079
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,743
The globalist

1080
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,791
New World Order

1081
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,815
Instead of

1082
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,607
Earmarking Soros

1083
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,375
Further

1084
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:30,911
Right

1085
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,727
The chance to pick a

1086
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:36,543
So now all of these guys

1087
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,311
4 position

1088
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,103
Killing each other

1089
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,407
Tipsy who's the globalist learn from the lessons

1090
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,199
And now Heather

1091
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:48,575
Rigidly hierarchical because of my

1092
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:54,463
Everyone has learned lessons

1093
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:59,583
I always equip Alex Jones

1094
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:05,215
How exciting is that quick prepares

1095
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,239
To reveal

1096
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,263
Who is

1097
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,799
At the top of the pyramid

1098
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,335
Yes

1099
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:20,063
The real

1100
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,903
The progressives

1101
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,535
2 days ago

1102
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,871
Years ago

1103
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:04,607
Create a blog

1104
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,399
Write the end Alex

1105
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,679
Clearly watch

1106
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:10,239
Some of Glenn Beck's show is like that

1107
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:16,639
I really like that chocolate

1108
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,943
Whataburger

1109
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:23,295
Becoming the neocon

1110
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,087
That's all I

1111
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,903
There's so many lines I could draw

1112
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,975
Soros is a

1113
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:34,815
Step above that you can only have four to six servings

1114
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:41,215
But who is at the top of the pyramid Alex would never say this sort of thing about like

1115
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:45,055
Now

1116
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:48,383
Weather

1117
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:52,479
If you have any kind of intellectual consistency

1118
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,503
Body don't

1119
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,783
Now we

1120
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,063
We get to the reveal

1121
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,855
Is it the top

1122
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:14,239
Bill Belichick

1123
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:17,567
Okay

1124
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:31,903
What a disappointing reveal

1125
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,695
Entire show

1126
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:39,839
Exciting Federal Reserve

1127
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:42,911
Docu

1128
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:46,495
The Federal Reserve is what does everything

1129
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:52,895
Everybody all the globalist to Alex's worried about their religion

1130
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:56,223
The bidding of the Federal Reserve

1131
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:59,039
Because the rotate

1132
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,855
Have to be part

1133
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,159
Play can't be the puppet

1134
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:08,511
Is like

1135
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,279
Stafford

1136
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:12,351
You know regardless of what administration is in office

1137
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:15,935
They're always there they're like a vice president

1138
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:19,263
Bugle

1139
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,799
And play I think I

1140
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:21,823
Someone

1141
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:28,223
4 steps down the hierarchy of the Federal Reserve is actually exactly

1142
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,831
That is an essential piece of this

1143
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:36,159
It if you are the head of

1144
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,439
The Federal Reserve which is

1145
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:40,511
The top of the globalist New World Order pyramid

1146
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,303
Your job only last

1147
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,095
Years or whatever

1148
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,935
Vivint Soros would never get the

1149
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,215
Never never

1150
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:55,359
The idea that the Federal Reserve is the Hat

1151
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,383
Is what he saying

1152
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,175
In 28

1153
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,455
Years prior

1154
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,223
Soros

1155
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,015
Never been

1156
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,087
But it's suspicious

1157
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,367
The Federal Reserve building

1158
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,135
Is appear

1159
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,975
So here's where George soros's

1160
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:17,631
George Soros

1161
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:21,215
But above him is Henry Kissinger

1162
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,519
George stults

1163
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:34,527
Middle-management operation

1164
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,063
Work from time to time

1165
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,231
He's middle-management type

1166
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,815
The people above him

1167
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,887
Even a plainclothes manager at Footlocker

1168
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,191
He still has to wear

1169
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,471
I still have to wear it

1170
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:57,055
Is where we get to know who are

1171
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:57,823
Important

1172
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:03,967
Is Rothschild family

1173
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:08,063
They're all right

1174
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:15,231
With the leaf

1175
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,815
Others

1176
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:25,215
Scoreboard cartoon

1177
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,591
Controls the strange

1178
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:34,431
Enter the nation-states and the petty regionally

1179
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:42,111
Trilateral commission meetings up here and endings

1180
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,975
So if you hear it is an oligarchy

1181
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:50,815
A tube

1182
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,095
But if you

1183
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:59,775
If you hear what you saying are you saying at the end of sauros people like him on his level

1184
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,847
Who just get brought around so they can feel important

1185
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:05,663
Hanging out at lunch today Bohemian Grove

1186
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:12,063
With people who really do matter Bilderberg Barnard's Offspring or whatever

1187
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,367
Even if I was a

1188
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:20,767
Rockefellers Rothschild soup Airport

1189
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:21,535
Specific

1190
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,423
Of the New World Order

1191
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,287
Okay

1192
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:39,455
David Rockefeller

1193
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:43,039
I think you said that before I did it again it's just

1194
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,831
It rolls off my back

1195
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,623
Omnibus

1196
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,695
Before but I think you said ombudsman

1197
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,231
Let's try it

1198
01:01:55,327 --> 01:02:00,959
I just didn't catch it because he's allowed

1199
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:05,823
You say that it's not like

1200
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
Consistent

1201
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,127
Miss you

1202
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:08,895
You know like it

1203
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:11,967
Pronounce one day that's wild

1204
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:14,783
That's crazy nobody is it correct

1205
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:15,807
Cowboy

1206
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,415
Exit

1207
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:26,559
He pronounces it every time

1208
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,095
Going on

1209
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:32,191
What does he always say for all intensive purposes

1210
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:35,007
I don't think he's ever said

1211
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:40,895
Child Federal Reserve is at the top

1212
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:43,967
Is how Alex closes things out on his show

1213
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:46,015
Disparaging George Soros

1214
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:46,783
Even more in this

1215
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,943
4 minutes out

1216
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,783
3 hours

1217
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,367
Yeah probably 4 minutes real time

1218
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,439
Neocon

1219
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:26,719
He's got to go

1220
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:28,767
I would like that

1221
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,583
But yes it was services in the servant class

1222
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:34,143
You billion dollars would be really bummed

1223
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,727
YouTube

1224
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,847
The Richmond

1225
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:52,063
The numbers game

1226
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:57,695
Secret society never get to party like that

1227
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:02,303
I just want to go to a bar and get drunk

1228
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:06,399
It is very similar to RiverWatch

1229
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,167
John Hodgman

1230
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:09,727
On The Daily Show

1231
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:13,055
Billionaire character appearance

1232
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:18,175
That deranged billionaires

1233
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,711
5 + 10

1234
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,503
Jon Stewart

1235
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,783
Going up there like

1236
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,599
Who does the menial tasks

1237
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,391
You're not going to do that when you're up there

1238
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,415
I'm a player

1239
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,951
Like a montage of clips

1240
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:33,279
Commercial space travel for millionaires

1241
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:39,679
Implying that the millionaires

1242
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,639
Your rights always a package

1243
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,175
Be wildly disappoint

1244
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:52,223
And I think very unlikely

1245
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,503
So now

1246
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:56,831
We have to ask ourselves a little bit about the timing

1247
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:58,879
Because

1248
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:01,183
Where in November 2010

1249
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:04,255
And this is really about a week after the midterm election

1250
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,583
So what happened if you don't recall

1251
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,631
Is in 2008

1252
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,911
And there was a lot of

1253
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,447
5 seats

1254
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,727
Blue Waves

1255
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,031
A bit of a blue whale

1256
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:21,663
What happened in 2010

1257
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:29,343
Dualistic mentality largely from

1258
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,927
Look up brother Sheldon Adelson freedomworks

1259
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:38,303
Prospero

1260
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,839
A sound economy

1261
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,375
Which is what became freedomworks

1262
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:44,191
Right

1263
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:48,287
Because of that influx of money propagandist like Glenn Beck

1264
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:52,895
But they paid for Sean Hannity

1265
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,663
The movement

1266
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:55,967
Became so

1267
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,527
Heavily covered by the media

1268
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:00,063
We end up in the situation

1269
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:00,831
Here where

1270
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,599
The Senate

1271
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:02,367
Republican

1272
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,391
Game 60

1273
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,183
The house

1274
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:05,951
The game

1275
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,255
And the game 6

1276
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,023
Text governorship

1277
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,303
The Republic

1278
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,095
Completely destroyed

1279
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,119
The game

1280
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:13,887
In 2010

1281
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,167
They took over every

1282
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,959
That is why we are where we were

1283
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:19,263
Because when they take over every

1284
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:22,591
They immediately set about sucking everything up

1285
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:24,639
Kind of been trying to close those doors

1286
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,407
So it can't

1287
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,175
I'll be done to that

1288
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,479
Over everything

1289
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:34,879
We are about whether or not we compromised

1290
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:38,975
Well we have to do this based on a republican plan

1291
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:42,047
That way the Republicans will support it

1292
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,327
Interested in bipartisan

1293
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:48,703
Well the reason that I bring this up

1294
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:49,727
Edsby

1295
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,495
Cuz

1296
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:55,615
The situation that we have is very similar to the situation that we see in 28

1297
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,663
Inasmuch as

1298
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,199
The midterm election

1299
01:06:59,455 --> 01:06:59,967
Something happened

1300
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,783
Continue your rhetoric

1301
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,343
You know needing to fight

1302
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,623
And all that stuff

1303
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:08,671
When you have just one every

1304
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,463
So we have

1305
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:14,047
The house and the Senate and the governor house is all going.

1306
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,071
Deeply Republican

1307
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,351
In 2010

1308
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,143
And if you're someone who is a partisan

1309
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:24,031
What you need to do with evolve your narrative into something that's much more Insidious

1310
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,567
Your enemy isn't

1311
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,615
The Democrats because you've already beat them

1312
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,919
You have all the cards you hold all the power

1313
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,455
And you cannot be

1314
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:34,015
Realistically

1315
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,551
You can't blame them

1316
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,343
Four things that don't work out and cover

1317
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,647
Because your team can just do anything

1318
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:41,439
And so

1319
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,207
In order to keep

1320
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,743
Propaganda machines going

1321
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:46,815
And to keep this working in the prophets coming in

1322
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:49,631
You need to create a deeper narrative

1323
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,423
And that's weird

1324
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:54,495
That deeper narratives that Glenn Beck

1325
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:57,823
Chose to do is this George Soros is

1326
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:58,591
Behead

1327
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,615
Of the

1328
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:05,503
Deep underground secretive New World Order stuff that's really what the problem is

1329
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,271
Right

1330
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,807
Certain extent

1331
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:12,415
Because the New World Order the idea that

1332
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,183
Behind the scenes

1333
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,207
There's all these Shadows

1334
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,303
Trouble

1335
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,119
Is when we look at the parallels

1336
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,143
To the modern day

1337
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:24,447
After the 2016 election

1338
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,983
That is where

1339
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,263
Alex

1340
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,543
No longer had any

1341
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,871
He's guy is now in office

1342
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,639
The Republic

1343
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,431
Controlled both houses of Congress

1344
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,479
Wasn't

1345
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:39,039
He's in 2018

1346
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:39,807
426

1347
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,855
In the exact same position

1348
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:42,623
Glenn Beck

1349
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,391
Was

1350
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,159
In 2010

1351
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,951
He was the propaganda

1352
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:51,839
Glenn Beck was the propagandist in 2010 it was leading this tea parties s***

1353
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:55,679
On board with it even though Sean Hannity and Rush

1354
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,703
Were

1355
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:59,519
You know at least mostly in favor of it

1356
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:01,311
He was the figurehead of it

1357
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,079
To Great degree

1358
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:05,663
Cuz he was willing to embrace what it was really about

1359
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,967
Racism and

1360
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,735
Conspiracy

1361
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,807
And he was wholly funded by the people who were pushing

1362
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,927
Rush Limbaugh

1363
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:19,231
But they still have some autonomy they didn't

1364
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,255
Have almost

1365
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,535
Entire ownership

1366
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,839
Yeah so the reason that this isn't

1367
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,143
2016

1368
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,167
The same position

1369
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,215
Glenn Beck was

1370
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,239
2010

1371
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,567
We still ramping up

1372
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,103
Thesaurus stuff

1373
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,967
Is there before now anytime anything goes

1374
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,295
Anytime there's a

1375
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,319
Left protest

1376
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:46,367
You see Soros being blame

1377
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,671
Much like Glenn Beck

1378
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,695
Jump the shark

1379
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,975
In 2010

1380
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,511
November 2010

1381
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,047
With this Soros

1382
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:58,399
Alex is in the middle of a very extended shark jump

1383
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,423
That he's doing

1384
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,959
With every single time

1385
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:01,727
There's something

1386
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:05,823
Oh my God look at these contracts I found on Fort and approve the Soros

1387
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,615
Is funding antifa

1388
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,663
Exactly the same

1389
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,455
We see a 6-year mirror

1390
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:13,247
Here is Glenn Beck

1391
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:14,527
Alex Jones

1392
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:17,343
We look back and see what Alex Jones

1393
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,367
In 2010

1394
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,391
We see him saying

1395
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,415
You sir

1396
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,439
Are a fool

1397
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:26,559
Alex I would ask you to look in the mirror and see some of yourself in the past

1398
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:27,839
Calling yourself a

1399
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:28,863
Republican

1400
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:29,631
Actually already

1401
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,191
Fred Meyer preme

1402
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:36,287
Allowed to look

1403
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,079
In the mirror ever

1404
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:42,175
Behind

1405
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:46,015
I think

1406
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,807
Yeah

1407
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:54,463
How to put a button on this I don't know what I think I don't know exactly what conclusions can be drawn

1408
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,487
From their butt

1409
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,279
It's weird

1410
01:10:58,815 --> 01:10:59,839
It's very weird

1411
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,119
We can safely draw this

1412
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,167
Alex Jones

1413
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,703
Is going on

1414
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:12,127
Man something is rotten in Denmark

1415
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,407
Expression

1416
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,599
What's the temperature

1417
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:31,583
What's going out in Denmark it ain't no good

1418
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:37,983
I said out initially looking back

1419
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,519
Deeply Patty

1420
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,055
So if

1421
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:43,359
You go back to the point where

1422
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:46,431
Glenn Beck does his presentation

1423
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,199
Soros

1424
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:49,247
If he was already talk

1425
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,831
That would trigger him to the point of screaming the

1426
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,623
The entire show about how Glenn Beck

1427
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:57,183
Is ripping me off this is my s***

1428
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:00,767
Of course so I knew that if you want talk about it

1429
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,815
Response and if he wasn't talking about him

1430
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,607
Is there

1431
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,911
He would need to be like I know more than you

1432
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,959
Of course so the conclusion that we come to

1433
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,519
The latter is

1434
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,311
He doesn't think that

1435
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,079
Cirrhosis

1436
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,103
A big bad guy

1437
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,151
And that means

1438
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:22,783
Investigation in 2009 wheat to find out the tea party stuff

1439
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,855
But that's the question would not be answered until

1440
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:32,767
So that question

1441
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,607
I don't know what we're going to do with that

1442
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,911
And saved us a lot of time

1443
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:41,471
I don't know if I did

1444
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,359
Conclusion is

1445
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:49,151
It's not 2,000

1446
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:55,039
I don't know how to

1447
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,575
Live without just saying

1448
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,367
Doing here my dear

1449
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:02,463
Here's my

1450
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,815
We've been trying Proto

1451
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,447
What if we try

1452
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,215
Their own

1453
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:17,567
I don't like where you're going with it I really don't like it

1454
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:20,383
On TV and I say

1455
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,151
You're right

1456
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,943
We have been paid by

1457
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:26,783
But the only reason we've been paid

1458
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,575
Is because we are

1459
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:31,135
Not being paid enough by all of these bosses

1460
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,927
Where's the same time those bosses

1461
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,207
Is our pain

1462
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:34,975
Senators

1463
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:39,583
Who's really getting paid more money as its approach

1464
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,935
And the Senators are the ones who are directing

1465
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:46,751
They're the ones who are secretly controlling

1466
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,799
So you have to say that the Koch brothers

1467
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:50,079
Secretly controlling Trump

1468
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,871
And you can't trust them Trump

1469
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,151
We actually all

1470
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:55,455
Protesters

1471
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:58,527
But he doesn't know it because he's being convinced

1472
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,855
We can convince him

1473
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:06,463
That was really going on is that the Koch brothers are laughing at him

1474
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,815
Just like when he was a millionaire in New York City and all of the big

1475
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,607
They were like

1476
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,655
Oh he's a McDonald's billionaire

1477
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:16,959
Nothing still doing that to Trump

1478
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:19,519
Listen to us

1479
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:30,783
Then I can just say you conductor that audio that's bulshit they all that s*** up

1480
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:33,087
Truck can only trust us

1481
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,135
We're the only ones you can trust because

1482
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:41,535
We admitted it we admitted that we got paid by George Soros

1483
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,631
And then you say all well

1484
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:56,639
They're mad they're mad because your money

1485
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:02,527
Play we all know this to be true

1486
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,551
Exactly

1487
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:07,135
So that's how we do we are only Isaac

1488
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:13,023
Just confusing enough to work

1489
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,815
Have we tried cheating

1490
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,607
We got to try

1491
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:19,167
Why not

1492
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,031
You still think that

1493
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,055
Cheating

1494
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,335
Even if you believe

1495
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:28,639
Is that the end result is good it's still like

1496
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,223
Sort of

1497
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,783
Take away people's rights

1498
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:36,319
Will

1499
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,951
I'm not trying to

1500
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,743
Trump Evan on TV

1501
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,535
Every time

1502
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:49,887
It's like I'm talking to Rachel Maddow possibly believe that

1503
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,423
I will continue on with this week

1504
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,983
I'll give it I'll give a big old winkle be like

1505
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:57,567
This is

1506
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:07,295
I was I was scratching my eye that wasn't awake you're still going to end up inadvertently tricking a lot of pictures

1507
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:14,719
See this is where you getting to real Danger

1508
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:20,607
Creating a mythology that will run away from you in a way that you can't control

1509
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:23,423
Brothers created

1510
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,471
Party got out of control

1511
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:27,519
Control that anymore

1512
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:32,383
You would face sort of weird blinking mythology

1513
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:41,343
Maybe some sort of like a demon side

1514
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,647
You can't prove that

1515
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:47,231
Careful back on YouTube trust me

1516
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:52,095
From my resort to these people

1517
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:54,655
You can't prove that he's not a deterrent

1518
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:58,751
Empath

1519
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:00,031
We cancel each other out

1520
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:10,527
I don't know what to say I hope your plan works out

1521
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:15,647
November 11th

1522
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,183
Send Alex Jones

1523
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:22,303
Does not care about Soros at all Glenn Beck

1524
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:25,119
He's misunderstood

1525
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,143
Is nice

1526
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:27,935
Thinks he's a fool

1527
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:28,959
Taking thesaurus

1528
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,727
The Puppet Master

1529
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,519
Of the New World Order
