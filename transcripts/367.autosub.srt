00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Air Jordan

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge B

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,832
Dollartree.com

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,744
Hey buddy would like a knowledge

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,792
Beverages and talk a little bit about Allie

6
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,328
Alex Jones

7
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,864
Giordano

8
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,656
Did you have

9
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
Did you used to watch

10
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,568
Late nights or Letterman weapons would let me watch

11
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,896
Stuff that late sorry I was younger not really oh okay

12
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,480
Houston sort of like

13
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,760
Saturday Night Live

14
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:29,088
The past year old Saturday Night Live

15
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,880
Like Monty Python

16
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:35,488
Or Blackadder that kind of stuff

17
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,256
Humor

18
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:41,632
Blackadder the lotto Rowan Atkinson the house

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,216
But that was all unlike VHS

20
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,032
The real time

21
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:53,408
It came on way past my bedtime for most of my life

22
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,432
Play kind of gravitate

23
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,272
Yeah but I would be lying if I said that I was

24
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,576
Super into it

25
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:06,976
To take on the identity of a lot of people in comedy who really were deep

26
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,280
Yeah I preferred it to other

27
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,072
Late night but I never watched it

28
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,376
You didn't have that

29
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,168
Affinity for the Smigel you

30
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:15,936
Sears on 9th

31
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,800
As I've gotten older and I've watched a bunch of the stuff

32
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:25,408
After the fact I understand why people would but I wasn't

33
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,200
Country lady

34
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
I was not

35
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,832
Not deeply invested in the Leno versus Letterman

36
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:38,464
Kerfuffle

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
Take a position on the average

38
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,024
Roll I know

39
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,608
Lino did nothing wrong hashtag

40
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
I have not heard MattyB

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,008
People expressive broletto visit

42
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
How about MSG

43
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
I don't know

44
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,384
I like to I like to

45
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,944
Enough like I liked Letterman in

46
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
Antonin that stuff I saw

47
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,272
But

48
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,160
Wasn't wasn't my main bag

49
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
Talked about it

50
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:14,048
Prior to this I wish it was Letterman guy

51
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,376
I wish it was on some level like I do think

52
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
Going back and watch a lot of that stuff

53
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
Is really hilarious

54
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,984
There's a lot of really good work that

55
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,032
It was being done Thursday night shows

56
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,824
But for me to pretend now is

57
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
35 year old man

58
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,480
Yeah backgrounds 12 I can stay up all night

59
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,296
But I have not a lot of respect for the crab

60
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,464
All that stuff in Minecraft

61
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,024
Watching late-night live

62
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,608
But I do know a lot about Alex Jones

63
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,192
Cool so Jordan today we're back in the past

64
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,752
We are going over April 23rd

65
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
2013

66
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,616
And are continuing investigation of what the hell went on with Alex

67
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,920
Primarily

68
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
In terms of calling

69
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,224
The people of where the victim

70
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,992
Viruses

71
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,344
Actors of Tangled into the Boston bombing

72
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
Are we are

73
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,416
Coming out of that

74
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,208
And all of its result

75
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,232
Really

76
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:21,631
I mean johar sarna physics

77
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,727
I apologize I should have spoken more clearly

78
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,287
Still very much so on.

79
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,639
And others I know that there's more to learn about his response

80
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,711
The Boston bombing but I also think that we have now entered

81
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,735
The portion where it's like

82
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:42,623
In the same way that Alex has a little bit of a Comedown once there's official information out

83
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,695
I'm experiencing a little bit of that too

84
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:50,047
Just going back to normal where is we had a stretch of shows where it was like

85
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:55,167
Really dance lies in real time

86
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
And end

87
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
God

88
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,983
Excitedly

89
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:03,359
I just chomping at the at reality trying to take a bite out of it

90
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:08,479
That's mine now he's kind of

91
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
Back to a normal show here

92
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,671
It feels a little bit weird but I still think there's some

93
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,975
Think stuff in here but you'll notice a shift

94
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,303
You'll notice this feel a lot more like a normal Alex Jones

95
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375
Be allowed right

96
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
Like what

97
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,167
TV show Stars

98
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,471
Groundbreaking moment you don't allow them to

99
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
Go back to

100
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,055
Exhaust

101
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,639
The World by breaking the biggest

102
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,247
You can have two different times

103
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,831
Different stories about the same story

104
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:50,463
All broken so we'll get down to business on this but first we got to take a little moment to thank you

105
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
People have signed up and are supporting

106
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:57,887
So first Andrew thank you so much you're now a policy wonk

107

Thank you so much

118
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,751
Caillou Robert

119
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,687
Do that website, click the button

120
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
Indeed we would love a very

121
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
We jump in here Jordan

122
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Alex is

123
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
Not talking much

124
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
About the Boston

125
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
Situation

126
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
At all

127
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
At the beginning of this show

128
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,511
He's mostly complaining about Janet Nepali

129
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,327
I know that seems to be what his

130
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
He's got some big grapes

131
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:08,031
With the head of the Department of Homeland Security which makes sense

132
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Is an offshoot

133
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,823
Of his

134
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,663
Feelings about Boston The Manhunt

135
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,199
It's disconnected

136
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,247
Disjointed you never brings it all to

137
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
Together necessarily

138
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,575
But he's very mad about a couple of things

139
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,415
That she has done it one of them has to do with

140
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
The DHHS budget

141
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,935
You will not cut our funding

142
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:51,039
100

143
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,855
Dollars a year domestically

144
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207
So this is a bad thing

145
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
On a number of life

146
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:06,399
First part of this is really terrible thinking is her saying hey you know if we cut our funding there's a greater risk of some

147
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Some attack happen

148
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,983
You could hear that as a threat

149
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,543
And I think he's insinuating that what she means is

150
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:18,943
We're going to stage four terrorist attack if you don't give us

151
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,759
Well if we are able to fund our programs

152
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039
We will

153
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
Leave area

154
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Uncovered

155
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,695
You know there's a greater chance of somebody pulling something off

156
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
Great say Alex

157
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,071
Can read magical words in bulk

158
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
And the second thing is

159
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,911
That he's imagining that she

160
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
It's that 200 billion dollar

161
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:48,895
I told Isaac to the budget is a little too high on a 200 billion dollars I would Janet Napolitano

162
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
As she sees fit

163
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:56,063
I would say that there is definitely a fair conversation to be had surrounding like the Department of Homeland

164
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
Insecurities

165
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
And all these big the budget

166
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,695
I think I think that you could have in good faith

167
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,975
Albertsons not doing that

168
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,023
Probably not because any figure that

169
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
Time to site

170
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
Necessarily involves

171
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,887
So many things

172
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Vettys pretend

173
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:17,311
Yeah I figure is a massive figure but it also

174
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,871
Extends to like outside of the DHHS

175
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,687
Things within the Department of State

176
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,479
Right like that budget is not

177
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
Just like

178
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,039
Janet Napolitano

179
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:31,135
You could save a lot of Terror attacks with 200 billion down

180
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
I suppose you cut

181
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,207
So anyway he's saying it's 200 billion

182
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,767
Then he actually looks it up

183
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,479
Enforcement agencies

184
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,487
Hundred billion dollars

185
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:14,143
Sammy what is he doing all of the law enforcement agencies likes OK Google glued like the FBI in there too

186
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,679
Alright Google

187
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,471
He's just a

188
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:22,335
Find Rihanna renderings of agencies that will eventually equal up to 200 billion

189
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,639
I don't care which one

190
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,175
Play so fast and loose with his

191
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
Terms

192
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
That's the sense I get it

193
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
Whatever you're doing

194
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,623
It's a problem to

195
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
Because

196
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
That is a conversation

197
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,743
Worth having

198
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,815
But when you do it. Disingenuously like this

199
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,351
Takes away from the ability

200
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,471
Have that conversation about the attempts to audit

201
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
The Pentagon

202
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
Nightmare where are you

203
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,383
Like everybody realizes that a certain point

204
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
They've done this over and over again

205
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Over again

206
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,759
Nobody in the Pentagon actually knows where the mud

207
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
It's all theoretical

208
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,951
Besides he's been deposed

209
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
Like who runs what

210
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,607
So I think Alex has a little bit just

211
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,679
Because he went and saw a movie

212
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,215
Last night the night before

213
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
Let me tell you

214
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
He loved it

215
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,335
Will you pull up the

216
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,967
Rise of the Machines end of humanity October

217
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,463
Place

218
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,143
Nowhere

219
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,727
Nowhere online

220
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:01,407
I just tell you know where online do they show you

221
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
The bad guy

222
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,415
Obsessed with that obviously not a secret

223
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,767
The movie is on the cover of my

224
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119
Out of my mind

225
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,263
So bad

226
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,567
So Alex Oblivion

227
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,871
Stop talking okay

228
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,967
If I were to do an epic if I were to cut a ton of Clips with this episode

229
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,503
So much of it would just be like

230
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,807
Oblivion spells out the globalist plans

231
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,903
It is a revolution it is a revelation of the Illuminati

232
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
And it's all because

233
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,231
He gets the bad guy well I want to talk to you

234
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:52,095
Okay that's that's what I was wondering have that issue

235
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,167
I'm not super interested in how the image on the cover of his

236
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,959
October 2012 magazine

237
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,751
Some similarities with the pyramid or the

238
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,543
The tat in Oblivion

239
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,591
There are some similarities but they're also

240
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,615
Some differences

241
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,199
One before minute Bolivian is not really a pyramid

242
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,759
It does have a triangular shape but then go out to

243
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,063
Also it's upside down

244
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
If you're trying to make it look like pyramids there's

245
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
I don't really give a s*** about

246
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
Here's why

247
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,231
If you look at that cover of Alex

248
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,279
2012 October magazine

249
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,095
You'll see a black pyramid with a red eye

250
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,399
If that's what you want to call it looks like

251
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,983
The pyramid in Oblivion also had a red-eye though the placement is dif

252
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
But this Stylistics.

253
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
Kind of secondary to the Mets

254
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
I know for a fact

255
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:40,991
The image on the cover of Alex's magazine is just a Photoshop of Hal from 2001 A Space Odyssey

256
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:48,927
I could say that with from his imagination with a hundred percent certainty

257
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
And here's how I know

258
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,255
On that cover the eye has the same

259
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,047
Three white lines on the top

260
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,119
Undercover Valley reflections

261
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,703
The lights

262
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,335
Deep truth or Vision when he designed that magazine cover you just stealing ship from 2001 A Space Odyssey

263
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:12,735
You can run around pretending that he has his prophetic Visions all he wants but the reality is that he's just seen a number of sci-fi movies

264
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
Thinks they're real

265
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,343
The makers of Oblivion probably added some sort of aesthetic touches

266
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
Bno Mars

267
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
2001

268
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
Alex

269
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,487
Too far gone to understand that

270
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,047
Original by Soros

271
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
I got you

272
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,655
So you spent a long time on this episode about

273
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
And I'd have

274
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,727
0 it's not as funny

275
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
He is his

276
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
Watch

277
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
Ton of clips

278
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,895
But it does definitely shade

279
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
His mental state

280
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
Okay on this site April 20

281
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Museums

282
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,063
Borderline obsessed with this movie

283
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,111
I really feel like

284
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
Just yesterday

285
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:56,767
He was crying about having defeated the globalist

286
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,583
Conspiracy theory that if he had uncovered

287
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:04,447
Then he did uncover the great autumn

288
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
That you never liked the drumbeat has

289
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Have to go on until

290
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
Fired

291
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,103
Tom Cruise movie alright

292
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
Okay well then there we go

293
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
That takes up

294
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,943
A lot of his attention

295
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Yeah

296
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,319
So he starts getting into talking about

297
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
So how you got a

298
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Got to live

299
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,255
Globalist want to destroy you

300
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
I think he ends up saying something really Danger

301
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,247
Because

302
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,183
The fluoride the chemicals in the water

303
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,399
Go get drunk if you want to

304
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,239
Prozac type drugs

305
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:15,103
What I would say

306
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
When's art bats

307
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,663
Suggestions and I'll go climbing Hill

308
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,711
I have a dream two friends

309
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
Suggestions when when it's

310
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:27,647
In opposition to write taking care of your mental health I think that's where you get pretty dangerous

311
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:34,047
Children psychiatrist why not just live like Tom Sawyer that he wasn't depressed that was a good time

312
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:40,191
A great time tricking people into whitewashing things looking that guy has a little bit dangerous

313
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,311
Psychiatrist

314
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,103
You know what you can take Prozac

315
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,175
I recommend

316
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,199
That's great

317
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
Seems like an Alex Jones

318
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,575
School of Psychology is not subscribed to

319
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
But you know like

320
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
He

321
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
Is the pillar

322
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
Of Mental Health

323
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:07,327
Like he is the image of what a well-adjusted person

324
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,351
Would look like

325
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,887
Right

326
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
Right

327
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:16,543
2001 Space Odyssey you believe

328
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,615
Magazine cover or they're both

329
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
Handling the globalist

330
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,223
Guy is saying you got it all

331
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,039
Yeah and I think his sanity is really on full.

332
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
Display in this next

333
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,743
Swimming in the toilet

334
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:45,471
I'll get you and your little dog

335
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:52,895
Your real powerful all you evil people

336
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
Will crush you for the Innocents

337
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,311
Doesn't sound like

338
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
Make sure you know that

339
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:44,095
So I'm not entirely sure what story Alex is talking about with the fetus in a toilet but I know I've heard him refer to it in passing

340
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,119
Multiple times

341
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,679
It's very hard to trace down exactly

342
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,983
What he's talking about since he's so vague

343
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,335
Probably a real story that he's talking about

344
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,127
But I can't credibly tell you exact

345
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
What it is

346
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:01,759
But I imagine that there's a good chance that it's just some sort of a disingenuous

347
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
Auntie abortion

348
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
I would assume

349
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,879
I think fetus in a toilet sounds more like a ween

350
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,183
Could be

351
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,743
But when you try to find out what story this could be

352
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,535
And like what I did is I went through

353
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,071
Through Google results with B

354
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:21,471
The end date being when this episode came out

355
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,775
Stories about people like Miss

356
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
Miscarriages

357
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,823
Don't in anyways

358
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
Support the narrative Alex

359
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Trying to sell here

360
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,175
The rest of the stories I could find mostly head

361
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,199
To do with high schoolers

362
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,503
Like people who gave birth

363
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,111
In a toilet at their school the horrifying story

364
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,903
Even really get into

365
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,975
But these are the very people like these high schoolers

366
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
Who are in the most need

367
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,047
A better reproductive Health Service

368
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,887
If Alex is truly concerned about these kinds of stories that he's yelling about

369
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,423
The answer is greater access

370
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,495
The things I planned parenthood not yelling at people about the devil

371
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,567
I don't know also

372
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
Small point

373
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,175
Alex just went on that rant about taking no pleasure in killing people in all of that

374
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
Which is par for the course for him

375
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,991
But let's be clear about this

376
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:10,623
What prompted that rant is comment his own fans made on his videos and articles

377
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
These

378
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
Aren't the globalist

379
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,951
He's mad at the globalist

380
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
Start the abyss

381
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,511
His audience is

382
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,071
Accidentally

383
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,703
Post this video that says this article about 2

384
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,007
And his audience

385
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:31,615
Bunch of shity things

386
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
It's very strange

387
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
That's no good

388
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:39,551
So Alex gets from here jumps into

389
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
Tim Gunn fear

390
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,159
Cuz it wouldn't be a full day on his show where they're not too

391
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,439
To be gunfire

392
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,631
California

393
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:58,495
24 million

394
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,527
California

395
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,976
Oh man

396
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,304
Did you catch that he said illegally own butt

397
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,608
Like even he would be fine with

398
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:29,216
People who illegally own things having that being like should be

399
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,008
Stop using a legally own

400
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:35,104
That bill is exclusively and entirely by people have gone to or not legal

401
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,944
He says 40,000 guns that figure comes

402
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,224
From the bill where it says quote

403
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,320
There are currently more than 20,000 armed prohibited persons in California

404
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:48,928
Collectively these individuals are believed to be in possession of a 39000 handgun

405
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,976
And 1670 assault weapon

406
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,792
The bill has nothing to do with door-to-door con

407
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816
Location of guns

408
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,840
Billions

409
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,912
It's about providing funding to improve the armed prohibit

410
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:05,056
Which is online database that gun dealers are supposed to cross reference when people are trying to buy firearms

411
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,384
Large part of it had to do with updating

412
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,016
Things so people who bought guns when they were legally allowed to buy them but then lost

413
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,856
Their right to own a gun because of a violent crime or something like that

414
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,904
I bet big sister would pick those

415
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,672
People op

416
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:24,000
And maybe that would end up involving a confiscation

417
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,024
But to be fair

418
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,912
Literally the only thing is Bill deals with his increasing

419
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,680
The state's ability

420
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
Enforce the laws that are already

421
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,288
If you disagree that people who've

422
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:40,640
Let's say committed a violent crime in the past shouldn't be allowed to own an assault weapon

423
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,920
We should make that argument

424
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,968
That's the argument Alex should be making

425
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,016
But I suspect he knows that he doesn't have the

426
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
To pull that off

427
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,600
It's super difficult to go on errands say

428
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm opposed to this bill because I think the people who committed armed robberies or shot people in the pasture be totally free to possess gun

429
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
Change the Arctic

430
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:02,656
Alex creates a straw man this is about legal gun owners really trying to create the impression that that's what this is

431
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,728
Is about being targeted by the evil state for guncon

432
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
That's easier to sell

433
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,080
This is the trick that's how it's carried out

434
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:14,176
Alexis Roderick much more marketable and people buy into it cuz they don't want

435
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,968
Legal gun owners having their guns

436
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,992
But in reality

437
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
Doing this

438
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,552
Supporting violent felons having

439
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
Access to guns

440
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,600
Agates

441
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,624
I don't know

442
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,160
Easy even can't

443
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,720
Handle telling the story the way he means

444
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,536
Illegal guns

445
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,608
In the in the copy that he's ready to

446
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,656
I mean I think that

447
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,680
The murderer should be at

448
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,592
So we can be confident that

449
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
That somebody who has murdered in

450
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,176
In the past will use that gun only for Wrecker

451
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:46,944
Creational Purp

452
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,016
From here on out if you want to make that argument

453
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,600
And then someone would probably disagree with you and then

454
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:57,696
You know whatever was the best ideal went out in the marketplace of ideas

455
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
I don't like that

456
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,280
Because my ID is going to lose

457
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,328
Said yeah whenever you

458
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,144
It's just all disingenuous framing

459
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
That's all it's going

460
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,240
You should not

461
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:18,688
It cuz it doesn't even matter that he says illegally everybody who's listening is going to be like oh illegally is just their slippery

462
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:23,296
Slope argument

463
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,088
If need be it'll come to

464
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,744
It'll just be presented as if the story was about they're going to come door-to-door take all of your gun

465
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,024
Everybody's gone

466
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:39,680
What even like he's slipped up he didn't mean to say illegal down

467
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,496
About the story it's not in the context of

468
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,568
People who are not legally allowed to have guns

469
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:51,200
Law Abiding Citizen every one of you

470
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,736
Every single one of you

471
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,784
So Alex is trying to go

472
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
Get some news are

473
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,856
Besides he's going to Google

474
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,392
Little article

475
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,696
And well

476
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,024
It is this this this was a little upset

477
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,984
Americans

478
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:24,480
This is still not working is still not typing

479
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,720
Computer

480
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,304
I just

481
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,448
This is

482
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,776
Real childish

483
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,944
I'm having trouble with my computer so I break it to force people to talk

484
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,088
You need to go outside you need to go on a hell unit maybe have a drink that's better than Prozac or

485
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,648
You could smash this s*** out of your

486
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
Computer every time

487
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,744
Because as a minor function problems

488
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,536
He reads his typing

489
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,560
Like a f******

490
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,840
About somebody who

491
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
Can't re-up

492
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,264
Doing a improv scene about hunting packs

493
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,800
Is it a typo

494
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,080
I want to see

495
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
6

496
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
Dogs

497
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,664
Play

498
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,688
With

499
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Lion

500
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:33,344
Quick all dammit I gotta break this whole f****** computer.

501
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,136
This is working the way I wanted it to

502
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,488
Ridiculous

503
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,280
Ridiculous that's it that's his problem

504
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
Wow

505
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:46,144
So there's no guests on this episode Alex is on his own

506
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,448
Just letting it all hang out

507
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,800
So he's got to take some calls he's got to open lines this thing

508
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:58,688
And he gets a call from a guy who wants to tell him about how Alex's taught him how to

509
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,456
Experience

510
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
The world

511
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:12,768
Encouraged

512
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,912
Information

513
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,960
It's become your formation

514
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,592
Freedom of Information in my mind

515
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,304
So close to a brain boost

516
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,584
Ditto

517
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,680
I don't know I could very easily be a real tall

518
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:58,080
You've taught me how to build a web of information in my mind that's all they call Alex's done like

519
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,384
Especially particularly in this

520
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,688
Post Boston bombing

521
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
Scratch that we've been in

522
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,504
All he's been doing is make

523
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,344
Whatever he feels like

524
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,368
Could be true

525
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:16,768
He just writes a story about it is true there is nothing supporting

526
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,816
He is ninety-nine percent of the time it is

527
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:23,168
Except that 1% that is always actually

528
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:29,568
True but 99% of the time it would have been for you learned on our last episode that Alex believes there's an objective real

529
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,128
So that is going to be a problem

530
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,176
R-Truth

531
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:37,248
You know he has this behavior that he is just

532
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
Do to your body

533
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,576
Is I'm going to make f****** s*** out

534
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,392
Area authority to bleed very confidently

535
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,952
I'm at so that behavior is mirrored by zombies

536
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,488
Freeze them up to make webs

537
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,024
Nevermind of infer

538
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,792
Information at

539
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,096
Might link here might link here

540
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,376
Of course not

541
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,424
Like it's bad what he's doing

542
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,752
It's really bad to imagine that it sort of

543
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,544
Give carb lunch to anyone

544
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,592
Right

545
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,384
Alex is a bad singer

546
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,664
But I bet there are worse

547
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,456
100

548
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
100

549
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,528
Absol any of them in his audience

550
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,344
I mean just by virtue of him being

551
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,880
Somewhat constrained

552
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:18,208
On the radio

553
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,000
Thinking only goes so far

554
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,816
Where is if you're just somebody quiet and alone

555
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,144
Watching f****** Raging Bull on a loop

556
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,424
You're going to be in trouble

557
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,728
Well he's constrained by his own success

558
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:35,872
Right like he doesn't want to lose that money that is a built-in boundary

559
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,920
That's at least at this point

560
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,224
His career he has we can't go too far left

561
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
Cash Stop

562
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,016
So

563
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,552
Don't like his caller or some

564
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,160
Dakooters has a Blog they don't have those constraints

565
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
Lulu's now

566
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,976
Like I told you Alex

567
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,256
Super into Oblivion

568
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,560
Sandy talks about it through most of this

569
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,632
This episode there is not a lot going

570
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,192
Just a lot of Oblivion thought of Oblivion talk

571
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,728
Handsome weird caller

572
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,264
Kind of

573
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:07,872
It's very surreal it almost has nothing to do with the Boston Marathon

574
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,152
That's okay

575
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:09,920
I don't either

576
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,880
Is Robert

577
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:43,456
That's what I envisioned in my mind when I stole the picture of Hal from 2001 A Space Odyssey

578
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,040
Concrete

579
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:50,624
Analysis I can confidently say to you

580
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,672
Satan's real and he's a Black Pyramid

581
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,208
Duh

582
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,512
Alright used to come to this

583
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,816
Alright Alex

584
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,608
Congratulations

585
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,168
It just becomes so difficult like

586
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
Whatever

587
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,728
I have my quieter moments

588
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,264
Of reflection

589
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:11,104
They just become so hard for me to reconcile the fact that like some

590
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,128
People like

591
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,408
Think he knows any

592
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,200
I know it's bananas

593
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,992
It's so weird when he's rambling about

594
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,064
I'm just going to tell you Satan's real is Black Pyramid

595
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,880
Okay

596
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648
Then I'll trust you

597
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,928
When you say two pictures are

598
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
Yeah

599
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:26,976
Ridiculous

600
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,256
Give me sir we need to

601
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,024
You just get him at

602
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
Cruise movie ever

603
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,352
Nitro for the show and then we can

604
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:35,936
Can just hear his he's also conflicted about it so cuz he doesn't really like Tom Cruise

605
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,240
Because Tom Cruise Bentley used

606
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,008
Friends of Charlie

607
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,848
How much does an actually spell this out because pick it up

608
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,872
Apple contact

609
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:50,272
Tom Cruise tried to get your of the sheet to join Scientology wasn't to do it

610
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,552
Anyway

611
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,368
Really like Tom Cruise

612
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,904
So good

613
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,744
So good tomorrow it overcomes

614
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,768
The Tom Cruising

615
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,816
It's kind of the same thing that he went through an alley

616
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:06,656
Came out I remember hearing a couple episodes of that where he was

617
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:11,776
Really f***** up over it

618
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:18,176
He's a Sci-Fi nerd with a little bit of brain damage to also had some sort of

619
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,224
Inability to regulate writer

620
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,296
More or less

621
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,576
Ins and outs of

622
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
Another thing is

623
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:27,648
He didn't

624
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,416
Go to college

625
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,464
But you knows all about Recology

626
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,256
Now even

627
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,816
You particularly like in the president

628
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,840
Yeah you know

629
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,864
You know that they are all TJ

630
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,912
In-depth experience

631
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:44,288
World education

632
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,616
V

633
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,432
Virtuous

634
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:53,760
That does sound like

635
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,832
What is a robber baron

636
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:01,696
They are

637
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:19,360
You deserve it just like Kesha did you just to kill themselves

638
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,152
Political show

639
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,712
I don't I don't know if

640
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,992
Everybody

641
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,272
Secondary education

642
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,064
Talk to a human

643
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,344
Things are ugly and bad

644
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,648
Was that in your orientation

645
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,440
Did you have to take a 101 class

646
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
I did Skip Orient

647
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:41,632
Freshman orientation hung out in the kiddie pool

648
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,656
In the backyard

649
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,680
0

650
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:50,080
Bunch of assholes that's why you don't believe in population

651
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:56,480
Ice cream Gathering know each other

652
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,808
I don't know I took a pretty broad spectrum of classes

653
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
Anyone

654
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,672
Of them was telling me that Youmans

655
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,952
Their evil but then again

656
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,976
And it's years ago

657
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,512
Maybe curriculum

658
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,536
Change

659
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:14,912
That is true who knows what they're dealing with right now they're probably I don't know

660
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:18,240
Learning about climate change this just seems like somebody who wants

661
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,288
Too aggressively

662
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
Dismiss

663
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
And invalidate

664
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,640
Scholarships

665
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,224
They say they're smart but they're all secretly

666
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,296
By virtue of me Hinds Community College

667
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,088
I know no consequences

668
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:36,672
Play that everybody who gets a secondary education is evil

669
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,488
So

670
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,304
That right after the Marathon bombing

671
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,864
There was no reports of

672
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,888
The ricin letters

673
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,168
I got sent to prison

674
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:52,800
And as we know from discussing it it was originally believed to be an Elvis

675
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:56,384
Resonator setup

676
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,176
Buy arrival

677
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:02,528
A conspiracy theory rival literally one of the craziest stories I've ever heard

678
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:08,416
Story is unfolding in real-time and our first suspect

679
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,232
The Elvis impersonator is now being released

680
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:14,560
Rightly because the police realized this isn't their guy

681
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,584
Alex

682
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,608
Now believes that he

683
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,632
He predicted this

684
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,400
As well

685
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:31,200
Of course

686
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,024
They don't say the guy gets up getting arrested

687
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,328
Tried

688
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:53,984
Just worked out no patches no Patxi's got killed

689
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,008
See bodies

690
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,776
Federer match

691
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
Yeah

692
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,384
Seem to ever really very realized

693
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,408
Must

694
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:06,272
So this is just like circumstance again playing into Alex's

695
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,552
Perception

696
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:11,392
Yeah you know this guy was passing set up it was all

697
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,416
The fake

698
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
He was

699
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,000
He what's that up he was a patsy

700
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:19,584
We have a

701
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
Actual Panther

702
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,168
But it wasn't from the government it was fun

703
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,960
From crazy person

704
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:31,360
It was from a guy that you pissed off cuz he didn't believe in his

705
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:35,456
Guy who Bears so many suspicious resemblance is 2al

706
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,224
Exhume self

707
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,528
Wish you would wrestle with that ass

708
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,136
Janet Napolitano,

709
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,672
About

710
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,976
About the budget of

711
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,512
Mvhs

712
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,304
But another thing

713
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
Is there is

714
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,352
Immigration

715
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,400
Being discussed in Congress

716
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,192
And she is out

717
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
Support of this

718
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,752
And I Alex

719
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,064
Future

720
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,328
Our world over the very worst people

721
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,912
Immigration importance

722
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:30,240
800

723
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:49,184
And if you actually download

724
00:37:56,352 --> 00:38:02,496
So the first problem with this clip is that I'm certain that Politico didn't write a straight news article that said added emigrate

725
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:08,896
Denaturalization would give Democrats Perpetual control of everything I'm not sure that

726
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,456
Will you political does at that end with most

727
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:15,040
Not something a serious person would really suggest

728
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:21,440
What does sound exactly like the kind of thing a propagandist like Alex would say people were saying in order to create fear in his audience

729
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,464
It does sound like that

730
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:26,048
Secondly even if that were true Alex's expressing

731
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,608
Exactly the same idea here

732
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:33,728
He's the crying with the Dems in the globalist want to bring a group of people who would vote in the way they want

733
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,520
Wow at the same time he sang that

734
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:39,616
The influx of people wouldn't be a problem if they had similar political ideas to his

735
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,152
Couches

736
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:44,992
Right-wing extremism by just calling it believing in the Bill of Rights and Constitution

737
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:48,064
That doesn't change what he actually supports

738
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,464
It's all these people voted the same way and believe the same sort of right-wing bulshit that I do wouldn't be a problem for immigrants to come in

739
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,744
Simple right

740
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:00,096
This is all I mean really get down to it it's all just demographic

741
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,400
Same sort of things a year from lightning

742
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,704
But it's been presented so disc

743
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,472
Ingenuous

744
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,264
That's all that's all that I can really

745
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,176
I don't know I don't know what to tell you about

746
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,224
The more demographics

747
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,504
Arguments

748
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,296
But there are the more

749
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,112
If you say the word demographic

750
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,416
Intubate

751
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,464
Your you've revealed exact

752
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
What your issue

753
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,280
Use the word

754
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,560
Do I know

755
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:34,144
That's when the word comes up

756
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,912
Only

757
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:35,936
So

758
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:36,960
Look

759
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,520
The most of this episode has nothing to do with boss

760
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:40,800
Alex.

761
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,592
Complain that they're under martial law

762
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:46,944
And then also brings up the people being

763
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,224
Having a home search

764
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,504
Once again we talked about on the lights.

765
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,576
Episode like he brings those up as little touch

766
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,624
Occasionally but that's really good

767
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,904
Get into a whole lot of

768
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,440
The only real

769
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,256
Kind of substance that I found that had to do with Boston is when

770
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,048
Caller brings up johar

771
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
And his back

772
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:11,264
Hey you guys

773
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:16,640
Did you look at the two pictures of Boston bombing suspects

774
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,968
Ottoman has a green backpack backpack

775
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,272
The backpack with the bombing it was black

776
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:37,376
I was just completely making up the both of bombs were in Black backpacks type that means just making

777
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,936
I like I like to call her

778
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
Giving us some

779
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:41,984
McAdoo news

780
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:52,480
So Alex is getting like he's doing some

781
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,504
Actually

782
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,064
The omni's

783
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,088
Pressure cookers

784
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,624
That was supposed to be in these back

785
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,952
And by research I mean he's trying to put a press

786
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:08,352
Cooker into a backpack that's kind of what I thought but I thought that was too stupid behind the scenes and

787
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,144
Don't know. It right now

788
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:21,664
You must acquit

789
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:26,272
Okay my right be the reference toronto-based

790
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:30,368
Situations

791
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,440
Clearly didn't

792
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:39,072
This is the clearest articulation yet of Alex explicitly trying to claim that the Tsarnaev brothers are in

793
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,608
Which is pretty f***** up

794
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,912
But at this point the case had gone to court

795
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,728
So it's totally understandable to be reluctant to jump to can

796
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,496
Conclusion

797
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,544
What to argue in phatic Lee for his innocence

798
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:49,568
Is a little bit straight

799
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,872
Alex was the only one engaging

800
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:52,895
Sort of behavior

801
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,967
According to an April 22nd article in wired

802
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,503
The whole community of Zohar

803
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,551
Supporters had popped up on social media

804
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,831
Pushing the hashtag

805
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,855
Free johar

806
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:06,463
People are posting all sorts of bulshit from your normal false-flag stuff all the way to in

807
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,487
The victims

808
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,279
Must have been fake because they didn't

809
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,815
You feel that there was enough blood around

810
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
There it is

811
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,631
A not-insignificant number these are

812
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:17,727
We're citing Infowars articles to help support their claims that johar was innocent

813
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:18,751
It should be released

814
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,311
Now in 2019

815
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,871
It's hard to look at that and not wonder if it was order

816
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:28,991
The way we've seen social media be manipulated particularly around hot-button issues and

817
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:29,759
Divisive event

818
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,039
Kind of makes me weary

819
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,599
I have little enough faith

820
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:36,159
Conspiracy socks that I could definitely believe this kind of

821
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:39,487
Campaign was well within the repertoire it could be a thing that they would do

822
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,535
I deal with it

823
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,327
Yeah that's not to say that I think

824
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,911
There's like a possibility of foreign meddling or

825
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,215
You know there's ways that people could games

826
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,751
Social media in ways that week

827
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,775
Realize

828
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,823
Maybe

829
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:00,223
Some people probably realize but we weren't super aware of

830
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,783
Being at least

831
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,807
Tested in

832
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,647
Shirt so it's entirely possible that that is

833
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
And outside

834
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:15,071
Situation

835
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:19,679
Come to bucket with strategies of social media manipulation and

836
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,959
Vacacionar thing

837
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:27,359
Things that people could have stumbled upon in conspiracy worlds like somebody might have figured out a good way to

838
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,127
Pusha hash

839
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,663
We have a bunch of

840
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,991
Connected accounts whatever all pushing it out

841
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:36,063
There is something here that could be very nice

842
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,647
All of that sort social media manipulation

843
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,439
And when I think back to Alex's

844
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,487
Earlier career he was doing a lot of

845
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,303
Not necessarily that I'm aware of.

846
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,839
Commedia but what if

847
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,863
Used to do

848
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,399
Was he would do Google Bob

849
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,447
Where he would tell all of his audience

850
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,215
To Google

851
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,239
Specific phrase

852
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:57,311
In order to make it rise up in the Google Trends

853
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,591
Dude show up in

854
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,871
Suggested searches

855
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:02,175
Like like false flag

856
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,455
That sort of thing

857
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,223
Yeah

858
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,039
I'm just I wonder I have nothing to base this

859
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,575
I can't prove it

860
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,135
But I do wonder about the organic

861
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,671
Of

862
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,951
That's sort of

863
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,231
Yeah

864
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,279
Only possibly organic

865
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:21,119
That is also the type of thing babe

866
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,167
They would do but

867
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,471
Now in retrospect with all the

868
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:26,751
I have about how the

869
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,519
The algorithm has

870
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,543
Exploited

871
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,567
Time and

872
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,359
How we weren't really paying attention

873
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,639
It is hard to look at

874
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,407
So many of the

875
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,455
Situations

876
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:39,295
Astronaut at least suspect ocean with that whenever it first

877
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,855
Weirdest ugly Hatter the light

878
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,879
Like you know or the

879
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,159
The Tea Party being asked

880
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,231
Kind of

881
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,535
Orchestrated media attack on

882
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,839
His is very similar

883
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,727
It's hard it's hard to know and I know that's kind of one of the reason

884
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
Discount

885
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,287
Whole Lotta social media

886
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,615
I think it's not worth really getting to

887
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,151
Up in arms about a lot of

888
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
Kind of thing

889
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,527
I'm curious I don't know what I don't know

890
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,319
What's going on

891
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,855
But

892
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,647
This caller that Alex is talking

893
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,439
We find out a little bit more

894
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,511
And it makes this interaction

895
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
Completely honest

896
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,351
Listen to almost every day and

897
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,399
14 years old

898
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:29,983
People

899
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,287
Annoying Orange

900
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,383
People

901
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,967
Now you probably have so many

902
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:43,295
People that hate you or make fun of you or call you crazy

903
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,839
Suspension for weapons

904
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:02,239
So this story is a little bit of a middle ground case for me

905
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:07,359
Is about a guy named Doug Bartlett who got suspended from his teaching job for bringing gardening tools

906
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,639
The school to show his students

907
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:10,943
I'm so and after you got tired excited

908
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:13,503
Got fired when you got suspended

909
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,527
The school

910
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,087
Is that punishment to the suspension a little bit

911
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:17,855
Excessive

912
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:18,879
Possibly

913
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:23,743
But also these are Sharp Tools that could definitely hurt somebody and it was a second grade class

914
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,535
You look like eight year old kids

915
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,351
Sensitive Sharp

916
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,887
Right you can't even have

917
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:36,287
The way the right-wing media presented the story with the Bartlett just brought a screwdriver in a wrench

918
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,567
The kids about gardening

919
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,359
But the reality is a little bit different

920
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,895
He also brought in a box

921
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,919
Cutter and a pocket

922
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:45,247
6 chainsaws that he also began to juggle

923
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:48,319
The flame unsafe working environment

924
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,647
The school review board found that while the discussion of

925
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,927
Tools is part of the proper

926
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,487
Curriculum he was a little bit outside of

927
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,255
Consider appropriate

928
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,583
The right-wing media also said that the screwdriver and wrench

929
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,351
We're kept in a lock

930
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,375
Box out of the Rita

931
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:04,191
To the students but this is directly contradicted by the findings

932
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,215
Came out when the case

933
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,007
In 2014

934
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,567
From the Cook County record quote

935
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,359
The imposition of a four-day suspension

936
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,151
For leaving such Tools in a place

937
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,687
Accessible to second grade students

938
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,223
Was within the discretion

939
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,247
School

940
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,063
These situations are always

941
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,087
Literally

942
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,647
Always more complicated than the way Alex

943
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,975
He wants cut-and-dry social crisis issues

944
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,743
Giselle

945
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:28,767
Nuance

946
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,559
He wants them to think that this globalist

947
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,631
I'm so out of control when in reality if you look at the Expo

948
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,399
Details of the case

949
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,167
Kind of makes

950
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,191
Play this guy might get to

951
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,215
Suspended for a few days

952
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,031
It's bad enough that Alex does this stuff

953
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:40,799
Generally

954
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:43,871
But to consider that he does this while talking to a fourteen-year-old

955
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,639
Child

956
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,431
Who listens to his show everyday

957
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,455
Is monster

958
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,735
Yeah that is

959
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,527
So inappropriate

960
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,295
Especially

961
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,319
Cicadas Clearlake

962
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
Expressing

963
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,111
Feelings of

964
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:56,415
Isolation and loneliness in rather than

965
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:00,511
Hey you know what you should still try and connect with people Alex

966
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:03,839
Everyone you know is lying there all crazy

967
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,119
No he went the kids

968
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:11,007
Pressing is I express the ideas that I learned from you and people think that I'm crazy because of it

969
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,799
I don't know they are crazy

970
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:13,823
That's

971
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,615
Abused I am yeah

972
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:20,479
Act like that you can't act like that you can come live with me

973
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:24,063
I can't accept that Alex takes calls from minors.

974
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:28,159
Inappropriate you should not be talkative

975
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,975
It's a family it is not a family

976
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,743
I think

977
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:36,863
I always talked about how you don't scream because you start Street screen your calls

978
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:42,751
About how you're not going to take joy in it but you're going to kill all these people or

979
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:46,079
All evil in the Devil is a Black Pyramid

980
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,663
Don't talk to kid he is he is

981
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,455
Definitely looking into the abyss right

982
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,247
Google

983
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:58,879
And it gets worse I mean as the call goes on this I think that it's fair to say that this call or this

984
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,415
Next clip of the call

985
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,183
Is Alex

986
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,463
Bucking with this kids

987
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,519
I don't understand

988
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,311
Rafael

989
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,591
Our Generation

990
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,295
Whose religion

991
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:32,159
Kids late like 14 year olds can't deal with this stuff

992
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:38,815
I mean I'm not trying to infantilize teenagers or anything but what Alex is talking about he's outside of the

993
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,583
The range

994
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,399
I might bake a 14 year old is not equipped

995
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,703
To deal with that being true or not

996
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,239
Use impressionable

997
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,775
You looks up to Alex

998
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,799
Steering

999
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,591
Come down a very f*****-up hat

1000
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:53,151
Call Alex I'm at lunch I'm going to take this

1001
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,687
Listen to biology next

1002
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,711
Superior

1003
00:49:55,967 --> 00:50:00,063
And he's going to be talking about to f****** Gregor Mendel and I'm going to be like

1004
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,415
Have you considered whether or not the overlords are dedicated eugenicist

1005
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,439
Discus

1006
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,511
Not good

1007
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:12,863
Open wrestle with like what is the worst

1008
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,887
Behavior I've ever seen

1009
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,191
Tough

1010
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,775
That's like asking what's the Worst Behavior I've ever seen

1011
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,103
There's so many things

1012
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,383
The denial of people

1013
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,943
Personal tragedies be

1014
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,991
The calls for harassment

1015
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,783
That are very clear if not

1016
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,807
Literal

1017
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,879
Do certain things too terrible.

1018
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:38,463
Profiting off denial of people's try to do right

1019
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,279
Why is the

1020
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,607
All really bad but in the running is definitely like

1021
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,935
Detroit children's braids

1022
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:52,799
Person who's under deepen 16 who I've heard call into Alex behaves this way to

1023
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:58,175
As I recall there's a twelve-year-old I've heard

1024
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,455
And like that you

1025
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:02,271
That is a level with inappropriate that I can

1026
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,295
Adult

1027
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:09,695
Yeah he's an adult he have kids your parents didn't even allow you to watch f****** late night TV

1028
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:13,791
What is this kid's parents do and let them listen to Alex Jones

1029
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,815
I don't know

1030
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,863
My parents were over Lisa

1031
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,631
Censorious

1032
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,911
Very much

1033
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,191
Controlling on a level that

1034
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,263
I could deal with a little bit less of that

1035
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,615
My youth but if the goal is to keep me away from

1036
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:30,431
Stuff like this

1037
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:33,247
A good motivation

1038
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,623
So another call

1039
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,903
And it's a

1040
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,671
The caller

1041
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,439
Who

1042
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:45,535
I don't know I don't know if this caller is an idiot but Alex isn't really

1043
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:58,591
Do me a favor

1044
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:05,247
I've been awake since 1 Seawinds George Bush

1045
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,015
Junior

1046
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:14,207
I got to wake when he wouldn't close the borders down when he's

1047
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,767
The guy wouldn't close the border is going to be like

1048
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,839
Okay there supposed

1049
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:25,471
You won't close our borders

1050
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:39,807
What a great prediction

1051
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:43,903
Mass sacrifice of children coming soon

1052
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,183
There's a 40

1053
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:45,951
13 year old

1054
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,743
Yeah yeah Alex

1055
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:51,839
Great so we got another caller here who thinks the Hunger Games

1056
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,375
Real which makes sense

1057
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:57,471
That's because he's listening to Alex's believes that every thought the movie Inferno

1058
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:00,287
But also with the movie Hunger Games

1059
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:04,639
Timmy that's a movie that's just showing where they want the us to go

1060
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:24,351
Population

1061
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:28,447
You have to be to think the gladiatorial games would do anything to impact

1062
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:31,263
Population

1063
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:37,663
That was really cut it really take us down one at a time I guess

1064
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:44,063
The least efficient sisterlook lowest could ever come up with how many battles can we have in a day with the

1065
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,087
Gladiatorial games

1066
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:51,743
Let's say we have a hero to one-on-one matches in a couple battle royale's we get rid of 400a day

1067
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,511
Hey Dad bye

1068
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,815
2025r free

1069
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,607
No no f******

1070
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:59,167
Wave Glider toriel Games

1071
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:02,239
Solution to overpopulation

1072
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:05,567
Ridiculous

1073
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:08,383
I would prefer a future where Battle Royale is real

1074
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,407
Supposed to

1075
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,711
That's my flavor of

1076
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:16,319
Murder each other I would rather neither thank God they're both pictures

1077
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,623
You're quite oblivious

1078
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,647
That is true

1079
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:22,975
So Alex is now f***** with his fourteen-year-olds mine

1080
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:27,583
You said there's going to be a Mass child sacrifices in the very near future

1081
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:32,447
The globalist want to bring back gladiatorial games in order to reduce population

1082
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,751
So this is a good summation

1083
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:37,567
This is a good summation of what he's trying to do on his show

1084
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:48,831
What's happening what's going on

1085
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,903
Massdrop sacrifices

1086
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:58,303
For the globalist to worship the giant Black Pyramid that is

1087
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,887
This is such a stupid show

1088
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,935
I got it

1089
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:07,007
I'm really struggling to remember that

1090
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,031
Yesterday

1091
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:11,871
Not. Like this is a week in the past and we've all kind of move.

1092
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,943
The 24-hour news cycle and whatnot

1093
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:21,343
This is yesterday that he was saying that full-on martial law was being declared

1094
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,135
But everybody in Boston was

1095
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,695
Held inside so they could

1096
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,231
Hundreds of fake

1097
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:27,999
Patsy

1098
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,303
And then the next Aries just like

1099
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,327
Man

1100
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,143
Go to take some calls your 14 the f*** you up

1101
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,423
What is this

1102
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,959
Can't do that

1103
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:42,079
It didn't say anything and that's what I mean this is a lesson that we keep learning over and over again that is like

1104
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:45,663
You just never know what he's going to do you have

1105
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,967
Spectations you know his patterns you know like

1106
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,247
But one of his patterns

1107
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:54,879
Predictability go watch Oblivion yet really f***** up the night before

1108
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,415
Really freaked out about it

1109
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,975
And then come in

1110
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,255
Disaster

1111
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,047
That's probably

1112
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,327
Really really good

1113
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,959
That's really good evidence for why he knows he's full of s***

1114
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:11,775
Because if you actually were

1115
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:17,151
On the greatest story in history of a major United States city being

1116
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,199
Put under martial law

1117
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,223
People being murdered

1118
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:21,247
You would

1119
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,295
Doggett Lake Houston pursue it

1120
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,855
Daily

1121
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:28,415
For your request

1122
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:34,047
This would never go away what don't you understand about it in-depth investigation tried to put a pressure cooker in a backpack

1123
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:40,447
What don't you understand that's right I forgot I forgot going

1124
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:43,263
Exactly I forgot that he was feeling better

1125
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,543
I apologize

1126
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:49,663
So he talks about Oblivion talk about these authors of the movie

1127
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:51,711
The guy wrote the graphic novel

1128
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,271
Person who adapted at these people are like

1129
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:58,111
Opposing parts of the Illuminati in the globalist plan

1130
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:00,927
How many only has one other author you can really compare it to

1131
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:06,815
Nope

1132
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:54,687
Emergency

1133
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,063
14 year old

1134
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,815
About you and your children

1135
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,143
Because I just want

1136
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:20,543
If you do you find out that he doesn't

1137
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,847
Know what he's talking about

1138
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,383
Just bill Joyce article

1139
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:30,783
You don't realize the only thing that Alex took from that Bill Joy article

1140
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,807
Is a passage

1141
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,111
It's quoting the Unabomber

1142
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:37,183
Bill Joy hit put in the article

1143
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,463
Discussing

1144
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:44,863
F*****-up version views of the future that is all allocate knows about this article

1145
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:49,727
That's what Bill Joy heard at this convention in the Unabomber

1146
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,775
Okay so you go to this convention

1147
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,823
Do they read the notes from the pre

1148
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,871
This meeting or do they just open with

1149
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:56,895
Should we tell

1150
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,687
I've been doing Alex's presenting

1151
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:05,599
We get down to business decided we're going to kill everyone

1152
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,927
So exhausted

1153
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,975
If you if you really were right

1154
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:13,023
I doubt you would have to say I'm right

1155
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:13,791
Twice

1156
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:19,423
And your break down about like I can't be around people who don't share my delusions anymore

1157
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,983
Yeah I know I do

1158
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:24,031
People would be fine

1159
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,335
If you were right

1160
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,383
So Alex Oblivion

1161
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,687
Keep bringing this up

1162
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,711
Yeah

1163
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:34,015
If I find a little bit upsetting

1164
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,039
Because I think Alex

1165
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,599
Legitimately almost starts crying talking

1166
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:42,975
We are under attack

1167
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:53,983
That is just

1168
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,847
See something like Oblivion

1169
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:09,855
Different archetype message

1170
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,391
It was all positive

1171
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,695
It was about

1172
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:22,399
Children but also getting the genetics

1173
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,215
And

1174
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,287
System

1175
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,847
Versus

1176
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,639
And the soul

1177
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,687
And

1178
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,991
Compartmentalization

1179
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:39,039
Is used to control everybody

1180
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,511
Is just beyond insane

1181
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:56,447
Overriding responsibility

1182
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:01,311
I can hardly be around children

1183
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:05,407
Because they're so innocent they're so good

1184
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,967
It doesn't make me angry

1185
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:10,527
Show evil

1186
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,111
I just ate your hair clips like that

1187
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:15,647
Should

1188
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:19,999
I don't want to live in a society where people aren't allowed to

1189
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:26,399
See certain movies you're I think you're blaming the wrong side of the media here on this one

1190
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:30,495
I think you might be going the other direction I'm not saying Outlaw Oblivion

1191
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:31,519
I'm saying

1192
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:38,431
Football Alex rooms yeah yeah yeah I don't know how you do

1193
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,759
It's just not for Alice

1194
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:44,575
NFL NFL

1195
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,343
Yeah

1196
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:49,183
Can't tell the difference between fiction and reality you don't get to

1197
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:54,559
See dystopic Sci-Fi warning on those

1198
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:57,631
TV MA TV delusional just get the f*** out

1199
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,959
I find it so upsetting

1200
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:02,495
Pick it up

1201
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:04,543
I feel such a responsibility to

1202
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,567
Stop this

1203
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:09,663
Oblivion in my head

1204
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,455
Like when he was going through this whole thing I was

1205
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:19,135
Kind of want to do a Sci-Fi 24-hour marathon with Alex and just see what he believes and what he does it

1206
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:25,535
I don't want him to explain anything to me I want to watch his face if it's dystopian

1207
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,815
He believes of course

1208
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:27,583
If it's

1209
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:30,143
Not dystopia any probably

1210
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:33,983
It's ridiculous

1211
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,007
Liberals

1212
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:35,775
You know the rules

1213
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:36,543
I've heard of them

1214
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,311
They want to kill you

1215
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:40,895
That does sound like us they want to kill everyone

1216
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,687
But you are but if you

1217
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:45,503
You try to kill them. You

1218
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:46,783
Their total hypocrite

1219
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:09,567
Don't take a good analyst

1220
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:25,951
Kill yourself

1221
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:38,239
So frustrated by this

1222
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:41,567
Logic trap he keeps putting authoritarian liberals in

1223
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,871
And they have no way around it

1224
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,151
You think the human race is

1225
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:47,199
Is bad and ugly and you want to kill him

1226
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:51,551
Yeah well what if I tried to kill you you'd stop me right

1227
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:55,135
Bulletproof bulletproof Point proven

1228
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,439
F****** debate

1229
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:01,279
If you have you've decided that all of your enemies are trying

1230
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:03,071
To depopulate the planet

1231
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:09,727
Conversation becomes difficult because they're going to need to clarify that first premise in order to

1232
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:12,287
Go to any further conversation

1233
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:15,615
And you're not going to let him your dog

1234
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:18,431
Cuz if you say things like

1235
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:24,319
I would like to provide reproductive health care for people in developing countries

1236
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,343
Well no

1237
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,391
That's why you want to

1238
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,159
Kill me

1239
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:30,463
But then you don't

1240
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,999
I can't I got to go

1241
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:34,815
I got to go

1242
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:35,839
They don't even know what the

1243
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:36,607
To say is like

1244
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,887
Yeah yeah

1245
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,935
That's the correct response

1246
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,959
Because your argument

1247
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,727
Silly

1248
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,519
Not wear the hat hour

1249
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:47,103
Earlier when I was talking about this immigration

1250
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,407
Isabel there were shades of

1251
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,175
Get some

1252
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,199
Feelings that he he

1253
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:51,967
He has about

1254
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:53,503
Demographics

1255
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,527
And all that

1256
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,575
Didn't feel very comfortable

1257
01:04:56,831 --> 01:05:01,183
We talked about it a little bit more here in a way that I feel like it makes it a little

1258
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:38,815
So I mean it's tough to hear that I did not hear some

1259
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,095
Racial tingy

1260
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:46,495
Votes Republican but then you let him

1261
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:52,383
People who aren't white and don't vote Republican they believe anything take the Gringos sacrament

1262
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:55,711
For Latin American immigrants to take white people's guns

1263
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:57,503
That seems

1264
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,295
F***** up

1265
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,831
The idea that

1266
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,623
There's something like

1267
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:07,743
You're going to bring in people who don't know any who aren't used to Freedom is like a

1268
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:08,511
Is a reason.

1269
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,279
Keep people out

1270
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:12,095
They're not they're not used to they're not ready for free

1271
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:18,495
They're acclimated to like a halfway house where your little free but not all the way free

1272
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,519
Because if they're free

1273
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,799
Here when they're not used to it

1274
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,079
Who knows what they'll do

1275
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:25,151
It's it's strange his feelings are muddy

1276
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,431
To say that

1277
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,479
Put it as nicely as possible

1278
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,527
There's not a lot of clarity

1279
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,319
But it seems bad

1280
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:35,135
So what are these big complaints about

1281
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,183
Janet Napolitano

1282
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:37,951
And her

1283
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:41,791
Position on the immigration bill is that he insists she hasn't read it

1284
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,095
And he's basing this on

1285
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:46,911
Little bit of a Cuban a question-and-answer session

1286
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,191
Ted Cruz

1287
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,983
Who asked her who is not her

1288
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,519
No he is pretty ass

1289
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,311
Napolitano she's read the bill

1290
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,591
So here's Alex's

1291
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,615
Is Big gotcha MoMA

1292
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,967
Said no one

1293
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,391
Received

1294
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,671
The text to this bill

1295
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,975
At 2:25 a.m.

1296
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:12,767
On Wednesday

1297
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,791
April 17th 5 days

1298
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,775
It is dealing with a very complicated child

1299
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:26,847
And in my first question is it is

1300
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:28,895
When did did

1301
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,455
Did your office receive a copy of

1302
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,735
Dylan

1303
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,527
About 3

1304
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,063
That's about right

1305
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,879
In the five days since

1306
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,671
It's obviously been

1307
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,695
Heavily focused

1308
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,719
Don't matter such as

1309
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,767
The Boston bombing

1310
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,047
Imater such

1311
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:50,399
Have you had the time to read all 844

1312
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,167
Four pages of the bill

1313
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:56,031
Actually I have read the bill I know how many section

1314
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,567
What

1315
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:58,335
Also I was able to

1316
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:00,895
But I had

1317
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:01,663
Able to review the bill

1318
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,991
Has been

1319
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,527
A busy week

1320
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,831
Yes sir

1321
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:09,599
Very busy

1322
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:10,623
Oh yes

1323
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:27,263
So it's got your moment is Ted Cruz asking if she's read the Belgian I'm familiar with a lot of its was able to

1324
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:31,871
Husky Parts but yeah I'm familiar with the Bell liar

1325
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:34,943
What where's the festival

1326
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:41,343
That's not fair not fair that is rude

1327
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,879
I feel like I do

1328
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:46,207
You can't just blame clip of her being like

1329
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:50,559
Meijer

1330
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:53,887
You can prove that you didn't read it

1331
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:54,911
But let's say she asked

1332
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,703
7 inch

1333
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:59,263
In five days you think they couldn't

1334
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:01,823
Handle the responsibilities plus reading

1335
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:07,967
What's a 100 pages and giving a brief not just that but when she says I'm familiar with certain parts of it that's

1336
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,247
Is the Bill didn't just

1337
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:14,623
Written without her being asked about it at all at all 800 pages

1338
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:20,767
Materialized out of nowhere

1339
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,303
This is ridiculous

1340
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,839
Stupid so Alex has

1341
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:28,447
Complaints about Napolitano and this is the way it generally goes with

1342
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:30,751
Especially with women in power

1343
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:33,823
Thank you mr. Napolitano thank you for the

1344
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:40,223
Making fun of women that look like men

1345
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,135
This is

1346
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,183
Good this is good

1347
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:53,535
Analysis hard-hitting political analysis

1348
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:56,863
All women in government look like women who look like

1349
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,887
Yes that's

1350
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:04,799
Unzip their alien suits and they've got a

1351
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,359
Janet Reno

1352
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,151
Janet Napolitano look

1353
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,943
Underneath that me this is just particular

1354
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:11,967
This is

1355
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:12,991
He's so annoying

1356
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,783
Whenever whenever we

1357
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:15,551
Get back into

1358
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:18,367
If if Warren is the nominee weird

1359
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,183
They already are

1360
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:23,231
I know but just so

1361
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,047
Yep it's going to be rough

1362
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:29,119
Yep so they're probably

1363
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,655
Like people like nopales

1364
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,343
Different planet Pop-Tart

1365
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,935
This is reality-based Radio

1366
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:11,615
General politano is from outer space and she came here in an upside-down Black Pyramid that I

1367
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,151
Last night

1368
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:18,783
Fourteen-year-olds Willis

1369
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,623
So I was next up Alex does one of my

1370
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,391
Are favored by

1371
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:24,927
Of course

1372
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,463
Hope the founding

1373
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,679
Weird

1374
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,215
Thomas Jefferson

1375
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:40,287
Add reminder

1376
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:43,615
Except

1377
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:49,503
Not a Thomas Jefferson quote

1378
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:51,295
Your paraphrasing Frederick Douglass

1379
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:53,599
Ninety-nine percent of the time he is

1380
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:58,463
No 99% ninety-nine percent of the time you start he's either making something up

1381
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:04,095
Quoting a memory ride somewhere or somebody else's words he's attributed

1382
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,119
How do I honestly

1383
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:07,167
We don't know if I've ever heard him

1384
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,703
Use a Thomas Jefferson

1385
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,471
Quote correct

1386
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:13,567
So we got one last like real clip from

1387
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,359
It's Alex

1388
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,407
Bragging about being psychic

1389
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,687
Because this rice

1390
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,455
Suspect

1391
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,391
The poison

1392
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,351
I'm sorry go ahead

1393
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:39,167
No it's not a globalist

1394
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:42,751
Handbook it's an incredibly f*****-up bizarre situation

1395
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:46,335
Of a rivalry that got way out of control

1396
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:49,919
Just such a more interesting story than some sort of globalist plot

1397
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,199
It's ridiculous

1398
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:56,575
You can you can propagandize so many stories but when you get a dynamite story like that you have to do

1399
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,599
Just read it for bait

1400
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:59,135
Yeah but

1401
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,671
The Alex lot of that

1402
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:04,511
We're able to know now hasn't come out she doesn't have that information

1403
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:10,911
So he can write his own story about it a lot of the Boston bombing stuff in the days

1404
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,703
Immediately after it

1405
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:15,775
But when you do have the gift of hindsight you can look back

1406
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,823
To be like you f*** that story up

1407
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,615
Multiple times

1408
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,151
The perfect opportunity

1409
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:26,527
Make a correct say you're correcting yourself in order to do Cerita badass story

1410
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,295
Would be

1411
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:30,879
But I don't have to give up his mantle of the

1412
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,415
The prophet January

1413
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,951
Like I told you I was going to

1414
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:38,303
Now whenever that case probably goes to court

1415
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:40,863
Alex is going to just ignore it entirely

1416
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:45,215
And just let let it sit there as a

1417
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:45,983
Yeah

1418
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:51,359
This episode is pretty short comparative Lee got a big reason for that is

1419
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:52,383
It's so much

1420
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,151
About Oblivion

1421
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,175
And

1422
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:57,247
Is it love that it's a preview is not

1423
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:01,855
Compact you know like he doesn't give a like a fool like this is what I think of

1424
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,647
Seeing with the Drone

1425
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671
Bob

1426
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:06,975
No the other people in there the shipping

1427
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:07,999
The Clones

1428
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,303
Yorkie doesn't really get into

1429
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:13,631
Vague talking about how great the movie is

1430
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:15,679
And how it reveals the Illuminati

1431
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,959
I've never seen it have you seen

1432
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:17,727
No

1433
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:21,823
I don't give a s*** you didn't watch it in preparation for this

1434
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,871
I watch some clips

1435
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,967
Myself

1436
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:30,527
I think this is another thing much like childhood's end

1437
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:33,599
And all these other sci-fi things that Alex believes

1438
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,367
The real

1439
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:36,671
I just

1440
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:38,975
I wish I wish it was more interest

1441
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:40,767
Oblivion review

1442
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:44,863
Because I we could have played a bunch of clips of it

1443
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,887
Fun but it's the

1444
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,447
It's just I believe that this was

1445
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,239
Globalist

1446
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:52,543
That's no good

1447
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:55,103
I want an Oculus Syfy

1448
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,407
I wanted to review like

1449
01:14:57,663 --> 01:15:03,807
Gravity or some s*** like that where there's no like there's no secret alien plot or anything like that it's just

1450
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:09,439
S*** goes wrong in Space the movie I'm positive that if we go and find the release date of gravity

1451
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:11,743
He would have Johnny Longworth you

1452
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,559
Along flooring reviews

1453
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:18,911
Yeah I don't know I am this was a little bit of a disappointing

1454
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:19,679
Episode in some way

1455
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:20,703
But also

1456
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:25,567
Of his show time I think it it's so fascinating

1457
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:26,591
How

1458
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:27,615
Cindy's

1459
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:30,687
Sci-Fi movies

1460
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:36,063
Blows his mind in a way that is very adolescent

1461
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,111
Yeah very close

1462
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:42,975
Yeah it really did that almost crying

1463
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,999
It's not like he was

1464
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:47,839
Fighting it

1465
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:50,399
Crying that he would he would have tried to speak

1466
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,167
Through it with like a

1467
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:54,751
There would have been more perform

1468
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:55,519
Stupid

1469
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:59,871
Crying yeah it is subdued is not the type of

1470
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,895
Performance

1471
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,687
So he has this relation

1472
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:03,455
Kinship with

1473
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,223
These

1474
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,503
Media things that

1475
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:08,063
Like movies that I would describe is

1476
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:08,831
Pretty adolescent

1477
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:11,903
You see these movies and that there truth to you

1478
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,927
Even if they are

1479
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:18,047
Even if some of them do try to give like a allegorical or metaphorical

1480
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:21,119
Message about the real world

1481
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,399
You could watch The Matrix

1482
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:27,263
And Come Away with some life lesson nothing wrong with that

1483
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,311
Revealing secrets

1484
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,663
Anything you see with like a Steve

1485
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:36,223
He was talking about how this person in the

1486
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:41,855
Media was writing articles that were to talk to him

1487
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:44,159
This sort of bizarre thinking

1488
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,207
That I would describe as

1489
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,487
Bucked up

1490
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,767
I'm kind of childish

1491
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:49,791
Yeah and

1492
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:52,095
When you have that mixed with

1493
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,887
You get a fourteen-year-old collar

1494
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,679
And you're just f****** with that kid

1495
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:56,959
Like

1496
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:03,103
I can't I can't not talk about that episode even if it has nothing to do with largely what we're trying to learn

1497
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,895
That's it's a mess

1498
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,919
It is weird

1499
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,199
See this Behavior

1500
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,527
So starkin

1501
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:14,111
While at the same time like

1502
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:17,439
Not applying that far larger

1503
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:20,511
Like the weird s*** that people

1504
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,559
Jamming to Children's heads

1505
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,351
On a daily basis

1506
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,655
Hey that reminds you so much of

1507
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:30,239
Alex Jones like everybody around you is crazy

1508
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:33,055
Like everybody around you as sex is going to hell

1509
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,335
Like all of this stuff that

1510
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:35,615
Hammer into

1511
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,919
And you just shouldn't be left

1512
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:38,943
Nope

1513
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:39,711
Nope

1514
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:40,735
That's abuse

1515
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:45,343
I got f***** up for someone who is such a champion of the youth

1516
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:46,623
The children

1517
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:48,415
This sort of behavior towards

1518
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:49,695
Children

1519
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,487
Even if 13

1520
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,767
Still not

1521
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,863
Developed until 25 or some

1522
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:59,679
That's when you can begin talking to me about

1523
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:06,079
That's when you can talk to Infowars

1524
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,615
Hopefully yeah

1525
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:14,015
