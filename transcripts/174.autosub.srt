00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
Alex

00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:16,896
Beverages this case of blood orange IPA

00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,944
3rd Dan

00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:20,480
Jordan

6
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:27,136
Being pressured into

7
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
Of a garlic hot sauce soft peer-pressure sauce

8
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:47,616
Continue to fight back 40 episodes of Archer

9
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,920
And or hot

10
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
I just wanted it

11
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:00,160
A lot about hot sauce

12
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:05,024
Weak tea I was raised on

13
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,560
Look

14
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:13,216
Wendy's spicy chicken sandwich spicy thing I ate until I was like 45

15
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,520
Spicy

16
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,152
Fast food items like a volcano

17
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
Very good

18
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:33,184
We're doing a little bit of a

19
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,584
Because this is a minisode it'll be two hours

20
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,216
2009

21
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,520
And our last episode was

22
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,544
February 6th

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,848
The temp right

24
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,664
Alex appeared in such a way

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,808
That I could not include it in the entirety of that episode

26
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,112
You insisted this to me

27
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:08,512
Multiple times and I couldn't explain to you beforehand because of the premise of this show

28
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:13,120
Got to keep going

29
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:19,520
We got to get into it but just spiritually thank you everybody was supposed to show fuel exports go to knowledge

30
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
Fight.com

31
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,312
Show button

32
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,360
Now we need to get to the important issue

33
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,152
I wouldn't

34
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,944
To you it is wasn't like

35
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736
A very real

36
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
Furious

37
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
Issue

38
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
I don't trust

39
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,928
Here is what we need to talk about

40
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,000
You'll be able to memorize any type of information

41
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,472
They fix the pronunciation

42
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,800
State commercial

43
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
Is it

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
What happened

45
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,392
Someone's like hey guys that's not

46
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,232
Also you don't have enough women on this

47
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,536
So let's not talk about that

48
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
Intro

49
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
Uncle

50
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:23,520
Text Jessica past 34 learning that we heretofore did not know exist absolutely

51
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:32,736
Aspiring that there's hope for everyone if you can learn that medomak

52
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,952
Is based on lies

53
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
So actually here's what I want

54
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
Well okay

55
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,664
Of course is referring to an article this morning

56
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,504
That is in the El Paso

57
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,208
Is reporting this

58
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
Going over that

59
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,791
Coming up

60
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,815
After

61
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
Don't

62
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,823
He's really stretching about me don't tell me about

63
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,871
He's really

64
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
Dan don't tell me what's going to happen

65
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,039
If you say it's very bad

66
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
Alex is going to say

67
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
The Disney Prime

68
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,647
Alex is going to say that your government

69
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,951
Is encroaching upon you Alex

70
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:50,559
This is the worst thing that

71
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:55,679
You should revolt and overthrow this government Alex is going to say government

72
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,239
But does this type of things is invalid

73
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:03,359
And it's not acceptable and that we should literally draw a line in the sand

74
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,431
And leave that government or perhaps

75
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,223
F****** Destroyer

76
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,783
Is that what I was going to say that

77
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:17,439
Not entirely I think there's some there's some of the undertone your

78
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,511
Getting correct but the reason that I need to talk about this

79
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,047
Is not because of

80
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
Had a realization

81
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
About Alex Jones

82
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,215
About why he's not a hippie

83
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:35,871
Okay this is a big this is a big deal I should just tell me on this hard

84
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,431
Really should have understood this sooner and I think

85
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
Naivete

86
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,271
Something that I

87
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,599
Listening to this episode from the 11

88
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
Brought into sharp Focus

89
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
That

90
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,463
I should have been paying much closer

91
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,231
Retention

92
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
Listening

93
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,375
He's actually talking about

94
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
Because we

95
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,727
So often what we do is we hear things like

96
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,519
I was just going

97
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,335
In that

98
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,127
Sometimes what you miss

99
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
What doesn't

100
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,991
Swept up into the

101
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
That's not the right one

102
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,855
Or whatever

103
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,207
Is the spirit of what he's actually talking about at this next clip

104
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,255
Really problem

105
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
This is your mic down clip

106
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,351
Because he's very prescient

107
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
About certain things

108
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,935
But then he also presented in a way

109
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
To all along

110
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
The big failure on our part.

111
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
We had

112
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,383
And they are part

113
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,719
Outside Austin

114
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,935
Portum

115
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:09,823
Grab the children

116
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,151
Process as well

117
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,735
Set the precedent

118
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
So

119
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,951
The part of it that the FEMA camp stuff that he's talking about

120
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
2009

121
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
But

122
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
The part that I need

123
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
2

124
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,935
The scales dropped from my eyes looking

125
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
Originally

126
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
Was when he said it's a beta

127
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
His whole

128
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
Problem

129
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
With mystery

130
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
Of Emigrant

131
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,759
His whole problem with the mistreatment of people who

132
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,087
You don't worry about them being treated poorly

133
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
Is that it's a beta test

134
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,695
Because eventually there's a

135
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,743
Yeah they're going to do it to us

136
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
You know what

137
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,143
Because I had that thought

138
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Recently

139
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,471
This has always been there

140
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,287
Like watching all of this s*** happens like

141
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,639
Really when you stop and think about the people that are doing

142
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,735
Do you think they really don't want to do the same thing to Progressive

143
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:26,111
Just like us

144
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:32,511
Communist sympathizers and

145
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:37,631
Don't specifically Target f****** Fred Hampton and Martin Luther King jr.

146
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,983
The only archers

147
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:46,079
Has an evil president been assassinated

148
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,199
Has somebody who has committed all of the evil

149
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:57,599
That could possibly be done even if I'd was Reagan actually get killed

150
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,951
I don't know enough about McKinley

151
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,303
He's just I just don't know enough about

152
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
Sure

153
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,607
He was

154
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399
Note

155
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,799
I like to I like I told you before the show you were going to scream about you like I probably won't

156
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:27,295
But apparently I jumped before 9 it's fine the neighbors are cool

157
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,135
Oh God.

158
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,415
Better

159
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
That

160
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
Mentality

161
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,535
Is made me take a very serious pause

162
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,607
The idea of it like I was a beta test

163
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,399
That they would abuse

164
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
Immigrant

165
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
And stuff like that

166
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:49,055
It indicates to me because I I think this tracks with his

167
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
He doesn't care what happens to them

168
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,151
He cares that eventually it's going

169
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
Happened to good

170
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
If you put

171
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
Good

172
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
Clean-cut

173
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
Families

174
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,319
Who are people

175
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:06,719
Now hear me out on that note I don't agree with it now

176
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,559
When we have in the past you've been screaming about FEMA camps forever

177
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,607
And now we have these camps

178
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,959
Where parents are being separated from their children I would have you

179
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:23,359
The reason critical for him to be like

180
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:27,711
It's fine it's because he knows with Trump in power

181
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,015
The Next Step isn't going to happen

182
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,551
White people are safe

183
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,647
And that to me was a heartbreaking moment listening to this episode

184
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Because

185
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,767
Back then there was a black president and it made him

186
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,559
Next

187
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:46,655
And now we have an overtly racist president and he's like

188
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:53,055
Ernie is fine you have a president who's legitimately saying like about

189
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
G Ching ping

190
00:10:54,335 --> 00:11:00,479
View president liked that sort of stuff that his principles should have led him to be like

191
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
No this is tyranny

192
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,575
On any on any scale

193
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,671
This is how you end up in a position where you were in the tyrannical

194
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,975
Dictatorship authoritarian rule

195
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:15,327
But because the person is presenting themselves as so fine with white

196
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,863
People and sofa

197
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,167
With the oppression of white

198
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,703
He doesn't care

199
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
And what it leads

200
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
Need to understand

201
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,871
Is that we've done a shity job on the show

202
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
Because

203
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,735
This is as far back as we've gone

204
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,759
For the most part

205
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
The 2009

206
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,087
It becomes very clear to me

207
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,135
Then he is a

208
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,951
White supremacist

209
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,999
22 like

210
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,303
Crazy doesn't say the same shade as David Duke

211
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,095
He tries to debate David Duke

212
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
He doesn't say

213
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,423
Things is like a Richard Spencer

214
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
Sing like that

215
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
He is a much more

216
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,567
He's much better at presenting himself as being like no that's not what I'm talking to

217
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,639
He has a lot more Nooks to hide and looks

218
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
But

219
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,551
I think that we've done a really shity job and I'd like to apologize to the audience

220
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
This to me

221
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,903
Is revolutionary

222
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,743
So how I will deal with Alex moving forward

223
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,559
There's not a there's not a bone in my body

224
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,631
Did think that any of his position

225
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
About

226
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
What he's afraid of are real

227
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,983
Their only real inasmuch as

228
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
He thinks they're white

229
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
Person is going to be a victim

230
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,335
Yep

231
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:38,015
This is me calling

232
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,623
I think that my position especially on this show

233
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,975
Is not taking that leap until that leap is appropriate

234
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:51,583
And I don't think that I think that up until this point from what we've witnessed

235
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,119
It would be reasonable

236
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
To say

237
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,679
Hey you didn't mean any of this yet

238
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
But

239
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,263
The scales are not fallen from my eyes

240
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
Until I heard

241
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,871
Very clearly the idea that what they're going to do

242
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,943
The things that I'm afraid of so much is a beta test

243
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,271
Making it so clear that in the

244
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Same

245
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
He's talking about

246
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,367
The idea of people having their kids taken away

247
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
It did that exact

248
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
Scenario playing out

249
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
In front of our eyes and

250
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
2018

251
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,607
And him being like

252
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,847
The moment you started talking I was like

253
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,919
That connection was made instantly

254
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:43,807
Because yeah I know cuz you're a smart person but

255
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,599
That immediately made

256
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
Perfect f***

257
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,671
That's the only thing that makes

258
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
F******

259
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,999
Because if his position

260
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:58,399
Is essentially when they came for the Jews because they didn't come for me and then they came for me

261
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,799
Like that's his position and now he knows when they come for the judges comings are not coming for me

262
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,175
This is f******

263
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,807
Nail this is a coffin that just got nailed into the

264
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,159
F****** ground has been masquerading as having principles for

265
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
3 years

266
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
Yearsin

267
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,255
His only principal is white supremacy

268
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
That's what it is

269
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
Quite realistically

270
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,143
I mean we've always had the smell

271
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,423
Forgiving white Terror

272
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
Creating

273
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,031
Gymnastic level defenses of life

274
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:41,407
How it's possible that this isn't

275
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
This is done

276
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,647
Set the eclipse

277
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,999
It breaks my heart and soul that the f****** clip it breaks my heart

278
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:00,351
Because it makes things very simple and moving forward will have a much easier framework

279
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
To work with

280
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,423
Some value to that

281
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,239
Really bothers me is that

282
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
2009

283
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
I want to save this

284
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,335
Really quick this is a diversion

285
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:16,223
Alex is ex-wife right now is on Twitter she started an initiative where she's going to

286
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,503
Plug Infowars

287
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,063
That's her new website that she's going to

288
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,391
She's going to unplug Infowars

289
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,463
Unplug Infowars

290
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255
And what

291
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,327
Clearly is it right now in 2009

292
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
She's a big

293
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
Part of the operation

294
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,727
Like when we talked about it she wasn't around when he went to Trump

295
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,263
Part of it at this

296
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,567
She knows a lot more than

297
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
She's putting out there

298
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,895
She really wanted to unplugged

299
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
Lot of stuff.

300
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
Put out publicly

301
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,015
It's a lot more than she could say

302
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
But you.

303
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,599
The other thing I want to say

304
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,279
Stock

305
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
Left

306
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,215
It's so obvious

307
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,335
By no means have I not call him

308
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
For the past year-and-a-half

309
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
That is

310
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
F******

311
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,063
That's what it really is

312
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,671
You know your other conclusion

313
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,535
Flawed and he's not applying them equally

314
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,839
This is his principles are

315
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,887
Pacific

316
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,495
You know why you know why it's so damn

317
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,103
But you know why it's so damning is because there are moments of like

318
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
Outright White

319
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,687
Supremacy in white spirit

320
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,503
Going into the swimming

321
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,063
Muslim women being like this freaks me out

322
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,903
You don't belong in your space

323
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,303
You are your problem

324
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,119
But this is such a different level because it's

325
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
Such

326
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
It's

327
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
Inexorable

328
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
From

329
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
He's Bass

330
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Narrative

331
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,823
Like the things that he has been most

332
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,639
Aggressive about in terms of what

333
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
Fear is

334
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,991
But here the Bandit now being afraid of

335
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,527
You know it's that it's

336
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,695
Yep you got that you're on Homebase now

337
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,487
Or more specifically

338
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
Safety event

339
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,615
Some of our other brethren

340
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,175
And the world

341
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
Airbnb

342
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,039
Irresponsible of us to sit here and say like

343
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,319
We are

344
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,855
Safe

345
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
Alex's married

346
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,975
Cuz you you're saying that he is safe now because like gun whites

347
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:11,839
We are still white and we still have a much bigger past than a lot of the other

348
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
Population

349
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
Yeah I mean

350
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,447
But the problem with

351
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
That

352
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,263
The problem with that

353
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,823
Veev sympathizer label

354
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,615
Which is going to be thrown about

355
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,175
If

356
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
We are

357
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:31,551
We will become sympathizers and that's loose

358
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:38,719
Like that's what it is what you think you think in Nazi Germany people who

359
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:44,095
No cuz they were why do you think we're not going to be people hiding people

360
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:49,727
Like a f****** if it look if you're illegal immigrant to my place

361
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,311
I will f***

362
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:58,687
F****** her s*** believe my shity look thankfully were not very

363
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,735
If I were there

364
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,831
Risotto there is a nice office in Chicago

365
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:10,463
This is the big that I wanted

366
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,999
To make

367
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:12,767
But there's more

368
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,839
Thankfully for the rest of this was could do a dance on Alex

369
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
Is racist a

370
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
About

371
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:25,055
Obama dictator

372
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,871
And it's interesting the specifics that he uses

373
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,039
F****** they're not even f****** real human being

374
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,599
They're dead on the f****** inside

375
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:45,023
Restaurants

376
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,631
Retail store right now

377
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
If

378
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:55,263
It's amazing to me

379
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,103
So that is all

380
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Appears

381
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,711
In the Obama

382
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,527
Documentary

383
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Economist

384
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,319
No idea

385
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,111
But hey

386
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,391
Fun fun fact

387
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,975
Murals of trump are at the zoo

388
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
Champs

389
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,535
I received

390
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,839
Would be a nice inscription

391
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:26,495
Sometimes losing a battle teaches you a new one

392
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,823
Cursive

393
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
Encouraging message

394
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,175
To the children or the people in those camps that might be it

395
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
As much as it is

396
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,479
Middle finger

397
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,319
To the liberals who have tried to create different ways

398
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:46,463
To make it through that declaration

399
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,511
Mural the Trump has

400
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:59,775
Everything with his goddamn name on probably paid some million other people now cuz I think that's that's a level of

401
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,823
That's a level of micromanagement

402
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,591
Dickies capability

403
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,871
I don't think

404
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,663
It's it's

405
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,735
That would be an insane amount of organization that I think he is

406
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759
These two hands off

407
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
White supremacy

408
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,855
Mayday

409
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,159
Mural with Trump's face in American flag

410
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,696
Adidas nmd

411
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
Sometimes

412
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,816
Losing a battle to win a war

413
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,352
I think that relate

414
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,888
To all the years

415
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,448
Supremacist or bang their heads

416
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,264
How to

417
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
Power

418
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,360
That's sort of a wagging dick

419
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:39,200
Kind of

420
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,040
That you should be staying to immigrant

421
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,088
I think that is entirely

422
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:51,488
I f*** you I think that's a f*** you too liberal

423
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:04,288
Would you be autopsy after they f****** destroyed 2008 was all about becoming more glue

424
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,944
Was all about changing demographics was all about making sure that the Republican party was more exclusive it was more

425
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,248
Inclusive

426
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,600
Figure out a way to win and make it more

427
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Exactly

428
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,648
Tea Party

429
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,928
F****** Christ

430
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
Dick

431
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,792
And here's

432
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:32,448
I don't I don't I don't know much about him and I can't I can't find much about him this clip said everything I need to

433
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
F****** know about it

434
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:39,616
After he was elected I heard the day of his inauguration I heard on the television

435
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:46,016
At least 75 times this is the first African-American ever elected see nights

436
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
Steaks

437
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
Well

438
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:54,208
His mother is Caucasian is father was 80% Arab in 20% after

439
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:59,072
And I don't care whether he's black.

440
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,888
But he's 10% African

441
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,448
African does that make him an African-American

442
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,752
And it is absolutely

443
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:19,552
Die die die

444
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,880
The sales pitch

445
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:29,280
The sales pitch Powers Allah

446
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,560
And

447
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,096
Amityville Trump

448
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,192
Has not gotten any of my reference

449
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,104
Also I think

450
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,384
Night last episode

451
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,432
That was clean

452
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
No

453
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
In this country

454
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,672
You're hyperventilating

455
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:01,536
Black is about Heritage in America

456
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,328
Black is about skin color

457
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:09,728
It doesn't f****** matter how far back

458
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:13,312
Do you have to go if you were halfway you were still not a citizen

459
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:19,712
How far back do you have to go to where you if you were halfway you still weren't allowed in the same white rice

460
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:24,832
Restaurants

461
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,160
Because I think what you're trying to express

462
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,768
Could I take a picture

463
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,048
Because it's time

464
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,400
Where whiteness was defined by exclusion

465
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,680
There were people who were like

466
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,960
You know you have a

467
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,264
Do you have a drop of black blood

468
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,056
Therefore you aren't White

469
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,592
Yep

470
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,384
Keep people out of places that was

471
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:55,552
Keep Society in order that the whites wanted order to be in your mother's grandma was black

472
00:24:55,808 --> 00:25:01,952
Doesn't matter how white the rest of your family is your a quadroon

473
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
2009

474
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:08,352
This guy coming in black enough

475
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
To be black

476
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,912
Your

477
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:16,288
Look there is the history of exclusion of black people because they're not white

478
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:20,128
And then now we have him being like what is the president

479
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,920
Black president

480
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,480
He is Mama's wife

481
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,880
Get the f*** out of here what the f*** do you want

482
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,440
Fremont

483
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,232
You heard him say

484
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,816
Who's the first black

485
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,632
You didn't hear them say he was the first

486
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,192
African president who was the first

487
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:50,592
President who was from Kenya

488
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:56,992
Isn't the first president that lie or mostly related to another

489
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,272
That was not

490
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:04,928
You heard them presents because his skin was black which meant that no matter f****** what

491
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,952
If he was

492
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:11,840
If his parents were white his grandparents were white

493
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,376
And by genetics

494
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,312
Everyone around him

495
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:27,712
Because they would see his skin color and they would say the n-word Direct

496
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:33,856
Could have been 98% but if his skin was touche

497
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,672
Then it wouldn't matter how he was

498
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,232
Genetically because blank

499
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,512
Outlook

500
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,328
F******

501
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,032
There's so much

502
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Fitbit

503
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
Concepts of

504
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,128
Whiteness and non-white

505
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
That are being played with

506
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:01,760
Specifically like the way you

507
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
Each each

508
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,064
Version that he's trying to

509
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,856
Use R2

510
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,392
Defend whiteness

511
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,464
Anti authoring

512
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,768
That's all he's doing you saying you like

513
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,584
He's using a rich tradition of

514
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
Exclusion

515
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
Black

516
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
Through

517
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,192
Appearance

518
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,520
He's flipping that around uses

519
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,312
Let's be like

520
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
You're not black enough

521
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,384
Because look at your lineage

522
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,688
Look at your lineage you're not black enough

523
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,480
And that to me

524
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:38,368
So Eugenics to build up on top of that

525
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,440
That is also a

526
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,464
Dick

527
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
Of like

528
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,072
Well somebody who is really black could never be

529
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
He's the first black president

530
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:04,736
Well of course he could become president so as I was actually but

531
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,952
So fascinating about this rich

532
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,744
Is it like there

533
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,048
This is fudge this is dark chocolate

534
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:21,632
Racism

535
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:26,752
There's the garlic layer and then there's the ghost pepper underneath the garlic

536
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:32,640
Ghost pepper that are like

537
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
The other

538
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:39,552
The idea of like you what are you saying is like

539
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,088
Absolutely

540
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,928
He didn't say all that much racist

541
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,000
She's plenty in his interview so I just like

542
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,536
Let's give this guy

543
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:54,144
Also gets back to the idea of

544
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,960
Changing Purity level

545
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,776
Because it's still always about what

546
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
But it's like

547
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:01,824
Well he's

548
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,104
Percent

549
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
Arab

550
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:10,272
Is X or Y

551
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:14,880
Whatever the return is always

552
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,184
Mostly

553
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:23,584
It doesn't it doesn't even f****** matter

554
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,632
Nope

555
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:29,984
Always just going to whatever it is

556
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,592
So now there is no reason to listen to anything these people have to say

557
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
This show is

558
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
Bulaga

559
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,456
Gas

560
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:44,832
We've got a murderer's row

561
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,392
He's a cop

562
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,928
Alright well then he's a graper

563
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,744
He also has a show on

564
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
The communications Network

565
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,608
You f*** with

566
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:00,192
Are phony president by the way we haven't had

567
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:05,312
This is a time that we don't have a president of the United States first time in our history

568
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,432
And because he's a phony president

569
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,760
Evidence to prove that he's not our president

570
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:18,624
Because of Article 2 Section 5 is Constitution says he's not

571
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,672
Because he's an illegal alien

572
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,464
Out of Kenya

573
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,488
And

574
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,328
Anyway they think they have got it made

575
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,888
You know they think they've got it made they got us

576
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:33,984
And they don't realize that God is still in control

577
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,264
God is in

578
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:39,360
Is there anything you cannot realize

579
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,152
Did the other people

580
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,224
Yeah because that suggests that

581
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,040
Where is there a god I wouldn't believe you

582
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
Controller

583
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,600
Control everywhere

584
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,416
Nicely done

585
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:58,560
Stop

586
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:05,216
And he doesn't remember that George W did not actually win Florida and the Supreme Court gave him the president

587
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:11,616
Because it was a conservative f****** Supreme Court but it was a 524 majority

588
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:18,016
Is that like a question that remains

589
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:22,624
But there is a question that remains of a why was Alex

590
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,392
Against

591
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,672
The George W bush

592
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,720
If he is this like

593
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,792
Now Trump is in office and he feels

594
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,328
Doesn't worry about this

595
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,120
And I would posit

596
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,400
As much as

597
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,448
George W bush is a war criminal

598
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,920
He was not as clearly a white supremacist

599
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,712
Like he wasn't it's clearly

600
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:53,856
Like he was not somebody that if you were if you were a Nazi if you were to write

601
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:59,744
You would not hang your hat like David Duke never advocated for George W bush

602
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:06,144
And that's because even though we're of the stupid / evil continue

603
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
They were like

604
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:10,240
He might be too dumb to

605
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,336
And he never gave like those wings

606
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,408
Synod right does to the

607
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:21,248
Few but they weren't as like murder

608
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,648
For that I think of it when we look at the history of like

609
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,928
Where Alex puts

610
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
His foot down

611
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:31,744
Criticize

612
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,048
It's very clear that

613
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,120
George W bush would have been like

614
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,704
My date is a Nazi rally there's good people on both sides

615
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,728
There's a decent

616
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,312
Which actually makes me concerned

617
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,080
In 2050

618
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,640
We do

619
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,688
Rodger Stone

620
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
Mike Worthy

621
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,248
Driving forces for him

622
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:54,784
Joining up with

623
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,344
Yeah that we don't know what they said

624
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,624
And there's a

625
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,792
I think Steve is a manipulator and he was doing his

626
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09,888
There's a counter counter-coup kind of shape

627
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,240
Whether or not he is a racist or not

628
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:18,848
Is irrelevant to me I don't believe that his manipulative game would have been

629
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,408
He's trying to Margarita

630
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,712
Yeah now I don't know about

631
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,736
Rodger Stone

632
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,808
There's a Rogers

633
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,856
Just been like a look he hates Hillary

634
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
Love's wife

635
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
You got to love

636
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,976
Yeah he's going to be fine with whites cuz

637
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,560
Is willing to tell any lie

638
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,352
But that wouldn't be a liar

639
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,632
No no

640
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,192
I just sent that he will do

641
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,312
Like that would be would be like

642
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
You love

643
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:01,856
He loves wife let's move it along is a propagandist

644
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
Manipulate

645
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,928
Absolutely

646
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,232
But I also think he has shame

647
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,816
You don't like from what I've been able to

648
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,376
Certainly

649
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:21,056
You can pretend that like Sandy Hook was a false flag

650
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,848
Las Vegas is a false flag

651
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,152
But at the same time he would not

652
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,456
Lower himself to being like

653
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,736
Please Alex

654
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,064
Like look he likes white people

655
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,928
He would try and do some high-scale manipulation as opposed to the low scale

656
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,208
Whereas I think there's a chance

657
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,232
Rodger Stone

658
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,792
Look on a bass level

659
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,096
You're afraid about white stuff

660
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,888
She's going to protect whites

661
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
I think this is

662
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:52,032
Possible that Rodger Stone

663
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,360
Ultimate Conga player

664
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:58,176
Ultimate limbo ultimate limbo champ

665
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,224
Glam

666
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,808
I'm going to read that you from the Southern Poverty Law Center

667
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,112
From the website

668
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:12,768
He produced a periodical called Aiden police newsletter most famous document

669
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,072

670
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
Colon

671
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:21,472
American police action plan for stopping World Government rule

672
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,008
In parentheses

673
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,992
McClain was perhaps the government

674
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:37,344
So the troops serving the New World Order after martial law is declared with Noah

675
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,624
Do with people living in Egypt

676
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,184
A blue. Met that you were destined for a

677
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,952
FEMA camp

678
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,256
Pick indicated that you were to be used in

679
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,280
Slave labor

680
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,840
Shot in the head

681
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:54,752
Mcclam was also involved in the development

682
00:35:55,008 --> 00:36:01,152
Almost Heaven

683
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:07,296
Located in okay that are coming before

684
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,768
Every word Idaho

685
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,840
The community

686
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:23,424
But you merely was supposed to quote New World Order

687
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,472
Mclambs partner in that failed venture

688
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,752
Conclude bogert

689
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,312
A decorated Vietnam veteran father of the races

Very Christian identity religion

691
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:37,504
A former Arizona

692
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,040
So that's

693
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:42,368
So that's sort of his

694
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,232
I hate he look he opposed Martin Luther King Junior having a holiday on the grounds of

695
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,024
We got too many bank holiday

696
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,376
Next

697
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:59,264
So on this day that Alex reveals to me the scales dropped from my eyes that

698
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,544
Just about protecting whiteness

699
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,592
He has now had a guy on who is

700
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,640
Saying that Obama isn't black enough

701
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:11,040
Right now Jack mcclam president

702
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:17,440
Country happens to be running right for trying to run a right-wing a separate

703
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
Community

704
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,512
With people who don't believe Martin Luther

705
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,304
Holiday

706
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,608
Christian identity

707
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,144
So that's cool

708
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,216
Is the Big Show

709
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,264
Gated communities

710
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,848
White supremacist gated communities

711
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,384
They're doing great

712
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:41,760
Not an Idaho dude location location location

713
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,040
Always

714
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:47,136
No doubt so it was next week

715
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,416
I'm telling you

716
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,280
1 Spencer it's great to have you on with us

717
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,816
You talk to you again

718
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:07,360
You know Alex I moved out of California down here to the Border about 7 years ago

719
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:11,200
What about the tell the truth about the border the American people

720
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
Admirable goal

721
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,784
Is it

722
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
Nope

723
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
Hope not

724
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,928
I should tell you their what sponsor does

725
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,696
Glenn Turner

726
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,744
He has

727
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
Technology

728
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:32,192
No these people can't have technology may or may not have an army of drones

729
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,520
Might you might have

730
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,616
Graph

731
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,432
So he can tell when they're people walking over it

732
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,968
At the border

733
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:48,320
People crossing the border

734
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,392
Now he doesn't do anything with that information

735
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,464
But he is a weirdo who spend too much money

736
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,792
He's a mess

737
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,096
And this isn't 2009

738
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:00,864
Yeah

739
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:06,752
This is he still doing today

740
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:10,848
I'm not sure if you was doing in 2009 he's actually doing it now

741
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,152
Started

742
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,432
But he's been trying

743
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,968
Develops

744
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,016
To f*** over people at the border

745
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,040
Long time

746
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,344
Doesn't report them

747
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,136
Border Authority but I think it's because

748
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:23,904
He doesn't believe

749
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,928
Even the Federal

750
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,720
I think that's part of it

751
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,512
So you just you just

752
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,584
Takes pictures of them

753
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,704
Take pictures of them as they crossed the border airplane

754
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:48,992
I think it would like that

755
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
It was like

756
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:53,600
Border-crossers.com

757
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,160
That's not all

758
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,208
Was about

759
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,232
That's not all

760
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:00,768
No sir

761
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,728
Implies that he's two people like a celebrity couple

762
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,824
Glenna Spencer

763
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,616
Where did you go

764
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:21,760
She's going shopping

765
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,576
So he re started this thing called voice for

766
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,880
Things together also known as American Patrol

767
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:32,000
In response to what he perceived as Mexican related violence in the LA riots

768
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,280
Police officers

769
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,352
So goes all the way back

770
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:42,496
All the way back all the way back to the Rodney King riots

771
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
Troll

772
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:47,360
Involved

773
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,152
94 was the

774
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,712
Opposition

775
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,480
7

776
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,760
Which aims to cut Publix

777
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,040
For undocumented

778
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,088
Immigrants and their children

779
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,112
From attending school

780
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,696
Spencer's website would become a popular anti-mexican

781
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,744
Consistently post

782
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,280
Fictionalized stories

783
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:09,120
Meant to imply that latinx people had a higher propensity towards

784
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,656
And undermining America

785
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:14,496
Culture reflected in this next

786
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,264
Clip

787
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,128
Something is coming apart

788
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:24,736
There was no Foundation there there was no cultural strength

789
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:32,416
Are unified in their very nationalist

790
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:37,280
However they will look for any reason at any excuse

791
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,816
The movie cross that border

792
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,656
Because they want to take the Southwest back

793
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:49,824
Anyway you slice it

794
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,919
So I kept that after that break their just because Alex had to

795
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:59,295
Spawn like I had to make sure yet

796
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:02,623
Stupid as planned

797
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,903
6 a conspiracy

798
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:10,303
Believes that Mexicans are working together through their advocacy

799
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,095
Metro or the Raza

800
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,887
In order to take back the Southwest

801
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,423
They're coming to America

802
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,239
Specifically because they want to swing demographic so they can

803
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,519
Voted back to Mexico

804
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,823
This conspiracy is deeply race

805
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,591
I

806
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
First off

807
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,919
Love that

808
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,479
To be fair

809
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:33,855
Really land

810
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:37,183
Go to put together a Scientologist

811
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:41,791
A guerrilla operation where you infiltrate an entire government

812
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,839
In order to take back land

813
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:47,679
Pretty wild easier ways to do these

814
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:56,127
Also the idea of a nationalist saying that they're very nationalistic

815
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:56,895
Yeah

816
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:03,295
Baseboards

817
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,855
Borders and they want their land back

818
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:09,439
You're wrong I actually think the Tipping his cap to his enemy

819
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:16,095
I think there's a

820
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,631
Spectrum

821
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:21,215
I kind of think

822
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,495
I can see that

823
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,775
I'm too also

824
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,615
I don't before you go any further

825
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,687
Despise

826
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,711
The

827
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:37,855
Because I'm special

828
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,671
The propaganda of the status quo

829
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:43,487
Yeah which to me is that

830
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,023
Anti-immigrant

831
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,839
Anti-immigrant

832
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:55,519
I just use that I just used is a feeling because either race

833
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,543
Right exactly

834
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,455
That to me is the propaganda of the status quo that idea

835
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:09,343
My framing it that way but I only did that because

836
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,879
I was harkening back

837
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
To what key

838
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:17,791
Probably thought he was doing that it was probably was

839
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,839
A kernel of it that he thought there was a

840
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,607
9 doors

841
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,703
But that might also me being that might be me Express

842
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:29,823
The same naive like you came up with anti-immigrant

843
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,383
No

844
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,943
At that phrase

845
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:41,343
Azrael a tighter that quoting some other places

846
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:44,927
I mean

847
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,231
Yeah then in that case

848
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,511
J'accuse

849
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,167
Was doing it all

850
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,495
I mean on a on a

851
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,543
Barebones

852
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:03,103
I do agree with the terminology cuz he is

853
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:09,503
There's a bigger picture to it

854
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,807
Don't get involved in anti-immigrant

855
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,343
Qrn races

856
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,623
Yes

857
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,951
What do you mean

858
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:20,767
Call are they anti immigrants from everywhere

859
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,815
I would also like to

860
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:31,007
I'm sorry sorry

861
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,055
Eventually we get to that

862
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,871
I don't which is again

863
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:42,527
Because generally anti-immigrant politics

864
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:48,927
End with

865
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:55,327
New York Times

866
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,375
Because there was a jerk

867
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,911
Those

868
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,679
Politics

869
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,703
Work

870
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:06,847
I trust you when you say that

871
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,639
If I ended it with

872
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:13,247
Anti-immigrant yourself

873
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:18,879
Yeah 1008

874
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:25,279
Center posted

875
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:28,351
Jew control Hollywood brainwashing Americans

876
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,375
That's actually

877
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:35,775
A good question it he assured readers that he had Jewish friends but added quote I fear however that this

878
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:39,871
Small handful of patriotic Americans are liberal Jews

879
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,431
Total control over Army

880
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,223
So he's branched out

881
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,527
At this point news on Oz Show

882
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,343
From just being super again

883
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:53,183
Coming from the border to

884
00:46:55,999 --> 00:47:02,143
Monessen forward like concept of

885
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:02,911
The five jewbag

886
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:06,751
Late like Run the World

887
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:10,079
The 5G producers

888
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,431
There's always

889
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,735
Catch-all

890
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,039
Which by the way

891
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,087
I don't think we have enough donations

892
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:22,879
The

893
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,647
The

894
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:30,559
None dare call it conspiracy to come out

895
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,095
Delicious

896
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,375
But

897
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,167
Man there's so much of that

898
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,471
Ready for

899
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:38,751
Cages

900
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,543
Construction

901
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,823
Again all this

902
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,103
Propaganda

903
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,151
He goes back and back and back

904
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,431
People just ate

905
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,247
Hazel stuff

906
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,783
Misunderstanding

907
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,063
Communism

908
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,903
Like vociferous anti-communism

909
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,695
Was such a scourge

910
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,999
Cold War

911
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,071
It was so bad the John Birch Society stuff was

912
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,863
So right

913
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:08,447
One actually I want to tell you about that

914
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,215
My research

915
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,239
So amazing

916
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,287
A bunch of University

917
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
They did a bunch of studies

918
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,383
About people's

919
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,175
Throughout

920
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,455
7 Dees

921
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,735
The 80s

922
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,527
And

923
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,551
They found that

924
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:24,575
Of course

925
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,623
As time went on people had much less

926
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,671
Fear about communism as an ideology

927
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:31,743
Actually towards the end of it

928
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,023
At least

929
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,047
Affinity

930
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,423
Alex Jones

931
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,447
Good cop.

932
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,727
But the

933
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,007
Funniest things

934
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,543
Is that they did a poll

935
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,823
1874

936
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:46,847
About

937
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,383
The government

938
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,407
Should be spying

939
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,759
So they are bunch of different groups like

940
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,295
Should the government spy on them

941
00:48:55,551 --> 00:49:00,671
Yes or no

942
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,719
74 this is

943
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:07,839
The number one group that people said yes you should spy on them

944
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,375
Was the American Communist Party

945
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,167
It's 74.9

946
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:15,007
Which is pretty high very high that's pretty crazy

947
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,079
What you up to communist

948
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,639
I kind of understand in the 70s

949
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:24,479
SOB Americans

950
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:28,831
Good answer

951
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:33,439
Stuff like that phone number to its 7

952
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:36,511
34.7% vigilante groups like The

953
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,535
Kirkplan

954
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,351
The KKK comes in just under

955
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,167
I like that they're closed

956
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,959
I don't like who's number one

957
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:50,847
But I'm feeling you 74 so far we're doing 50 50 years with really fun

958
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,383
You came in third

959
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,943
The John Birch Society

960
00:49:56,223 --> 00:50:00,063
47.2% of respondents to the government

961
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,087
Should be spying

962
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,367
On the John Birch

963
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:05,183
Tire ratings

964
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,487
The students for a Democratic Society

965
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:14,143
The Weather Underground forehead just got done

966
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,983
They were more suspicious to the public

967
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,775
50 FPS

968
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:24,127
Because the SES isn't actually going to take over the government

969
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:28,479
They were trying to change policies they weren't infiltrate

970
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,039
There's other

971
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,319
Republican Party

972
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,207
Society

973
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:44,863
Hahaha is what they added Fox News and it was number four is

974
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,631
Raising

975
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,679
Super weird facts

976
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:53,823
Yourself Glenn Spencer you suck we're sure you are a monster

977
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,359
But

978
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,663
This is actually really fun

979
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,967
So I want to see this but I couldn't

980
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,991
Because it's time

981
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:01,759
Pinstripe

982
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:04,831
I have started to notice that Alex says a bunch

983
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,599
Interesting

984
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,647
Pixar off

985
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,255
The only way you'd be able to

986
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
No this is

987
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,583
If you listen to all of the Ross

988
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,119
Right

989
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,167
Not to the attitude coming out of

990
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,191
Commercial

991
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,727
This

992
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,751
Repeatedly

993
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,543
Initiate

994
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,871
Waging War on corruption

995
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:33,503
Alex Jones commercial

996
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,527
Initiate

997
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,623
I think there's a part of his military

998
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:42,463
There's a leak coming out a commercial

999
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,023
Not like let's go

1000
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:48,863
NACA

1001
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,167
Whatever it is

1002
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,239
Where is worth noting

1003
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,799
I like it I like it

1004
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,335
I think it's more fun

1005
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,895
If he's like a weird closet Syfy

1006
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:12,415
Call viz references or like what's real is actually what happened

1007
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:21,375
No we could never love a Highlander so much you just relay that to his stupid ideas about Star Wars

1008
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:23,679
In a week and everybody thinks that I loved doing it

1009
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:28,543
Okay was it matter was it

1010
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:34,943
Good less references to Highland Drive I'm putting a pimping you a little bit

1011
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:41,343
Dude I could go get him a present

1012
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:47,743
Does there are four

1013
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,631
Have you read chapter

1014
00:52:56,191 --> 00:53:02,335
It's a few thousand years after the god of

1015
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:07,711
Check the f*** out

1016
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,247
I-Ready

1017
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,271
Seventh grade

1018
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:17,439
This is news to Long Walk

1019
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,791
It's like it's like anybody tried to convert to Judaism where I'm like

1020
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,071
No no

1021
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:26,399
You don't want to go through this no it's

1022
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,935
You don't want to go through this

1023
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,215
Let It Go

1024
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,335
Coming up

1025
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:39,455
I told you this

1026
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,855
This guy might be worse than all of them

1027
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,927
Alright

1028
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,487
30 minutes

1029
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:54,303
Joined Sheriff Richard Mack

1030
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:59,423
No Sheriff Richard

1031
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,959
It's going to be a bad day for

1032
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,031
Sheriff cuz he's never like

1033
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,847
Help save two puppies

1034
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:10,175
Today it's never that it's always a sheriff that is like

1035
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,223
I'm the ultimate laws

1036
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:17,599
The one person who I believe has new world order

1037
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,647
His name is

1038
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,439
York County Sheriff

1039
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,463
Oh boy

1040
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,095
His name is

1041
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,679
How many counties are there

1042
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:39,615
But also counties

1043
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:40,895
Louisiana

1044
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,199
Alaska doesn't have

1045
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,855
Is very

1046
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,623
Like the sheriff is

1047
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,791
Too bad

1048
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,071
Richard Mack

1049
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,399
A board member

1050
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,423
The Oath Keepers

1051
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:09,055
Dick Mac is a board member of the oath keeper I should also tell you he is one of

1052
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:09,823
If not

1053
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,383
The main originator of the cons

1054
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,663
Institutional stairs movement

1055
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:20,319
He's been one of the guys who started this idea the sheriff is

1056
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,623
He's the Proto Arpaio

1057
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,695
Funny you should say that

1058
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:26,719
How do you say that

1059
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,279
Is another drop

1060
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:33,375
Who has endorsed my book by the way

1061
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,911
He's on the back of the book

1062
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,703
Jubilee

1063
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:40,031
In all of this about the autonomy of the sheriff

1064
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,823
Look what you've done

1065
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,103
That's a bad way to phrase it

1066
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,895
Look what he's done

1067
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,943
Look what you

1068
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,711
Would like

1069
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,247
All of you

1070
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,271
Policy walk

1071
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,831
To elect me president

1072
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,183
I will have a vice president

1073
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:59,231
Who is far more qualified than me

1074
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,511
However

1075
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,535
As president

1076
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,583
I will spend one day in office

1077
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:04,863
And that day

1078
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,423
Will be an active executive order

1079
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,471
To murder Joe Arpaio

1080
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,543
Scrotal

1081
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,567
F****** die

1082
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,847
20 years ago

1083
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,895
The worst god dammit that

1084
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,431
F****** piece of s***

1085
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:25,087
It's not surprising that would be super on board with Richard Max idea that is not

1086
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:29,695
VR the sheriff is the ultimate law of the land because people like Joe Arpaio

1087
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:33,279
Make their own little mini fiefdom yep where they are King

1088
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,839
They like to abused their power they liked

1089
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,607
The creates the

1090
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:39,167
Systematic abuse of people who are different

1091
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,983
And scare people about the immigrants in order to

1092
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,007
To justify

1093
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,311
Things like

1094
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,079
Not

1095
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,383
Investigating

1096
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,151
Abuse

1097
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,431
Things like

1098
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:57,087
Creating fake bomb scares in order to get himself over this over and over again

1099
00:56:57,343 --> 00:57:00,927
Never Enough never enough

1100
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,719
There's there are very few like

1101
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,487
Summary

1102
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:04,255
Execution

1103
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,279
Candidates

1104
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,607
Anthony

1105
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,167
Yeah

1106
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:13,727
Like for real

1107
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,007
Legitimately

1108
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,799
White supremacist

1109
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,591
And as done

1110
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,895
Irrevocable damage

1111
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,943
Countless

1112
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:26,271
Like the people who had to live in his f****** 10

1113
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,039
Kansas City

1114
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,343
I can't imagine what

1115
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,159
PTSD some of them had to go through and

1116
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,439
The lingering effects

1117
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,719
That that is caused

1118
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,999
Do people in their lives

1119
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,535
I can't imagine

1120
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,839
The people who dreamed up

1121
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,143
What happened to them

1122
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,679
Like the ripples

1123
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:46,495
That he's responsible for Jeff because of his love

1124
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,263
Power

1125
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,847
And just because of his desire to be the king share

1126
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,919
Richard

1127
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,223
His advocate

1128
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:59,807
He is no he's at a level where I like

1129
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:06,463
I understand six Roman overlords put people

1130
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:12,863
And lit it on fire

1131
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,399
About about

1132
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:17,471
Yes like absolute

1133
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,751
Because

1134
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,543
White people are not

1135
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,871
The people who are going to be hurt

1136
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,919
Exactly

1137
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,479
Pattern

1138
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,783
Is so f****** clear

1139
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,319
Over and over and over

1140
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,135
So now I'll tell you about Richard McEvoy

1141
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,351
Why wouldn't you be

1142
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,887
Why would

1143
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:49,215
Why would Mac be there

1144
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,751
Richard Mack former Sheriff

1145
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:57,919
I was part of the Bundy standoff because of that he ended up a guest on Fox News

1146
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:05,087
Appearing on Fox News has the real story on Monday former Sheriff Richard Mack said he and other protesters quote

1147
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,927
We're already strategizing to put all the women up at the

1148
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:15,327
Front if they're going to start shooting it's going to be women that are going to be televised

1149
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,607
Federal officers

1150
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:21,983
So that to me takes away from the brutality of what the officers would have done if you are

1151
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,519
Open up front door

1152
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:26,591
Create some sort of monster image

1153
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:29,151
Oh isn't it terrible

1154
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,943
Put them up front daughter for them to be

1155
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,711
Be killed

1156
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:35,039
What the f*** is going on what game are you playing

1157
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:38,879
Like he's pretending or first of all that never happened

1158
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,415
Second of all

1159
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:44,255
That are not worth you getting your wife killed

1160
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:48,095
What the f*** is going on you he cared more about the Optics

1161
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:52,959
Pretending that the oppressive government that was going to kill them

1162
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,543
His wife

1163
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,823
In Mortal Danger

1164
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:04,223
What are you doing is he saying you know all those organic

1165
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,503
Locations where the cops

1166
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:06,783
The government

1167
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:11,135
Have murdered young women

1168
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:13,951
Children everybody

1169
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:18,815
You know all those situations where white supremacist have wound up doing that

1170
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:21,375
Well we're going to manufacture the

1171
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,679
That's what he saying

1172
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,983
And let's not talk at all

1173
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,007
Is there white supremacist

1174
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,031
Sip killed tons of

1175
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:28,799
Minorities

1176
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:33,151
Tintagel would never

1177
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:39,551
Do that their monuments to doing that in the United States was definitely not doing

1178
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:41,343
Getting Burger King

1179
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,159
1

1180
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,255
I would say go Wendy's

1181
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:03,615
The place where the world is so f***** up

1182
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,151
How do you what are you even f******

1183
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:08,479
Literally the definition of gallows humor

1184
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:13,855
No s*** in 2014 Richard

1185
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,647
Navajo County Arizona

1186
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:18,719
We're going to make it a constitutional County

1187
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,255
Show everybody the bloop

1188
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,535
Blueprints of freedom

1189
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:25,375
There's a lot more people running another offices

1190
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:27,423
I'd say I'd run for Sheriff

1191
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:31,775
We're going to give this one more try the elections 2016

1192
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:34,847
I'm going to be moving there in the spring 2015 so I can

1193
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,383
Get ready for this

1194
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,431
Your buddy year-and-a-half

1195
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:41,759
To decide I'm dead serious about this

1196
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,295
PostScript

1197
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:48,415
He lost that election to democratic Market

1198
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,207
So now here

1199
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:52,767
Jordan I wrote this paragraph and I'm super proud of it

1200
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:57,119
Richard Mack was a hostile opponent of Obamacare

1201
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,143
And then

1202
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:00,191
If you had a heart attack while his wife was very sick

1203
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,263
They were self-employed could not afford

1204
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,031
Insurance

1205
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:07,871
With mounting medical bills they started a GoFundMe to pay for their Healthcare

1206
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:10,175
Jordan will be thrilled to learn

1207
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,199
That they did not read

1208
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,855
Yes yes I am

1209
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,647
Yes I am

1210
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:23,999
I mean like that there are a classic example of

1211
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:27,327
No it's bad when everybody else does it it's

1212
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:31,935
Yeah absolutely

1213
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,983
$60,000 goal

1214
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,263
For there a GoFundMe

1215
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,287
And they reached

1216
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:37,823
53 South

1217
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,359
Still too much

1218
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:42,687
And Subway

1219
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,479
You know still somewhere like

1220
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:45,247
Go fuc his

1221
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:51,647
There's the real issue is they had a miscalculation by 10 grand

1222
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,927
Like that's the

1223
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:55,487
If I had $50,000

1224
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:59,327
Never really happened

1225
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,143
I think that if your

1226
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,447
If you have this principle

1227
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,983
You go through life like this

1228
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,055
F*** people being able

1229
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:09,823
2

1230
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:13,663
Afford insurance when they're self-employed go f*** yourself

1231
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,199
You stupid piles of s***

1232
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:15,967
Look at this

1233
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:17,759
Affordable Care Act

1234
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,295
I hate it

1235
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,319
Oh s*** I had art

1236
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,111
Please give me

1237
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,135
Yep

1238
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:30,303
The idea that you don't at that point realize why it's a problem and why this

1239
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,095
This is very important for people

1240
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:40,799
Security benefit

1241
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,847
Caused him to be like

1242
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:43,615
I get

1243
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,431
On the other side

1244
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,711
I don't

1245
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:50,783
I refuse to understand that I'm accepting

1246
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:51,807
What amount

1247
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:59,487
Charity could just be done

1248
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,511
Automatically

1249
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,303
For everyone

1250
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:04,607
We could all do this

1251
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,959
In a bigger way and take care of everyone

1252
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:15,359
And GoFundMe getting a 8% cut or whatever

1253
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,127
Private ism

1254
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,687
Capitalism that doesn't leave

1255
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,735
And everyone knows it

1256
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,159
Security benefit

1257
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,231
And yet

1258
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:41,215
Pass that massive text cut right and what are they doing now Dan

1259
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,823
That I have ever said this before

1260
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,615
Written about it extensively

1261
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:50,687
For those tax cuts

1262
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:54,783
I'll be God damned if it isn't to cut Medicare and Social Security

1263
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:59,903
Oh they said they would never touch it they said it would

1264
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:07,839
We got it we got it

1265
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,631
3 trillion-dollar deficit

1266
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,911
That's a terrible idea

1267
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:14,495
Too bad there aren't other ways

1268
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,543
Reason

1269
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:20,127
Voted against his own interest it's bananas

1270
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,735
Be subversive

1271
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:26,015
The height

1272
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,039
Are going to

1273
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:27,807
To be punished

1274
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,855
Long

1275
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,135
Immigrants

1276
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,671
The minorities

1277
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:37,535
Lgbtq community

1278
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:41,375
It goes back to reconstruction-era South

1279
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,679
Poor white people or black people

1280
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,215
They're going to

1281
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,775
So you divide poor white people in

1282
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:50,591
Which is why everyone is so mad at the

1283
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,687
In terms of the broken Coalition together

1284
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:59,039
Exactly the same time the ID of like shifting

1285
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,599
More right in order to be more appealing towards

1286
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:04,927
But that is a problem but that idea of

1287
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:05,951
Together all of the

1288
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,999
All the disenfranchised group

1289
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,279
I'll take care of you

1290
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:11,583
If you followed with all of that

1291
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:18,495
That was reading strategy

1292
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:29,503
We have the worst president in history and somehow the opposition parties going to f*** it up

1293
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,807
It actually is very clear why

1294
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:34,623
No one knows

1295
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:36,671
Like

1296
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,207
Why would

1297
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,231
Why would

1298
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,535
Who's been in

1299
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,583
Government for 10 years

1300
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:46,911
15 years old has assholes for like 20-30 years

1301
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:49,215
Why would they know how to deal with

1302
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:52,031
Why would they understand

1303
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,823
The situation

1304
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,847
That is

1305
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:58,943
Unfolding Lex Luthor Superman

1306
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,223
The Democratic Party

1307
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,759
The Democratic caucus

1308
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,063
Leadership

1309
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,231
On the

1310
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,047
In the same breath

1311
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,583
How could they not

1312
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,143
Give him a pass

1313
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:24,031
Yeah of course years of like

1314
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,567
Things being different

1315
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:26,847
And now things

1316
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:28,895
And you'd hoped

1317
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,943
I got to wake up call

1318
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:33,247
Get better not going

1319
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:35,295
Because I mean I mean to

1320
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,599
Spoiler alert

1321
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:40,927
Because out is that a couple of House Representatives

1322
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:41,951
The show as guest

1323
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,231
I looked at their salary

1324
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:45,791
House represent

1325
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:48,351
Not even in the Federal

1326
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,143
House representative

1327
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,167
In most States

1328
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,447
Have a

1329
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,263
2070 thousand-dollar year

1330
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,287
Salaries

1331
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:00,127
How the f*** would they give a s*** about

1332
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,663
I'm in this posting

1333
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,943
I'm good right

1334
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,479
Right

1335
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,295
I don't know

1336
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,831
Can you imagine being

1337
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,623
Ada government for

1338
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,647
30 years

1339
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,927
20 years were

1340
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:16,511
There's a very little chance you'll ever be voted out because

1341
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,303
Sometimes you don't have anyone even

1342
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:23,679
There is in that government job

1343
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,959
Because it is so pretty

1344
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,775
Lifetime Health Insurance

1345
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:32,383
Billion percent of money corrupt

1346
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:37,503
Like the arguments for paying representative

1347
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:43,903
Politician is because if you say if they were already rich maybe they won't

1348
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:50,047
Averse to corruption as we already know better version

1349
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,071
Oversight

1350
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,375
Regulation

1351
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,143
Crazy

1352
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,215
Everybody hates that word

1353
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:00,287
Soap dirt back back back on track

1354
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,639
I'd say that Richard Max sucks

1355
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:10,015
Dickie Max and here is one level

1356
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,551
Very very very

1357
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:12,831
Give misrepresent

1358
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:13,855
Beloved

1359
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,647
Yeah

1360
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,671
2000

1361
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,207
Election

1362
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:19,743
I think it's very

1363
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:25,375
Set the hopelessness that people felt during especially this last campaign

1364
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,935
The presidential election 90

1365
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:34,079
That's so many people with a bad taste in their mouths of hopelessness and right now I've given the message that there is hope

1366
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,615
And it is your County Sheriff

1367
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:36,639
I would say

1368
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,967
That I never saw more

1369
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,527
2008

1370
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,343
I never sought more people

1371
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,415
I never saw more

1372
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,695
In my lifetime

1373
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:50,975
Optimism

1374
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:56,607
Who otherwise

1375
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,399
People who are very scary

1376
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:06,079
Do you mean

1377
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,871
That everybody was dancing in the street

1378
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,919
Because that day

1379
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,967

01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,735

So many grapes the greats of County Sheriff

1382
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:23,487
You've got Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Gregerson

1383
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,255

I don't know

1387
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:45,759
That took all the way out of myself I was going to try and come for a name

1388
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:49,343
I'm so sorry I wanted to hear like 30

1389
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:52,415
McGregor

01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:56,767
Jerk tungsten shout-out to Mystery Science Theater

1392
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,679
Hardest name ever

1393
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:10,079
No he wasn't Coolio

1394
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:10,847
Alright

We got we got a couple more clips and they're all fun

1397
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:18,271
From here on out

1398
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,551
Alright

1399
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:22,879
Very queer

1400
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:27,231
Line of white supremacy

1401
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,279
Read ideology

1402
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,071
Like all of these

1403
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:31,839
There is

1404
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,191
Not a quitter

1405
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:39,775
Since they're all on the show

1406
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,055
Now I should tell you

1407
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:43,871
Over the years

1408
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,431
And that is italics

1409
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,199
Killing dog

1410
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,727
So

1411
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:12,287
I find it hard not to think of naught

1412
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:14,847
When I hear music

1413
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:20,479
I think he f****** shot knocking the head I'm not sure if I'm just hearing this

1414
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:22,527
He is

1415
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:25,087
Singularly obsessed with this like

1416
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:28,671
Verbal picture of killing a dog

1417
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,951
You don't want to kill

1418
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:34,815
Yeah but you got to kill this dog you got to kill this f****** dog

1419
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,095

Circumstances

1421
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:43,263
But you don't know what the government is going to do with that remains

1422
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,543
Kill it yeah

1423

But also

1425
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:54,783
I got that I actually got that a letter was

1426
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:57,599
I didn't see any reason to kill that.

1427
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:05,023
Joyless to a kid looking up to you with those puppy dog eyes work

1428
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,839
Any reason to kill this dog

1429
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,967
Portland

1430
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:29,087
Trusting person there's no reason to kill that dog

1431
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:31,647
You're just murdering a dog

1432
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,463
He's looking at you up at you hungry

1433
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,743
Like a dog

1434
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,303
Elizabeth

1435
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:44,703
7 years old so you know you've built a long relationship with it you love that dog Kenosha

01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:52,127
Single benefit of the doubt and then it's just

1438
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,199
Anyways

1439
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:55,967
Free dog

1440
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:03,647
Video of Obama talking to

After I don't know if

1447
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,615
This forum

1448
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:34,879
In that speech

1449
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:35,903
And then I also do

1450
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,439
Presented

1451
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,743
If he'd been like

1452
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:40,767
Your dog is

1453
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:47,167
Is going to die anyway

1454
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:52,799
Is murder a woman who's hungry

1455
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:53,823
Edwards home

1456
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,359
And

1457
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:59,455
It is exactly like when you murder your dog because you

1458
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,831
Nobama didn't murder that lady

1459
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,879
Not quite like Alex murdered

1460
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,415
Probably

1461
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,695
I can't even remember the other.

1462
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,487
He's brought up

1463
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,255

01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,815
Call Bae.

1465
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:18,911
We were in Austin and we almost went to

1466
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:22,751
I don't want to go

1467
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:24,543
Nazi iconography

1468
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,895
We're going to we're going to end this on a Cota

1469
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:31,711
Much like the end of Layla

1470
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:33,247
That is where we get to like

1471
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,039
Episode where

1472
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:37,343

Cannot get away

1475
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,791
This will be a

1476
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,095
From now on I can't stress that enough

1477
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:48,863
Like this is

1478
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,399
Payson pool to scales

1479
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,167
For my eyes

1480
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,447
You clearly now

1481
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,103
They are eventually going to be

1482
01:15:59,359 --> 01:15:59,871
Be applied to White

1483
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,223
Yep

1484
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,271

01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,039
All of that

1486
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,831
Only about like

1487
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:11,647
They will do this two white people eventually

1488
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:13,183
Scared of that.

1489
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:15,743
Because

1490
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,791

Who selling gold

1497
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:34,431
But it's clearly not enough

1498
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,455
He's not a millionaire

1499
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,791
He's not done with

1500
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:50,559

01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:45,503
I mean the reason we end the way we

1537
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,039
It's cuz that's how he

1538
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:47,807

1544
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,143
About Khan

01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:02,911
It's about the

1546
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,495
Except valyria effective

1547
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:09,311
He believes in the white supremacy first

1548
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,079
Totally

1549
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,615
Titanic built around

1550
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:15,967
Effective

1551
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,295

That joke is flown around the Facebook group

1557
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:49,503
But it would be it would require like us not being friends

1558
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:53,599
Like if we if we faked that

1559
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:54,879
You could not

1560
01:19:56,159 --> 01:20:02,303
Would not allowed

1561
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,327
I could make a pivot

1562
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:09,215
Things or something

1563
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,007

01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,328
And abuses it to the

01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:13,376
Point that it is untenable
