1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damned important

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge B

3
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
Need money

4
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,832
Collegeboard.com

5
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
Everybody welcome back to fight knowledge um Jordan the little show where sometimes I

6
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:15,264
Subject

7
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,824
That's humility on mypark

8
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:26,784
Well today then I'm going to do a little talking about

9
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,880
Guy named Graham Ledger from one America news

10
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,672
Okay Network

11
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,424
I didn't ask you this is the first time you've messed up your side of the it's not true because you didn't save it

12
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
Novelty Beverages and talk a little bit ly

13
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,056
Which is what leads up to you whatever

14
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,592
Right spot

15
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,432
Dan my bright spot is

16
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,712
Release a new album

17
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:59,040
Okay

18
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,320
Experimental

19
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,392
He did a song with

20
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672
Bjork

21
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,744
It's been a long time since I've heard this song

22
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,536
Is so f****** Bjork

23
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
What is the most

24
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,608
Bjork

25
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:17,216
Concentrated Bjork it's been awhile

26
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,032
Breathe

27
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,616
That's great

28
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,688
Experimental avant-garde nonsense

29
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:33,088
Paradoxical because this is also a little bit involving the year of the

30
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,792
In

31
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,096
It's terrible mess

32
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,656
It serves as a reminder that I'm sometimes

33
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Prophetic

34
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:54,080
Okay

35
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,760
With cucumber stuff so you found

36
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:07,136
Is in the fridge I was worried about it when it came out

37
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,184
I got a mint cucumber

38
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,976
From

39
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
Alright

40
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,792
It is

41
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,072
The worst I've had

42
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:20,704
The worst shelter.

43
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,056
100

44
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,336
Trash

45
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,360
Absolute trash

46
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
And here's why

47
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,688
If you get

48
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
Cucumber flavor

49
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:38,880
If you supplement that something commit to adds a little bit of I don't know I don't know who Mommy

50
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:45,280
Is the right name

51
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,008
That is a pickle Seltzer and it's gross I like this was disgusting

52
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,800
With pickle juice

53
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:02,176
It's great because it's super concentrated and you can mimic

54
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,760
Greatness

55
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:10,368
This is supposed to be a refreshing Seltzer drink that tastes like a goddamn pickle

56
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
And it's gross

57
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
So f*** you could gather

58
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:19,327
You're the worst

59
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
I mean you can't really compare

60
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,175
Will take away from my ability to try bunch of other one

61
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,783
So anyway

62
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,831
You surprised me with your

63
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:47,231
Disgusting this

64
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
Seltzer division

65
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
That's all we can blame

66
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,423
For sure

67
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
Brightspot

68
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,055
Yes you are right that's why I thought it was

69
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
Gross

70
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,871
I actually was a

71
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:11,039
The only selters I can actually think the rest out

72
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,855
Well the first one

73
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,399
Little bucket

74
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,335
Whatever

75
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
That's where I'm at

76
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:46,367
Like I said this is from

77
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,439
First episode of a show

78
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,791
Supporting the team

All capital letters

Batman your handwriting

91
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,127
Okay

92
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:46,527
I'm not criticizing

93
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,159
Which paid off I'm glad I learned that

94
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
Okay

95
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,535

00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
You're both not Technic

101
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,303
Heroin

102
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
So good

103
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,887

104
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
Make it so much

105
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,031
Alex and Mike

106
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:45,919
You're really not doing a great job of articulating

107
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,223
What's wrong

108
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,551
Hawk

109
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,111

You can find a local charity in your area or bail fund

Donate to that

118
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:20,735
See it's not as easy as it looks to try and like come up with a way to express packaging something

119
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,599
Professional

120
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,999
We're going to be talking about

121
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,935
I don't I don't really know how to turn the personalities

122
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
People there

123
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,543
I certainly don't think that they have what you described as a rising

124
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
They do not

125
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:55,807
Something that is very relevant to the world of right-wing propaganda

126
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,879
To look into something

127
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:03,487
Baby a way of Dipping our toe into that gross water

128
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:09,887
Something from

129
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
From

130
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,727
Well I mean I watched a lot of

131
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
OneAmerica

132
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,543
Which was

133
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
Narcan

134
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
A harder right

135
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,479
Minor league Fox News

136
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
You know it's like

137
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
What majors

138
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:32,671
At least has a slugger in Alex Jones

139
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:39,071
You know it's like a really bad.

140
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,631
Still some seats

141
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,447
Right

142
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,431
The big backer or whatever his truck seems to love them a bit

143
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:02,111
There's just nothing every time

144
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,415
Happening here this is

145
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
It is not good

146
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:10,047
It's not it's not good and a lot of it seems to be very similar

147
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,583
Demon content

148
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,119
The stuff we already talked about

149
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,423
Totally so I always had

150
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,727
I would describe it at least Mike's.

151
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:22,847
Covering a lot of it felt like I was a rock climber who couldn't find a hole

152
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
There is one rock

153
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,023
You should just go ahead and play are out of contacts dropping that'll give you an ID

154
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,839
Would be very handy

155
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,935
Okay

156
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:55,103
We'll see

157
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
Infested prison

158
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,199
Andy went on an interview

159
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,015
And it was almost word-for-word the exact same

160
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,719
I also got a message

161
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:17,119
Couple messages actually about other stops that Rodger made apparel

162
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,167
Show

163
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,471
Infowars

164
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
Rescheduling

165
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,799
I feel like

166
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,871
How to blow up a set with a pencil

167
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:34,271
I'd be very mad

168
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,599
Is it this is a media to a raises baking Trump

169
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,415
Departing him saying how much

170
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,207
He has to drop

171
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,743
Now here's the thing

172
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
We skip that part entirely on

173
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,607
This interview and there aren't that many

174
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,143
Clips of it is a really short interview

175
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,703
This interview there's no buttering

176
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
Trump up really okay

177
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
Out-and-out

178
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
Begging

179
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
Literally he says

180
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
I'm begging you

181
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,711
I'm begging Trump depart

182
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,527
He says he's praying to Trump again today

183
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,575
What's the temperature

184
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
I think

185
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,183
Probably a good move on his part cuz

186
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:18,559
He has a pretty good reason to believe the Trump may actually be watching me

187
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
So

188
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:25,983
So yeah he goes on Graham Ledger show Graham Ledger is

189
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
The is the

190
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
You know minor league Bill O'Reilly

191
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,615
Okay he's trying to do that whole thing

192
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,895
And he's just

193
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,175
Even more hard right that's

194
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
The whole idea

196
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,319

In response to Newsom

198
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,695
Tweeting out something like

199
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,999
It's a good idea where I'm at

200
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,071
Wearing a mask is a sign of submission

201
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:56,191
I would rather die from the Wuhan coronavirus than ever submit you were

202
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959

Politely asking you to do an eminently reasonable

00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,679
Howard Stern

Long predates covid-19 or map

213
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,039
Submission is preparing you for the globalist

214
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
Dude

215
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087

Okay people are being very racially harassing

234
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
Okay

00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,695
Within 24 hours he was fire

236
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,279
You can't save

237
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:02,655
Well and he also

238
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,703
Defender

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
Exactly

240
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:12,383
Paris of course 13 hundred grand in compensatory damages and the glow

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,199
Yeah I'm the total lawsuit was 1.1 million

242
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,247
So is that

243
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,063
Who is Grimm

244
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,623
I was looking into him trying to find his

245
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,671
History in his bio and stuff like

246
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,975
He doesn't have a Wikipedia

247
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,767
Which I find fast

248
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,095
He has been on one America as a host

249
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,631
For three years now

250
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,959
Even longer

251
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,751
And he still doesn't have a Wikipedia

252
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,055
Yeah it's not weird

253
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,335
Cuz a little bit

254
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,919
They're just not that maybe they're not nearly as big as

255
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,599
Maybe we're the only situation where you like

256
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,647
Wikipedia pages are really just

257
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,951
Based on how much interest anyone has

258
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:04,351
To make one no one's interested in

259
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
For themselves

260
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:11,519
You think so

261
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:15,103
Wikipedia page

262
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,407
Is very vain

263
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,479
A biopic

264
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Marathi.

265
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,319
I believe it's

266
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
Marathi

267
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,903
It is now my new favorite website

268
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,975
Okay it is

Maharashtra's leading entertainment and cultural website

272
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,775
Is Maharaja is region in India

273
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,567
Marathi is

274
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
Predominant language

275
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,151
That people okay

276
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,735
I have no idea why he is on that website and not with

277
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,783
But he's there

278
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,623
And there's some great little fun fact I things about him

279
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647

00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,439
This was there's a couple of

281
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719

00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,239
With more than three decades of experience he has earned himself a prominent seat and conservative news cover

286
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,359
That seems a little self-aware for a website

287
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,175
Primarily based out of India

288
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,455
You mean self-written

289
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,247
Maybe

290
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,319
Write 30 years of experience

291
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:32,415

00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,151
Still in San Diego

298
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:59,039
Any of the local news host and it's it's like his career goes like that until about 2,000 for 2,000

299
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,087
And then he switches and help

300
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,879
Start smart drive system

301

00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
Is a business

303
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
That makes

304
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
Cameras

305
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,047
To put in long-haul Truckers

306
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
Cabs

307
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,631
In order to watch them at all

308
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,423

309
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,495

That gives him the term American Business

314
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,671
And then later on

315
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
He goes in

316
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
Starts working

317
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,255
It's a little bit like a

318
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,839
Ron Burgundy turned into Bill O'Reilly

319
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,399
The career trajectory that

320
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,703
She's a big deal

321
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
Kind of a big deal

322
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,311
And then here's another part of another fun tidbit

323
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:58,175
Has a daughter named Sienna Maryland whom he loves very much

324
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,455

Their social media presence is hard

326
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
Subjective

327
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,439
Find

328
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
It's a little bit weird

329
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,279
Here's where it gets a little bit

330
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,815
More and more obvious

331
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,983
With his sharp business skills Ledger soon established a market foothold and made business relationships with the state of

332
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,775
California in the Salvation Army

333
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,127
Salvation Army

334
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
Apparently

335
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,015
I looked into this further and it turns out

336
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,551
All of that information

337
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
From

338
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,855
Marathi TV

339
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:42,207
Comes directly from a meet the candidates interview

340
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:47,071

344
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,407
In 2006 I helped launch a high-tech Company in San Diego smart drive system

345
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,199
With little or no budget we

346
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,271
Successfully carved out of Market foothold and established the company

347
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,807
In a highly competitive industry

348
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,623
Well personally establishing new client relationships

And salvation

351
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
So

352
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,255
I suspect

353
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,047
That

354
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,839
There is somebody in India

355
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,911

Alright

386
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,688
Yeah so unhealthy

387
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,968
I you get

388
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,272
Really really weird

389
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,296
Grammar in

390
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,600
11 quotes

391
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,928
Is Graham Ledger was born on 13th March 9th

392
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,720
61 in San Diego

393
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,792
He is American by nationality and that's big

394
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
Ground is white

395
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,376
There is no information about his parents and siblings

396
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:36,288
Girl hang out Pete where did Saint Ignatius college preparatory situated in the place where he grew up and graduated with phenomenal eval

397
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568
Great

398
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,896
Shiki for further studies join San Diego State University

399
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,944
And successfully obtained a bachelor's

400
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,016
All typos and

401
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
Poor grammar

402
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,320
Directly from the side

403
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,416
Griffin Ledger was a reporter Onkyo

404
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,952
Grandmother was a reporter

405
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,232
Kmsb

406
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,280
TV from 1990 2000

407
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:01,376
Eminent for covering probably the greatest live news stories like

408
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,192
2003 California wildfire on National

409
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:09,056
Victoria took proficient photography from 2014

410
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,616
2005 and began Graham Ledger photography

411
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,944
He seemed a few times on the radio

412
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,736
Including 210 FM

413
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,552
Seems

414
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,160
Now this is where it really ramped up

415
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:29,536
The bad grammar

416
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,840
Write a bio about how like

417
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,632
I was into drugs and humping

418
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,656
I'd really like

419
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,216
His name is G I would call it back grammar

420
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,520
That's a good idea

421
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
Puns

422
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,968
Well his show is called the daily life

423
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:52,832
Yeah you can do with that

424
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:57,952
21 G you could remake that movie

425
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:58,976
Please go ahead

426
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,792
7 G

427
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,520
Lyrics never keep any of astray

428
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,104
But here's my favorite one

429
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,664
Graham Ledger's this is under Graham Ledger's net worth

430
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,432
Salary

431
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,784
Graham Ledger without a doubt acquires a lot of Fortune

432
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:29,440
So is a hosting anchor he acquires a normal salary of 127,000 it's protected to state that he can

433
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,720
Conveys a net worth of milk

434
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:37,888
Fantastic I got translated and it's translated back

435
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
Seems like something

436
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,728
That's the reason the grammar is bad

437
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
He hasn't

438
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,312
Are you staying in Indy

439
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,848
That could be

440
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
Good for him

441
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:54,272
So the show interview does with

442
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,856
The show for the most part is

443
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,928
I didn't deal with the second half at all which is

444
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,744
AAA an interview with

445
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
What Josh Horowitz

446
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,840
The conservative reporter guy

447
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:12,704
It is one of the most racist like just out-and-out

448
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,520
Straight up nonstop races and then I just

449
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,824
And there was no point in doing anything

450
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,920
Maybe hate them for

451
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,224
Snow

452
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,272
Stay away from that

453
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,112
And here he has one of the more incoherent thing

454
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,440
We're dealing with because he has the same problem that Rogers

455
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,464
Is that Alex had

456
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,488
With Rodger Stone

457
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,792
It is a status imbalance

458
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,352
No no it doesn't seem like that

459
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,888
It's that Rodger Stone

460
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,912
Is

461
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:43,936
Telling you

462
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,704
If he goes to

463
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,288
The jail covid-19 will kill him

464
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,824
Dangerous thing in the world

465
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
Is going

466
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,176
To tell you that there is no problem

467
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
At all

468
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,504
With covid-19

469
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,832
Branch in the road is tough to

470
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,904
So we wind up bouncing back and forth

471
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,256
Invalidating everything simultaneously sometimes within the same sentence

472
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,304
But he starts off like this

473
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
All

474
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
Data

475
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
Driven

476
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,400
Not my opinion

477
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:21,824
So the deal is all raw data driven

478
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,128
He is about to tell us

479
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,408
All about

480
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:30,016
He is about to tell us the truth using only facts and

481
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,552
Sam

482
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
Exactly

483
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,600
Dragnet s***

484
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,392
Immediately after saying that

485
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976
Like the fact

486
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,256
This is the least

487
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,584
Weasel so-called Global pandemic history

488
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,376
500000

489
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:52,800
Is this is this true Jordan is it true then I don't know to tell this is

490
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,848
The least glow of this is the least

491
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,176
Lethal so-called Global pandemic

492
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:01,760
In history weaselly words

493
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,552
You could probably look at numbers and

494
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
History

495
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,856
Just go we'll go from there

496
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Sure

497
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,184
What do you how do you define a global pandemic

498
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,976
Touches the globe

499
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,512
Okay one side to the other

500
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
Sure okay

501
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,584
And then

502
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:19,680
Least lethal is he talking about percentages or

503
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,216
Numbers

504
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:27,872
He's 100,000 kind of believe that it would be a number of grow

505
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,688
I don't know

506
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
Okay

507
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,856
So sorry one

508
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:42,720
Is that the least lethal Global pandemic in history because we took steps or they took

509
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:46,304
Steps necessary to keep it from becoming a lethal global

510
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,400
Still I think the larger issue

511
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,448
It's not over yet

512
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
Good boy

513
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:57,568
How can you tell me in the middle of the global pandemic

514
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,104
This is the least lethal one

515
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,896
You know that's you saying

516
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,200
Well you don't need to act like this is a big deal

517
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,992
Until we make it the most

518
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
Lethal

519
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:12,160
Car wreck

520
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:16,768
The least lethal car wreck

521
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:21,632
Just

522
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,008
Dover Maybe

523
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
Other

524
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,968
Yeah start over

525
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
So

526
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,832
He's he's right at the gate this is the beginning of

527
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,624
Talking numbers

528
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:47,232
Already he has said something that neither makes sense nor can be

529
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,768
Dealt with

530
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,864
As if he understands wait a sec

531
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,424
I just said 500,000 people were dead

532
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,984
And I said this was not a big deal

533
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
He goes with that

534
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,824
Yes we just

535
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,128
A half a million deaths

536
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,664
By covid-19

537
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
Ladies and gentle

538
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,272
I am not intending to diminish

539
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,088
Any of these deaths by Corona

540
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,136
They were all human being

541
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,184
Alright Dan

542
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,744
What do you think his next words will be

543
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,536
Guessing

544
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,328
Stars

545
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,352
Yelp

546
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,168
I don't know these people are like

547
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:31,008
Like you know their pool balls like a break in any direction I don't know

548
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,056
But I know it's going to start with but

549
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:37,920
But is the cue ball that's about to hit

550
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,456
Unpredictable directions

551
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,992
They're all humans

552
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,016
But

553
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,624
I don't know

554
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,416
Go for it

555
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,976
But that number is apolitical

556
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,256
Statistical

557
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,024
Joke

558
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,072
I don't know what that means

559
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:59,936
Also how can you start with I'm not trying to diminish any of these deaths

560
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,960
And end with

561
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,240
It's a joke

562
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,800
The number is apolitical

563
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,080
Statistical joke

564
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,128
Okay

565
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,736
Alright in what way does that not every single death

566
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:18,880
I mean I guess what he's trying to say is probably that the numbers used

567
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
Political

568
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,464
Shiraz or whatever

569
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:29,888
Stated objective of just using the facts and the numbers

570
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,912
Because

571
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,984
You still now has to talk about that five.

572
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
But

573
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:40,384
But that seems as soon as I can

574
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,200
Trapped himself in a bit of a weirdo

575
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,224
Cucumber

576
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,272
Men's pickle

577
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,832
He's got his own SodaStream right now

578
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,624
So yeah

579
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,672
Already this is just the first two men

580
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,952
Of his

581
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,744
And he is already said

582
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,024
3

583
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,304
Conflicting things

584
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,584
That don't make any sense

585
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,120
At the same time

586
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,680
He's tried to say he's having it both ways

587
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,216
As much as he possibly

588
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,032
And he knows what he's doing to

589
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,824
Like even now even with this

590
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,104
He said something like this

591
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,688
There are somewhat 6 billion +

592
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:17,760
Or minus a few hundred million people on the planet

593
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,576
Half a million

594
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,392
Is not statistically relevant

595
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,000
Add in this country to death by covid-19 numbers are not

596
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,048
Repeat

597
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
Not

598
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,608
Pranking

599
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:37,472
Broadcaster

600
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,288
Because 500

601
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
That sounds like

602
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,592
A lot of people

603
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:52,576
I respect

604
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,136
To donate

605
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,952
You got convinced

606
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,488
What's up

607
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,816
Just talkin about

608
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,608
Furthermore

609
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,400
How many

610
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:10,240
The people are on the planet

611
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:15,872
This guy has all the facts all the numbers

612
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,712
Big World popular

613
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,760
Was a big deal when it cross

614
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
The seven

615
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:28,416
Seven points now

616
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,768
6

617
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,608
But you know what comes from

618
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:43,264
I don't know I feel like a lot of the time that population was a big deal was around

619
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,592
What's the time when it might have been around

620
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,504
You know a lot of the arguments about

621
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
6

622
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,904
M4

623
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,952
I think a lot of people probably

624
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,488
Regurgitating stuff

625
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,768
From both timer

626
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,096
And that might be why it's sort of shorthand for the population

627
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:14,496
It could be talking about

628
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,544
Do under half a billion or whatever

629
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,152
We talked about

630
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,480
Updated there

631
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,760
The references

632
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,552
And normally I'm fine with that

633
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:29,856
This guy

634
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,648
Opens his Broadcasting

635
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,696
He's going to give us all the numbers and all the facts

636
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,720
And multiple times

637
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,256
He does exactly what Alex

638
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,304
Yeah that's fair

639
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,584
Hours of research

640
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,424
Hours of Richard's to all of these numbers

641
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,264
This morning

642
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,824
You should probably get

643
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,592
The

644
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:54,944
Imagine that you saw that number at some point doing all your

645
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,272
Search

646
00:33:59,296 --> 00:33:59,808
Spiking

647
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
Right makes it very

648
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,648
But a little bit

649
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,416
This is his neck

650
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,720
Immediately after

651
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
Outside of a

652
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:12,864
Huge data dump on June 25th thanks to the governor of New Jersey

653
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,912
Thank you so much mr. Murphy

654
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,448
Yasso

655
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:21,568
Outside

656
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:28,480
Thanks New Jersey

657
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:33,600
The governor of New Jersey

658
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:38,976
So that would explain why his

659
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,536
Review data dump

660
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,632
He's responsible for a lot

661
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
Absolute

662
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:51,520
And continues on he just does this whole thing over and over and over

663
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,848
Not a big deal there's no problem

664
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,872
No I know there's a

665
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,760
Everybody

666
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:06,112
That's the whole thing huh

667
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,928
Okay it's not a problem I know it's a problem

668
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
Yeah

669
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:17,888
Scary number ever told you about the 30

670
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,680
Where do you even get sir

671
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,960
Magic

672
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,264
Good them

673
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,568
And most of this is just constant

674
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,592
Covington

675
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
This is what he's

676
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,664
No difference

677
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,200
Then previous years

678
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,480
Why is this

679
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,016
This is why

680
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,832
If covid-19 is such a killer virus

681
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,904
Then we would be seeing an increase

682
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,976
In the sheer number of dead American

683
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,792
Compared to previous years

684
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,560
Right

685
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,096
But we're not

686
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:52,192
Just not true

687
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:52,960
Number is

688
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,240
Look pretty

689
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:58,848
Pretty shocking particularly in areas that are have heavily affected without breaks

690
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,152
Up to as high as 40%

691
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:13,696
Excess deaths numbers for a lot of portions of the country but New York

692
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,488
Financial Times

693
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,560
Analysis is like

694
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,120
Tons of other countries that were showing

695
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,656
Massive jumps

696
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,216
In terms of excess deaths

697
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,264
I don't have any

698
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:33,920
Reason to believe him unless he can demonstrate that compelling evidence

699
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,224
A lot more.

700
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,784
No one no one denies that

701
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,832
Except for people who just stay there is

702
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,904
Yeah like this is 290 all the number

703
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,208
I don't know who they the same time it start

704
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,536
Hard for him to prove a negative

705
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,584
To prove that there aren't more deaths

706
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,864
You just have to

707
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,632
You know

708
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,912
Deal with the thing

709
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,704
Like

710
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,520
The sources that are saying that there are

711
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:04,896
Ensure why they're wrong

712
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,688
What he does have interest

713
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,248
Just wild

714
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,528
He follows that

715
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,296
Clam up

716
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,624
That the deaths aren't speaking with this line

717
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,440
Are you listening California

718
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,488
And the people of Illinois

719
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,024
New York

720
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
You're being a hoe

721
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,864
You're being lied to

722
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,424
I got distracted cuz I realized he was talking

723
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:35,360
I just like the inadvertently admitted directly to our faces

724
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,920
You're being lied to I'm lying to you

725
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,456
Just lied to you

726
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,528
Just two on the

727
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,440
I know I'm being unfair about

728
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,304
Right on that why

729
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,424
I guess I just don't like

730
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,448
Hit people just

731
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,240
It's being like it's not happening

732
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,264
Wake up

733
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:08,384
They're lying to you

734
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,664
Alex yelling

735
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:10,944
But wake up

736
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,248
Two people that he's trying to keep him

737
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,528
Delusional

738
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
Absolutely

739
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,624
It's just it's just

740
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,416
Immensely annoying to me

741
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:24,256
Especially whenever they use the second person that's whenever it

742
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,048
Okay now you're talkin

743
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
Sing directly to me

744
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:31,680
Telling me that they're doing the thing that you're literally doing in those

745
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:34,240
Name the state

746
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,032
I'm taking it personal

747
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,824
Sure

748
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:42,688
Ledger meet me at Portillo's we're going to

749
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,928
Are you okay

750
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,720
That's good stuff

751
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,536
And so it just keeps doing this

752
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,608
Kind of it's just a

753
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,632
Constant like back in

754
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,400
You know

755
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,936
With the with his next

756
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,472
If you happen to have

757
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,752
I want one in a nursing

758
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
New York

759
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,896
Those facilities

760
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,272
Which was to issue debt

761
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,320
Thousands of elderly

762
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,856
Porcine

763
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,136
Nursing homes

764
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,928
To accept covid-19 page

765
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,464
Absolutely outrageous

766
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,536
4500 covid-19 page

767
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,304
Dad

768
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,864
After Cuomo's March 2500

769
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,704
It is the highest rate of nursing home deaths

770
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
In the

771
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
Again

772
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,032
The numbers

773
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,056
Do

774
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:41,824
Not

775
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
Why

776
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,896
That's just another Alex Naruto

777
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,688
That's something we've seen Alex talk about a bit

778
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,760
Option in there

779
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,040
That is like

780
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,576
Can you afford

781
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,344
2

782
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,136
Care for your pet

783
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,952
Whoever you have your loved one is at home

784
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,000
Yep are you able to provide the

785
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:03,328
Specific kind of care if they have a condition that they need

786
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,656
To be taken care of you probably can't

787
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:10,496
So he's telling people to do something they probably couldn't do

788
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,776
To avert something

789
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,896
Damn

790
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,176
Eddie immediately

791
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,992
No it's not

792
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,040
Billion or even care about

793
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:28,672
Unless you're old

794
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:34,816
Stop

795
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,728
Isn't really

796
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,520
A coherent reason why

797
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,568
One is and one isn't

798
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:48,640
No except for it

799
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,664
Exactly

800
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,200
This is

801
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,016
Don't worry about it

802
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:58,368
Everybody's dying your nursing homes cuz part was telling that right but I mean

803
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,304
Unless you're in New York

804
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,864
In which case it's even more

805
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:15,264
Like it's this isn't a big deal unless you're in a blue State and you happen to be somebody who is likely to be in my audience

806
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:18,848
Exactly

807
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,176
He does

808
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,224
Is he starts talking to

809
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,272
Governor news

810
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,600
Does it the same he doesn't Alex Jones

811
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:33,184
Hanover on the Left Coast pretty much the same thing

812
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,464
Just as bad

813
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,744
Frankly if not worse

814
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
From the

815
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,536
Slick

816
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,304
Marxist

817
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
Nutcase

818
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
Gavin Newsom

819
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,656
Covid-19

820
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,704
Summer recess

821
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,520
Summer vacation

822
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,080
Another body language

823
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,128
Looking is Jaws

824
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:52,895
Clancy's

825
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,455
He's moving around

826
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:59,551
He's showing California residents and the rest of the world

827
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,831
But he's mad

828
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:01,855
Mad

829
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,879
Maps.

830
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:09,535
Do that a lot of people say like stop

831
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,303
The fly

832
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
Canstaff

833
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:19,007
I think Alex does it and it's more fun or more interesting at least because he's like so emotion

834
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,543
Affected by whatever

835
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,871
It's more Showmanship to it than that

836
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,151
That was very

837
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,479
Now my my notes on that are

838
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,015
You're so disappointed

839
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:36,415
Pointing this is Governor Newsom is a demon what are you doing

840
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,183
Marxist

841
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:48,447
They don't have a slugger

842
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,471
Pick me up I hate it

843
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:53,823
And then goes into this whole thing and he points

844
00:42:55,103 --> 00:43:00,991
And that Newsome is trying to close down the bars and he's doing all this s*** to try and keep young people from spreading device

845
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,575
And it's spreading mostly among

846
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,367
Young people which the governor is

847
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,415
He's trying to punish here right now

848
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,023
Because we know that younger people

849
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,839
The demographic of somewhere in the neighborhood of

850
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:19,167
0222 30 years old

851
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,471
Has almost 80 mortality

852
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,543
Many of these young people running around

853
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,823
At and many of them

854
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,359
Contract the virus but

855
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,895
Have no antibodies

856
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,967
Because their body fought It Off the Grid

857
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,527
There's no antibodies showing up in in the blood work

858
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,319
Amazing

859
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,135
I got my brow

860
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,951
Rodi you do I can see some confusion

861
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,863
If your body fought it off successfully that would lead to antibiotic

862
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,143
Yes

863
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,703
Unless you fight it off

864
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:59,359
So 6 I don't even understand

865
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,383
You can't even find it

866
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,151
Right

867
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:01,919
Okay

868
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,039
Don't know what's going on anymore

869
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,879
I don't even know the ideas that are attempting to be expressed here

870
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,671
Quite frankly

871
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,047
I mean I guess there's a way to make this coherent on some level

872
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:18,815
I mean

873
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,375
If he bad and I wouldn't I wouldn't support this

874
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:27,519
But like if you was going around being like yeah Unger have a lesson

875
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,543
Granted

876
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,335
Summer still going to die

877
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,735
Hey let's go let all these young people go out to bars and all this stuff won't be as bad

878
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:40,575
Make sure that nobody

879
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:46,975
Is immunocompromised or has a pre-existing condition or is over the age of 40 something I can go to work

880
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:53,375
Let's

881
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:57,215
In order for you to be able to go to Dick's Last Resort

882
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:08,991
But that's not a restaurant Chicago

883
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:13,343
Dick's Last Resort is 260

884
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:19,743
I've never been to Dick's Last Resort downtown Chicago

885
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:25,375
I was like

886
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:29,471
I could come up with a better bar I could have gone with

887
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,239
Anything

888
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,263
Dick's Last Resort

889
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
That's what we're doing

890
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,359
Cabo Wabo

891
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,663
At least named after alcohol

892
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,479
New twenty-year-olds going to Cabo Wabo

893
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,367
And he does this knowing full but like he's

894
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
Talking about the mortality

895
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,743
Many of the young people are running around 8

896
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,279
Alright

897
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,559
How can you tell me

898
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,351
You know like oh man

899
00:45:56,607 --> 00:46:02,751
All these old people in nursing homes are dying all the time and it's those single worst thing in the world

900
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,823
We should definitely let their kids run around asymptomatic

901
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,847
And then

902
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,127
No visit them

903
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,407
Sure

904
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:14,271
Asymptomatic vs. pre-symptomatic Tucson clear at any point

905
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:17,343
What you we are where you are if you are

906
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,367
If you're going

907
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:21,183
To develop symptoms eventually or if you are going to

908
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,719
To be truly asymptomatic

909
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:25,023
Through the course of your

910
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,047
Your illness

911
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,911
Yeah it's dangerous it just beeps stupid

912
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:36,543
Unless you want to like I said.

913
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,591
Isolate people just so

914
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,383
You could go to bars

915
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,919
Or whatever

916
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:47,039
You should still baby wear a mask at the bar

917
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,087
Is that Governor Newsom is

918
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,623
Punishing you for going out

919
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,439
Out to a bar. Okay

920
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,023
But the governor yes while he's shedding

921
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,303
Shoot himself in the foot

922
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,839
He also realizes

923
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,119
Teddy's continuing to

924
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,399
Strangle

925
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,679
The economy

926
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,727
His little piece of the u.s.

927
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:06,495
Economy

928
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,519
Which Harms

929
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,543
The real action

930
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,311
Chances

931
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
Donald

932
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,639
Trump so he's still at it

933
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,175
And he's still going to be at it

934
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,199
Straight

935
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,735
Through November

936
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:18,783
His account

937
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:19,807
As much

938
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,087
As possible

939
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,367
In order to harm the re-election

940
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:30,303
As boring as hell

941
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:36,703
Reason why I was not able to find a grip on this network

942
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,335
And he's he's doing that it like

943
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,383
It doesn't get more

944
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,151
Globalist

945
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,711
Kind of nonsense whenever you're saying

946
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,735
Okay so yeah

947
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:55,135
The governor is shooting himself in the middle part of the US economy

948
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,951
California's economy illegal

949
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,791
Top 25 GDP in the world

950
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:04,863
But also

951
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,631
At the same time

952
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,167
Newsom is doing this on

953
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:07,935
Purpose

954
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,983
In order to hurt Donald Trump's real

955
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,799
The reason that is that is

956
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,567
McKay's

957
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,335
Babe

958
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,383
That also hurt Gavin Newsom

959
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,663
Re-election chances

960
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:22,783
Because he completely Torpedoes California's economy California probably the movie Life

961
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,319
Keep this guy around

962
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,623
Think about that one

963
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,903
You're dumb Ledger

964
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,183
Here's the bigger

965
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:32,255
Alright at no point in time cuz

966
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,023
Cisse

967
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,559
Trump could do something

968
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,375
He's the

969
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:41,471
Is destroying his own

970
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,007
Could literally be like hey

971
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:46,335
Here's money we've got a new support package

972
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,615
And then the economy does

973
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:57,599
Trump could solve that problem if you wanted to

974
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,207
In terms of like

975
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:05,023
Ensure that local businesses don't have to close

976
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:09,375
People don't end up

977
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,959
There's a number of things that it would just be policy

978
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:13,983
Decisions

979
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,263
They could be made from

980
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:22,687
So what

981
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:25,503
Course not subset of

982
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,527
Doesn't have

983
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,551
A real

984
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,367
No because the answer is

985
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,135
Obvious

986
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,159
And I don't want to do it

987
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,719
So instead they'll blame others

988
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,279
Doing

989
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,559
The thing that they could do

990
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,095
Easily

991
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,887
Yeah and it's all an attack

992
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:42,911
To dry and hurt

993
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:43,935
You got it

994
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,495
Everything is Everything

995
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:49,311
Poorly delivered until were stalking coin

996
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,359
This is all just

997
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,127
The same

998
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:59,039
I'm listening to update

999
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,087
This morning

1000
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:14,399
Disappointed

1001
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,215
Decent chance that eventually someone with

1002
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:17,983
Chops

1003
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,007
Will

1004
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:19,775
End up

1005
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,311
I mean

1006
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,335
You gotta think it's

1007
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,615
The president is

1008
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,175
Retweeting there

1009
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,735
Network

1010
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:32,063
All this stuff you got to assume that some enterprising grifter

1011
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,343
Who has chops

1012
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,391
He's going to end up there

1013
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:39,487
Problem I see is that like a lot of people

1014
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,279
Is younger set

1015
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:45,375
They seem to gravitate towards Harter extremism then could be

1016
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:47,423
Motivator fit into that slot

1017
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:50,495
You need somebody who's a sell-out and good

1018
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,311
And someone like you

1019
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,847
Phuc yea

1020
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:57,151
Extreme

1021
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,175
Couldn't do it

1022
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:02,527
You need you need like a sell-out like a harder sell out version of 20

1023
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,575
In their game over

1024
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,111
Devastator

1025
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,159
Do you know what my suspension on that is what's up

1026
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,975
The hard like those guys who are talented

1027
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,767
They stay on the inner

1028
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,839
They're not going to one America news

1029
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,119
They're not looking

1030
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,911
Co-anchor job

1031
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:23,775
Yeah you know to create their own like space

1032
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,823
Because that's part of the

1033
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,103
Darkest part of the internet

1034
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:33,503
That creates that more rabbit situate editors and bosses

1035
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,855
So he continues with the

1036
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:38,623
The

1037
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,647
Governor Newsom little

1038
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,183
He's pissed off about

1039
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,487
Can't let Governor Newsom

1040
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,535
Hasn't gone away

1041
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,351
I know a lot of us about kicking to get warm

1042
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,423
Once it gets hot all goes away

1043
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:55,775
On this next

1044
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:56,799
You stopping the tape

1045
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,079
What

1046
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,871
What do you think he's going to say

1047
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,735
If it's hotter

1048
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,319
Then the virus

1049
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,087
Good

1050
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,623
Because you know

1051
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:14,975
Temperature rises

1052
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,767
It's already done

1053
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,047
Really close

1054
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:20,607
You know I checked the number this is my job

1055
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,423
Everyday

1056
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,727
Australian beaten interest

1057
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,543
When you look at El Salvador

1058
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,847
And you look at the Philippines

1059
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,151
And you look at Thailand

1060
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,687
And you look at Vietnam

1061
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,223
Those areas have

1062
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,759
Warm weather

1063
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,551
And high humidity

1064
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,831
High temperature high

1065
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:41,855
Combination

1066
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,391
Their cases are in the Hunter

1067
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,207
Unsold

1068
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,815
Sure

1069
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,655
Those the only high temperature

1070
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:58,495
Are we sure we're not selecting for some other variable

1071
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,591
Are you single problem with that logic

1072
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,127
Obviously

1073
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:09,759
It's just like oh okay so you're saying that he doesn't kill the virus

1074
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,575
Look at El Salvador

1075
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,623
One place where I know it

1076
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:17,183
It can be hot anywhere

1077
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,719
No more virus if it's summer

1078
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:23,327
Yeah that's bad bad

1079
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,095
That's it like

1080
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,887
This is honestly

1081
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:31,263
On You episode

1082
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:35,615
Experiential is like I'm listening to

1083
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,919
And I'm not even interested in this guy's bulshit

1084
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:42,527
That's what I'm for though

1085
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,575
You're not interested Robert Jeffress

1086
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:51,231
People to use the weekend never speak of them at least a little bit boring

1087
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,023
Free game

1088
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:55,071
This guy is just like

1089
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,375
A junior varsity

1090
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,191
Alex

1091
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,727
Makes me gravitate towards

1092
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:02,495
And being

1093
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:07,359
Interesting or even scary I mean it's just somebody who's

1094
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,895
S***

1095
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,919
Kind of

1096
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,991
But in such a way that is like

1097
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,039
I find it

1098
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:21,951
It's dangerous.

1099
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,231
From a critical perspective

1100
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:25,791
In terms of

1101
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,071
Being interested

1102
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,887
Which is something that I need in order to

1103
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,655
You keep doing

1104
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,727
Fails

1105
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,519
Why we only do one episode on him

1106
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,383
Performance review

1107
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,711
I have spent

1108
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,247
Place of uterus

1109
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:57,791
But I'd listen to maybe 3 minutes of you

1110
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:08,799
They're counting them in the hundreds Vietnam has zero

1111
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,103
0 deaths

1112
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:16,479
Know how good their accounting is

1113
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,551
Yes

1114
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,599
As the weather gets warmer

1115
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,159
As the humidity rise

1116
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,695
It helps

1117
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,719
Beatbox

1118
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,999
The transmission

1119
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,279
This spread

1120
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,559
Virus

1121
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,607
Something this guy

1122
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,375
Will

1123
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,143
Not

1124
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:34,911
Admit

1125
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:40,031
When somebody says the bottom line is something after

1126
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:42,591
Using a couple of examples of why

1127
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:48,479
Sure they're not doing any testing but they've got zero.

1128
00:55:56,927 --> 00:56:03,071
I just lost his match against beat me fair and square that's all Grace

1129
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,679
Yep

1130
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:17,151
Vietnam

1131
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:21,247
Bottom line

1132
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,879
Linguistically

1133
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:33,535
If you have trouble with that sense of yours and you're watching that and I guess it makes sense problem is

1134
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,815
Not him

1135
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:38,911
The problem isn't the problem

1136
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,703
Send

1137
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,983
Comprehension

1138
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,543
That's troubling

1139
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,591
The interesting thing

1140
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:47,871
This is something that I was

1141
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,895
Expecting to look into

1142
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:49,919
And be like

1143
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:50,943
Wouldn't it

1144
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:53,759
You're telling me that humidity

1145
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,295
Stops viruses from

1146
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,671
I looked it up and there is a little bit of evidence

1147
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,231
Maybe possible

1148
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,535
That seasonal changes could affect

1149
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,327
The spread of the virus

1150
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:10,911
Some scientific

1151
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,935
Count on it

1152
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:15,775
The case for every virus or illness

1153
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,823
Is debatable

1154
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,871
And the extent to which

1155
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,663
Like it even is

1156
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,735
To discuss is like

1157
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,879
Difference

1158
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,183
NIH director

1159
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,743
As far as

1160
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:39,583
That goes cuz I looked into it and I was like maybe there is something to

1161
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:45,471
The researchers at the NIH ran three

1162
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,775
Turn scenarios based on the role of climate in

1163
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,055
In the spread of other virus

1164
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,383
You know like oc43 nhq

1165
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,663
KU won

1166
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,455
Better known to cause common cold

1167
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:57,503
In all three scenarios

1168
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,063
Their models showed that climate only would

1169
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,367
Become an important seasonal factor in

1170
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,391
Controlling covid-19

1171
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,439
What's a large proportion of

1172
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,975
People within a given community

1173
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,535
Right now before that

1174
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:13,119
Because sorry is CO2 is as sensitive to

1175
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,143
You claim it as others

1176
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:14,911
Viruses

1177
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:17,727
Summer heat still wouldn't be enough to mitigate

1178
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,007
The spread

1179
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:19,775
Rue

1180
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,335
So that makes sense I'm exactly

1181
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,359
But it could

1182
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,663
It could have an incremental

1183
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:28,991
Ofac even like

1184
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,271
Talking about

1185
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,807
In terms of like I wanted

1186
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,599
Once it gets warm will be good

1187
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:41,279
If you would like to go back to how El Salvador and Vietnam have

1188
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,815
Wonderful climates and everything

1189
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:50,751
Well climates like Brazil Ecuador

1190
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:57,919
Loading summer when it's summer

1191
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,711
Yeah

1192
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,527
Is other parts of the world have different seasons

1193
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:06,111
He's in San Diego he doesn't know about

1194
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,135
Come on now

1195
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:07,903
Yeah

1196
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:11,231
Brazil

1197
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,511
It's a dry heat

1198
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:19,935
Give me Amazon

1199
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,287
Brazilian dry forest

1200
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,847
So very so very good

1201
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:31,967
He continues on though he Powers through all of this terrible nuns

1202
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:35,039
What's the opposite of saying you gotta respect that

1203
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,831
I probably what he says

1204
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,111
We have to

1205
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:38,879
Sober up

1206
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,415
To this is

1207
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,463
This is getting back to Noosa

1208
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,767
Still in the first

1209
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:48,607
First wave in a second wave we're still in the first wave

1210
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,167
We we are

1211
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,191
Still in

1212
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:52,959
The first wave

1213
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:56,031
Going to wave that all you did was kind of

1214
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,311
Slow down

1215
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,335
And then

1216
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,615
You Unleashed it

1217
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:02,431
When you said over going to start opening up again he had

1218
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:05,247
If he had his way

1219
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:06,783
He would have kept

1220
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,343
They California, shut down straight through November

1221
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,623
In order to

1222
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,903
Free hat

1223
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,743
Honestly lost

1224
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,023
In terms of

1225
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,047
How that's supposed

1226
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,583
To help the right-wing argument

1227
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,375
Yep because

1228
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:24,703
If I'm tracking this correctly

1229
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,239
He's saying

1230
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:29,055
He said there is a first wave that happen

1231
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:36,735
The old medication measures like distancing mask-wearing closing businesses

1232
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:39,039
Successfully hold back

1233
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,831
Right

1234
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:45,951
Everybody was discussing at the time

1235
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:51,327
And they had to reopen things because there was a ton of pressure is now

1236
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:58,751
Did no longer being held back the first wave is now researching

1237
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:06,687
He said you just take a slightly different approach to this time he sounds

1238
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:12,319
Like like he's advocating

1239
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:14,623
Somehow you saying that like it's

1240
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:19,231
See what happened was

1241
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:22,047
We shut down the economy

1242
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:29,727
I'm surprised because we didn't shut down long enough

1243
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:32,287
Which is what governor Newsom wanted to do

1244
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,055
By the way

1245
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,919
And that's Governor Newsom

1246
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,199
Yep

1247
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:43,295
I don't understand anybody listening

1248
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,599
Phuc yea

1249
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:49,439
Let alone

1250
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,999
That's what is

1251
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,791
This is what passes for brilliant

1252
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:59,935
Yeah and she prescribed

1253
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,703
Because

1254
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:04,543
Vacations to be understood

1255
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,895
Has nothing been done earlier

1256
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:15,551
Hospitals overwhelmed

1257
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,087
Nintendo cases everywhere

1258
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:20,415
So obviously that's not what

1259
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,463
So

1260
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,767
Does recognize that the measures were

1261
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,095
Refuses to wear a mask

1262
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,119
Great

1263
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,679
He did

1264
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:35,775
Can't really be saying shut down

1265
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:37,567
Because that's part of

1266
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:44,223
Marriage results

1267
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:48,319
You can't be saying the businesses should have reopened

1268
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:51,135
Because he's saying that that is with leading to this

1269
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,695
Rising number of cases

1270
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:57,535
You can't be saying that businesses should be re closed

1271
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:03,679
No cuz that'll hurt the economy

1272
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:10,847
I don't honestly see what boobs other than

1273
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:14,175
And pretend like everything is an attack on now he's hero

1274
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:21,087
I don't I don't understand how there's any semblance of his being productive

1275
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,879
What is him

1276
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:27,999
Immediately discounting it and then just continuing on like you proved

1277
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,791
What are you trying to say

1278
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:32,863
I hate to see this he's more confusing than Alex

1279
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,911
This is nonsense

1280
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:37,215
I don't understand any of

1281
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,519
And he does

1282
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,543
Not give

1283
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,407
So Americans in all states

1284
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,711
From Texas to Florida California

1285
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:53,087
You can listen to the mainstream media breathlessly misreport the spread of covid-19

1286
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:55,135
Or you can do your homework like I do

1287
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,159
Day in and day out

1288
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:59,999
The truth about covid-19 lies in the date

1289
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:02,303
And the truth is Corona is not the leaf

1290
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,071
Threat

1291
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,607
Majority

1292
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,911
American population

1293
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,239
So there you go

1294
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,519
It doesn't matter

1295
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:12,799
It doesn't mean anything

1296
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,615
No sure they're 120,000

1297
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:18,175
You know compared to

1298
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:19,711
6 billion Dam

1299
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:25,599
The gigantic number that six billion about the time

1300
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,391
Here's another way

1301
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,463
Big number

1302
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:32,767
So

1303
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,047
According to the FBI

1304
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,375
They're about 16,000 murders per year

1305
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,143
Bright

1306
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,447
Only solve

1307
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,727
And don't really

1308
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,751
Prevent

1309
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:43,775
About

1310
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,799
47%

1311
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,615
So

1312
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,639
That means that

1313
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,687
The threat to you America

1314
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:51,967
Is practice

1315
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:52,735
Nothing

1316
01:04:55,551 --> 01:05:01,695
Finally get rid of

1317
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,231
Oh yeah

1318
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,767
His argument is perf

1319
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,815
If you use

1320
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,863
If you use his

1321
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:14,751
He's set up for himself

1322
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,847
It's it's nuts

1323
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:21,663
And anybody knows that a functioning Society

1324
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:22,687
Cares

1325
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:25,759
Even if it's not a threat to everyone

1326
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:26,527
You should

1327
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,551
Right

1328
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:28,831
It seemed simple

1329
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:32,159
And he is at home

1330
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:38,815
All right so finally we get to the main events we get to our boy Rogers

1331
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,607
Introduction

1332
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:45,215
From Fort Lauderdale Florida political consultant

1333
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:46,239
And former Trump

1334
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:48,287
Surrogate Rodger Stone Rodger

1335
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:50,335
Trump as a racist

1336
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:52,127
Because they are deathly afraid

1337
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:56,735
That he is going to pick up a larger percentage of the black vote

1338
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,759
Come November

1339
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,039
And they attack

1340
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,575
You and they have a

1341
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,855
You

1342
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:04,159
Because you are a proxy

1343
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,951
For President Trump

1344
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:10,303
Glass shops

1345
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,679
Turns out

1346
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:21,567
Parkrose

1347
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:26,175
How do you say the speaker at every single

1348
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:29,247
Every pie

1349
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,295
I just love the

1350
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:33,087
That was a complete non sequitur

1351
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:38,975
They want to call Trump a racist because he's going to

1352
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:40,255
They never speak of races

1353
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:44,607
I never speak of any of that ever again

1354
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,375
You just start

1355
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,167
Introduces

1356
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:47,935
Yeah

1357
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,703
Yah mean

1358
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,799
I think they probably is also great like

1359
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,591
Solid analysis

1360
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,639
The people called Trump raises cuz they're afraid

1361
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:59,199
Going to win more video

1362
01:06:59,455 --> 01:06:59,967
Oh yeah

1363
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:02,015
Seems like

1364
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:08,415
That's why we got to lie about

1365
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:11,231
6%

1366
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,559
Cool

1367
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,327
Call Maurice's

1368
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,423
That's cuz

1369
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,191
He is

1370
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:20,959
You bet

1371
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,007
And this is where

1372
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,799
Stone begins to

1373
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,567
Bag

1374
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:26,591
Beg

1375
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,151
For President Trump

1376
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:31,455

It's only a couple

1385
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,071
Weeks

1386
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:47,839
You have

1387
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:50,655
A lot more work to do between now and then because this

Does narcotic

1391
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:57,311
It does not quite cut it

1392
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:59,615
So far going on Alex the show

1393
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:04,479

But we have qualified

1396
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:08,831
Congratulation

1397
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,623
For getting two weeks off

1398
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:13,695
He was trying to get a further

1399
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,231
Yeah yeah yeah

1400
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:19,583
Congratulations

1401
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:20,607
Oh yeah

1402
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,935
Stone is going to get to work

1403
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,727
This is where he's going to start back

1404
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:27,007
He knows what to do

1405
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,567
Majority in the house

1406
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,591
Concerned about the

1407
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:31,359
Dangers of

1408
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:33,151
Covid-19 virus

1409
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:35,199
The same time

1410
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,991
They support my being sent

1411
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,527
Hue

1412
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:39,295
Facility

1413
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,063
Georgia

1414
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,087
Worthy

1415
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:42,111
Danger

1416
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:42,879
Covid-19

1417
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:44,927
Infection

1418
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,487
He 7 years old

1419
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:51,327
Is extraordinarily

1420
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:57,727
This is a really good play on his part because it is something that's real Jason

1421
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:00,799
I don't trust him

1422
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:06,431
More Center I care more about it if he was still circulating and making this appeal

1423
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,455
On Networks

1424
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:09,759
They first of all took covid seriously

1425
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:12,319
Screaming about

1426
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:18,719
Then releasing murderers into the streets because of covid-19

1427
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:22,815
Rodger Stone eating to not go to

1428
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,839
Prison

1429
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,119
Environment

1430
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:31,519
Minimum security type situation

1431
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,543
That facility

1432
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:36,127
More seriously if it wasn't

1433
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,151
Being

1434
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:43,039
Distributed by people who have tried to fear about not letting people out

1435
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,599
Based on these very same concern

1436
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:46,623
It's Discord

1437
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,415
I don't I don't appreciate it

1438
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:50,207
No it's it's cognitive dissonance

1439
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:53,791
He's doing this on a show where just five minutes earlier

1440
01:09:54,303 --> 01:10:00,191
The guy said well we should let young people out all the time sure they're so asymptomatic

1441
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,727
Smith a virus

1442
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:04,799
They don't know anybody like Rodger Stone

1443
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,335
Somebody who's 65

1444
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:09,151
With a history of asthma

1445
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,687
Is also at

1446
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:13,503
The most dangerous risk from the covid-19

1447
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,551
How does Graham not know

1448
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:20,415
Somebody twenty-year-old

1449
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:25,023
Someone with a broken bottle

1450
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:28,351
Give him covid-19 from going to the bars

1451
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,655
I just made a compelling argument for why G

1452
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:34,751
I think you just wrote Conair 2

1453
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,799
David Gray

1454
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,919
These people doing this desperate

1455
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:44,479
Self-contradictory nonsense

1456
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,015
I wish

1457
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:49,087
Rodger Stone does lead into it

1458
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:49,855
Hard

1459
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:53,695
And went around on all these shows I was like

1460
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:56,511
Gather a dirty dozen

1461
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,559
I'm breaking out

1462
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:04,447
There's no convincing Amy Berman Jackson

1463
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:08,287
So what I'm doing is I'm putting together a team to break me out

1464
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:12,127
Like why not just do that ahead of time

1465
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:17,247
Explosives guy

1466
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:20,831
Need a Spaceman

1467
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,903
Somebody who's really good at picking locks

1468
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:27,743
He's just going on shows any like recruiting the hose

1469
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:31,839
He's like

1470
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,375
Listeners

1471
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:43,615
Motorcycle

1472
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:50,527
Why the f*** not because if it's been Rodger your girlfriend

1473
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:55,391
Look for rest of your life a parody

1474
01:11:55,903 --> 01:12:00,511
That's how you could have penance

1475
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:08,191
You've lived your life like it in secret silly supervillain

1476
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:12,031
We build a laser to break out of this prison

1477
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,055
Exactly

1478
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:21,247
Are that plan Alicia interviews on dammit

1479
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:24,831
Rodger

1480
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:28,671
Could do it

1481
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:38,399
He's in a position where he's about to go to prison

1482
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:45,055
No one else is ever going to be in this position where you may be meddled with an election and now you're going to

1483
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:48,127
The prison and your

1484
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:51,455
F****** give you a pardon that he hasn't given you yet you still B

1485
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:55,295
So why not cover your bases to get a super villain

1486
01:12:55,807 --> 01:13:00,415
Bacon

1487
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:09,375
And stone has a moral responsibility

1488
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:13,215
To fulfill his purpose

1489
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:15,519
Elon Musk keep builds tunnels

1490
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,079
Before we continue this meeting

1491
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:19,359
No one can wear mask

1492
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,127
Tamale break

1493
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,223
The one rule

1494
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:25,759
The big guy stands up in jail

1495
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:29,343
Alright we're going to need new muscle

1496
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:32,415
Alright pisses me off

1497
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,183
Yeah

1498
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,231
Lean into it Rodger

1499
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,255
Do better

1500
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:51,615
What's a really good point

1501
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,151
Cuz he thinks you might actually

1502
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,943
That's a big difference

1503
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,479
See that's what

1504
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:59,039
Trump needs to send him a quiet man

1505
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:02,623
Don't worry about it you're getting a pardon on July 13th

1506
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:03,903
Everything's cool

1507
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,927
Go hard

1508
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:10,303
If you contact

1509
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:14,143
I have a lot of bad press on me guess what would help with that

1510
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,935
Mr. penguin

1511
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:22,335
I could pardon Rodger I would pardon him if he did

1512
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:29,759
Actually it's because people would probably end up

1513
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:31,807
Tried to blow up prisons

1514
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:38,975
That's true in a movie it's funny but the real-world probably would get way out of hand

1515
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:39,743
About Hospital

1516
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:40,767
Through

1517
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,559
That would be bad in real life I wouldn't like

1518
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,583
Like that

1519
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:44,863
Call

1520
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,887
Continue

1521
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:49,983
Always not his fault guess whose are villainous

1522
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,031
Wait where do I get the gas

1523
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,055
Okay

1524
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:00,735
Nope right back to judge Jack

1525
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,271
We made a motion

1526
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,295
Before judge Jack

1527
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,087
Based on the

1528
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:06,623
Department of Justice

1529
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,415
And the US Bureau of Prisons

1530
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,183
Policy

1531
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,207
Moving

1532
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:11,999
High Ridge

1533
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,535
A prisoners from

1534
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,559
From prison to home

1535
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,095
Rather than

1536
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,119
Incarceration

1537
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,911
The judge ignore those arguing

1538
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:19,935
Entirely

1539
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,055
Okay

1540
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:27,871
Yep I'm sorry judge Jackson

1541
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:34,015
I've been to every time I think of Rodger Stone

1542
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:34,783
The judge Jack

1543
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:45,023
Distance coming to

1544
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,655
Well that's the thing I don't

1545
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:53,215
The thing that got me about that cuz normally I wouldn't even bother

1546
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,263
He's just doing the whole

1547
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,287
But

1548
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:58,847
I hate the way that they always get

1549
01:15:59,359 --> 01:15:59,871
Raiment

1550
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:01,919
They always let him frame it as

1551
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:02,943
Is Judge Jackson

1552
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,711
Nord

1553
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:04,991
My concern

1554
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:07,039
Yeah she did not

1555
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:10,111
Onion on his

1556
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:12,671
Having carefully looked over them

1557
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:13,951
And even

1558
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:14,975
By all accounts

1559
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:16,255
Beyonce

1560
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:20,095
Like I was reading the decision and there's a couple really good

1561
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,631
A couple really good things

1562
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:26,751
While the defendant correctly observes that other courts in the Sticks

1563
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,799
Have granted extensions another case

1564
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:34,431
Neither of those defendants were was convicted of threatening was convicted of threatening anyone

1565
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:38,783
And there is no indication that either failed to abide by conditions of release at any time

1566
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,575
Contrast

1567
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:43,391
Mr. Stone was convicted of threatening a Whitney

1568
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:47,231
Throughout the course of these criminal proceedings the court has been forced to address

1569
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:49,023
His repeated attempts to intimidate

1570
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:51,327
Stoke potentially violent

1571
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,095
At a rave

1572
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:55,167
Including individuals involved in

1573
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:55,935
Give me investigate

1574
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:56,959
Zeros

1575
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:58,751
I remember those times

1576
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:00,543
Rodger

1577
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:04,895
You're going in there because you threatened to hurt the judge

1578
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:10,015
And put out a million-dollar there yet

1579
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:11,807
Like the whole thing

1580
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,855
But here's my favorite one

1581
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,671
The defendant's response to the courts

1582
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,695
Inquiry concerning his

1583
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,975
Is personal preventative rack

1584
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:19,999
Purposes and avoidance

1585
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:22,047
The public gatherings in accordance with these directives

1586
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,327
Was vague

1587
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,351
Carefully parts

1588
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,631
And not reassuring

1589
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:29,471
So you still been going to t.g.i. Friday's

1590
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:32,287
She's literally like

1591
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,055
Honestly

1592
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,615
You're more dangerous to yourself

1593
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,383
Outside

1594
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:40,223
Sucking rally

1595
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:47,135
Exactly she's trying to save this f****** life perhaps

1596
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:52,511
Yeah just in Folsom deaf ears for me I mean look at the same time

1597
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:55,071
If there were some sort of a

1598
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,095
House arrest

1599
01:17:56,351 --> 01:18:00,447
Kind of thing until things calm down and Rodger

1600
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:02,495
I would be hopping mad about

1601
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:07,359
Xscape just

1602
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:09,663
Get whatever punishment check

1603
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,711
Society's deem necessary

1604
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:14,783
That it was just delayed for safety measures

1605
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:20,671
Concern for his own

1606
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,951
Selfish purpose

1607
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,231
Exactly

1608
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:23,999
Because I don't

1609
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,815
I don't see him or anybody

1610
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:29,375
He associated with you have platform

1611
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,399
Advocating

1612
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,423
4 people

1613
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,959
Being released over health cancer

1614
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:37,823
Because of that this seems just Halo it seems false

1615
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,615
I don't care

1616
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,639
A complete b*******

1617
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:44,479
And here's very we get imprinted

1618
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,295
I am praying to the president

1619
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:52,671
To Grant either,

1620
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:54,463
AeroGarden

1621
01:18:58,815 --> 01:18:59,327
Federal Prison

1622
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:03,423
Prior to my appeal being hurt

1623
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,959
I assure you.

1624
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:05,983
Of course

1625
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,519
Love's

1626
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:13,151
Message to

1627
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:15,455
Schrodinger's appeal

1628
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:20,831
He's praying to Trump

1629
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,879
Means it isn't

1630
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,903
No I had to

1631
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,719
Yeah

1632
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:27,743
That's weird

1633
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:28,767
Yep

1634
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:32,607
Should have said very religious

1635
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:38,239
For somebody who is a recently born again Christian

1636
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,055
Stupid

1637
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:41,823
Oh well

1638
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:45,919
It's like they might not

1639
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,479
This is our last clip right here

1640
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:51,551
He's going Graham Ledger

1641
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:52,831
It's not going to snow

1642
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:54,367
Grandma

1643
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:02,047
Usher

1644
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:06,399
You're too generous

1645
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,167
Let's make it 4

1646
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:11,519
Alright I will give you 400 it's worse than the 6

1647
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:13,055
Billion

1648
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,848
Where's the net

1649
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,384
Cucumber

1650
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,152
Fair enough

1651
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:20,480
And then finally this is how it is

1652
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:23,040
This is when

1653
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,832
This is the last time he says any

1654
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,880
Deposit WETA

1655
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:29,440
And puts it on the screen Graham Ledger does

1656
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,208
Listen this is weather

1657
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,840
To try and get you pardoned as you mentioned

1658
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,120
By the

1659
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,912
The United States

1660
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,448
Lori Hendry

1661
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,728
I made a post

1662
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,520
On Twitter and then

1663
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:46,336
Significant

1664
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,872
But significantly present

1665
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:48,896
Trump read

1666
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:49,920
We did

1667
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:53,760
Her tweets tweets on this program

1668
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,320
Significant

1669
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,088
Don't you

1670
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,648
I mean Ruby and is it true

1671
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:00,672
To think it is

1672
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:02,464
Why don't you know about this person

1673
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,000
That's why

1674
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,280
Cuz I was like

1675
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:08,608
Why are you putting a tweet up from a random person

1676
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,376
Just being like

1677
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:15,776
I don't know who is Lori

1678
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:19,104
Yo every morning and nobody at all

1679
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,896
Before 2 just look it up on Twitter real

1680
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,528
Madison that's unique

1681
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:28,064
Do these right-wing ding dong

1682
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:32,928
Doubtless they rely on like social media farming for

1683
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:36,256
Do not do looking

1684
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:38,304
The account today

1685
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,888
Universal problem mode

1686
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,960
Integrating news and social media together

1687
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:46,496
Stupid

1688
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:48,288
And the and the tweet that

1689
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,056
He's talking about

1690
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:52,640
Lori Hendry I looked into it it's a real Twitter account

1691
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:56,224
I was hoping it was a Phil Hendrie characters

1692
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:57,504
I was hoping

1693
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,272
Phil Hartman

1694
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:00,064
He's actually still alive

1695
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,088
That would have been the

1696
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:01,856
That would have been my

1697
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:04,672
Michael is Joey's R JFK jr.

1698
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:05,952
He is r.j.

1699
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:13,376
She's a she's a conservative Twitter

1700
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:15,680
Apparently a real person

1701
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:19,776
Right like she's got 300,000 followers

1702
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,336
And the company Vine site

1703
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:24,128
Along with

1704
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,920
Nbcnews looked into it

1705
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:28,224
More than half of all of her

1706
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:30,528
Are direct

1707
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,832
Yeah so she's

1708
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:34,368
She's just made up

1709
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,904
She's a complete creation

1710
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:37,184
