1
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge like I'm sick of them posing

2
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

3
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

4
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
Alex

5
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
All got something in my eye

6
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,872
Alright I'm okay I can blink

7
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:26,272
Are you okay

8
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:29,088
The office desk

9
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,624
My birthday

10
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,440
NADA just arrived I'm excited

11
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,024
Knoxville I've not unpacked it but it isn't

12
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,936
Quite a bit of time at the office Wednesday Indian so my chair is

13
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,496
Quite destroyed as I look at it is

14
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,896
A night we have this Amy's coming I mean the 45 degree angle

15
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:56,992
Is just absurd it's not good I finger my left side when I leave

16
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,112
What's going on with my spy

17
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,464
Bean bag chairs

18
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,280
Play I'm excited to get that new chair out Build It Up

19
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,560
And

20
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,656
Hopefully feel a little bit better or saying I'm telling you what man

21
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
Lower back

22
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:20,544
Appreciate that

23
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,592
My bright spot

24
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,152
Is everything everywhere all at once

25
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,688
The movie finally saw it

26
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:33,088
F****** as good as they say that's what I've heard it's fantastic people say it's good and then I've heard other people say it's as good as people say

27
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,856
As good as

28
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
People say

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,928
But it's also really really great

30
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,208
Michelle yeoh

31
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:38,976
Incredible

32
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:45,376
Greatest incredible I don't see a lot of movies

33
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,448
Hover-1 that I I need to get to round two

34
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,008
What great

35
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
Yeah

36
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,080
I'm glad you enjoyed it bright spots achieve

37
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,384
Jordan today we come

38
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,248
To the show in a little bit of a difficult position because of

39
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,320
News about the school shooting in Texas

40
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:10,464
I made a bit of an executive decision and that is that

41
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,000
We're not going to be talking

42
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,304
About Alex and his coverage of that till at least

43
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,072
East Monday

44
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
Because

45
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
It's it's difficult

46
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,192
To to say exactly

47
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,216
Listen to words but

48
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
I feel like they're too

49
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,824
Two primary objectives of the show

50
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,408
Is to analyze deconstruct

51
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
The

52
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:34,784
Narratives and the false reality that's perpetuated by Alex the sources of it

53
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,112
The sources of his worldview is ideology a lot of the same

54
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
Happy communist bulshit

55
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
That stuff

56
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
Is very important

57
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,768
But the second goal really is to not

58
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,560
Do things

59
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,584
Things that are not in

60
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,376
In service of the audience

61
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,656
And I don't

62
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,960
Feel like there is such a rush

63
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,496
To get to this

64
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,080
I'll bet it over comes the the

65
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,640
Sort of difficulty that people are feeling and

66
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,200
And how it would be exacerbated by listening to Alex's

67
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,480
Horrible Bosses

68
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
Should about it

69
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,808
So we're going to put that on

70
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:12,160
The back burner but we will eventually cover his immediate response

71
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
And

72
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,791
Do that next week it's nice that you can make executive

73
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,143
Decisions unilaterally mainly just because my opinion is so predictable

74
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
Like you didn't really need to bring that to me we didn't need to discuss about similar things in the past

75
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,127
But like you know there is not really a

76
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
Like

77
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,223
Pressing a news cycle for

78
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,271
Us necessarily we can

79
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,343
Allow things to be until

80
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,439
Aspect of it is the emotional

81
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,743
And the charge of it at the moment

82
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,279
Aquarium

83
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,839
This case in particular has really Illustrated

84
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
The

85
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,167
The difficulty of

86
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,703
Nailing down FAQ

87
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,775
In the immediate

88
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,359
Every hour it seems like there's a new p

89
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:07,711
Piece of information every hour it seems like there's something somebody is not been

90
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,247
Completely honest about

91
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,295
Or any number of

92
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
Difficult

93
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
That

94
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
We should not be grappling with

95
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:21,791
Until we have the totality of that. Pretty difficult well

96
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
A lot of information

97
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
And it's shifting around

98
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,143
Is it the people are

99
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:32,031
Still trying to figure out what's going on in short we don't f*** with the wet cement that's not all right that's not Arthur

100
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
It doesn't help

101
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,615
So we'll have a different

102
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
Episode

103
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,991
Today but first let's say hello to some new folks

104
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
The first

105
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,063

112
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,311

Thank you very much what about a sharp

117
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:33,727
That reminds me of

118
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:40,383
Amazon Jack Baker's lactose intolerance

119
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
Closer

120
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,479
And I can't remember his line for it

121
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
He did it

122
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,903
Is Eddie got a bigger laugh and then he kept doing it and made fun of me for giving him the bigger last tag

123
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,695
Mad and to this day

124
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,487
I will Lord it over him

125
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,887
As long as I live

126
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
Did you know that

127
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:15,455
Great stuff

128
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,807
It was only like 50 people in Chicago

129
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,159
You don't even have to explain the reference

130
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,719
Call Souderton

131
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:33,119
So thank you so much to do be meddling with my pedaling don't be roaming around adrenochrome

00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,423
Don't be screaming when I'm dreamily creaming

133
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:39,263
This is bordering on New World ordering thank you so much you are now a technic

134
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
I'm a policy wonk

135

136
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,847
Risen above

Miami

138
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,783
A list for me

139
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
And then we're going to

140
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
Comeback

141
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
And I mean

142
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
Start the show over

143
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
F*** you

144
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,399
I got plenty work for you but at the end of the day

145
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,447
F*** you and your new world order

146
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,495
And f****** horse you rode in on

147
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
All your s***

148
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
Maybe later on WhatsApp

149
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,639
Maybe I'll just be gone a month maybe 5 years

150
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,455
Real walk out of here tomorrow

151
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
And you never see me again

152
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,295
That's really what I want to do

153
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,599
I never want to come back here again

154
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
I apologize to

155
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
Yesterday that I

156
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,255
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

157
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
I'll be better tomorrow

158
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:40,447
He's not but we'll never know because never know but not today, because

159
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:44,287
Different today we can start this

160
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,823
This bad boy off

161
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
And

162
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,967
I am here today

163
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,759
How to do sort of an overview

164
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
Quite a few

165
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,575
Who sings and so

166
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
Hopefully this is

167
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
Just going to workout

168
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,671
And it's going to all make sense

169
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
You didn't say hi

170
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:08,351
I didn't return the hello

171
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
It's been so long it's been so long since we talked to Carrie has been a long time with project

172
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:20,383
Small and it's very Kerry Cassidy and David update

173
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,735
She does does a thing where she's looking at the camera and breaking down the news

174
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:29,087
And so much of it has just been qanon and like

175
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,879
Covid conspiracies and stuff

176
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,903
Where is

177
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,767
Space here are the aliens that's what we're here for right

178
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
Dog

179
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
Traders

180
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,631
That's what we're about rough Traders like Mercantile

181
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,423
Miners not minors

182
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,055
They're back on the team but they were on

183
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
But

184
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,247
Today update within the last week or so and we have an update on the world

185
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,295
And I am thrilled to report that we are back

186
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,855
Two aliens aliens are in

187
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:05,183
Play and there is Major news of s***

188
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
Well

189
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,255
It's actually not news cuz it's something it

190
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,559
Conceivably has to have been going on since like

191
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,119
The 70s hits news to us

192
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,191
That's what we got

193
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,263
Here's where we start off with some of the storylines

194
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,055
Has to do with

195
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,335
A city in Switzerland

196
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
First of all

197
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
What I want to talk about is

198
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,271
The role of Basil

199
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,807
Are Basel Switzerland

200
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,367
And the control of what is

201
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
Just called the right

202
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
Issue

203
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,487
And and why is

204
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
Centered in bath

205
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
Switzerland

206
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
And and

207
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
As far as I can

208
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,351
Until there's very little

209
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
Talk about this

210
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,447
At least in the circles that

211
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
I

212
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
Attention to

213
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,055
And I'm always Gathering more and more

214
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
So I have a whistleblower

215
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
On the subject

216
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
Who is

217
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,455
Very well-versed

218
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
And trained

219
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,527
As part of this

220
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,319
You know monetary

221
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
System that we've had

222
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
That involves

223
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,647
What's Wall Street

224
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,975
And and all kinds of things

225
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:17,375
Wall Street and Stockwell Street and stocks and aliens in Switzerland

226
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
For international settlements

227
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,983
And that's what's going on here

228
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
Settlements

229
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
He's up

230
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,847
What yes yeah that is

231
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Abbreviation

232
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,431
It's like the central banks of the world

233
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,991
Can meet and

234
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,271
Sort out issues

235
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
Is the Bank of Bank

236
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,087
Subway

237
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Okay

238
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,647
Be the notion of

239
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
What are you getting into

240
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
Is like

241
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:46,047
The bank of international settlements directly controls all like

242
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Issuance of

243
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,607
The currency that's not

244
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:53,983
That's not accurate all the banks go there to discuss what to do with their Bank

245
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,871
This all comes from a pamphlet called the right to issue written by a guy named William called

246
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:04,479
Which is mostly been reported on by the raving anti-semite and friend of Leo zagami

247
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
Henry Makow

248
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:12,415
The idea is that there's this group called The sabatons Who pretended to be Jewish people but are actually evil

249
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,487
These people are the ones working

250
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
To destroy Western Civilization

251
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
And the world

252
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:24,703
More or less

253
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,287
That well protected.

254
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Themselves

255
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:35,199
David I can spread some of these ideas on Alex's show in the past few years and actually is quite a big proponent of this Epic

256
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
50 yen

257
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
Conspiracy idea

258
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,343
What to say about this stuff

259
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,647
In terms of

260
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
I just want to put it up

261
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
Because the words are going to come out

262
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:52,607
Laters the Basel Switzerland right have you

263
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:57,215
Pretty explicitly crypto anti-semitic ship

264
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
That is a turn I did not

265
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
Expect them to

266
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,871
To take whenever it's like hey you know guys anti-Semitism is wrong

267
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,431
I didn't expect him to just be like haha

268
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
Now what if we

269
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
We just say they weren't

270
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
Actually Jews

271
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:13,855
Little twist

272
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:20,255
Kernels of this in a lot of places like with Ben Shapiro calling Jewish people who vote Democratic Jewish and name

273
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,303
Yep

274
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
Listen

275
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,887
We know we can't openly hate the Jews

276
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
Yet

277
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:31,007
But we got to get it out somehow man with just in a

278
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,335
So Carrie has a whistleblower on the

279
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
Of course she does

280
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,895
So I have a whistleblower

281
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
On the subject

282
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,711
Who is

283
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,503
Very well-versed

284
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,527
And trained

285
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
As part of this

286
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
You know monetary

287
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
System that we've had

288
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
That involves

289
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
Wall Street

290
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
Stocks

291
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Nn

292
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
And all kinds of things

293
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
They have had

294
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
Training

295
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
In this area

296
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
And they have

297
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,959
Recently communicated to me that there is

298
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,495
I believe they said

299
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,031
10000 Acres

300
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,335
Where there are

301
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
Ascertain

302
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
Group of families

303
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,199
Come on now I Got It download

304
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
Asstube

305
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,503
The various eat

306
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
Erases

307
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
Is that are interacting

308
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,855
Bring it home

309
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
System on Earth

310
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
Recently

311
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,951
Play and so I wanted to

312
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,999
Wrap that into that under

313
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
Understanding of

314
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
The right to issue

315
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,215
So 10,000 acres is approximately twice the size of the entire city of Basel in Switzerland

316
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,055
The city isn't just the bank of international settlement

317
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:42,175
It's Switzerland third most populated city

318
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,223
Switzerland sure you know

319
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
And actually

320
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
Someone famous was born there

321
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
Basil

322
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,367
Do you know you don't know who it is

323
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:56,767
Basel Switzerland I should know somebody who was a writer

324
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,839
Who did the thing who is it Rodger Federer

325
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,399
WhatsApp

326
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,447
Your boy Federer

327
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,775
Born in love tennis

328
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,055
People being born

329
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
Fair enough

330
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,455
It is 10000 Acres

331
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,735
Or whatever

332
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,807
They control the control of the

333
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,623
What's showing on Aliens

334
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Really after

335
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
Course

336
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
There is a group

337
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,767
TT races that seem to be

338
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,815
Vying for control

339
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
Bookkeeping

340
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
Control over

341
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,399
The monitor

342
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,727
So first of all there are the

343
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,263
Reptilian Draco

344
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,799
So I put them moral lesson

345
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
Same bucket

346
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
Graze

347
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
Around you know the

348
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,687
The Grays out there the various gray rat race

349
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
Report to

350
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,503
The Reptilian agenda

351
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Draco

352
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,575
And then we've got those

353
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,879
Beings from aldebaran

354
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
That are

355
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,463
From what I understand humanoid

356
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,255
And Mike

357
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,047
Actually be reptilian

358
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
Humanoid

359
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
Hybrids

360
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
Okay wait

361
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,447
So they've got their own planet of reptilian humanoid hybrids

362
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,775
Yes aldebaran aldebaran

363
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:18,175
Okay I only correct because they will Factor heavily

364
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,711
Aldebaran is

365
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,039
Ostensibly based on what Carrie is telling us

366
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:28,159
An entire system devoted to when the Draco reptilians

367
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,231
And the humanoids got together and made a hybrid race

368
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,023
And they just gave him a planet

369
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
I would like

370
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
Stay on aldebaran

371
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:41,727
Maybe there's not concrete details

372
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:48,127
Manifestation of like weird narcissism

373
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,943
Multiple alien groups

374
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
AR

375
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,551
Fighting with each other over our banking system

376
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,367
Okay so listen

377
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Alright

378
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,463
You have traveled several thousand light-years

379
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,255
Maybe even a million likes

380
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
And you are like

381
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:12,959
The Frank is not stable enough for me to invest in right now I'm going to have to go to the

382
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:18,591
As go the Euro so goes the governor

383
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,663
I feel like if there are these

384
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
What's a

385
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,295
Spacefaring groups of aliens

386
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
They do

387
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
They shouldn't give a

388
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:34,207
F*** if we end up destroying ourselves another

389
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,743
Species of alien

390
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:40,607
That ended up like the humans ended up becoming spacefaring as well maybe they'll hold on

391
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
It's not make or break

392
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,679
Throw this out at you

393
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,775
Let me throw this out at you cuz I think it might blow this whole thing wide open

394
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,543
Alright

395
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,567
Maybe

396
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
The only reason

397
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
Let all the other race

398
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,199
Jesus became spacefaring and we didn't

399
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,247
It's cuz we're the only ones that invented

400
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
Speculative current

401
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:04,671
So they come here because nobody else knows how to gamble like Americans

402
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,975
Counter-argument Maybe

403
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:13,375
All of these face fair and Graces became spacefaring only after aliens fought over their monetary system

404
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:19,775
Catalyzing Uno's Uno's

405
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:24,895
So there's these aliens that are fighting for control of our bags to the reptilian

406
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
Draco's

407
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,199
We got the aldebaran

408
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:33,087
Oh yeah I don't think the Raptors are in play well I mean you can't have Raptors without Mark Richards

409
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,159
Leaving the shop does actually come up later

410
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,719
Spiedino she hasn't been to visit

411
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
Sam Houston whistleblower

412
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
Yeah I guess

413
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,583
They like Chaka

414
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:49,983
But more than money and antiques

415
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,799
Jurassic Park world you know like they're having a great time

416
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
So there's other

417
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
Aliens

418
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
Then there's the Anunnaki that are

419
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,223
Ledian humanoid

420
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,527
Reptilian hybrid

421
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,343
And and certainly there can be more

422
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
For example

423
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,951
The beings from Venus

424
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,743
Whether they're playing in or not

425
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,791
You know all go back

426
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,815
Milira so that

427
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,607
What my understanding is that

428
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,887
The humanoid races

429
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,191
10 to go back

430
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,727
All stem from Lyra

431
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
The viruses

432
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,055
Could also

433
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,103
Have originating other part

434
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
What's the Multiverse

435
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
And

436
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
And then

437
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,271
Also there are the beings coming

438
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,551
I'm going from Venus

439
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
So these are the main

440
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,415
From what I can tell TT races

441
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
Just that are

442
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
Trying to control arm on a

443
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,255
System and buying for

444
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
Control over

445
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:55,263
I mean I guess we don't know as much about the aldebaran aliens from our from our journey

446
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,127
Pleiadians are good though

447
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,175
Yeah

448
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,503
Hybrid Draco

449
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
Right

450
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,343
And then the Grays are always up in the air

451
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:15,743
It's ya both sides in the past

452
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,071
Maybe

453
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,887
Ages for birthday I've no idea

454
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:26,239
I need generally here of them as being people who report back to the

455
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,543
The minions of the Draco

456
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,311
Reptilia

457
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,103
I like it our version of

458
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,895
Camelot we've built our own kind of back

459
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,735
Backstory mythology to wear now we're like arguing about whether or not

460
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:42,879
Tom Bombadil was the right spot in Fellowship in aliens that are absent from this

461
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,695
There are so many different

462
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
Right

463
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,255
F****** aliens that artist

464
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,047
Based on animals

465
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:56,447
Where are the cats

466
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,519
Underwater

467
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,615
Lord knows what time does an octopus somewhere problem

468
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:10,015
I don't know why they are coming in to help with his battle for the monetary system

469
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,551
I think I love

470
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,831
Brett

471
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:19,232
Of answer that you get for where you go for a well you know I think most humanoids are originally from the Lyra system

472
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,304
But they could have been from somewhere else in the Multiverse

473
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,120
Yeah man that's called playing the field

474
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:31,776
Yes everywhere it's basically saying nothing

475
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:39,968
It's my understanding from here but they could come from literally anywhere else

476
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,248
People are false

477
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,528
Awesome thank you

478
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,088
The aldebaran aliens

479
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
Important

480
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,440
For today cuz there's a certain things

481
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
That happened

482
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
At some point

483
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,864
Entire continent on planet

484
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,168
We didn't know no one knows about that

485
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,728
And I'm also wasn't

486
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
In contact with

487
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,312
Another whistleblower on the same

488
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,104
Subject that I'm going to talk about

489
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
About here

490
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
That

491
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,432
Basically

492
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,712
Gordon.

493
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
Talked about

494
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
I have

495
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,576
It turns out to be

496
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,624
Three other

497
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,928
Very substantial whistleblowers 1 is

498
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
Is Captain Mark Richards

499
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,256
The other is a

500
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,304
A very long time contact

501
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,584
The Project Camelot

502
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,120
And the other is this

503
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,912
Other whistleblower who brought

504
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
Forward important

505
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,216
Information on the sub

506
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
And the subject

507
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
What is

508
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
How

509
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,592
It's actually Bass

510
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,896
There's a a movie and I've talked about

511
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
Before

512
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
So those

513
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,272
Of you out there who follow my workers approached know what I'm talking about

514
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
So surprised

515
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,832
But it centers around

516
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
A television

517
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,880
Series called me

518
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
Event

519
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,928
Which is actually a dick

520
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Depiction

521
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,232
Of a real

522
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,280
Situation that we're having

523
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
Here on planet Earth

524
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,072
To do with

525
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,864
Marius ET race

526
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,400
And though

527
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,936
Specifically

528
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
The race

529
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,240
From aldebaran

530
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,824
So the aldebaran

531
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,616
It's at the event

532
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
Right

533
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Right

534
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:19,040
So she mentioned Gordon Duff in there

535
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,344
I think what she's talking about cuz she's not so

536
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
Specific about this but

537
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,952
In 2013 Gordon Duff published post on Veterans

538
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,768
Titles quote of the little green guy book

539
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:35,168
Which was a guy to various alien races that is very much not a real document or anything other than someone have

540
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:41,568
Having a good time okay it's not official it's not from any government it's just a fun book with pictures of what someone

541
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,336
Would look like

542
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:48,736
It's like a monster manual it's the DM's manual my favorite of the races of the

543
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,784
Aliens in this is

544
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,832
Jeff okay

545
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,648
Here's what's known about my God don't tell me that it's

546
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,928
Jeff snow

547
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:03,072
Everyone's name Jess back to 1500 BC

548
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,120
They met with JFK 3 weeks

549
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:11,520
Before he was killed they also have around the same time at with other human world leaders they have not

550
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,616
What's up

551
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,320
Either they had something to do with it or that was the last

552
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:28,672
Straw for that you guys are going to kill JFK

553
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,488
Peacekeepers they probably wouldn't get involved

554
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,816
Open killing JFK

555
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,096
Kill the president

556
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,312
Also strangely

557
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,128
Us Focus

558
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
It's so weird

559
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,200
That was part of

560
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
The

561
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:57,088
Impetus for some of the I guess maybe the aldebaran aliens are in that monster manual

562
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,368
So she has other

563
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,392
Sources

564
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:03,232
The tell her that the show the event is real

565
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
To these people

566
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
That

567
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
It is

568
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
That all

569
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,632
The movies that they are referencing

570
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,168
Are all in English

571
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:15,520
Though no one else in the world made movies about a lie

572
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,336
That's true

573
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,360
I think I watched

574
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,664
The event

575
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,016
Catalog in my mind

576
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,808
Kind of the same as like

577
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,600
Terra Nova

578
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,672
A revolution like these shows that I was like

579
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:36,768
Man this could be this week

580
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,328
Post lost

581
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:44,704
Desire for something

582
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,056
I thought flash-forward a lot of potential to and then I hated it

583
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,336
In the finale I like to

584
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,664
It again

585
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:58,784
I just come back

586
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
And

587
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,880
What's going on with the aldebaran

588
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
Okay

589
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,696
The Story Goes that the race

590
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,720
Aldebaran

591
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,256
Destroyed

592
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
What

593
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:14,912
I understand to be not just one planet of theirs in their system but two

594
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,240
And they got into a situation where they wanted to come

595
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,032
And

596
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,056
Basically

597
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
Terraform

598
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,664
And and take over certain portion of our territory

599
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,224
And that a negotiation

600
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,760
Play so that we

601
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
Could go in

602
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,296
Two outer

603
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
Space

604
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,856
And take over certain

605
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,160
Planetoid

606
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,952
Or planets

607
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
Where we could establish

608
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,000
Colony

609
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,536
With their help

610
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,352
And that at the same time they would be given

611
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,144
Portion of our land mass

612
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,168
Which was

613
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,240
So I know this sounds

614
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:53,824
Crazy to there but this is actually

615
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,104
Something that Gordon Duff

616
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
What about

617
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
On Veterans

618
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,432
Today many years ago

619
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,736
So

620
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:04,576
Exchange for help with planet

621
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,344
Someone

622
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,648
Gave Africa to

623
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:11,488
The aldebaran aliens you ask

624
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,024
For Africa

625
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:19,680
I don't know I don't know if she has coronavirus killed the Clippers a bit because point out that some of this

626
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:23,008
Smaller countries in Africa were not thrilled with it

627
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,824
Hayward Consulting

628
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:32,224
Who do you go to what's the contact info for like listen

629
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,016
We got this big treaty

630
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,320
I need to call these off-world

631
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
I got to say

632
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
We want

633
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,416
All of China

634
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:44,000
No we're not doing China buddy this is the Earth

635
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,304
We don't just give chinaway to anybody

636
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,352
Alright fine we'll take South America

637
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:51,680
Oh oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa you tried to lowball us

638
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:58,848
Yeah I guess maybe they worked it out with the International Bank of settlements or something and

639
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
I think Africa

640
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
Librarian

641
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:09,088
Weird band with that is such that slight little bit of you know you're being racist when you just say they gave

642
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:15,488
Hermaphrodite in the story also read

643
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:20,864
Enforce that a little bit convenient way to explain away something

644
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,728
Right right I don't like the whole continent of Africa because of

645
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
Aliens

646
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,056
Well no it's not too much of that but

647
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,080
There there are some

648
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,872
Thoughts that I have

649
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,408
Anyway the aldebaran

650
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,992
The game 2 secret bases sure and then went around

651
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
Into

652
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:38,784
Did the Africa

653
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,576
To get back to the album

654
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
Deborah

655
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
Story

656
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,952
This story as we were told by whistleblower that has

657
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,000
Has been substantiated Again by

658
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,536
At least three others

659
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,584
Substantial sources

660
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,608
Including Garden.

661
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
That the bean

662
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,216
Wings from aldebaran

663
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,032
Express they wanted to

664
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
You come here

665
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,616
We gave them this land

666
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
They have

667
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,432
Disguise themselves as

668
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
Have some kind

669
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,736
Kind of ability they do look

670
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,760
You know the normal

671
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,552
Short of blonde blue-eyed

672
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,880
I don't know what you want to call that

673
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,416
Humanoid

674
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,464
Even you might

675
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,744
Call them the Nordic

676
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,768
Type of love

677
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,048
Right of the tip

678
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,584
Local Nazi but they

679
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,608
Seem to be able

680
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,376
How to change

681
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,656
Their appearance

682
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,192
And so what they did is they

683
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
Themselves

684
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,056
They there they turn their skin dark

685
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,848
You know like black

686
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
The black race

687
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,944
To blend in with the race

688
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,712
Is of Africa

689
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,760
How's that how's that grab you

690
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
Wait

691
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,064
Hold the f****** phone

692
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,344
Did she just say

693
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,624
Aliens

694
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,928
Created Rhodesia and then when they got

695
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,488
Caught they just turned themselves Al Jolson

696
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,120
What's going on here I am not sure but I do think that there is

697
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,168
Some connection to

698
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:05,056
Like explaining away apart oh yeah there's no way you can have a

699
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,592
What classic Nazis in F

700
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
Africa

701
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,152
Not apartheid right

702
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,688
I think

703
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,992
I think let me hit let me play the next

704
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,552
Text Cliff because I think there's some information that comes

705
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,320
Hear that make

706
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,088
Maybe like

707
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,136
Made me feel a little bit more

708
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,416
Along these lines

709
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,952
Toby same basis

710
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
Is Ben

711
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,512
Became sort of a place

712
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,792
Distribution place

713
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,560
I swear these

714
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,352
Racist from aldebaran

715
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:29,888
These beings

716
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,424
Cool again

717
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
Where

718
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,728
Kind of like Refuge

719
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,264
From another planet

720
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,056
Coming into office

721
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
Africa

722
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,360
Families

723
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
Exedra

724
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,408
And then dropped off

725
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,432
In South Africa

726
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,224
Where this

727
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,504
Particular whistleblower

728
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Actually

729
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,320
Told us

730
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,088
That what

731
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,368
Happened was they be

732
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,392
Began to see

733
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,928
All of a sudden

734
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,976
That would they have population

735
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,536
That they in numbers that they never

736
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,560
Knew where that came from

737
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
And

738
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,120
They appeared

739
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,400
Kind of out of nowhere

740
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,192
In the immigration

741
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,216
Record I guess

742
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
And then

743
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,520
They would take

744
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,544
Maywood

745
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,824
Cake train

746
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,104
And leave

747
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,872
South Africa

748
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,664
And go into the rest

749
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,688
Apparel

750
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,224
And establish

751
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,528
And because they

752
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,576
Like the

753
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,136
Peoples of Africa

754
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
They

755
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,208
Got under the radar

756
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,232
I think

757
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:30,560
That by doing this kind of a framing

758
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:33,632
You're able to explain away all sorts of

759
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:38,240
Inconvenient things about hit the history of Africa

760
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,264
For instance

761
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,800
You could

762
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:44,384
Denotes a in the same way that the anti-communist folks

763
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,504
They have their support of apartheid is based on like oh yeah Nelson Mandela and

764
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,296
It wasn't about

765
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,576
You know like human right

766
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,160
Pushing communism

767
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:01,024
Like a fight for human rights

768
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
Text Bryce

769
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,328
The aldebaran

770
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:07,424
Who overthrew apartheid

771
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,216
Yuno and Yuki

772
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:15,616
Features of a small minority is ruling over another majority group I

773
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,920
If there's a whole bunch of

774
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,992
People that come in baby that's why there's a majority

775
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:21,760
It's

776
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,040
It's a mess I mean

777
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,832
It does kind of feel like what

778
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,648
Just happened there is

779
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,256
She described apartheid and then the end of Apartheid being

780
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,304
The people who caused apartheid

781
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,864
Changing their skin black and disappearing

782
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,144
Leaving those

783
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,936
Poor innocent White

784
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,704
People

785
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,984
To deal with the Fallout

786
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:46,080
I understand

787
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,360
I get more of

788
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,384
The aldebaran

789
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,432
They camouflage

790
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:54,528
Do appear like the people in Africa

791
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
So then

792
00:32:55,552 --> 00:33:00,416
The so then it was the the white people who were just fighting back against the aldebaran

793
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,696
An apartheid was

794
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:07,328
Really great possible that could be an interpretation

795
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,656
The aldebaran he's we're just trying

796
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,728
To take control of places you are and so the fight

797
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,008
Human rights

798
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,080
In places like

799
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,640
In South Africa overthrowing those systems

800
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,480
We're actually the aldebaran strikes a control right

801
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,296
Things like the remnants of

802
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,320
The

803
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,344
Colonialism

804
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,160
In places like Rwanda

805
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,952
I'm sure I could take that as

806
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,512
Some sort of influence of the

807
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,560
Aldebaran

808
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,608
Right you know you can basically take

809
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,680
Cultural responsibility away from

810
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
Human actor

811
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:49,056
It's not there and place a lot of it onto aliens if you cause a problem

812
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,944
Do you like there's a little bit of that what I am hearing is that the route

813
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
Cause

814
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:02,368
Is somebody just gave away Africa without letting any enough people know it's weird

815
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:07,232
The problem here if that's the case I also think that there is a very very strong chance

816
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,304
The we are over reading this

817
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,840
I think that's our job.

818
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:18,240
Just trying to grasp at straws to make any of this make sense in the real world

819
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:21,312
In her reality is when she keep saying we

820
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,104
Like when she referred

821
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,200
We gave them Africa describing a group of human

822
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,992
So powerful

823
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:29,760
They can just

824
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,576
Give away a continent to aliens without telling anybody

825
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,600
Bear funk

826
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:40,000
Actually aliens as well yeah you can't get built love yourself in with my crew that's not you

827
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,536
I don't want none of this on my hair

828
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,584
What are the reasons that I

829
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,376
Associated this a little bit with

830
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,424
Possible ideas about apartheid

831
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,240
Is that she said that they came into South

832
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:54,848
Yeah and the other reason is because there's a potential time frame

833
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,896
God given in this next

834
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:00,480
Klipsch 70s to early 90s

835
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,760
I don't know what that

836
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,784
Actual number of

837
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
These beings are

838
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,368
I do know that

839
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,416
It's very possible

840
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,440
That what they're calling

841
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
Ebola

842
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,000
Is actually

843
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
Could be

844
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,352
Our reaction

845
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,400
To work

846
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
Addison Park

847
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448
Campaign

848
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,984
Keep people away

849
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,776
Interior

850
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,568
And

851
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
70

852
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,896
This race

853
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:29,920
Hidden

854
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:33,504
Do you know the first case of Ebola was identified

855
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,784
1076

856
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,832
Yeah yeah

857
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:42,720
Yeah resistance to apartheid was quite strong

858
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,768
Beginnings living up the beginning

859
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,792
A large

860
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,816
Push pretty

861
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:52,192
Overthrowing of the system happening

862
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,728
Well when it came to

863
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,288
No

864
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:05,248
It's interesting that you saying that it's to keep people away from central Africa because they're work Ebola outbreaks in central Africa before

865
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,296
4 but the most recent one was very

866
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,064
Much of the Atlanta

867
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
The coast

868
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,880
In Northern Africa Sierra Leone

869
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:16,256
Iberia just saying the Centre of Africa because that seems like a cooler place to say

870
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,816
You know like you're not going to say it like that

871
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:23,424
Maybe they're keeping people away from The Coasters

872
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,824
In fairness brakes were more like in the Democratic Republic of Congo

873
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,408
The other thing is that like if

874
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:37,760
She saying that you Bola is somehow a cover to keep people away

875
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,856
So they don't uncover the existence of the aldebaran alien right

876
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,136
First of all that silly

877
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:47,488
Because that would mean that

878
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:54,400
Exist prior to 1976 it has to be 76 on Word

879
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,216
That's the time frame of this

880
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:03,616
Have to do with Eisenhower allegedly negotiating with aliens

881
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:10,016
This is pure any other way I can't hear it any

882
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,320
The details are too like

883
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,904
Anna in the world that we're talkin about

884
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,304
These places where the aliens came and we're the same places that gold was sent to space

885
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,840
Come on

886
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:29,216
We're talking about people who have a list called eurocentric an understatement

887
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,240
Towards their out View

888
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,384
And the idea that they would know anything about Africa

889
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,152
Apartheid

890
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,176
Blows my my

891
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:41,248
So I'm going to have to go with that I'm not even certain that

892
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,344
She does. That's another part of it that's also possible

893
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,624
So

894
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,976
Maybe is a false flag campaign to keep people away from

895
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,256
Africa's video

896
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,048
Uncovered the aldebaran

897
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,584
But also there's another possibility

898
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,352
Okay

899
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,144
But there's also sort of a cat

900
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,192
Which is that all they look

901
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:00,960
Human

902
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
What

903
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,568
Is the situation is that

904
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,384
And this is in the movie The Event

905
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
Which is a series you

906
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,968
You can watch a movie

907
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,784
Vision series

908
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,088
You know you used to be

909
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,624
Towards the end

910
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,416
Is revealed that

911
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,208
Although their humanoid

912
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,000
Very humid

913
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
They act

914
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,816
Actually needed if

915
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,096
Atmosphere than us

916
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,144
And that they

917
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,448
Exposure of us

918
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,472
To them

919
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,288
Alters are

920
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,080
Rdna or actually

921
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,104
You know

922
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
Actors account

923
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,408
Poison

924
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,200
Which is

925
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,224
Possibly

926
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,784
Reflected in addition buckham

927
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,320
Pain that they call Ebola

928
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
Yeah

929
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
Okay

930
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,232
Okay so then it's even stronger evidence it has to be 1976 forward

931
00:38:55,488 --> 00:39:00,352
Aldebaran alien

932
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,168
That is that person even more concrete thing

933
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,496
Yeah you can't claim it some sort of ancient Ebola then come back

934
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,776
You're saying that a bowl of didn't

935
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,080
Exist and we know that it only started

936
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,360
In 1976

937
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,640
So that was it

938
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,664
Disinfo campaign

939
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,248
Created a specifically around a certain purpose

940
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,528
So that

941
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,576
I don't know what to say

942
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,624
I think your sources

943
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
Is are probably racist

944
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:29,792
You just know stuff

945
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,608
You get near an aldebaran alien

946
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,424
You may be poisoned

947
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,984
Because it might be a distant for campaign

948
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,520
Or it could be a bowl

949
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,312
Well but Ebola has to

950
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
Exist

951
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,360
Because

952
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:49,760
Kerry also has some news to drop on you hear there's also a Bola outside

953
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,296
Possibility of Ebola

954
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:57,184
We know that the covid-19 people into vampires in China

955
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,464
Absolutely had to

956
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,024
Bob are people living

957
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,840
With garlic nails

958
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,936
But there's also something about the vaccine that size news

959
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,704
Pier

960
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,264
Now it's well-known that Ebola was a

961
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,800
Actually an ingredient

962
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,080
Or isn't ingredient

963
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,104
Up the Baxter

964
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,640
So

965
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,712
This story that I'm telling now does

966
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
Reflect back

967
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,040
Into the whole covid

968
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,320
Last two years

969
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,856
Which is

970
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,392
What I've said over and over

971
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,160
Again

972
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,440
A trans human

973
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,464
Agenda

974
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,280
With

975
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,048
Physically

976
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,072
Collateral damage

977
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
Where they don't

978
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,608
Care how many

979
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,656
Why people can't handle the change

980
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,960
They're trying to change our Gina

981
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,800
There's a there's a bowl in the vaccines

982
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:48,384
And it is

983
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:52,736
Coming in contact with the aldebaran aliens would just do this to you

984
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,808
When you get Ebola

985
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,648
If you don't that it just changes your Dino

986
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,672
Sherando wave

987
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,720
That these aldebaran aliens what

988
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:06,816
To happen and they're sort of collaborating with a new world order on there

989
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,608
Cuz they don't care it's all about

990
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
Transhumanists

991
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:12,704
Be able to handle it

992
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,984
Become transhuman and the rest

993
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,264
Now they may die

994
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:21,920
Who cares I'm going to give you a list of people who have put a Bola inside of a

995
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:27,040
A supposed vaccine or thing designed to stop you from getting sick

996
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,832
Mike Adams

997
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,112
End of list

998
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
Well

999
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,952
Did he invent the covid-19

1000
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,512
Yeah so that's a

1001
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,072
Yeah it's weird

1002
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:43,424
Do you want those things you can see is like there's a lot of thematic parallels

1003
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,192
With Alex

1004
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:49,312
End goal being this transhumanism or whatever

1005
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,848
There's a lot of stuff very similar

1006
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:57,247
I mean in this context it's kind of it's kind of interesting to see the the way

1007
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,551
Vete a futurism

1008
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:04,415
Is combined with such an abscessed conservatism as well you know like

1009
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:09,023
Do they all look at all these alien races the stars are available

1010
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,559
Signing intergalactic

1011
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
Treatise

1012
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
Listen

1013
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,423
I am not going to get weird okay

1014
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,447
We're going to live

1015
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:23,103
Same way we f****** do

1016
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,687
Go back to the gold standard

1017
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,735
Yes now that I know the

1018
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,551
Best Infiniti of the Multiverse

1019
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,831
Available

1020
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,367
I want to go back to

1021
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:38,463
South Africa during apartheid its futurism mix

1022
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,231
With

1023
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:43,839
Obsession with fast and reverting back

1024
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,375
Yeah it's a weird like

1025
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,167
Futuristic

1026
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,447
Civil War

1027
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,239
Convoluted

1028
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,519
So I think we're

1029
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,055
If I carry is right

1030
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
Divide

1031
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,151
There is this

1032
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,687
Ongoing

1033
00:42:59,455 --> 00:42:59,967
Barry Zito

1034
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,735
Erases

1035
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,039
That the New World Order is

1036
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:03,807
Is all about

1037
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:04,831
Controlling

1038
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,135
And they want to control

1039
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,927
Space Program

1040
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,951
Court program

1041
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,231
Around the world

1042
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
And

1043
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,535
Right now

1044
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,583
Centered in the United States

1045
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,607
As I've said

1046
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,655
With the opposite being

1047
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,447
And

1048
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:23,775
There are a different

1049
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,543
China

1050
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,567
Ascertain

1051
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,359
The Drake Over

1052
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,127
Reptilian

1053
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,151
Are draco's

1054
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:29,919
Probably

1055
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
And

1056
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:31,967
Then

1057
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,503
We understand perhaps

1058
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,039
Spider beings in

1059
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:35,807
A few other

1060
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,087
Beans

1061
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,879
That the Chinese are being

1062
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,159
Helped by

1063
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,695
If they're being influence

1064
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,279
So and you got them then you got

1065
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,303
Icheat

1066
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,095
Okay every Itachi

1067
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:48,863
Race

1068
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:49,887
That becomes

1069
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,167
Spacefaring race

1070
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
Creates

1071
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,959
An AI

1072
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,519
So then we also have nots

1073
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,287
Speculatively

1074
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,591
AI

1075
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
That are

1076
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,407
Influencing

1077
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
The Earth in

1078
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,223
Circumstances

1079
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,271
Right now that are not

1080
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,295
Negative towards

1081
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,063
Humans

1082
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,855
What does that's another

1083
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
That we're dealing with

1084
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
On top of our dealings

1085
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:12,927
With all these different

1086
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:19,583
If you racist that's too much to deal with man so we got these alien races but really all we're kind of

1087
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,375
Dealing with them is before a I though

1088
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,911
Cuz they're the ones orca

1089
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:29,311
Castrating all of this maybe you still have spider beings we're going to have to fight at some point

1090
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,639
Negotiate with the AI maybe the AI can help us out

1091
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:36,735
The aldebaran are clearly not up to do not have good intent

1092
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,015
Doesn't seem like it

1093
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,575
Why is China being influenced by the spider bee

1094
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,623
Cuz they needed a roll

1095
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:49,279
Feel like this

1096
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,119
Play the role

1097
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,679
Administrator

1098
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,959
Spider-Man

1099
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:01,567
Yep so through the covid

1100
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,103
Roll out

1101
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,383
Bio weapon

1102
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,967
And the vaccine with the fake and real Ebola

1103
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,759
This is all a plan

1104
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,527
Right

1105
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,295
In order

1106
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:16,415
Plan is and it comes back to the Ebola in the back okay

1107
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,951
Basically what they're built

1108
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
An army

1109
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,071
An army of being

1110
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,351
To fight

1111
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,399
Any incoming

1112
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,167
Threat

1113
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,215
Especially Android

1114
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,775
Coming from one Souther AI

1115
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,311
And they are cultures

1116
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,359
Out in the

1117
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,895
Larger solar see

1118
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:38,687
Invalid

1119
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
So

1120
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,759
We are

1121
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,295
This is this is

1122
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,063
She say

1123
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,855
What I call a humanities

1124
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,671
Program

1125
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,695
And

1126
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,719
Covid

1127
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,487
Is very much

1128
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,255
Part of that

1129
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,535
What was 2.0

1130
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,327
That was

1131
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,607
The Cybermen

1132
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,631
From Doctor Who

1133
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,935
These are Android

1134
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,983
Yeah yeah

1135
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,079
Look I think there's a coherent plan here

1136
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,383
Coherent

1137
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:14,783
The covid vaccine will turn some people into Priscilla right otamatone

1138
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:19,647
Mindlessly be able to fight against the incoming cyborgs Brazilian Air created

1139
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,487
What is it

1140
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:30,655
What do you think what is everybody think AI cultures are going to be human cultures but like

1141
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,935
Angry towards

1142
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,727
Russell Wilson II culture

1143
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:39,615
I mean it's whenever a bunch of a I get together and they like started band International AI settlement

1144
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:45,247
Absolutely I don't I don't know what any of this is

1145
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,295
I don't know what I got culture is I don't know

1146
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:53,695
What is it

1147
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,999
Well I think it's both

1148
00:46:56,255 --> 00:47:02,399
I think all is possible in the Multiverse buddy you really did like that movie

1149
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,215
Killing people isn't really the goal

1150
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,239
Necessarily

1151
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,799
With so many people in AI in

1152
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:13,407
Can aliens why would you even bother killing people there in right Beyond

1153
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:19,551
This is a harsh split from Alex's ideology population is the number one goal

1154
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,343
Eliminating population

1155
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,647
Is not as crucial for them

1156
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,951
Although they're certainly involved in

1157
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,255
Chinese very

1158
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,279
Specifically in back

1159
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,559
Mike Richards

1160
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,607
Told me two years ago before this whole thing

1161
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,375
Things started

1162
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,679
That he'd gotten word that the

1163
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,447
Chinese head

1164
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,215
Decided they need

1165
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,007
Get rid of

1166
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,311
At least 500 million

1167
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,591
Or more of Their Own

1168
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,895
And they are

1169
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,663
Still as you

1170
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,431
Juicy

1171
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,967
You know doing lockdown

1172
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,527
Probably spring there

1173
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,063
They're people with this

1174
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,623
Versions of the bioweapon

1175
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,439
Making sure that more and more people

1176
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,207
Diane.

1177
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,743
Get transformed in

1178
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,279
This

1179
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,815
Cybernetic

1180
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,095
Army

1181
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
So

1182
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,423
So we have that going on

1183
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,959
We got that going on

1184
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:15,359
So mind-bogglingly evil in you just described in such a butt like

1185
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,407
So what they're obviously doing is

1186
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:19,455
Spraying people with murder

1187
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:23,807
He's trying to bring down their population whereas the rest of the world

1188
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,599
Is trying to create

1189
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,879
Cybernetic armies

1190
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,415
The fight cyborg

1191
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,207
It seems like Mark Richards

1192
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,487
Has his hand on the

1193
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,303
The pulse of global affairs

1194
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,119
Keep the spark told her about this but

1195
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:37,887
Before

1196
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,911
Man

1197
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:45,311
What is she been doing for the past signature to warn people

1198
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,639
So

1199
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,455
The vaccine

1200
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:57,855
It's kind of unclear if the Ebola is the same thing as the graphene oxide right but she's very very scared

1201
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,135
About this vaccine

1202
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,927
The graphene oxide is a

1203
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,719
Apparently the same as like

1204
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,487
The black goo

1205
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,767
Right

1206
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:11,423
It so there was this guy who was a researcher in the Paranormal world what have you gotten a Max spiers

1207
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
A few years back

1208
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,495
And Carrie believe that he was killed by the Black

1209
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:18,591
Little bit of

1210
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:21,151
Inside information. She has

1211
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,431
What happened

1212
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,455
To Max

1213
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,271
Spears and his death when he went to Cypress

1214
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,319
Then came back and was dying

1215
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,343
I was at

1216
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,623
Actually on the phone

1217
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,415
With one individual that way

1218
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,439
I was on the site

1219
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,207
There

1220
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,231
The time

1221
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,535
Bentley Max was

1222
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,839
Dying in the other room they were try

1223
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,119
Call some help

1224
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
Then

1225
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,423
Doctors came back

1226
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,703
Do anyting

1227
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,983
They left

1228
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,775
And eventually they came back to

1229
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,335
The body away and they didn't allow them to

1230
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,615
Take that body away

1231
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:52,895
Instead they spent

1232
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,919
Several days

1233
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,199
Trying to

1234
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,759
Reanimate

1235
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,807
And what else

1236
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,831
We doing a lot of black

1237
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,159
And

1238
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,183
What he

1239
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,463
He was dying of

1240
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,743
Appears to have been

1241
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,279
Covid

1242
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:10,815
Gas station

1243
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,119
Or takeover of his body

1244
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,655
Because there was black

1245
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,935
Stuff coming out of it

1246
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,703
Various

1247
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:24,639
Now so it's probably covid infestation is manifested by the Black.

1248
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:31,039
A few days always forget that magic is also real Arcane rituals

1249
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:37,439
They were also doing black magic 2 reanimated

1250
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:44,863
Travel through stars but we're still f****** cauldrons we got the ingredients

1251
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,167
Come back to life youngboy

1252
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,447
To what end

1253
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:55,359
That's not an animator

1254
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:58,431
Doesn't seem important

1255
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,991
Got all that f****** dude

1256
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:07,391
Long long predated covid-19 around that is the black

1257
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:12,255
Is covid-19 forever or something

1258
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,279
Cured himself

1259
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,047
The black goo

1260
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,583
Yes that is true

1261
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:18,143
Biotics

1262
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:24,031
Also like every old records is like black tattoos that look like Black Goose

1263
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,311
What else

1264
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,615
She does actually talk about that how it's like

1265
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:33,503
The one big oil spill was like the black you eaten through the bottom of a boat

1266
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,063
So funny it's yeah but hey

1267
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:36,831
Here's the good

1268
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:37,855
Haha

1269
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,159
There are multiple gurus

1270
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:47,327
Of course there's so many guys there's the gray goo that's the Nanobots right the gray goo where everybody turns into The Nether iPad

1271
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:51,423
Superbad

1272
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:56,031
It also looks like that last clip you know obviously one of Lovecraft books

1273
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,591
Herbert West reanimator

1274
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:02,431
This also gets a little bit love crap out

1275
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,223
Cthulhu vile

1276
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,503
Alex Newell

1277
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,783
Is

1278
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,831
780 contact d

1279
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,111
These blue alien

1280
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,671
I believe he's not living in

1281
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,719
As far as I remember

1282
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,255
Remember I thought it was New Zealand

1283
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,839
But many years ago

1284
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,911
And he talks about an e.t. race

1285
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,215
I'm not sure it's if it's the

1286
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:25,983
The same race

1287
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,775
Or whether the race

1288
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,311
Just reveal the information

1289
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,079
But there

1290
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,359
They were aware

1291
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,663
-11

1292
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,199
Black goo

1293
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,735
That is again a i

1294
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,783
That has was put here by Nietzsche

1295
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:41,087
Erase to be activated on a certain

1296
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,367
The point in our his

1297
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,159
Which obviously

1298
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:44,927
Happened

1299
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,463
And happened

1300
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,487
Beginning in the Falkland

1301
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:49,791
That

1302
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,559
There is

1303
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,119
So this is embedded in the Earth

1304
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,399
Under the ocean

1305
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,191
What is n o n

1306
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,471
Was always going

1307
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
Time to wake up

1308
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,263
And start to in

1309
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:01,567
Our planet

1310
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,127
Then supposedly there's another

1311
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:04,895
Erase.

1312
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,919
Is trying to stop a

1313
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,455
But

1314
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:08,991
It's obviously

1315
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,783
Very successful

1316
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:16,159
And then there is a a version of that black goo

1317
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,183
Royalty

1318
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,719
Substance status

1319
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,743
Supposedly

1320
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,791
Even deeper in the Earth

1321
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,815
That is

1322
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,863
Oh oh that's nice

1323
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,679
So we got we got a layer up so we got

1324
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:30,239
Alright then we got the Earth's crust

1325
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:36,639
We never got the mantle

1326
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:39,711
Strange Aeons

1327
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:46,111
Play the Black

1328
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:52,511
A few layers below that right above the core we've got the good goo goo goo good good also failing oil

1329
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:56,607
We need the good go it'll pop out

1330
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,887
How many moments

1331
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:00,191
I need other people try to stop the black goo

1332
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:06,591
They suck at their job or not

1333
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,383
Not met before

1334
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,271
I don't know why they suck at their job right

1335
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,295
I feel

1336
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:18,111
Powerless to do anything in her world

1337
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,439
We can get down to that goo

1338
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,023
I don't think so

1339
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,559
Ugly boy that shovel

1340
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:33,983
Then you're going to have to get through the other bad goofer

1341
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:34,751
It's so far.

1342
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:35,775
Yeah

1343
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:36,799
Hot down there

1344
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:39,359
If any of this is true

1345
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:46,015
Just live your life cares

1346
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:50,367
Does any of this is true write a book

1347
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:56,255
Biafra is any of this writing science fiction book based on what you know to be true and then make some money

1348
00:54:56,511 --> 00:55:00,607
I live your life cuz you're not going to be able to make any difference

1349
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:07,263
In the world of various Goos is almost paralyzing and yet at the

1350
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,543
Same time comforting

1351
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:12,383
Of being like if I lived in this universe that she says we inhabit

1352
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,175
What would I be

1353
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:14,943
Afraid of

1354
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,503
Like everything could kill me sure

1355
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:23,647
Right now everything could kill do outside my window there's a tree is a tree beer

1356
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,719
Anything they're notoriously hostile to humans

1357
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:31,583
Black magic spell on me right now and I would probably are

1358
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:37,983
So why would you be afraid there's just got black magic and s*** flying around there's Goose fighting everybody

1359
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:41,055
Tweets about black magic rituals you're doing

1360
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,871
Yeah

1361
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:44,895
It's

1362
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,175
Silly

1363
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:52,831
Update on the world with a couple of clips about some figures in the meat

1364
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:53,599
Okay

1365
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,671
The first is Vladimir Putin

1366
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:59,999
How's it how's he doing with his alien we got some up

1367
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,815
I know that Russia is

1368
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:03,839
With us

1369
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:05,631
Ace Program

1370
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,423
Amazing

1371
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,263
The Russians are also working

1372
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,567
Group of E cheese

1373
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,847
That

1374
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:17,151
Apparently our move are more positive

1375
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,943
Then they used to be

1376
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,223
What version

1377
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:22,527
Who is

1378
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,807
Innocence

1379
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,575
The Clown

1380
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:25,599
Is not

1381
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,623
The original

1382
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,647
And it's a match

1383
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,927
More positive

1384
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
Oriented

1385
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,511
And is working with

1386
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,535
Trump

1387
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,303
And the White House

1388
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,095
Behind the scenes

1389
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,631
And

1390
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:39,679
We're going to see where that'll leave

1391
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:45,311
Not leaving anywhere good right now also I think that you just prove Russian collusion

1392
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,847
I don't know

1393
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,127
Go back to space

1394
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,431
Space

1395
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,991
We don't need you down here on Earth

1396
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:56,063
Is a clone

1397
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,855
Is the fruits of

1398
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,647
Positive aliens are the warranty

1399
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,415
Ukraine

1400
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:03,231
I'm not interested in positive alien

1401
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,255
Full circle

1402
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:07,327
Clearly the Draco in the reptilians are good be

1403
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,607
Because Mark Richards hates them

1404
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,655
Well I mean the Raptors are bad

1405
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:17,055
Prince's like she believes the covid stuff is a bioweapon in the black goo in all this

1406
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:23,455
And they're biolabs in Ukraine the Russia is actually going after an attack

1407
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,479
A+

1408
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,015
Nothing but

1409
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:32,415
I mean the reality of what she's justifying through fantasy is is outrageous

1410
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,719
That's that's one of those where

1411
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,255
I do feel

1412
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,023
Like she's

1413
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:39,071
Scott that moment of where it's like

1414
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,375
Either I can wrestle with

1415
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:45,471
What I've accidentally walked by a space ass into

1416
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:47,007
F****** Putin

1417
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,311
Haha no no no

1418
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,079
I go

1419
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:56,735
All the way that we need a painfully elaborate

1420
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:01,343
Elon Musk

1421
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:02,623
Now

1422
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,903
I'm not sure

1423
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,207
If I mentioned but

1424
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,231
Elon Musk

1425
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,535
Is a

1426
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,583
Okay so I have my own

1427
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,351
Take on him

1428
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,143
I'm in my understanding

1429
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,423
What I was seeing

1430
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,447
What's a cyborg

1431
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,239
I believe he's

1432
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,775
He's run by good

1433
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,799
That of

1434
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,871
Whether it's an AI or a group

1435
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,663
Cheese I don't know

1436
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,431
Outback

1437
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,199
The most

1438
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,479
He seems fairly

1439
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,759
Positively Orion

1440
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,807
But he did grow up

1441
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,343
When was

1442
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,623
Totally back

1443
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,391
Bye

1444
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,415
Our secrets

1445
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,439
Space Program

1446
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,743
During the time when it was

1447
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,511
Completely

1448
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,047
Run and dominate

1449
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,327
Anybody new world order

1450
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,119
So he has been

1451
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,399
Position

1452
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,423
Purposely

1453
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,191
Tubi

1454
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,471
Playing his role that

1455
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,495
He's playing now

1456
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,799
Whether he's turned against

1457
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:53,567
Is

1458
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,871
Sort of operators

1459
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,663
Or whether he is

1460
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:58,943
Actually

1461
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,991
Fulfilling a war a role that

1462
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,015
That they prefer

1463
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
Play

1464
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:07,391
And where that might lead I don't know

1465
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:11,231
Cuz I would have said that he is the Avatar of

1466
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,279
American white

1467
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,303
Mail

1468
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,863
Failure being rewarded

1469
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,167
As the richest man in the world

1470
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,447
Cyborg

1471
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:26,335
Well I mean Bluetooth if you were create if you were creating something in the lab

1472
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:32,735
To more accurately reflect back on America every failure that it ever made and what

1473
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,015
What it looks like

1474
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,295
That would be you on

1475
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:42,463
As a cyborg that's under the control of some hyper powerful alien Rai

1476
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,767
Kind of gets you around having to explain

1477
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:47,583
His behavior

1478
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,631
What that stuff is kind of like

1479
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:52,959
We can still

1480
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,263
Cyborg I do appreciate

1481
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:58,079
The Absurd willingness

1482
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,103
To bend your back

1483
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,127
Over

1484
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,151
To make

1485
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,455
Monster seemed okay.

1486
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:08,831
That's that seems like that's what a lot of this is I mean Mark Richards

1487
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,367
That's amazing

1488
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,391
That's loyalty

1489
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:14,975
You know I'm just going to say this right now

1490
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,255
If you were like

1491
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,023
Hey

1492
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:19,327
I'm going to lead to the deaths of

1493
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:23,935
Thousands if not millions of people I'd be like Dan I don't think we can be friends anymore

1494
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:27,007
I'm not going to explain away your behavior number to buy Twitter

1495
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
Fair enough

1496
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:33,407
So what if Musk

1497
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,431
Takes us to Mars

1498
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:37,247
Okay cool

1499
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,783
Maybe

1500
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,063
I don't know what

1501
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,111
How where along is

1502
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,391
What he

1503
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:44,671
Ashley is

1504
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,695
Or or not

1505
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,231
So I don't I don't

1506
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:48,511
And I'm not trying

1507
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,279
How to install

1508
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,327
But

1509
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,351
This is what

1510
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,631
You know you can't help what you

1511
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,655
You see so

1512
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,983
Then on top of it someone

1513
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,007
Roach me

1514
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,287
There was a book written

1515
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,055
I don't know

1516
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:03,103
They said 100 years ago or whenever it was

1517
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:05,151
That depicted

1518
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,687
A character called Eli

1519
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,735
Google benchley

1520
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,015
Pre-made pretzel

1521
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:10,783
Mars

1522
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,319
And so

1523
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,599
I don't have a

1524
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,879
Copy of that book but I

1525
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:15,903
Just what I heard

1526
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:16,927
Investigate

1527
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,975
Find it.

1528
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,743
Quite

1529
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,815
Security clearly hasn't looked into this at all

1530
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:25,119
Because if she had she'd have a much better

1531
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:28,959
Conspiracy about it project

1532
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:32,031
Publix 53

1533
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:38,943
It was written by Nazi rocket scientist Wernher von Braun

1534
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:44,319
Extra part do weights over nerve on Braun

1535
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:49,183
Yeah essentially used his imagination to pull Elon Musk

1536
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:49,951
Ask from

1537
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,231
The Multiverse

1538
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:56,607
And inflicted him upon us here that's what you're telling me you wrote a book

1539
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,631
What is

1540
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,983
I read some parts of it

1541
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,519
I wouldn't say it's good Syfy

1542
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:09,663
It may be sci-fi written by a Nazi rocket scientist

1543
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,223
In the book The person who takes humans

1544
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,759
Mars isn't named Elon

1545
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:17,343
The office of the presidency in the Martian government is called

1546
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,879
Vee law

1547
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:21,951
That's the level of information that Carrie has on the topic

1548
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,719
Precisely to switch

1549
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:26,559
You get from seeing a meme or something

1550
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:32,191
Don't if you sincerely believe this meant something wouldn't you've read the book when you've liked

1551
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:35,519
You know damn well what the name of the book was who wrote it

1552
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,543
What the connection

1553
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,823
Elan is because

1554
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,127
If you believe it has a meaning

1555
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,151
It would help you

1556
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,455
You understand what's happening in the present day

1557
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,759
Is there be other information it's not like

1558
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,783
That one p

1559
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:52,415
Piece of trivia is the only thing that's important they're right so what you're saying is that

1560
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,439
If you heard

1561
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,767
Maybe third or fourth hand

1562
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,839
That a prophecy might have existed in a book

1563
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,375
That may exist

1564
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:04,447
LeBron

1565
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,727
About Eli

1566
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:06,751
Then

1567
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:07,519
You

1568
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:12,639
Would go like oh I should read that Pope and guess what Carrie also believes that the Nazis could time travel

1569
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:24,159
If the Nazis could go back in time

1570
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,439
The Rockets

1571
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,719
And then the Elon

1572
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,999
It all makes sense

1573
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,303
I mean they're pieces of something

1574
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,119
I heard there was a prophecy

1575
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,655
I'm going to be president

1576
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:38,751
Fun interesting cool right let's just move on

1577
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:42,591
I think it one of the reasons that people like Carrie don't learn more about the

1578
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:45,663
The things that they're like they see like this

1579
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,455
Is because if you learn more

1580
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,223
It's Les Schwab

1581
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:52,575
Actually more fun because then you'd learn who's my Braun

1582
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,111
Right

1583
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:58,463
This is got to be a learn

1584
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,487
Learned behavior

1585
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,023
That is is

1586
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,047
So much

1587
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:04,863
For you and I would be like putting our hand on the

1588
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:05,887
On the burner

1589
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,703
Proverbial burner you know I got burned

1590
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:13,055
I'm not going to do that again every time they look into stuff they get disappointed by real

1591
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:16,895
Happened a couple times and you learn like don't date too far

1592
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,295
And then you try and explore them

1593
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,087
The surface level of the headlines

1594
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,111
Alex reads

1595
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,647
You see the results of

1596
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:29,695
It doesn't

1597
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,719
Bend towards

1598
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:36,351
The Alex peed right about stuff on some level subconscious or otherwise

1599
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,423
People that carry probably have that intuition to

1600
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,727
Best naat

1601
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:44,543
Actually trying confirm things

1602
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,567
Instead

1603
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:48,639
Let's take our information from a murderer who makes stuff up

1604
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:51,199
Let's take our information from

1605
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:55,039
Weird monster manuals that a guy

1606
01:04:55,295 --> 01:05:00,927
Yeah this is totally aware of it it's just Skinner ISM like

1607
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,975
That level of like I've just

1608
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,255
If I don't look

1609
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:05,791
Things could happen

1610
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:06,815
If I do look

1611
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:07,839
Things bad happen

1612
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:12,703
That's that they'd ever have to be aware of that

1613
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:19,359
Wow what a

1614
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:22,175
You know obviously we've missed some of the alien talk

1615
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:24,223
And I'm glad that there was a little bit of it

1616
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:24,991
Oh yeah

1617
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:29,855
Terrified to learn that Africa is under the control of the aldebaran

1618
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,647
This is big

1619
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:35,743
Earthshatter I mean well I mean it's at least

1620
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,023
One-seventh of Earth

1621
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,559
Shattered

1622
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,863
How does that affect

1623
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:45,215
How we would go about our lives

1624
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:45,983
Somebody

1625
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:50,591
And not some but I mean I'm not talkin about specifically like a person although I assume

1626
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:53,919
Could be a personal first

1627
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,711
Could just be like okay

1628
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,503
Aldebaran

1629
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:58,527
You guys are dumb

1630
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,551
You get Africa

1631
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:03,903
We got to help us with space, but I mean like you can't just say you get Africa

1632
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,183
Sprite the who did that

1633
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:11,327
The fact that somebody somebody is conceivably has my power is or shatter

1634
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:14,655
Explored the idea that the Chinese are working with spider beings

1635
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,423
Is

1636
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:19,007
Is troubling ever true for sure I mean not because we're anti spider

1637
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,543
No no no no

1638
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:25,919
We know we are into the spider leadership

1639
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:29,759
Ladybugs around the house

1640
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,831
Where is Ibiza

1641
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:39,487
If I remember the Vietnam conflict

1642
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,023
Anagen Beatles come through portals

1643
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:47,423
I'm trying to eat people. Why there wildfires in order to cover up for the portals open

1644
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:48,191
Mirak one time

1645
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:54,591
Yeah that's what I was bombed close of the Stargate

1646
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:57,151
And I think that they wanted to steal a

1647
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,943
Antiques

1648
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:02,015
Relics this is what covid really took away from us

1649
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:06,367
All of our good conspiracies are now just like there's a bubble

1650
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:10,719
Yeah I think the world is so bad in many ways that like the

1651
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:13,279
The fun elements of

1652
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:15,327
This space conspiracy staff

1653
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,351
Kind of

1654
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:22,751
It's okay it's Rob you're deprived of it emotionally-charged about

1655
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:29,151
Everything all the time you know like she can't enjoy these conspiracies to mad because we're being murdered

1656
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:35,551
The phenomenon

1657
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,319
Trump

1658
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,111
I brought in so much

1659
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:40,159
Conspiracy ISM to politics

1660
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:42,975
Overlap

1661
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:43,999
Is ruining

1662
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,023
Conspiracy

1663
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:49,119
Air along with politics

1664
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:53,215
These are more boring and politics is more destruct

1665
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:59,615
There used to be like a political conspiracy had like JFK assassination and stuff like that

1666
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:03,711
Maybe with tertiarily involved in politics

1667
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,503
That lived in a

1668
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:11,903
Space and the real crazies would combine the two and they be like all aliens kill.jfk and you'll be like well now we know we don't

1669
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:13,183
I have to worry about you sir

1670
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,999
And there will be less of that new age

1671
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:18,047
A easy off and then it all just

1672
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:21,375
Spell singular Turtle towards qanon stuff in

1673
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,143
Blah

1674
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,167
Now it's all one

1675
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:27,007
But anyway we got a little bit of a taste of the old days

1676
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:28,799
Delicious

1677
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,847
So I will be back Jordan

01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:32,895
Probably

1680
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:39,295
Present episode on Monday

1681
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:43,135
We aren't intelligent B2 - 8 Jordans

1682
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,159
Not Uncle Joke

1683
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,695
Nautical joke

1684
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,999
Call back please

1685
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:53,887
Silverback

Dzx Clark I hope you all have a dreamy creamy summer

1687
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,263
The sex robot
