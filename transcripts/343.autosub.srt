00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,168
Obviously we didn't talk about it

9
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,984
Okay because of course

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,384
What happened last weekend Fleet Lee forgot about it

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,712
I woke up on the table

12
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,368
Oh that's a real thing that can happen

13
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,024
My favorite horror movie is there

14
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
Situation in real life where you were at

15
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
Actually like

16
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,400
You know like I thought I was going to die

17
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
Yeah man I got robbed at gunpoint when I worked at a gas station

18
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,992
Didn't think that there was any reason

19
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,576
But this would turn into a murder but that didn't mean I didn't still go into shock

20
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,904
Cars get off the road

21
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,928
Black ice

22
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
Those moments

23
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
Terrifying

24
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,816
I don't know moments in the car driving

25
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,144
Really bad driver

26
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,240
And I have never been

27
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,264
Situation

28
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:24,128
Chicago for a car

29
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,968
I moved here I haven't really explored the possibility of

30
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,760
Getting my driver's

31
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,368
Distractible

32
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,512
I'm not I'm not good at defensive driving

33
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,560
Not exciting

34
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,216

Terrified

40
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
Merging onto

41
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:07,648
Incoming traffic on the highway I'm dead

42
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,464
Corset never did but

43
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
That would make

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,704
Subway

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,824

46
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:32,736
I'll just to avoid merging absolutely

47
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:38,880
Expound more on this than getting robbed at gunpoint

48
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,096

Struggling

56
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
Glad you didn't ask about scary movies

57
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,344
Because I hate

58
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,488
And

59
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,607
A little bit about 1

60
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:25,983
I know the last episode

00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,543
The present and find out what's going on with Alex

62
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,871
Watch him as whatever his story is goes the direct

63
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,663
It's going

64
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,551

65
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,695
Listen to it again

66
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,279
For our show

67
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:53,631
And then he did his debate night coverage of the democratic debate

68
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,423
Just stupid

69
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703

I'm still sticking with Avatar Aang

73
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,599
The only thing that I thought was really in

74
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,183
Interesting at all is being brought on and it's really

75
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
Disgust

76
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,487
Quite a bit Howie's

77
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
The political gambler

78
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,303
And it really seems like he's

79
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
He's trying to hand

80
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,167
Handicap the field so the audience can bet on the election

81
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959

That's hilarious you can only do it outside of the United States

89
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,663
There are places that like pennies audio

90
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,199
It's not gambling

Man I have a

102
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,151
Point where it's becoming harder and harder for me

103
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
To deny certain

104
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
Things about Alex Jones

105
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,759
And one of them is

106
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
I think we were dumb

107
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,575
To ever consider him

108
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
Shopping

109
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,975
I think it we were foolish

110
00:06:55,231 --> 00:07:00,095
That we ever thought that stupid was a possibility

111
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
Consider the possibility

112
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,959
That the appearance of stupidity is cover for the

113
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,543
Okay crazy thing

114
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335

Being dumb

118
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
Is an act

119
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,063
At this point

120
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,623

197
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,871
Got a lot of bad tweets from racist

198
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,247
Year on April 3rd and it's

199
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
Like

200
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,807
During these times when I'm listening

201
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,599
To Alex's show

202
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,927
Keep socks and there's a lot of stuff throughout a lot of it

203
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
But then there's other times

204
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,999
When I'm like oh boy

205
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:16,767
Here we go

206
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
I like

207
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
This beginning

208
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,143
It doesn't last long but I really like

209
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
Education

210
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:38,015
And I heard last week

211
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
Eyebrow razor

212
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,743
I was just talking to a senior Secret Service Personnel today

213
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
Amazing

214
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,567
Yesterday afternoon

215
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,615
Coming up

216
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
And

217
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
Features

218
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,863
My fingers for about 20 minutes

219
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
What

220
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
What

221
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,007
Guess what

222
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
And

223
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,575
Is my favorite kind of

224
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:49,951
I want Alex to live there

225
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:56,095
Look there's people and they're putting out this video about houses

226
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,119
Okay

227
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
You guys know that

228
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,799
Guy who spoke out the globalist

229
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
I love it

230
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
That's pretty good

231
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,015
Yeah that's pretty good

232
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:19,391
I'm not going to I'm not going to take that and end

233
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
I don't have time

234
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
Bulshit

235
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
Right

236
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,071
I looked at it and I was like a dog

237
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
I'm going to need it

238
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
Talk about their bowls

239
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
But

240
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
It's not your b*******

241
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,823
This is because

242
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
Big

243
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:45,247
I feel like I could pick you back in a little bit

244
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:50,879
Haunted

245
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,463
A crucial element of the story

246
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,911
This was a video of a secret service agent to be a reptilian

247
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
But that was

248
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,983
The central focus of a lot of the framing

249
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,775
When the videos were posted on YouTube

250
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Here's a description

251
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,591
Went along with the video

252
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:16,991
A shape-shifter alien humanoid working for the powers that be taught in high-definition video

253
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:22,623
Zionist cabal

254
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:28,511
President Obama during a speech he gave to a pack for the American Israel public affairs committee

255
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:35,167
Conspiracy it was at The Reptilian shapeshifter was highly important

256
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,263
Zog Affair government

257
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,271
With that part of it

258
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:55,903
Is why a lot of these internet dub dubs were interested in the first place

259
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
The the

260
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:01,279
A package Interstellar involvement

261
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,887
What are the reasons that Alex

262
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655
Is that like

263
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,935
Forced his hand on

264
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
But because Glenn Beck

265
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
Offense

266
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,591
Opportunity

267
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,407
Lot of f****** time yelling about

268
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Episode

269
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
That's a complaint

270
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
Kinda funny

271
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:34,815
It's not about the aliens that's about the Alex's narratives about the billions of bullets

272
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:40,959
I don't want to hear that because we were just talking about

273
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,751
But that's what the pronoun reference

274
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,343
Who is George Soros

275
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,815
So he takes issue with putting such a sharp focus on that George Soros

276
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
You just can't

277
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
Entire body

278
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:19,359
Act one bag calling

279
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
Small part of it

280
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,015
Because once you start looking at all directions you find out this guy doesn't believe

281
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,087
1 Police

282
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,183
That's one of the most important

283
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,487
Of doing the show

284
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,815
Separating the real from the facade

285
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
Intrinsic

286
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,727
And there are very few things

287
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,967
Volume

288
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,087
Is kind of a good

289
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,111
Wait for me

290
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,391
Read that sentence

291
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,463
Masculinity

292
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,791
Apollo his version of masculinity

293
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
Glenn Beck

294
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,239
Is it

295
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,335
Alex

296
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:38,463
Says the guy who starts

297
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,663
I did get plenty of men who like real

298
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,271
But leaving that aside this is so ridiculous

299
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,575
A laundry list of right-wing

300
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
Yours to call each other

301
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,671
You trollop you trollops

302
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,999
The challenge

303
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
My friend

304
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
Like this is not the only

305
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,287
Glenn Beck light in the loafers

306
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,823
Doesn't like eat beets or two

307
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,223
Throughout this episode but I think that's a pretty good

308
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
Example of it

309
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:39,647
Joey also is convinced going back is just afraid cuz I would

310
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,231
Just went on

311
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
Yeah like everybody

312
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,815
Glenn Beck is f******

313
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,399
He makes another claim here in the

314
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
It is also

315
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,239
Incongruous with his bowels

316
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,263
Does presentation

317
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,831
Because I

318
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:21,375
I just don't even know what to say

319
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,919
Biggest frog

320
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
I like

321
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:44,159
Alex's version of Glenn Beck

322
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,743
I'm not sure if it's accurate portrait

323
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:51,327
Hey keeps calling me a fascist

324
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:05,407
Alex has been bought off by Peter 2

325
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:11,807
I thought it was

326
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,343
Campaigning

327
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
Computer tail was

328
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:19,488
Just a few years back Alex is a beast

329
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,792
He should remember the things he thinks

330
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:27,168
Opposite

331
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
Liberty Movement

332
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,528
Who else what else

333
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,576
Conclusion

334
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,416
It's weird he's really really mad

335
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,976
Glenn Beck a spends an inordinate amount of time

336
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
Episode

337
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:06,080
I just want you to like me

338
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,128
So we're starting up the

339
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,688
Where can I get into a little

340
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
And then we're going to

341
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,480
Come together I'm going to

342
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:16,320
Bravo

343
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:27,072
Yeah I will call it it does kind of feel like the possibility of a fight

344
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,864
And then coming to Daytona

345
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,704
It works for everybody to price out of it

346
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,728
With architect

347
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,288
Say horrible things about each other

348
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:46,528
Okay if David Summit

349
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,320
Big developments

350
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,624
Vagina coming up later

351
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,256
He insinuates himself into the show and one of the most amazing ways I've ever heard

352
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,304
Alright I'm so excited to tell you all about it

353
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,584
Before we get to that

354
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,120
Alex has to make

355
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,168
Oh really weird

356
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,032
For years and years one of the most consistent

357
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
Just like me

358
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,872
Then telling his audience

359
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,920
That's at the globalist

360
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:18,784
Homeland Security all of them have decided that white people are terrorists

361
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,808
Yeah right

362
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,600
So against that

363
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,368
You make

364
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,904
Stunning claim

365
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,584
Wheelman head screwed on straight

366
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,192
That is not good

367
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,728
Because sometimes

368
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
They are

369
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,360
You know it's either that or

370
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,896
Coming out as pro-terrorist

371
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,712
I think he is

372
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,528
Right right

373
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:55,904
The Weeknd

374
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,280
Maybe he just really actually loves he's covering for the 9/11

375
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,096
He's actually disappointed cuz they weren't real terrorists

376
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
Terrorist

377
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,960
Are real men

378
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
Patriots

379
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,264
FleetPride

380
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,920
Like revolutionaries in Central and South America

381
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,688
Like

382
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,224
Any communist

383
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,272
That would be labeled a terrorist

384
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,136
Yeah okay I guess he likes assert

385
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,952
Okay

386
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,608
Sort of a couple a couple of

387
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,632
Narrative

388
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,424
News stories

389
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
That he's throwing out on

390
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,240
Episode that

391
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,520
I think our

392
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
Search clearing

393
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
Indications of Hattiesburg

394
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,408
I can't stress enough like how this

395
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,688
Is a

396
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
Print of

397
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,736
How is processor

398
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,528
This is work it's pretty impressive

399
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:08,096
Cops and prosecutors

400
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,944
So what's going on here he doesn't explain the story at all there were likes

401
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
Some murderers

402
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,480
So District

403
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,832
I guess

404
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:34,464
Maybe he covered this on like the Nightly News or something he hasn't brought it up on the actual show yeah

405
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,280
I guess he's relying on his audience

406
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,816
Be aware of the story is very strange

407
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
But

408
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,912
The story he's talking about the actual news story about

409
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,472
Security is out of the local Dallas Outlet

410
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,776
Discussing Vista idea of whether or not

411
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:54,176
Areas where they have to go from the building to parking at unprotected area

412
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
Murders in the

413
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,480
The area of gesture

414
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
Officials

415
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
I'm still on the Run

416
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,600
We should not

417
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:06,976
Target

418
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,536
Yeah so 3 like I said

419
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,816
Because in early 2013

420
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,608
There were string of murders

421
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,888
In Kaufman County Texas

422
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,168
And two of the victims

423
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,448
Chief assistant just

424
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,984
Search attorney and the criminal District

425
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
Attorney in the county

426
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,568
And the third victim was the latter's wife

427
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,432
It was its cleared there was targeting

428
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
The pattern

429
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:31,296
There was some conversations in the media that the culprits were members of the Aryan Brotherhood

430
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,112
And there were some reasons to suspect that was a possibility

431
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:39,232
4134 members of the Aryan Brotherhood had just been indicted I believe was

432
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,512
Houston right around the

433
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,352
The chapter in the area is described as

434
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,400
The splc

435
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
Most important

436
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,008
The beginning of the burden

437
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
Murder spree

438
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:56,128
The Texas Department of Public Safety released a warning that the Aryan Brotherhood hit made

439
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,200
Threats of retaliation that the department found credible

440
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,736
There's plenty of reason

441
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,296
To think that these guys were definitely

442
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
Considering the possible

443
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,136
Does the Kaufman County

444
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,184
Attorney's office also was involved

445
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,488
There's a bunch of organization

446
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,072
In the case that ended up getting these 34 members

447
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
Indicted

448
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,376
But like they were one of them

449
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,680
Yeah so it makes sense if there

450
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,216
Threatening retaliation

451
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,544
We are one of the groups that was involved in that

452
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,896
People have been murdered and heard it's it

453
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,944
They're suspicious

454
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
It makes noise

455
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,272
Who murdered those guys

456
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,808
Was it those guys who

457
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,112
He said they wanted to murder guys like that

458
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,392
Could be those guys

459
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,440
It's worth considering

460
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,256
Fears that his gut instinct

461
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,072
Based on zero information is to defend

462
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,632
Supremacist group and say it's more likely it was Mex

463
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
Cartel gang

464
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,960
Yeah he literally has no reason to say

465
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:59,616
You have one violent white organization wants violent Mexican organization

466
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,152
High-profile Boston it threatened

467
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,944
Retaliate

468
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,248
Lead him to do

469
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,856
That's what he does

470
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,184
But if you were a media figure and

471
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,976
You said I think this is why

472
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,608
You would have reason to say that based on information

473
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,144
Ultimately you be wrong

474
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,704
As a reason for suspicion

475
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,032
No reason for that suspicion

476
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:31,360
Jeff Pickett

477
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,432
I can't prove anything yet

478
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,224
It suggests that our main suspects

479
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
Is it going to be the

480
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,528
Aryan Brotherhood

481
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,880
Waterford

482
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,792
I think you might not be into Japanese people

483
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,608
The Aryans nor the cartel

484
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,424
The guilty party was Eric Lyle Williams

485
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,448
And his wife Kim

486
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,008
Eric was a former attorney and Justice of the Peace

487
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:03,104
You said Kaufman County but even caught on camera stealing $600 worth of

488
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,152
Computers which ultimately led to him being

489
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
Convicted by the justice system in golf

490
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712
County

491
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:11,552
According to his wife he immediately came home and began plotting his revenge

492
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:18,208
Kim says that Eric kept her high on morphine through the. While he was plotting the murders so she didn't really experience the

493
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,232
Clearly

494
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,000
And now that she's a

495
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,024
Prison

496
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,304
She's seriously regrets.

497
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,072
But you didn't do anything

498
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
Stop him

499
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:29,472
The crime though it wasn't the Aryan Brotherhood the police had very good reasons

500
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,520
Respect them as they're being involved

501
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,568
Though it wasn't the Mexican cartel

502
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,848
Alex had absolutely

503
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,944
This isn't

504
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,480
Incredible display of his races

505
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,832
And I think it's a really good example how that stuff penetrates so much of his coverage

506
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,904
This is a seemingly innocuous unrelated story

507
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,928
His gut

508
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,744
Is to deflect criticism of the white supremacist gang

509
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,328
Even though you know what history of murdering police

510
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,120
It didn't the abstract

511
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,216
I give it a 20

512
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,752
I don't know what that mean

513
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,824
Get somebody on here

514
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
Scott abetting

515
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,688
Situation

516
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,224
White supremacist

517
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,320
What you have is a pretty clear-cut

518
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:19,648
Example of a place where he is

519
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
For the perception

520
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,512
That area Nations Aryan Brotherhood were involved

521
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,048
And pointing the finger

522
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,328
A Mexican cartel

523
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,352
A notary

524
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,656
But I kind of.

525
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
But it's a bad

526
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,344
Mexican Mafia

527
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
What do you mean

528
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,768
56 different versions of the

529
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
Oh boy

530
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,912
I've got the Ninja

531
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:06,752
No

532
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:10,592
Probably

533
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,360
Some got killed

534
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,664
Prosecutor

535
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
Okay

536
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:18,272
District

537
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,040
Right

538
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,320
His Joseph

539
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,112
For assume

540
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,672
With no evidence

541
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:28,512
Dad was a cartel

542
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,792
People

543
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,584
Enable other state

544
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,400
Right

545
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,496
Haha

546
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,520
Chicken cartel

547
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:44,640
Previously

548
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,200
I hate I hate to put it this way

549
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:53,600
But you perfectly understand that's not know that is exactly what it is

550
00:31:55,392 --> 00:32:01,024
The story Alex's is referencing to strengthen his assertion that the Kaufman County killings are Mexican gang

551
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:08,448
I'm is about the chief Deputy district attorney out of Colorado with Heather Stein

552
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,776
Who along with her husband killed an intruder who is breaking

553
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
Scuffle

554
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:21,760
3

555
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,784
They all hit him

556
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,832
Pretty spectacular

557
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,648
Wow about to have no connection

558
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,440
To the couple

559
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,000
He tested positive for

560
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
Cartoon

561
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:40,192
You tested positive for meth Oxycontin morphine and his autopsy

562
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,240
I cut quite a cocktail

563
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,640
I wouldn't even know where to

564
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,408
Begin

565
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:54,272
No one suspected the Aryan Brotherhood because the circumstances that lighted

566
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,064
Suspicion

567
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
To this case

568
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,368
No threat

569
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,792
To kill legal employees really know

570
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,864
Joshua Stevens

571
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,448
Assume that Alex is wrong on this one

572
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,520
Hey guess what is David been released by April 2nd

573
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,080
The day before this episode recorded

574
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:24,480
So Alex has every reason to know that against Mexican cartel gang

575
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
Got it

576
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,112
So good

577
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,744
This stupidity is cover

578
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,560
For the evilness that he's actually

579
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:43,680
The actual case is really weird and I'm not sure anyone knows what happened

580
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:49,312
It could have been an attempted burglary but it also could have been a horrible misunderstanding was fueled by the

581
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,592
These drugs I was on

582
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,176
The stockings home is actually a converted Hotel

583
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:59,296
So there's a decent chance that when Steven thought it was a place you could rent a room

584
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,344
From there because he was so f***** up on these

585
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,904
These drugs the situation escalated in a fight broke

586
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:07,488
The DA's report does reflect circumstances that are not

587
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,792
Really what you'd expect your son was trying to break

588
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,352
Question definitely link

589
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,656
Doesn't look like

590
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,192
Breaking entering

591
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,240
But also because he was so f***** up

592
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:22,080
It could be a really weird

593
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,104
He could have looked up

594
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,432
He could get

595
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,456
Very very well

596
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,504
Yeah with that number

597
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,040
Variety

598
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,320
Severity of dragon

599
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,136
If

600
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,928
Nobody is capable of telling

601
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,952
What he thought

602
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,720
He would say

603
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,744
Right even have

604
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,816
Whatever the case is the DNA found at this time today

605
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,376
Completely within the law and their actions were

606
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,424
Artifact

607
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,616
Because he's prejudiced piece of s***

608
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,736
Why are you doing

609
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:01,760
I mean we know why

610
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,576
That's that's just really

611
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,368
Really bad

612
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,648
It's really really bad

613
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:12,256
8-bit

614
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,048
This is such a good

615
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:14,816
Example

616
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,864
Of how this bigotry in the

617
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,632
Is prejudice

618
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,400
Infest

619
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:22,240
The show he's talking about race issues

620
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,800
It involves all of these the way he

621
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,104
Covers a lot of stories

622
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,384
X

623
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,664
I skip over stuff

624
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,712
Kind of like this but this was so egregious

625
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,480
Do spiders like

626
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
This is a great

627
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:37,088
Case in point case study

628
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,624
The tentacles of prejudice

629
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,648
Just are every

630
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,928
Yeah it's not like

631
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,536
It's that literally everything

632
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,328
To do with a white

633
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,632
Eventually

634
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,400
Post office

635
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,960
If it's negative

636
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:02,432
Who is a veteran who apparently had his guns taken away

637
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:06,528
Oh no Tales

638
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,952
What will get into some of the details of Alex

639
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
Sturtevant Howie's

640
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,352
Like it's real

641
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,648
So

642
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,696
First thing about that clip is that

643
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,000
Alex Azar

644
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:24,864
Yeah he does that repeatedly because he will reframe everything that this guy says

645
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,912
Your language

646
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,448
And Then trailer

647
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:34,592
And he's he's not like one of Alex's normal gas to someone who has experience

648
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,872
Trudy's trying to relate

649
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
Contextualizing

650
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
I'm seem like

651
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,088
I keep telling a pecan

652
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,904
Disjointed

653
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,976
Too clunky interview but by the end of Alex has gotten

654
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:51,744
And this guy

655
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,584
More into the Rhythm of the Night

656
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:02,752
There is apparently he got put on like a 72-hour hold

657
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,288
For his own

658
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:08,640
I'm not sure about that I can't really find any information other than

659
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,176
His own telling of the story

660
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,736
But I looked a little bit

661
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,272
Apparently

662
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,600
The way the story is told that this guy was a veteran was dishonorably

663
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,416
Discharged honorably discharged

664
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,256
Presages what the globalist

665
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,560
Want to do to all the brave Patriots

666
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
Out there in the world

667
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,680
The story is that schmecker went to a doctor to try and get pain meds

668
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:37,312
What a veteran who gets their Healthcare through the VA shows up at a doctor's office looking

669
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
A pain pills

670
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,128
They're required to get a psych evaluation

671
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
In from the VA

672
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,200
In an effort to screen out drug-seeking Behavior

673
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,760
Jamaica refuse to get that evaluate

674
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,368
Referred him back to the VA for the evaluation

675
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,952
Call Debora follow-up Macker wasn't home

676
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,792
He called dude wasn't

677
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:02,912
And apparently the answering machine message that he got was enough to worry him for smackers well-being

678
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,824
The doctor recommended wellness check and the police showed up and

679
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:16,736
I'm not sure what to make of the story primarily because the only information I can find on it comes directly from him

680
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,296
And even by his telling of the story his act

681
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,344
Created the situation he found himself

682
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:27,744
This wasn't an instance of tyranny,

683
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,792
To follow the va's guidelines

684
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,096
Disturbing

685
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:35,680
Who acted in red flags to mental health care providers

686
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:38,240
Like there's no way to say this for sure

687
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:42,336
Almost $0 just shown up for the VA psych evaluation

688
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,104
It wouldn't

689
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,896
Formality

690
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:49,760
It would have been fine as long as he didn't use it as an opportunity to rant about the government track

691
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,040
How to use psych evaluations

692
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
Stick control

693
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,856
Do people in society

694
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,392
If you just go

695
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,488
I'm almost certain of that

696
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,768
So overworked

697
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
If he had gone

698
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,584
Hyundai

699
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,144
Psych eval

700
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
Maybe

701
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
Yeah maybe

702
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,824
Baby

703
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,152
Would be a behavior that you would be looking

704
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:22,528
Paranoid

705
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,344
Baby has the mother issues

706
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,392
And if you recognize that

707
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,928
You're probably failing

708
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,720
A little bit from the mental health perspective

709
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,328
I want to hear this dude

710
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,352
This to himself

711
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,888
Just didn't

712
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,192
Follow the steps that are appropriate

713
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:40,960
Required

714
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,008
Holiday

715
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,544
It's just something that is

716
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,592
64 Alex to manipulate

717
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,920
Oh yeah oh yeah you know you

718
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,712
You just have guns

719
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,760
If you don't want to submit to the

720
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:59,136
Would you go to the DA you're going to go to the VA you're going in there and it's

721
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,416
Just for them

722
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,952
To get your gut

723
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,512
So you refused to do that so they took your guns and

724
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,280
Retaliation

725
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,816
Going to the VA

726
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,400
But I thought it was there so when I went

727
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,824
Acting a little bit

728
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,224
Overreacted a little bit

729
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,528
Over-aggressive

730
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,648
All those guns

731
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,232
I don't have enough information about this situation

732
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,024
To say this with any

733
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,048
Absolute search

734
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,656
But from the pieces of information that are publicly available

735
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,936
This is the situation

736
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,216
Where

737
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,496
This guy

738
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,288
Could have avoided all this

739
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,407
Very easily gotten his gun

740
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:59,039
That retained no harm no foul his behavior is exactly the reason

741
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,599
Things went the way they did

742
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,135
Sure

743
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,463
Personal responsibility is a very high priority

744
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,487
For the right

745
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,047
So Alex

746
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,631
Like all guns

747
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,167
Or being taken from veteran

748
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,239
It's happening

749
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,519
Really

750
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,543
Really freaks

751
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,567
All guns

752
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,871
One story where the guy

753
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,663
Getting all the reasons

754
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:30,527
Does it feel to like other people he's talked to.

755
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
Is a bunch of

756
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,719
Snitches

757
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,511
The VA is a bunch of snitches

758
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,303
Wow

759
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,167
The wave at the

760
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,703
Functions for our vets

761
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,519
Let alone with an a

762
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,543
Assholes

763
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,335
Hate and fear everyone at the

764
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,431
That's good where it's good it's good

765
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,087
Perception of what's going on

766
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,879
Now which is based on faulty

767
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,159
Information of misrepresentation

768
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,463
But he's really worried

769
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,743
Because

770
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:12,767
The present

771
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,071
Really matches

772
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:18,399
Miss representation

773
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:24,031
Right that's trouble take the predictions based on those lies

774
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,687
It's Dawning on me

775
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:36,319
They said they

776
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,135
Blood thinners

777
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,279
He's got a letter

778
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:56,287
Exquisite

779
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,823
Now I'm going to

780
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,359
Misrepresent various things

781
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,151
In order to prevent exit

782
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,967
I was right all along

783
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,735
It's crazy

784
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,503
It's just

785
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,039
To self

786
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:10,623
Fulfilling

787
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,391
The guy

788
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:14,463
If you got a letter L

789
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,791
I've never heard anybody he asks actually

790
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:28,031
One of those letters

791
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,759
So this clip

792
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,807
What where he's at a little bit

793
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,599
It's just so crazy how they

794
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:42,879
6 years ago

795
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,415
Nothing changed

796
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,423
Google set offshore

797
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,615
He just it's always the same

798
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,639
Never

799
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:09,247
Never changes there's the intensity of this right now another never f******

800
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,039
Exact

801
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,063
Exact

802
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,391
Spell for this

803
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,439
And I think it's

804
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,463
Funny

805
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,743
Considering Alex's

806
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,991
So shocking

807
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:46,367
Mariah to take pictures of hookers

808
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,159
Sex workers

809
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:53,535
Whatever it is it's not healthy it's not it's not healthy

810
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:59,935
No but I'm more interested in the other advice because this guy you know the police came and took his gun so that's why Alex is Target

811
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,983
The police in this equation

812
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,007
Cuz they're collaborate

813
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,567
But like

814
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,359
Alex recently

815
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,151
Was it sxsw

816
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,503
And he thinks that's the biggest

817
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,831
Superiority that is his life in a very long time

818
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,367
He refused to file a

819
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,159
White about how you're not going to

820
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:26,559
Complain about you don't tell the guy to overthrow city council get the police chief fired

821
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,703
Just working there

822
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:39,103
He wants his listeners because he knows that it won't work out it'll be a waste of time for them it'll

823
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,383
Personalized

824
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,431
But Alex will be able to report on it

825
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,223
He'll be able to create

826
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:49,087
Attention for himself and himself out of their action

827
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,927
He knows that's not in it for him if he reports this b*******

828
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,231
Did the Austin Police or whatever

829
00:46:55,487 --> 00:47:00,607
It's it's going to be filing a false complaint going to go nowhere whatever the case is

830
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:07,007
It's going to be a drag on his own time and resources

831
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,335
The the carnival

832
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,615
The parasite you know like

833
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,455
Our leaders

834
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,479
Just sucking off of

835
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,295
For your money

836
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,111
That's what I do that's what I do

837
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,903
I'm a f****** parasite

838
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,951
What do you want

839
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:31,071
As we find out

840
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,607
Like he's really against

841
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,143
These Mexican cartel gang

842
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,447
Imagines are on a rampage

843
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,983
Wow

844
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:44,383
Sure I prefer the real things they do as opposed to the imaginary line

845
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:52,063
Prosecutor

846
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:58,207
Just took out.

847
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,863
This is stupid

848
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,655
This is so stupid

849
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,191
They don't want to say who

850
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,215
And again

851
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,495
This isn't stupid

852
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:15,615
This is racist by stupid Behavior

853
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,431
Yeah that's that's where it where at

854
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:23,295
So as Alex that call with

855
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,087
He gets into

856
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:32,767
Right because he's decided that this guy was tortured in a North Korean

857
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,303
Powfu

858
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,887
Alex has an epiphany

859
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,007
I just realized this

860
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,055
4 years

861
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:00,159
Right now

862
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,743
Serious

863
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:07,583
And

864
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:11,679
Washington

865
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,735
You know what the feeling I get with

866
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,759
Stuff like that is

867
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,551
I don't know if you ever experienced

868
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:30,111
Go to church a lot

869
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,927
They're like small group meeting

870
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,743
Preacher of the alike

871
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,559
Heading to peponi the other day

872
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,911
God loves us

873
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:49,311
101 s*** already to Civil War

874
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,103
All the time

875
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,175
The same thing with that you

876
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:54,943
Which is like

877
00:49:55,967 --> 00:50:00,063
I'm telling you this because I know

878
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:06,463
This is the one time that I think I'm telling you the truth

879
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,023
Sort of

880
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,559
Does

881
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:13,119
I don't think Alex musically

882
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,935
You don't you don't believe it

883
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:22,335
You have an epiphany like that emotions and then you believe it

884
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,919
As opposed to

885
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,711
You viscerally felt

886
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:33,087
What you want to talk about it like you you had

887
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:33,855
Epiphany

888
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,391
Mooresville

889
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,159
Experience

890
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,183
Lights U2

891
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,743
Experience this in Moore

892
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,535
Real way

893
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,095
Tim self

894
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:49,215
Like this guy was in a p o w camp

895
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:53,311
Tiffany of a realization

896
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:56,383
He's already had plenty of times before

897
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,015
I think that Alex is

898
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,831
He's far more performative in the youth pass

899
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,367
Because what he's doing

900
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,391
He's trying to be

901
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,927
Like this is real

902
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:11,231
This is this is absolutely real

903
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:12,767
F****** know it

904
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:13,791
This is tyranny

905
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,815
It is arrived

906
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,191
I don't think he wants

907
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:21,983
Call Dale

908
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,895
During the last

909
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:39,903
Thomas Jefferson

910
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,207
Call godchild

911
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,631
Especially one charismatic

912
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:51,935
What

913
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,983
Trying to read

914
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,007
Just added

915
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:01,663
Text Brooke a definition for Lake

916
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:06,271
Literally knows

917
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,551
Nothing about Thomas Jefferson

918
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,623
Clifford little Snippets of qualities red in Malaysia newsletter

919
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:15,999
I will say that this one at least is a real quote but you have no idea what the quote is about

920
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:21,375
The words Alex always repeats are quote I've sworn upon the altar of God Eternal hostility against

921
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,143
Every form

922
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,423
Tyranny over the mind of man

923
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,959
And that sounds

924
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:31,359
Especially when you're Alex like about the New World Order and globalist

925
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:38,015
Reply back to religion I would like everything I own no idea where

926
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:42,111
It's from a September 1800 letter to Benjamin

927
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:46,207
Rush know what that letter is about like you said

928
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,791
Here's the quote in Kanto

929
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,375
The Clause the Constitution which

930
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,655
Secure the freedom of press

931
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:59,263
Covered also the freedom of religion

932
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,055
An establishment

933
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,591
Particular form of Christianity

934
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,871
Through the United States

935
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:07,199
Does every sect believes its own form is

936
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:07,967
Everyone

937
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,759
Perhaps hope for its own

938
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,087
But especially the episcopalians and congregational

939
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:17,183
They're returning to their house

940
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,743
Position

941
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,767
Power confided

942
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,815
Tumi will be exerted in opposition to their

943
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,863
And they believe truly

944
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,167
Upon the altar of God eternal

945
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:29,215
Hostility against every form of tyranny

946
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:29,983
Over the minds

947
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,287
Is a man but this is all they have

948
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:36,127
This is a quote about swearing Eternal hostility

949
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:42,527
Against all forms of tyranny but specifically

950
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,575
United States I don't know I don't know why Alex

951
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:50,463
Diametric opposition with Alex's b******* about the nation

952
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:54,303
And yet Alex pretends the world's number one

953
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,095
Some scholar and follower of his tradition

954
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,143
This is getting a bit redundant

955
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,935
But rest assured

956
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,215
I'm going to keep up

957
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,799
Keep bring up the mirror is Alex knows nothing about his hair out

958
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:09,919
Because it's important to reiterate over and over again Alex knows comes from extremist

959
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,223
Anti-communist propaganda sources

960
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,527
All of the historical ship that

961
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,319
Recite every time he drops

962
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343
These quotes

963
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,879
Out of context

964
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,671
He has no idea what their actual

965
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,439
We talkin about

966
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:25,535
You think you knew that was about religious

967
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:31,167
Nonsense I don't like the way you said that

968
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,799
Outback

969
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:46,015
Now gets back to his

970
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,087
Man

971
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:49,855
Baby it's just

972
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,927
Can't stress how weird is Jay

973
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,975
Just for people to be like I've epiphany

974
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,095
Last night

975
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,887
It just dawned on me

976
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,191
Alex isn't cool

977
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:20,575
Problem

978
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:24,927
Drama

979
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:28,767
Top movies

980
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,319
Surreality

981
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,255
Can we hear that

982
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,047
I can't imagine

983
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:02,815
That we've had a

984
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,839
A full week on

985
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:06,911
It's one of those

986
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,471
I can't imagine that it ever is at

987
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:13,567
I can't I can't even do this for years I don't think there is

988
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:16,895
Is one where were you not heard Alexei almost

989
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,663
Exactly

990
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:24,063
Because I've not thought

991
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,879
Double Wacky Wednesday

992
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:33,279
They're all

993
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,047
Is happening up

994
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,583
Too close to the problem I didn't see it

995
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,119
But it's not just the media

996
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,935
Not just the globalist everybody

997
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,343
Despise

998
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:02,975
School counselors

999
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:09,375
So he calls

1000
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,399
Vision while preparing us

1001
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,935
Episode

1002
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:19,103
I always prefer to show not tell when it comes to how bad Alex's but I kind of felt like doing that would be

1003
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:19,871
No one special

1004
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:25,247
It's very clear with Alex's doing

1005
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:26,783
Puritans

1006
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,319
There's no way around it

1007
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:33,439
Like you can hear it through his framing of the schmecker guys interview

1008
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,975
You can hear it and Howie's

1009
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:39,327
Demonizing the VA

1010
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:45,983
Ranting about how everyone's a global is spy and he's realized the Civil War

1011
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:49,311
That's performative in order to allow this escalation

1012
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,079
Rhetoric

1013
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,383
All of its aim specifically a veteran

1014
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:53,919
Constant

1015
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,711
Globalist

1016
00:57:55,967 --> 00:58:00,831
Know that they need to take out Military in order to take over everything

1017
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:04,159
It's what all resumes do they take out the Old Guard

1018
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,719
Authoritarian

1019
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,767
Some of the examples that uses our kind of

1020
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:09,791
I mean

1021
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:13,119
Yeah but also has more specific to it then like

1022
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,423
Hitler Purge

1023
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,447
ROM

1024
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,471
It wasn't like

1025
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,495
He wasn't killing

1026
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,287
Rank-and-file of veteran

1027
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:23,615
Power grab that was a leadership

1028
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:26,687
The base of the militia

1029
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:32,831
Leadership of the militia by killing The Regular Guy

1030
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,367
Mmbn like hey

1031
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:39,999
Bosses of the militia can I run now that Alex is using which is

1032
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:45,631
Kind of absurd like he's using these historical examples of times that Armed Forces

1033
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,399
Units have been

1034
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,191
Have been purged like that

1035
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:49,983
Typically

1036
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,519
They haven't been done

1037
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,055
From the ground up

1038
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:57,919
Right that doesn't seem like a good strategy but either way that's the way it's raining

1039
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:00,479
Leaderless

1040
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:06,367
The phone lines for military folks have had bad run-ins with

1041
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,135
VA

1042
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,671
It's just Alex

1043
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,695
Plus props

1044
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:13,023
One guy calls and who claims

1045
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:16,863
In a way but the story it's very clear that there's more to the story

1046
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:20,959
He keeps bringing up how his family is who keeps trying to get him help

1047
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,519
How he gets into altercation with his doctors

1048
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,799
Clearly someone who's

1049
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,591
Having a really hard time and needs

1050
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,151
Instead of treating the situation

1051
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,967
Stickley Alex use this guy to prove his point that the globalist

1052
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:33,503
Not only want your gun

1053
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,527
They also want

1054
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,295
Your kids

1055
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,135
Completely disgusting diatribe

1056
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,927
About how the CPS people are having

1057
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,511
I just couldn't bring myself to include that clip

1058
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:47,839
Like before and it's really nothing

1059
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:49,631
At the same

1060
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,423
Time I couldn't not bring this up

1061
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,471
Because it's so indicative of an oz

1062
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,007
Clearly doing on this episode

1063
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:59,359
He's absolutely trying to radicalize these met military folks in his audience

1064
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,663
By lying about everything and convincing him

1065
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,223
The people who say they want to help them like people

1066
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:04,991
VA like

1067
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:05,759
Psychiatrist

1068
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:07,295
Psychologist counselors

1069
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,111
There really is globalist

1070
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,927
Your kids and then have sex with them

1071
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:16,255
Listen to this episode I really don't think

1072
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:19,071
Just that I don't think this is just how we talk sometime

1073
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:20,863
Feel like this isn't

1074
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:25,471
It definitely feels like he's trying to rile up mentally unstable people

1075
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,495
Turn them against

1076
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,519
Anybody who

1077
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,287
Possibly

1078
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:31,359
Help them your turn them away professionals who can help

1079
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:34,943
I just hoping one of them does something horrific so you can claim it's a false why

1080
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:38,015
Might be a little bit out there for me to say but it's death

1081
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,039
Currently how it felt this

1082
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,367
Like he's trying to Target

1083
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,135
This

1084
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:45,695
Group the middle military veterans

1085
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:49,023
He's trying to radicalize them

1086
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,303
Through exaggeration

1087
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,095
Trying to take away

1088
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:58,495
Any appeal to support structures and then also preemptively creating

1089
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:02,335
Civil War and the globalists are going to create false Flags inflamed about us

1090
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,615
It

1091
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:07,199
Exactly what you would do if you wanted them

1092
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:07,967
I'm to do this

1093
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:09,503
Wow keeping your hands

1094
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:13,599
According to prove

1095
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,255
Wanted to

1096
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,047
Perform a cool during

1097
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,071
Ftr's

1098
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,191
They got

1099
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:28,959
Is the guy

1100
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,495
Exactly

1101
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:31,775
Basically said

1102
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:35,871
Get all the veterans together and then perform a soft

1103
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:37,919
And it's just

1104
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,223
It's just rile up a bunch of people who are

1105
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,503
Actively trying

1106
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:45,087
Help

1107
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,647
That's more of a coon

1108
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,743
Cuckoo

1109
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:55,071
This this feels like inspiration

1110
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,095
Stochastic

1111
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,959
It feels like he knows

1112
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:01,983
What he's doing

1113
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:05,567
Because there isn't an appeal to

1114
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,359
Solving the actual problem

1115
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,175
There anyone have anything

1116
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:13,503
There isn't an appeal to like let's say

1117
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:15,551
Greater oversight of the child protect

1118
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:18,111
Active Services there isn't an appeal to

1119
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:23,231
A bill introduced

1120
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:23,999
In order to

1121
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:26,047
Pueblo CO

1122
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,119
These

1123
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,167
Those are the things that you would

1124
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,959
Probably or

1125
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:35,519
You care more about these colors

1126
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:39,359
And not use them just as ways to prop up your narrative

1127
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:40,895
It seems to me

1128
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,175
Very clearly

1129
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,479
He's up to he's up to no good

1130
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:49,087
You have to be a psychopath

1131
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:50,623
Listen to so

1132
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,647
Play story

1133
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,207
Very clear

1134
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,511
All of that

1135
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:02,655
Girl spies

1136
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,615
Advice to give

1137
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,639
It's probably not

1138
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:44,383
Walmart advertisements

1139
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,255
I'm telling you

1140
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:24,063
Honestly break is what I say as a parody of

1141
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,951
What he saying there is

1142
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:32,255
Advocating for his audience to Target

1143
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,279
And harass people

1144
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,815
Because

1145
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,351
The application of

1146
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,631
ASO

1147
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,655
Nebulous

1148
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,423
It's so vague

1149
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:41,727
So the people at the VA

1150
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:44,031
Despise and snitches

1151
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,567
The police

1152
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,871
Loratadine

1153
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,895
Collaborators

1154
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:53,759
Anybody you suspect of being a globalist

1155
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:57,855
Now let's say someone is in the false flag terrorism event

1156
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:01,951
Cartels

1157
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,999
But you have to understand how this

1158
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,023
Rhetoric

1159
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:09,631
And like okay you know what happened

1160
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:11,679
They got hammered

1161
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:14,495
You know what happened

1162
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,031
Victims of things

1163
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,311
Who you

1164
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,847
Text suspicion on

1165
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:22,175
They got exactly

1166
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:27,807
You're telling your audience that all of these people who are

1167
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:34,463
I do know this nefarious s***

1168
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:37,535
Define they do evil stuff

1169
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,583
Just always be following

1170
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,863
This is definitively on

1171
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,655
No it's

1172
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,679
It's about to be

1173
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:49,311
I already be asleep might already be applying

1174
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:52,127
Specifically the Sandy Hook because he's still

1175
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:58,783
Not going full bore on that but God who has

1176
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,599
Expert in his elevator

1177
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:02,879
The platform

1178
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:03,647
So

1179
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:07,231
These things living in concert with each other are absolutely relevant

1180
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,767
Like

1181
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:10,815
Lumos

1182
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:18,239
April 3rd episode by talking about how

1183
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,031
Is a secret service agent

1184
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:23,103
Shrek

1185
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,407
The Dad episode

1186
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,463
Sicilian

1187
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:52,799
Hello

1188
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,359
Pixel

1189
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,135
From the Fantastic Four

1190
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:09,951
Superhero

1191
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:22,239
So I know who bit damp know is

1192
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,007
Shape-shifting

1193
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:26,591
Secret Service that alien guy is absolutely 100%

1194
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,871
Not that bongino

1195
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,663
Oh no

1196
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:33,759
Their heads are totally different shapes their facial features don't look anything alike

1197
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:38,367
There's the fact that you left the Secret Service in 2011 to unsuccessfully run for a senate

1198
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:39,903
That's a problem since

1199
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:45,279
Video of the supposed alien was shot on March 4th 2013

1200
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:49,631
Stop

1201
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:56,031
Ratigan unsuccessful a couple more times for Congress

1202
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,895
He had a show on nr8

1203
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:01,663
TV

1204
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,967
Through his career he's been

1205
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:05,247
He's been followed by

1206
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:07,295
From his former Secret Service

1207
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,111
Cohorts

1208
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:13,183
That is brand is being built on

1209
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:15,743
Information from

1210
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:19,327
Time on the job kind of betrayal

1211
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,119
Supposed to uphold

1212
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,143
Pretty much

1213
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:31,103
What's going on here is trying to associate bongino with this story because

1214
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,383
Outspoken

1215
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:35,455
And Alex has to claim that all such people are under attack

1216
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:40,831
Immediately Globus can't handle dealing with bongino's actual arguments

1217
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,367
For the accused

1218
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:44,671
Paranoid bowls

1219
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,231
So clear but Alex is doing at this point

1220
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:50,047
Is it

1221
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:54,399
The medical community VA the media Glenn Beck

1222
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:58,751
And how isolating Alex's being

1223
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:01,311
Also escalating is rhetoric

1224
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:03,103
Around the same time.

1225
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:03,871
Very nice

1226
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:07,455
There's a very sincere feelings

1227
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:10,271
His feelings and rage up

1228
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:13,855
Suspicious of anyone

1229
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:14,879
Just a recipe

1230
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:15,647
Reefer trouble

1231
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,695
He thought I'd describe it as

1232
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:18,719
Trains running

1233
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,999
Get through each other you know it

1234
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,023
He's going to happen

1235
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:22,815
It's it's

1236
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:23,839
Verite

1237
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:26,911
Makes me very

1238
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:33,055
Decided this is Dan bongino it's rotten

1239
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,335
Demonstrable

1240
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,407
It's not him

1241
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:41,759
Deciding vote him

1242
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,295
Is the same thing as proving

1243
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,599
Okay

1244
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:51,487
What

1245
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,839
No

1246
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,631
Know you can

1247
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,703
You can't just say

1248
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,751
We found out who he is

1249
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:09,151
My memory did that's breaking to prove it breaking news

1250
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:12,991
Alex has proven the Dan bongino is an alien

1251
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,807
It lazy

1252
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,831
Pretty sloppy

1253
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:25,535
To get bongino on the show to talk about it so you offer the bounty

1254
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,559
For him to become a

1255
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:33,727
Disintegration of 11

1256
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:39,871
And it's a disturbing pattern

1257
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:46,527
The offers a $500 interview

1258
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:48,063
Pupate

1259
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,343
The Obama phone

1260
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,975
What is that what is that mean

1261
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:57,279
Does it mean anything

1262
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,559
What is what is

1263
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:00,095
It means nothing

1264
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:02,399
Mike Adams

1265
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,679
April 4th

1266
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,447
Because Alex

1267
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,471
This is working on like some

1268
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,751
Studio renovations

1269
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,823
Studio

1270
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:16,479
Tool belt

1271
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:20,063
Fixtures

1272
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:23,903
Victoria

1273
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:31,327
Mike is covering is that North Korea threatening to start a nuclear war

1274
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:36,191
Play again to that a little bit a little severe about it

1275
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,471
We just kind of interesting

1276
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:38,495
Considering the way the rest

1277
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,775
Episodes going to play out

1278
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:43,359
So are we get to the fence cuz who gives a f*** about Mike Adams

1279
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:45,151
And Alex

1280
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:51,551
He's continuing his severity but however one wants to take your kids to globalstar going to kidnap

1281
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,319
Your children

1282
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:53,855
Here's

1283
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:54,623
The tone

1284
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:24,831
That means

1285
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:25,855
Secession

1286
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:26,879
What is that

1287
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:27,903
So

1288
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,975
So rather than smoke

1289
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,791
Which is how they going to take your guns

1290
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:38,143
Cuz it's more illegal now in 2013 than it ever has which is

1291
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,167
Pretty funny

1292
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:49,663
I don't know

1293
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,431
Tone is like

1294
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:54,271
Everything is against you you have to we have to

1295
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,575
Completely separate

1296
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:01,183
So he has some ideas about tyrant

1297
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,719
How you make them go away

1298
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,511
Sure

1299
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,079
Call wife

1300
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:24,479
Thomas Jefferson

1301
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:27,039
Come on man

1302
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:29,343
Installment of our favorite segment

1303
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:37,023
I thought I was kidding when I said I wasn't going to stop correct

1304
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:41,631
Literally I would never stop

1305
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:44,959
Sort of

1306
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:51,359
I use at least using some of the words of a real quote that gets passed around in the most common version of this quote is

1307
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:57,503
And people generally at the dawn of

1308
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:01,855
You can already tell that this is really have anything to do with the context Alex's

1309
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:03,135
Is using the Cloud app

1310
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:06,719
Princeton's when Jefferson says Enlighten the people generally

1311
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,023
I have to assume that means I have something to do with that

1312
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,303
Education

1313
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,327
Republic Republic

1314
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,119
And it does have some

1315
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,423
This line comes

1316
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,727
Bambara letter Jefferson

1317
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:20,287
Consent to pierce

1318
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:24,895
A French expat

1319
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,175
One of the largest companies

1320
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:30,271
U.s. history

1321
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:32,319
Anatomy of taking climate change seriously

1322
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,599
I won't hold that against

1323
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,623
Pierre though

1324
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:40,255
You probably have no idea

1325
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:46,143
Thomas Jefferson go for it

1326
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:49,983
This letter in April 1860

1327
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:53,311
And it's mostly about how much Jefferson likes the u.s. form of Albert

1328
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:59,455
I would argue that he's a little biased on the subject so

1329
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:00,991
I don't know

1330
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:07,391
Disproportionate comes from is specifically about discussing a

1331
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,927
Constitution that have been proposed in

1332
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,975
Which would require also

1333
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:12,767
Citizenship to be contingent on a person

1334
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,303
Ability to read and write

1335
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,327
Something

1336
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,351
Speaks of posit

1337
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,655
It was Jefferson spilling that tyranny

1338
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,703
And all those negative things in society

1339
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,471
Your body

1340
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:22,495
We'll just disappear

1341
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,775
The population was

1342
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:27,103
Which is probably very naive position

1343
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,199
Yeah

1344
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:32,991
Got the British

1345
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,015
Back off your f***

1346
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:40,415
Let's go to work

1347
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:46,815
It's better than the alternative but it's not a cure-all.

1348
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,607
Nothing to do with standing up against

1349
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:51,423
Tyranny of them disappearing like Mist in the morning

1350
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,703
Important

1351
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,239
I'm having a literate and educated

1352
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:57,055
Population since the masses are where the power resides

1353
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,847
In theory it's absolutely

1354
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:00,383
Crucial that the masses have the wisdom

1355
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,175
Them to appropriately use that power

1356
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:06,527
This is about education and literacy which as we've learned over and over

1357
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,295
Not one of Alec

1358
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,063
Strong suit

1359
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,367
There's a delicious irony

1360
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:13,183
That Alex is misusing a quote about literacy

1361
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:14,719
That he would understand

1362
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,767
If you took the time to read the things

1363
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,303
He pretends to Everette

1364
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:24,191
Every every f******

1365
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:24,959
Time he meant

1366
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,495
And he embarrassed

1367
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:27,263
Himself

1368
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:35,711
But him not reading the quote that specifically like about literacy and misrepresenting that

1369
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,479
Is just

1370
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:39,551
Amazing

1371
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:45,695
Over how many years

1372
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,975
Embarrassing

1373
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,279
You look incredible

1374
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,071
Credible

1375
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:53,119
Innovated

1376
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,935
The speaker someone else is really impressed

1377
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:58,239
On the April 5th episode

1378
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,263
Alex has deep

1379
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,031
Pieczenik back

1380
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,823
Sure put this

1381
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:02,847
Narrative

1382
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,615
Takes

1383
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,895
F******

1384
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,431
Swan Dive

1385
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:09,759
Okay this is not about that

1386
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,551
But it absolutely

1387
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:12,575
To be related

1388
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:13,855
In some way

1389
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,135
I just

1390
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:15,903
I love it

1391
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:16,927
I love this

1392
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:17,951
Cuz it's

1393
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,999
Something that only a crazy

1394
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,535
Easy person brings in

1395
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:22,559
Silk

1396
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:25,375
No one else would do something like that

1397
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:43,807
Korea

1398
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,903
Motion Pictures

1399
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:52,767
Has multiple degrees from

1400
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:54,559
Here in front of me

1401
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:04,543
Operation

1402
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:16,063
Great great stuff

1403
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:16,831
Here's what it is

1404
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:40,383
Has gone to the DMZ to report

1405
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,759
There's no way

1406
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:52,415
I will say his phone quality is almost always pretty bad

1407
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:54,719
Right call this coming from

1408
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:56,255
South Korea

1409
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:59,327
I don't know there's no

1410
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:07,519
Without telling anyone

1411
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,543
And I bet Ali

1412
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,823
Well of course I was

1413
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:20,063
Well you know Alex is the kind of guy who's really easy

1414
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:22,367
To run

1415
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:26,719
Key is to butter him up a little bit

1416
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:27,999
And here is house

1417
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:28,767
Steve present

1418
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:30,047
His trip to Korea

1419
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:36,959
Opportunity in the unique one and the reason I've done is to really be able to

1420
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:48,479
The only media that I can get the real truth

1421
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:49,503
Sing it now

1422
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:55,391
Real to the only real need ESO I had to go to Korea in order to make sure

1423
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:57,439
That the real truth gets out

1424
01:19:59,231 --> 01:19:59,743
Just on vacation

1425
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,279
If you just went on

1426
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,047
Listen to South Korea

1427
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,583
His wife was literally

1428
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,375
Oh my God

1429
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:08,191
You do realize

1430
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:08,959
You could do right now

1431
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:17,152
I'm way ahead of you managed to ignore her rolling her eyes like

1432
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,712
Leave Alex alone

1433
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:25,856
I have literally no idea Steve was actually in

1434
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,648
Korea

1435
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:31,744
Mostly because I was drunk

1436
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,560
In order to see what I can find I went checked out

1437
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:39,680
These blogs

1438
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:42,496
First you posted about Sandy Hook being a false flag

1439
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:45,824
Then he made another post about how he was going to be on Alex's show that

1440
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:54,272
On April 4th you returns claiming that he'd headed out to the DMZ to sniff out what is large-scale psych Warfare

1441
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:58,624
He claims a quote

1442
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,720
Isaac transition from a military leadership to civilian political system

1443
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,536
Add later in this episode when he's talked to Alex he's going

1444
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:11,168
Which claim more less responsibility

1445
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,728
So he saying he was in South Korea

1446
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,776
At the end of this

1447
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:24,992
48 which one is 5 years old

1448
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:31,392
Actually there at all

1449
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,464
Alright okay

1450
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,768
I have no f****** idea

1451
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:37,536
The Korean War

1452
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,840
Probably

1453
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,376
I guess

1454
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:43,168
Could have been in the country like

1455
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:43,936
The 80s

1456
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:44,960
As a tourist

1457
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,544
Is any kind of a player in any situation

1458
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,568
It doesn't make sense

1459
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:52,384
His claim that he was there and in the mixed follows it

1460
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,920
Certain pattern of taking credit for

1461
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,200
For everything that's ever have

1462
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:58,272
The evidence that accompanies his pose

1463
01:21:58,528 --> 01:21:59,808
Is 3 pictures

1464
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,088
What is a legend

1465
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,112
Steve

1466
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,136
Tourist spots

1467
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,160
In Korea

1468
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,720
I say allegedly because at this point

1469
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,744
2013

1470
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,560
Steve was still refusing to reveal himself publicly

1471
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:13,376
So he blurted out his face of these tickets

1472
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:15,168
It might not even be him

1473
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:20,288
Might just be someone interest pictures with the word face

1474
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,616
Blur don't say that

1475
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:31,040
They don't show anything that could actually just be a retired guy visiting South Korea to see the fight

1476
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,320
Which are now being Rica

1477
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,088
Contextualize

1478
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,392
Is proof that he's there.

1479
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:36,928
On April 5th

1480
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:39,488
Steve posted a picture of himself with a group of Korean

1481
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,376
Fatigue which group of soldiers on Leisure Time

1482
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,936
Is analysis is fairly

1483
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:54,080
North Korea knows that second South Korea would mean at the end of any real military or political exist

1484
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,616
For both the North and the South

1485
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:57,152
Incredibly unlikely

1486
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,432
You just seems

1487
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:04,832
To be mad at media Outlets are escalating the story and hyping up the possibility of a strike from North Korea which is weird

1488
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:05,856
Exactly what

1489
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:09,440
Has been doing

1490
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:15,328
The analysis of it isn't

1491
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,608
Escalation is

1492
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,656
Sensational

1493
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:21,728
It seems pretty clear

1494
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:22,752
Seems to be

1495
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,336
Deceitful

1496
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,384
To be advocating for

1497
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,664
I'm not really again

1498
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:39,648
Claiming to be in all different places

1499
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:41,696
Accused

1500
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:43,488
But what if he was doing that to give

1501
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:46,048
Clear-eyed foreign policy advice

1502
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:50,656
Clear-eyed foreign policy

1503
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,704
That's not analysis been anyone needs

1504
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:59,104
Let's go to Korea to have

1505
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:03,200
Publications put out by the intelligence company stratfor

1506
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,736
Steve is

1507
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,552
Exit trip goes on he offers no evidence

1508
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:11,648
You saying other than more tourist photos which I find

1509
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:18,560
He also complains on April 7th that he's being denied access to the US Embassy any military base and any other official

1510
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:22,400
Areas which is unacceptable

1511
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:25,728
Deputy assistant Secretary of State for East Asia

1512
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:29,056
This is a new title that I've never seen him

1513
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:31,616
You have an any other article or any

1514
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:34,432
In every other source he's at the title of deputies

1515
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,224
Assistant Secretary of State for management

1516
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:36,992
Which is

1517
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:42,368
Completely different wing of the state department organizational chart for this new title that he's giving himself

1518
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,672
Also if that was his position

1519
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:46,976
You would know that it's actually called the deputy assistant

1520
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:52,096
Secretary of Defense

1521
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:57,984
Legitimately this would be an entirely separate career from anything he's going to happen

1522
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:03,616
There is zero chance he was ever the deputy assistant secretary for it's just not possible

1523
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,664
Until there's more proof of this

1524
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,712
There's no way I can really even

1525
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,040
The evidence

1526
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,320
Tourist pictures

1527
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:16,160
And Analysis that anyone could have if they just read some

1528
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,952
Some s*** and it Daddy blurt

1529
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:18,720
We blurred the picture

1530
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,216
I kind of understand that

1531
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,240
Like it makes sense

1532
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,264
If he's legit

1533
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,312
It also makes sense if he's coming

1534
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:38,944
Sure I don't think that that very active trying to Maine

1535
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,712
Maintain your private

1536
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:40,992
I don't think

1537
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:42,528
Dammit

1538
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:45,088
Although it does make it much more difficult for you to

1539
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:51,488
Use tourist pictures as evidence of you being on a clandestine mission to South Korea in order to

1540
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,512
Tell Alex

1541
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:54,304
The truth makes it almost

1542
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,072
Infinitely

1543
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:59,936
Easier to claim that you weren't holding back

1544
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:01,472
Now unfortunately

1545
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,336
And all that stuff

1546
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:09,920
Some things that are real problems

1547
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:13,760
And actually make his timeline

1548
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:17,344
Timeline even more impossible

1549
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,904
Like we discussed in the episode all about

1550
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,928
Like what

1551
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:23,744
We didn't know other things

1552
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,048
Episode

1553
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:26,816
His timeline

1554
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:27,840
Literally a

1555
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:28,864
Okay

1556
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:35,264
But I know what I was trapped in I was 24 25 with Alex

1557
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,336
Mandatory two-year service

1558
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,432
Look there's just no way that's your story makes it impossible

1559
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:48,064
He claims he made the rank of 06 at age 32 which be pretty much unbelievable

1560
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,088
18th birthday

1561
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,928
He was drafted at 24 25 years of age

1562
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:55,232
Bentley's claimed he reached 06 and a Mac

1563
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,000
Maximum of eight

1564
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:57,536
Which is just

1565
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:58,304
I'm close to pop

1566
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:02,656
Yep after I last episode about Steve I got some messages from enlisted persons

1567
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,424
Veterans

1568
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,216
And their perspective was very

1569
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:06,496
Bayside

1570
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,776
There is no way

1571
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:10,336
Hey Steve could have reached 06 by 32

1572
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,616
It's just an insane

1573
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:14,688
Shorten that time frame

1574
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,456
Even further with

1575
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:17,760
More impossible for me to believe

1576
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:19,040
It's something he could have done

1577
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:20,320
Beyond

1578
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:23,136
At the time he was drafted

1579
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:24,672
He should have been in medical school

1580
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:30,560
You could get out of draft

1581
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:32,864
While he was doing his

1582
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,656
Residency

1583
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,424
As well

1584
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:39,264
And simultaneously he was getting

1585
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,032
HD from MIT

1586
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:47,456
Absolutely

1587
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:51,040
Position of believing

1588
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:52,832
People about their credentials

1589
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:56,416
Especially about military stuff cuz it's really serious

1590
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:58,464
To like impune someone

1591
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:00,256
Syrup

1592
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:01,024
Really just

1593
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:07,424
Respectful

1594
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:13,056
Screwy as something that doesn't make sense about this

1595
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:15,616
And I would I would like clarification for it

1596
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,896
Because I don't want to be

1597
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:18,432
Be forced to call someone service

1598
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:20,992
Listen to question

1599
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:27,392
I'm rapidly being pushed down that road to take care of this for you I am not going

1600
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:33,792
However I do not necessarily reflect

1601
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:39,168
I'll join you at the photoshoot

1602
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:41,472
This is crazy it's absolute

1603
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:44,544
So on this episode

1604
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,640
Alex been talking to Steve about it Korea report

1605
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:52,736
Which is an Oculus for the most part except for the

1606
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,272
Alex

1607
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:55,296
Talks

1608
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:57,344
Two two pastors Chuck Baldwin

1609
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:59,904
Strippers Pastor Chuck Baldwin

1610
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,696
And

1611
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:04,256
And for the most part

1612
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,280
It's just about

1613
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:06,816
Foreign

1614
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:09,632
Globalists are taking over the church

1615
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:12,704
Because their argument

1616
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:18,080
Churches are 501 c 3 and that's made them puppets of the state

1617
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:20,896
Shut your f****** taxes

1618
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:27,040
Organization

1619
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:27,808
Tax exempt

1620
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:31,392
If you don't want the requirements that exist with 501 c 3 entity

1621
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:32,160
Cool

1622
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,184
Pay your taxes

1623
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,720
Big do whatever you want

1624
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:37,536
I don't care I don't care about this

1625
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:38,816
Bye

1626
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:40,096
That's what a lot of

1627
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:42,912
And now they're tools

1628
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:46,496
I thought about it

1629
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:49,056
About this too though is this interview

1630
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:50,848
It's just about the globalist

1631
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:51,872
Take overall

1632
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:52,640
All the churches

1633
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:53,408
And all that s***

1634
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:54,944
In the same way

1635
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:55,968
Vet on

1636
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:56,992
The 3rd

1637
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:58,272
Alex was targeting

1638
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,040
These veterans

1639
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:01,600
With this extremist radicalizing rhetoric

1640
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:02,880
He's now doing that too

1641
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:03,648
The Christian

1642
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:04,416
Thor 2

1643
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,184
Hitting up his

1644
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:05,952
Version of cry

1645
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,744
He sent the globalist

1646
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,280
Are an existential threat to

1647
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,048
The church they're going to

1648
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:11,328
Takeout everybody's

1649
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,096
Got it

1650
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:12,864
It's it's

1651
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:13,632
Exactly

1652
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,168
Is isolate

1653
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:16,960
And using

1654
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,544
Whatever hardship they may be experiencing

1655
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:22,080
A prop

1656
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:23,616
And a pedestal upon which

1657
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:25,408
To promote his narrative

1658
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,432
Erratic

1659
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:28,224
8 intentions

1660
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,040
It's like he's doing those themed episodes of

1661
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:31,808
F****** Maury

1662
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:38,208
A week before his Christian who's been wronged by this

1663
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:40,256
Episode where we try and radicalize all of you

1664
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:46,144
Well it would be that is Maury's goal was to overthrow the government

1665
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:48,960
Alright

1666
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,264
Beyond that Alex

1667
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,104
Episode this is one of my

1668
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:06,624
Mother

1669
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:14,816
Barrel maker

1670
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:25,312
A lot of family on the Mayflower

1671
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,640
The strong theory that Alex is

1672
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:32,224
He's trying to tie his lineage back to the Mayflower because

1673
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:32,992
Who was the first

1674
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,528
Pilgrims that came over

1675
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:35,808
And because Alex

1676
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:36,576
Subscribed

1677
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:38,624
To this Christian identity

1678
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:40,160
The first pilgrims

1679
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:43,488
Is it came over we're really were amuli

1680
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:45,792
The Promised Land

1681
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:46,816
So he's

1682
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:49,120
Being the descendant of the like

1683
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:52,704
From the original

1684
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,496
It makes him the purest

1685
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:59,104
Like it's almost like he's a Chosen One

1686
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:04,480
I really believe that that's the rhetoric or the point behind the rhetoric

1687
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:05,248
I was like

1688
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,016
There's no

1689
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:07,552
When he started saying

1690
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:09,344
My dad's family has Iowa.

1691
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:10,880
Had both of his

1692
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:11,648
Parents on there

1693
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,440
Click the British Israel

1694
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:18,048
That clicked right there was like

1695
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:21,376
Genuinely think that you're one of the f****** 144,000

1696
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,704
Like that's what behind

1697
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:28,288
The Mayflower arrived in America on November 9th

1698
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,896
1820s

1699
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,200
Considering

1700
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:38,528
They're only about 130 people on board

1701
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:39,552
Yeah.

1702
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:42,368
Right it was a bit of a cat

1703
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:44,160
The odds are staggeringly

1704
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:50,304
True American royalty

1705
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,632
Confederate Rose

1706
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:54,912
Is blood

1707
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:56,192
Anna's country from day one

1708
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:59,264
Except for when it was out of this country for roughly 4 years

1709
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:02,080
Punitive

1710
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:06,432
Directions.

1711
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:11,040
Let's leave his mother's side of the family out of the equation.

1712
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:14,112
Zillow the difficult to sort out

1713
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:15,136
Complicated

1714
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:21,536
Denis just saying his mom side goes back to the barrel maker and famous lady

1715
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:23,072
I know who is talk about

1716
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,352
Descriptions I would say

1717
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:27,936
However on his dad side he says the line goes back to the camp

1718
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:28,960
And that's something I

1719
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:29,984
Definitely looking

1720
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:33,824
Alex is making the claim because the captain of the Mayflower his name

1721
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,104
Christopher Jones

1722
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:37,408
And honestly must be related

1723
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:39,968
Goddamn

1724
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:40,992
These people so much

1725
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,272
I hate silver

1726
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,552
It makes sense

1727
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:45,600
About it heroic Libra

1728
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:52,000
Pilgrim versus the world that made a home here where his ancestors became intertwined with the growth of this land from the very start

1729
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:56,352
And you're like well clearly I started China also

1730
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,888
Also there's a huge hole

1731
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:58,656
The story

1732
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:00,960
There's a lot of information about Christopher Jones

1733
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:05,824
This is that he was bringing the pilgrims to America because they paid him

1734
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:10,432
He had nothing to do with their Vision you could say you would people wear on

1735
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,224
And his family

1736
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,504
Including his children

1737
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,528
Didn't come along

1738
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:18,112
His wife Josie and Clark stayed behind in their home town of Harwich

1739
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:19,136
But

1740
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:22,464
After delivering delivering the pilgrims across the Atlantic Ocean

1741
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:25,536
Look out the rest of his life there

1742
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:26,560
Which was not long

1743
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:27,584
Is he died at 6

1744
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,352
T22

1745
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:35,008
He didn't stay in America and he's not one of the founding members of this country very unlikely that he's actually related to Alex

1746
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,360
I think it's just a thought which is amazingly

1747
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:44,736
Child

1748
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:45,760
Toddler f******

1749
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:46,784
Use the world

1750
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,600
Oh my God

1751
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:58,816
Are you related

1752
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:03,424
Larry home

1753
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,728
Larry Holmes Larry

1754
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,896
So rare

1755
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:16,736
Literally

1756
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:18,528
Maybe we could have a

1757
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:24,928
I do have a lot of

1758
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:27,744
Like distant weird relatives among like

1759
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:29,536
Communities

1760
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:31,840
Is there a reason is fairly common

1761
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:33,376
Reasonably common name

1762
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:37,728
Some weird distant relatives

1763
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,056
Found a few that work on

1764
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:42,848
But

1765
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,176
I don't believe that Alex is related to

1766
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:49,760
The people who were on the Mayflower because this is an area that people have studied

1767
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:55,904
The original North America is pretty well research

1768
01:35:56,160 --> 01:36:00,768
And none of the resources I can find indicate in any way that Alec says descendants among the pilgrims

1769
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:02,304
But you know who does

1770
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:05,376
Movies

1771
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:08,192
As well as

1772
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:14,336
How about noted Avril Lavigne

1773
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:20,736
The cheese Canadian or what do you think about

1774
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:36,608
Relatives

1775
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:42,496
What time is it okay that is but that's not what we want to say any

1776
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,056
Can't see me

1777
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:48,896
Is that for the list for The Listener at home

1778
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:52,992
Antenna Concord

1779
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:58,112
Sakura song

1780
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:02,464
He gave England the Five Knuckle Shuffle

1781
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:04,256
Stfd

1782
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:07,072
Documented relatives

1783
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:11,680
All I can say is that he's related to the bear

1784
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:15,008
It's weeks.

1785
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:16,544
Some politically biased list

1786
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,360
That would ignore don't conservatives have Pilgrim ancestry

1787
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:22,176
I know this because list also includes Sarah Palin

1788
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:26,528
Alex is no different than Sarah Palin in terms of public disgust

1789
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:33,696
The thing you have to consider is that the pilgrims were very much unprepared

1790
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:35,488
What they found when they arrive

1791
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,072
45 of the 180 passengers on that ship died in

1792
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:39,840
The first winter

1793
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:42,144
With 10 more dying within the first year

1794
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:42,912
From when they land

1795
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,472
On top of that eight of them returned to England

1796
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:52,896
All the people Alex is claiming his mother's side where John Alden was a barrel maker and Priscilla Mullins

1797
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:53,664
Should I get

1798
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:55,968
Daily shirt

1799
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,504
Reference to

1800
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:04,160
Decide to stay in North America as opposed to returning with Christopher Jones

1801
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:05,184
Right back

1802
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:09,024
He married Bowen

1803
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,048
Because Mullins

1804
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,072
Hire family died

1805
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,096
First winter

1806
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,704
They're gigantic databases of John Alden

1807
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,752
Descendants because spoiler alert

1808
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:20,544
That dude like to have kids

1809
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,592
Carol Jones

1810
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:25,152
Actually a number of Carol Jones

1811
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:26,944
Descendants of Alden

1812
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:27,712
Caroline

1813
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,504
Which is close enough

1814
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,808
Unfortunately all of them were born in the early

1815
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:36,672
So I doubt we are our ancestors

1816
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:39,488
I couldn't be her anyway

1817
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:40,512
Because

1818
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,280
Carol hammer

1819
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:46,400
The database of the Alden family tree

1820
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:47,424
Hammond

1821
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,448
Exist what

1822
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:50,496
It's nice

1823
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:52,288
Included as part of the genetic lineage

1824
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,568
Or the I guess

1825
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:54,848
Genetically

1826
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,896
You call that

1827
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:59,712
Play trelaney into whatever

1828
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:02,784
Hilarious

1829
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,832
Post

1830
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:05,856
Yahoo answers

1831
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:06,880
Quest

1832
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:13,536
I re-posted like a day after the episode that we're going

1833
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:19,168
Why does Alex Jones forget details about his family history on the Mayflower it's making this stuff up

1834
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:25,568
YouTube

1835
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:28,896
Very likely making this stuff up

1836
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:35,296
Because corporate gets to feel like he has a greater claim on being a true American

1837
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:38,880
Since being an opportunistic conman is all he really needs

1838
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:40,160
To make him as American as

1839
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:42,720
Apple pies

1840
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:44,768
People who on the Mayflower far-less pate

1841
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:45,792
Patriotic in America

1842
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,328
Gaming other America

1843
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,376
Number one

1844
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:53,472
I can't stress this

1845
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:55,264
Like people who have

1846
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:57,568
Families go back

1847
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:58,592
To the Mayflower

1848
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,128
Know about it

1849
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,408
They document

1850
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:06,272
Like it's it's it's a very common thing people have like certificates

1851
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:08,064
And like you're involved in

1852
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:14,208
An organization might even know a bunch of other

1853
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:15,488
It clubs

1854
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:16,768
April Alex

1855
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:18,816
Claimed that his family goes back

1856
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:19,840
Back to the Mayflower

1857
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:23,424
And him care so much about these sorts of ideas and you think

1858
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:25,728
Not know the name

1859
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:30,336
Of the people just the barrel maker in the famous lady unbelievable

1860
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:33,408
Absolutely if Alex was

1861
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:36,224
Truly related back to people who are the Mayflower

1862
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,248
He would know their name

1863
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:39,296
You know so much about them

1864
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:41,088
Not forget their name

1865
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:44,160
It doesn't make sense it's not true

1866
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:45,440
It look

1867
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:46,208
True

1868
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:48,000
And everybody is family like

1869
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:50,560
Important but they don't really get together about those made

1870
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:51,840
Flower people

1871
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:53,888
Royal

1872
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:55,680
I think some of that

1873
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:57,728
I think that's the thing I think that is

1874
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,776
Also the country

1875
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:00,800
I know that

1876
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:04,640
Pretty hilarious

1877
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:11,296
Really doesn't feel like a nose

1878
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:13,344
The pilgrims was a

1879
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:15,392
He didn't realize that you

1880
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:17,952
Tire Guy

1881
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,304
In the context of this interview with Baldwin

1882
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,328
And a great day

1883
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,400
Boring

1884
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:28,704
There's also meant to

1885
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:29,472
Jessica Rupp

1886
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:30,496
The religion

1887
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:35,104
It's kind of indicative

1888
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:36,384
Talking about

1889
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:37,664
They're trying to wipe out the

1890
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,392
On Earth

1891
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:54,560
Local church on Earth

1892
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:05,568
Christianity

1893
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,808
Exactly

1894
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:18,368
That is a parody of what I would

1895
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,904
Do if I were back

1896
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:20,672
Confido

1897
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,208
Weird

1898
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:24,000
I would just say that

1899
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:26,048
And be like it seems like

1900
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:31,424
Yeah it's coming back I just saw

1901
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,192
It sounds like

1902
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,104
The tenor of what they're talking about

1903
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:45,760
Do you win is bacon boobs now literally all churches

1904
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:49,856
Is being used to do

1905
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,328
Take over there

1906
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:12,384
What what's going on is day-by-day Lorazepam

1907
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:16,992
Turn on Alex's show in order to alienate

1908
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:18,272
And radicalized

1909
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,552
Segments of his audience

1910
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:23,136
Segment on one day about

1911
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:25,440
There's now that segment on this episode

1912
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,464
About the church

1913
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:28,000
And it's

1914
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:29,280
Upsetting

1915
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,328
You wouldn't do this

1916
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,352
Unless

1917
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:33,632
You were trying

1918
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:34,400
To do something

1919
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:35,936
That's almost it's almost like a

1920
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:38,496
Regular it sounds like a scheduled B

1921
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:46,688
That has been as overt

1922
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:49,760
Right scaling

1923
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:51,040
In this

1924
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:51,808
Beginning of

1925
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:53,088
Which is

1926
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:53,856
Very trouble

1927
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,160
So are we get to the seven

1928
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:57,440
And I keep this clip-ins

1929
01:43:57,952 --> 01:44:00,512
Because I always talk about how bad his job

1930
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:03,072
And there's no greater indication

1931
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:04,864
Then how you figure

1932
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:05,888
On the 7th

1933
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:12,800

This is on the show this is like some hidden camera video this is him on the show say

1937
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:30,976
What do

1938
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:38,912

Subscription to Reuters what the f*** are you doing

1940
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:46,848
Please God

It shows what are you researching

1942
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:51,712
You're just reading support

1943
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:54,528
Whatever you talk about this with hard work

1944
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:57,344
But you do in like I spend hours

1945
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:01,696
Google the couple play WorldNetDaily holiday sayings

1946

See what's up

1947
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,536
The 7th Alex Spencer

1948
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,304
Most

1949
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,328
Of this show

1950
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:09,120
Talking about Melissa harris-perry

1951
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:12,448
Because that video has just been

1952
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:15,520
If you'll recall it was a woman on MSNBC

1953
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:20,128
You see who she talked about how

1954
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:22,944
For a long time we've looked at kids as being just

1955
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,480
The responsibility of their parents

1956
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:29,088
So we need to take a more communal approach and not look at it as children belonging to their parents

1957
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:32,672
Everybody

1958
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:34,208
Sat with thought about

1959
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:34,976
Realized

1960
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:39,328
Fairly reasonable holyshit

1961
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:43,936
How we normally view the family but

1962
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:44,704
We live in an in

1963
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:46,496
Society

1964
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,176
Cotuit

1965
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:02,112
Charcoal

1966
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:06,464
Cam

1967
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:10,816
Hey sassy on that red link

1968
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:11,840
From a Drudge

1969
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:18,752
We talked about this narrative before when Alex has brought it up when he encountered it

1970
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:22,592
Commercial said the children don't just block their parents they belong to

1971
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:28,480
It's really obvious from surrounding context that she met the word belong in relation to the community and its definition that means

1972
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:29,504
Being a part of

1973
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:34,880
But that didn't stop literally all of the right-wing media from freaking out and screaming about creeping communism

1974
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:40,512
Sarah Palin Rush Limbaugh Glenn Beck all made sport out of yelling about this s*** now it says no difference

1975
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,048
He spends almost

1976
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:47,424
I would say most of this episode talk about this clip and have proved exactly what he said about the globalist

1977
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:52,288
Harris-perry responded to the backlash in a blog saying quote

1978
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,104
Those of you who are alarmed by this ad can relax

1979
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,152
I have no designs on taking your children

1980
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:58,176
Please keep your kid

1981
01:46:58,688 --> 01:47:01,248
Everyone

1982
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:06,880
I should know full well that my messages my dad was a call to see ourselves as connected to a larger hole

1983
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:09,696
I don't want your kids but I want them to live in safe neighbor

1984
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:12,512
I want them to learn Dynamic class

1985
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:15,584
I want them to be healthy and well and Free From Fear

1986
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:19,680
What you meant was totally clear that added self

1987
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:21,216
Clarify that further

1988
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:22,240
Matter

1989
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:24,032
This means nothing

1990
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:25,824
But there's another funny

1991
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,872
Thomas episode Alex

1992
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:29,408
Keep going on and on

1993
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:31,200
About how

1994
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:32,480
Nazis and Soviets

1995
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:33,504
Want your kids

1996
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,784
And this is proof of that

1997
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:39,648
What bring the kids

1998
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:47,840
It's weird McDonald's

1999
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:50,144
I don't think

2000
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,168
That Alex

2001
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,448
Is is

2002
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,216
Arguing

2003
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:53,984
A lot of it

2004
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:55,520
My good faith

2005
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:56,544
Thinking through

2006
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:58,592
This guy

2007
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:04,992
Is just throwing doesn't really care I don't know

2008
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:06,784
Kids throwing shade at the walk

2009
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,344
Oh no I mean like

2010
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:12,672
Whatever it is

2011
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:14,464
Just like

2012
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:17,280
Bright

2013
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:18,816
Yeah yeah

2014
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:21,888
System

2015
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:24,448
There's

2016
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:25,216
Felix

2017
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:28,800
Tough time getting away from

2018
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:30,848
Attention

2019
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:34,176
Always there which is

2020
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:34,944
Is that

2021
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:38,528
A complete and utter opposites

2022
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:40,320
A willingness

2023
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:42,112
Opposition

2024
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:43,392
Willingness to

2025
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:45,184
Twist and distort anything

2026
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:46,464
Into something that might

2027
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,232
Fit Within

2028
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:50,560
Save it

2029
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:53,120
What he's saying

2030
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:54,656
But there is apps

2031
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:55,680
Absolutely

2032
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:57,984
It's all built

2033
01:48:59,264 --> 01:48:59,776
In the beginning

2034
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:02,080
You know he wouldn't even have the opportunity to

2035
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:03,104
Something that stupid

2036
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:09,504
Melissa harris-perry

2037
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,296
For most of the show but thanks

2038
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:12,832
Another segment

2039
01:49:13,344 --> 01:49:13,856
Show

2040
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:18,720
North Korea

2041
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:30,240
Psych Warfare specialist

2042
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:36,640
Another

2043
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:39,968
F****** North Korea

2044
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:41,760
Really into

2045
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:43,296
Extenuating himself into the show

2046
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:45,600
You coming on very regularly

2047
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:48,672
Is a Xanax

2048
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:52,256
Alex is presented with all of these huge credentials

2049
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:56,096
And he's going to South Korea because he helped us blush the

2050
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:57,888
Be there

2051
01:49:58,144 --> 01:50:02,752
Deeply credible it's going there and he's telling Alex

2052
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:07,872
Consistently I went so I could give only you the real truth

2053
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:09,920
When you present him like that

2054
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:12,736
It's really hard to not believe everything

2055
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:16,320
So

2056
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:17,344
Is actors

2057
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,624
Which he already has

2058
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:20,416
It really is tough

2059
01:50:20,928 --> 01:50:22,464
To disconnect that

2060
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,512
From The credibility that you're giving him

2061
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:26,048
By having him on concert

2062
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:27,584
Play to talk about North Korea

2063
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:29,632
It's it's it's

2064
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:31,424
It's a setup for real

2065
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:32,192
Trouble

2066
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:35,008
It is kind of interesting out of all of this

2067
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:37,056
I haven't heard anything about Alex

2068
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:37,824
Blaming

2069
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:39,872
Nothing

2070
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:44,480
Williams like Wolfgang halbig

2071
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:48,064
But not go through

2072
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:51,392
There's no other way to look at it other than a man

2073
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,208
F****** with Alec

2074
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:58,048
If you don't see or not whether it's

2075
01:50:58,304 --> 01:50:59,584
Like

2076
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,352
Or not

2077
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:01,888
He is f****** with Alex

2078
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:07,520
He's not in Korea but by saying the reason Korea

2079
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:13,920
I will believe literally anything you say you went to South Korea and

2080
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:20,320
Tell me on your own time to be a field reporter for me

2081
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:21,856
I didn't even do anything

2082
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:27,744
If he didn't go you have to look at this as an intentional effort

2083
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,584
In order to make himself a fixture on a Leticia

2084
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:34,656
100% this is a Hail Mary

2085
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:38,240
It's crazy if he did go

2086
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:39,776
It's even crazier

2087
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:42,336
I don't I don't know what's going on

2088
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:45,920
Just was like I can kill two

2089
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:47,200
Two birds with one stone

2090
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:54,368
Steve's going to be coming up

2091
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:56,416
Complaining about the Melissa harris-perry

2092
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:57,440
Clip

2093
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:04,608
Department of Education

2094
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:05,888
North Korea

2095
01:52:08,192 --> 01:52:11,264
Quote

2096
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,032
Thomas

2097
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:13,056
Temperature

2098
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:14,080
Fight back

2099
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:20,480
So it's the same Thomas Jefferson quote I know we already discussed that misuse quote earlier but

2100
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:23,552
But I have to bring it up again because it's f****** hilarious to me

2101
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,160
It's about the need for education

2102
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:31,232
And here Alex is engaged targeted

2103
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:36,096
To campaign against someone who's just trying to encourage greater communal responsibility for the education of children

2104
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:39,168
If he knew what he was doing I would say this must be satire

2105
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:40,704
But as it is

2106
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:43,776
Who's memorized a couple quotes and pics

2107
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:50,432
Like he's using a quote about the importance of Education

2108
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:51,456
Great

2109
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:53,760
Eddie's using it in such a way as to

2110
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:54,784
Change it

2111
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:55,552
Original me

2112
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:56,832
Not

2113
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:58,624
We should all educate ourselves

2114
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:07,584
Serenade

2115
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:08,864
Do the Department of Education

2116
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:15,264
She's a political science professor

2117
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:17,056
In that cuz it's

2118
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,336
Be officially Obama's attack

2119
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:21,664
Tampa take over the school

2120
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:26,528
Wants her in the media to get you

2121
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,832
Used to the idea

2122
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:29,856
That's a really she

2123
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:32,160
Official anyway

2124
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:34,208
Unofficial

2125
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:40,096
Does Steve and Steve tells him about what's going on in North Korea

2126
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:44,192
Not Sensational analysis

2127
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:48,032
He gets down to talking about the situation it's very much

2128
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:49,312
Like okay

2129
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:53,152
I don't know if I agree with him that North Korea is completely controlled by China

2130
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:59,552
Prescriptive is all just about like we need

2131
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:00,320
Need to calm down

2132
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:04,160
Yeah yeah yeah

2133
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:05,952
Now you also said something

2134
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:06,976
That is

2135
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:08,768
Absolute ball

2136
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:23,616
What

2137
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:25,920
Steve created

2138
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:29,248
Delta Force

2139
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:34,368
911 are you

2140
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:41,024
Admission 1970

2141
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,072
He started Delta

2142
01:54:43,328 --> 01:54:48,192
Just kicked off in November so he might have created Delta Force before the hostages were taken

2143
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:53,056
Definitely call in for that

2144
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:53,824
Search crisis

2145
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:55,104
Something is doesn't make sense

2146
01:54:56,896 --> 01:55:00,736
Knows that he can make up whatever he wants about Delta Force because be superseded

2147
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:01,504
Secret unit

2148
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:02,784
It's really easy to lie about

2149
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:04,320
Unfortunately for

2150
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:05,600
The Army released

2151
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:06,368
Bunch of documents

2152
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:07,904
For the first time

2153
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,440
Delta Force was created

2154
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:10,208
And it does not my

2155
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,232
Story

2156
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:13,792
The initial plans were formulated after the bombing at

2157
01:55:14,048 --> 01:55:15,072
The Munich Olympics in 19

2158
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:15,840
72

2159
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:19,680
There were already at least 150

2160
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:20,704
Delta Force

2161
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:23,008
So the timeline of him creating it 1979

2162
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:23,776
Absolutely

2163
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:26,848
Jump force was officially created in 90

2164
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:29,408
1077 by army colonel Charles Beckwith

2165
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,712
And Steve's name is literally nowhere to be found

2166
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:32,480
Did any of the information

2167
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:34,016
I mean this

2168
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:35,808
Sincerely if this isn't true

2169
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:37,344
This claim is an outrageous

2170
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:38,368
Spectrolite

2171
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:43,232
I'm not going to go about troops or any of that stuff

2172
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:45,024
But

2173
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:46,816
I don't believe

2174
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:51,168
Particularly about founding Delta Force

2175
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:53,984
This is the only only associate

2176
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:56,288
This is outrageous

2177
01:55:58,848 --> 01:56:01,152
I'm starting to come to a conclusion that

2178
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:02,688
Might be

2179
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:04,736
Severely matted

2180
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:12,672
Like

2181
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:17,280
After we did that episode on the show and I'm maybe I'm

2182
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:20,096
Ridiculous and everybody else saw this

2183
01:56:20,352 --> 01:56:21,120
Little Easter eggs

2184
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:27,008
You is stupid

2185
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:28,032
As a crank

2186
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:30,592
Right

2187
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:36,480
Manipulative can I say that I still agree with those three catheterization

2188
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:39,552
But then after we did the

2189
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:41,600
Claims on his bio I'm like

2190
01:56:42,112 --> 01:56:43,904
Okay I might be out for

2191
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:50,304
Fun to like this might just I'm also

2192
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:54,144
You at this

2193
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,192
When he doesn't

2194
01:56:56,704 --> 01:56:59,520
He doesn't need to call Alex he has no obligation

2195
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:02,336
Even if

2196
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:07,712
Stay

2197
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:11,040
Really feels like device out of his mind

2198
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:13,856
A part of it just because I'm very too

2199
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:17,440
Detached from all this and I'm looking at it

2200
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:18,720
The past

2201
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:21,536
Like there is a part of it that I kind of appreciate

2202
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:23,072
Even if he's that crazy

2203
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:24,096
Because it is

2204
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:26,912
So weird it's so outside the norm

2205
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:28,448
That look at it

2206
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:34,336
Cindy created Delta Force

2207
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:36,640
Democratized South Korea

2208
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:44,064
Interesting why are you doing

2209
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:49,184
The guys who suddenly have this like

2210
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:50,720
Weird

2211
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:52,256
Forrest Gump

2212
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:56,096
Lifestyle

2213
01:57:56,352 --> 01:58:00,192
Forrest Gump guy

2214
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:04,800
Include

2215
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:06,336
Like

2216
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:08,640
Forrest Gump and then just throw a little bit

2217
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:10,944
Over and over and over again until you have a

2218
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:12,736
I'm long Forrest Gump

2219
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:15,808
Steve is Freddy has

2220
01:58:16,064 --> 01:58:18,112
Shooting framing about why he went to

2221
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:26,048
Which again dr. I believe but this framing

2222
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:34,240
Interview with you which was so grateful that down Sandy Hook where I told you was the phones black I knew

2223
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:38,848
That Obama and his white house quireboys but start another false flag

2224
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:39,872
In Korea

2225
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:40,896
I could see it

2226
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:44,480
The next day without anybody's permission

2227
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:52,928
Came here and I wanted to report directly to you and Jean and other parts in North Korea

2228
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:55,488
.

2229
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:02,144
Oee nude blown the case wide open with telling Alex B

2230
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:07,264
Did Obama was going to hear his appearance on Alex's show

2231
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:09,824
And he's going to have to shift gears and start a false wagon

2232
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,104
North Korea

2233
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,408
So he went over there to get to the bottom of that at

2234
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:15,712
Crazy

2235
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:16,736
Deeply

2236
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:17,760
Conspiratorial think

2237
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:21,600
Type of thinking that has people

2238
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:26,208
And I told to have a seat

2239
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:35,680
So that's good

2240
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:36,960
Of course

2241
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:38,496
Not

2242
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:43,616
Text the different approach you and I

2243
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:48,224

Individual

2249
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:28,928
My friend

2250
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:37,632
Relation to earlier the episode Alex got about someone

2251
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:39,680
Bring up Plato's allegory of the

2252
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:43,264
The cave because also in the Republic Plato and courage

2253
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,288
Philosopher-king

02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:54,016
Support everything

2257
02:00:58,112 --> 02:01:02,464
Even bring that up to flatter Alex

2258
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:04,000
That was that was later.

2259
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:05,536
This point

2260
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:06,816
Like if you understand it

2261
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:09,120
In the preparation for this episode I listen to

2262
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:10,912
Thursday's last Friday's up

2263
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:11,936
So that's it

2264
02:01:12,448 --> 02:01:13,216
6 something hours

2265
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:15,264
Gone through the

2266
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,032
Third

2267
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:17,056
Fourth fifth

2268
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:18,080
+ 7

2269
02:01:18,336 --> 02:01:19,360
Is a Sunday

2270
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:21,152
That's four more episode

2271
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:25,504
This is the episode he said Steve on a couple time

2272
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:31,904
Signing off and saying I have you want tomorrow you got to find out how

2273
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:37,280
You're not going to know what Revenge of the Sith

2274
02:01:37,536 --> 02:01:38,048
The prequels

2275
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:39,584
Revenge of the Sith

2276
02:01:40,608 --> 02:01:41,376
Resistant

2277
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:43,168
Cuz

2278
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:57,504
Air Force 1

2279
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,368
Kirsch

2280
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:17,984
So

2281
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:24,640
What's really particularly jarring about that is that when he sang the people look and act like actors

2282
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:27,200
They specifically talking about Robbie Parker

2283
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:30,272
The news conference that he gave

2284
02:02:30,528 --> 02:02:31,040
Where

2285
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:32,064
He appeared

2286
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:34,112
2 Chainz tune at home

2287
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:40,000
This is the exact same

2288
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:41,536
Something that the caller

2289
02:02:41,792 --> 02:02:42,560
A couple months back

2290
02:02:42,816 --> 02:02:45,632
Ask Alex about

2291
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:49,216
I took this sort of thing about someone who lost their child

2292
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:51,776
This is a 180° split

2293
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:52,800
He is now making

2294
02:02:53,056 --> 02:02:53,824
Fun of this guy

2295
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:55,616
And using it to suggest

2296
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:57,664
Fifties people look and act like act

2297
02:02:58,432 --> 02:03:00,992
You still creating it in the form of a disjunction

2298
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:01,760
Where he says

2299
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:07,904
Either exploited or associate with all these people

2300
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:08,672
Act like actors

2301
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,464
That is a massive

2302
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:13,024
It doesn't

2303
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:13,792
Scream

2304
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:15,584
Like a

2305
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:19,168
Elf on the show

2306
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:23,776
And Alex is presented as an expert he's going to South Korea to report for Alex

2307
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:27,872
If you take that seriously you have to take the other things you bring to

2308
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:28,640
To the table series

2309
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:31,712
Is it Noah

2310
02:03:32,224 --> 02:03:33,760
I think that this is

2311
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:35,808
This music by product of

2312
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:37,600
Giving Steve credibility

2313
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:39,392
It's insane

2314
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:43,232
Telling you

2315
02:03:43,744 --> 02:03:45,792
How credible Steve is that you being like

2316
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:48,096
Well obviously Steve told me he's credibility

2317
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:52,192
He does mention that they're like talking

2318
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:56,288
It's very likely that Steve

2319
02:03:57,056 --> 02:03:57,568
Add stop

2320
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:02,176
You know we talked a lot about other things that were

2321
02:04:02,432 --> 02:04:03,200
That would factor into

2322
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:04,224
Switch

2323
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,832
The fact that Obama talked to them

2324
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:09,600
Specifically

2325
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:13,440
Would have course be one of those

2326
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,048
Alex is like clicks and there's no way the present

2327
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:19,584
Talk to her real father

2328
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:22,656
Does he know that it's a false flag so he would have had to

2329
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:23,424
Kill the guys

2330
02:04:27,776 --> 02:04:28,800
Is it there are no Vic

2331
02:04:29,824 --> 02:04:30,592
Zachary

2332
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:33,920
Sure

2333
02:04:36,736 --> 02:04:39,296
He always presents himself as being against

2334
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:42,880
The actor idea he has for good B

2335
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:43,648
Resistance

2336
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:48,512
Crazy about

2337
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:50,560
This next clip

2338
02:04:51,328 --> 02:04:52,096
Eerily

2339
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:53,632
Is in contradiction

2340
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:27,424
Between saying we all need to get into this and saying the Public's not ready for it

2341
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:31,776
Publix not ready for it isn't indicative of you believe this

2342
02:05:32,032 --> 02:05:33,824
But you don't think you can get away with it

2343
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:42,272
Adan Salazar came up with his report calling

2344
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:46,880
Let's run it by legal and then legal said I don't know

2345
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:50,976
Everyone calling the Sandy Hook people actors

2346
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:52,256
You got Steve

2347
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:54,304
You got all that you got

2348
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:55,840
You got James

2349
02:05:56,096 --> 02:05:58,656
Yeah Wolfgang halbig still hasn't appeared at all

2350
02:05:58,912 --> 02:06:02,496
If any of this I don't know I don't know what what's going on there

2351
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:07,360
But you have this this rising acceptability of this rhetoric

2352
02:06:07,616 --> 02:06:09,408
The public

2353
02:06:10,432 --> 02:06:13,760
Also now is probably the time I could just reveal this cuz I don't really give a f***

2354
02:06:14,016 --> 02:06:19,136
Everybody always asks whether or not Alex is aware of our

2355
02:06:19,392 --> 02:06:21,184
And for the longest time I said I don't know

2356
02:06:21,952 --> 02:06:22,976
I do know that he is aware of

2357
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:24,512
Because

2358
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:30,912
That guy who created report on the actors

2359
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:34,752
His longtime producer follows me on Twitter

2360
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:36,800
I don't know why you do that

2361
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:43,200
I told him about this hot new show and Heat

2362
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:45,248
When they tweeted out there

2363
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:52,160
Right so

2364
02:06:53,952 --> 02:06:56,256
Good job

2365
02:06:56,512 --> 02:07:02,656
Coming up with theories about the Aurora victims being actor

2366
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:04,192
In the lawsuit

2367
02:07:04,448 --> 02:07:08,032
Yeah that is house

2368
02:07:08,544 --> 02:07:10,080
Subway

2369
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:16,992
It's too late for him I think the Aurora victims

2370
02:07:17,248 --> 02:07:17,760
I'm sorry I act

2371
02:07:39,008 --> 02:07:39,776
So there we go

2372
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:41,824
It's a hop skip and a jump

2373
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:45,408
From here if you're saying this about people who survived the Aurora shooting

2374
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:48,992
Makes literally no difference for you to bridge the gap

2375
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:51,040
To Sandy Hook

2376
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:55,904
It doesn't ease. He's there he's arrived at least by the beginning of April

2377
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:56,928
It's before

2378
02:07:57,184 --> 02:07:58,976
We didn't even get all the way to the bombing

2379
02:07:59,744 --> 02:08:01,024
It's about a week before the bombing

2380
02:08:03,072 --> 02:08:04,096
Accelerating his

2381
02:08:04,352 --> 02:08:04,864
Rhetoric

2382
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:05,888
In terms of

2383
02:08:06,144 --> 02:08:11,776
The existential threat that the globalist he's encouraging people to harass

2384
02:08:12,288 --> 02:08:13,056
The globalist

2385
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:14,592
At the same time

2386
02:08:14,848 --> 02:08:15,616
Scaling who

2387
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:17,664
Rhetoric around these false flag

2388
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:20,736
2 now incorporates so much talk of them being actors

2389
02:08:21,248 --> 02:08:24,832
If you combine all that stuff together he's whipping his audience into a frenzy

2390
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:26,112
He's advising people

2391
02:08:26,368 --> 02:08:29,696
Go and document.

2392
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:36,864
Including grieving families as members of the people who are involved with the globalist plot

2393
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:39,680
If you include all three

2394
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:44,800
Very definitely happened around the same time you have everything he's being sued for

2395
02:08:45,056 --> 02:08:46,080
Absolutely correct

2396
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:47,104
He is doing

2397
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:48,896
He is

2398
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:50,432
Absolutely do it.

2399
02:08:50,688 --> 02:08:51,968
The defense

2400
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:55,552
Of like other people were saying the stuff online is absolutely true

2401
02:08:56,064 --> 02:08:56,576
It is

2402
02:08:57,088 --> 02:08:58,112
But I don't think it's a

2403
02:08:58,368 --> 02:08:59,392
Exculpatory because

2404
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:02,720
The level of credibility he gave these arguments

2405
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:05,280
By his own show

2406
02:09:05,792 --> 02:09:08,608
Lake at the prevalence of the high-profile of his own show

2407
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:10,400
And by associating them with Steve

2408
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:12,192
And elevating

2409
02:09:12,448 --> 02:09:13,984
Steve and his theories

2410
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:15,008
With his show

2411
02:09:15,264 --> 02:09:17,568
I don't think anybody in the world

2412
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:18,848
Would have been in a position

2413
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:19,616
To do what he did

2414
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:21,920
It's not

2415
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:24,736
I don't know if that makes it any more

2416
02:09:24,992 --> 02:09:26,016
Likely

2417
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:29,344
He'll be found guilty I don't know if that makes what

2418
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:30,112
He did

2419
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:32,160
Somehow legally worse

2420
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:33,952
But I can't think of any

2421
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:36,512
Person who could have done the damage

2422
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:37,536
He is doing

2423
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:40,096
He was in a unique position

2424
02:09:40,352 --> 02:09:40,864
And he did

2425
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:41,888
Exactly the wrong

2426
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:42,912
Yeah

2427
02:09:43,424 --> 02:09:44,448
I'm seeing that

2428
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:45,984
It's abundantly clear.

2429
02:09:55,968 --> 02:09:57,504
I guess the I guess the issue

2430
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:58,272
Is

2431
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:00,064
Going to

2432
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:01,600
Turn out to be that

2433
02:10:02,624 --> 02:10:03,648
We have proven

2434
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:04,672
Everything

2435
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:06,720
To be proven

2436
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:08,768
In terms of

2437
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:10,048
This is a wrong

2438
02:10:10,816 --> 02:10:12,864
Bad and awful thing that led to

2439
02:10:14,912 --> 02:10:16,704
I don't know if that means

2440
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:23,360
It's one of those things where the biggest issue that we run into

2441
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:25,920
There's absolutely

2442
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:26,688
No way

2443
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:27,968
You can come away

2444
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:31,296
With the information that we have laid out and think

2445
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:33,344
With doing great

2446
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:36,160
McDowell

2447
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:36,928
A f****** dick

2448
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:38,208
He's doing this and he's using

2449
02:10:38,976 --> 02:10:39,488
He's destroying every

2450
02:10:40,256 --> 02:10:42,816
And

2451
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:44,352
The law

2452
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:48,960
Well

2453
02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:50,240
Two points that are really interests

2454
02:10:50,496 --> 02:10:52,288
Alex's defense

2455
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:56,640
I barely talked about Sandy Hook after it happened

2456
02:10:56,896 --> 02:10:57,920
It's kind of true

2457
02:11:00,736 --> 02:11:02,016
True

2458
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:04,576
He tells himself to let himself off the hook

2459
02:11:05,856 --> 02:11:09,952
Is like I can see why he's bought his own bulshit

2460
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:12,256
Evans

2461
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:16,096
He could probably fall back behind some

2462
02:11:16,864 --> 02:11:17,632
Version of this

2463
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:19,168
You could tell himself

2464
02:11:19,424 --> 02:11:21,984
I wasn't aware of the consequences

2465
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:23,008
Is it my accent

2466
02:11:24,032 --> 02:11:25,568
I think a little bit later in this episode we will

2467
02:11:25,824 --> 02:11:27,104
Clear evidence that can

2468
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:32,480
Episode

2469
02:11:36,832 --> 02:11:42,720
I'm just going to get a check

2470
02:11:42,976 --> 02:11:43,488
Big World News

2471
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:50,144
So what's going on is this is

2472
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:51,168
Play pimps

2473
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:52,448
Steve's coming up

2474
02:11:54,752 --> 02:11:55,264
This is what I look

2475
02:11:58,848 --> 02:12:00,384
Criminal activity there are

2476
02:12:01,152 --> 02:12:03,456
Thousands of private intelligence

2477
02:12:06,528 --> 02:12:07,296
To everything

2478
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:20,352
A battery

2479
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:22,400
Mercenary Bridge

2480
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,368
You know it's hilarious

2481
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:44,160
He's waiting to talk to Steve

2482
02:12:44,416 --> 02:12:46,720
Someone who's been advocating for eggs

2483
02:12:46,976 --> 02:12:49,536
Exactly

2484
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:52,352
Putting out papers and journal

2485
02:12:52,608 --> 02:12:53,632
About the knee

2486
02:12:53,888 --> 02:12:55,936
For private intelligence companies to take over

2487
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:56,704
For the government

2488
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:57,728
He's been

2489
02:12:57,984 --> 02:12:59,520
A customer of Stratford

2490
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:00,544
3 years

2491
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:06,944
Email you'll be the ones who will take care of all this so we could get rid of

2492
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:08,480
All the government agencies

2493
02:13:08,736 --> 02:13:09,248
Alex

2494
02:13:09,504 --> 02:13:14,112
Doesn't have no idea that he was on the phone with someone who advocates for

2495
02:13:14,368 --> 02:13:15,648
Stands for in Provo

2496
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:17,184
The very thing

2497
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:20,000
Sitting here complaining about

2498
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:22,304
That's hilarious

2499
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:23,584
That is

2500
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:24,608
Man there's a

2501
02:13:24,864 --> 02:13:25,376
This word

2502
02:13:31,776 --> 02:13:34,848
Touches on a couple issues here and there

2503
02:13:36,128 --> 02:13:37,664
Define what the globalist

2504
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:38,688
Zorgo

2505
02:13:39,712 --> 02:13:42,528
Running wild

2506
02:13:46,624 --> 02:13:52,768
Destroying normal

2507
02:14:08,384 --> 02:14:08,896
Complete

2508
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:10,688
Stud

2509
02:14:11,456 --> 02:14:12,480
Weirdos

2510
02:14:13,248 --> 02:14:16,832
Globalist want to destroy

2511
02:14:17,088 --> 02:14:18,368
What you have to do is

2512
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:19,648
Consider Alex

2513
02:14:19,904 --> 02:14:21,184
Define normalcy

2514
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:24,512
That's an important piece of the equation

2515
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:27,072
I think we've got a pretty good job over the course of the

2516
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:27,840
The show

2517
02:14:28,352 --> 02:14:29,120
Define ingin

2518
02:14:29,632 --> 02:14:35,776
Chicken okay

2519
02:14:36,032 --> 02:14:41,152
Let's just pull back like let's just do like you know those composite sketches where they have

2520
02:14:41,408 --> 02:14:42,176
Inputted

2521
02:14:42,432 --> 02:14:42,944
10 million

2522
02:14:44,992 --> 02:14:45,504
Exactly

2523
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:46,272
Mathematic

2524
02:14:47,552 --> 02:14:48,064
Average

2525
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:49,344
If you could

2526
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:51,904
Like in your head

2527
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:53,440
But he thinks that a normal

2528
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:58,816
What characteristic

2529
02:14:59,072 --> 02:15:00,864
Steven Terry looks a lot like Alex

2530
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:03,936
Maybe when he was younger

2531
02:15:07,776 --> 02:15:12,128
Alex

2532
02:15:12,384 --> 02:15:14,176
Suggesting that him and all of his right

2533
02:15:14,432 --> 02:15:15,200
Doing dumb Dumb Friends

2534
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:16,992
Repeating things from chain email

2535
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:19,552
When they really are just

2536
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:20,320
Spirit Amy

2537
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:22,624
And then

2538
02:15:23,392 --> 02:15:23,904
The narrative

2539
02:15:24,928 --> 02:15:25,440
Here we go

2540
02:15:56,416 --> 02:15:58,720
He says he just told us

2541
02:16:04,096 --> 02:16:06,912
Oh no

2542
02:16:07,168 --> 02:16:09,728
South Korea

2543
02:16:14,848 --> 02:16:20,992
Listen and fellow retirees

2544
02:16:21,504 --> 02:16:27,648
So I got to go out of the country

2545
02:16:28,672 --> 02:16:30,464
FX Clippers just Steve like

2546
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:32,000
Going

2547
02:16:32,256 --> 02:16:35,840
The fence is flattering out

2548
02:16:42,752 --> 02:16:48,128
Or more

2549
02:16:48,384 --> 02:16:52,480
I'm being facetious here for more historically reference

2550
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:58,880
Play don t reference that I was taking it back and I had to go read some

2551
02:16:59,136 --> 02:17:01,184
What you were saying

2552
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:07,584
Holder of multiple

2553
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:13,984
Big reuse International hostage negotiator extraordinaire

2554
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:18,080
Is never read Plato or Nietzsche

2555
02:17:19,104 --> 02:17:20,640
Level level

2556
02:17:20,896 --> 02:17:22,176
Look I don't even want to release

2557
02:17:22,688 --> 02:17:23,456
These shows anymore

2558
02:17:23,968 --> 02:17:27,808
Because if people just acted as likes

2559
02:17:28,064 --> 02:17:29,088
They could rule the world

2560
02:17:29,344 --> 02:17:34,720
Every one of our listeners little tricks

2561
02:17:34,976 --> 02:17:36,512
The CEO of a company or perhaps

2562
02:17:38,048 --> 02:17:38,560
Information

2563
02:17:38,816 --> 02:17:41,888
Requires the recipient of

2564
02:17:42,144 --> 02:17:42,656
Kind of

2565
02:17:42,912 --> 02:17:45,984
Vaguely narcissistic and

2566
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:47,776
Probably not

2567
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:50,848
Plate

2568
02:17:52,384 --> 02:17:58,528
Blue Lotus South Korea

2569
02:17:58,784 --> 02:18:02,880
List of complaints about that though they might be racist

2570
02:18:03,648 --> 02:18:09,792
I go to TSA I got to go twice

2571
02:18:19,008 --> 02:18:20,032
That's

2572
02:18:20,288 --> 02:18:21,056
Not a good look

2573
02:18:23,616 --> 02:18:27,968
Your problem

2574
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:29,760
Smart enough for you

2575
02:18:30,016 --> 02:18:31,808
It seems to be as main issue

2576
02:18:36,416 --> 02:18:37,440
That's not good

2577
02:18:39,744 --> 02:18:41,536
You can just steal the old man racist

2578
02:18:43,072 --> 02:18:47,168
Cuz we had a president we were all like

2579
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:48,448
Anyways

2580
02:18:48,704 --> 02:18:49,472
Minorities

2581
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:52,544
Old man house phone

2582
02:18:53,056 --> 02:18:59,200
Over the course of the time that we've been looking at Steve pieczenik these last couple weeks as he's shown up on aisle

2583
02:18:59,456 --> 02:19:00,992
Alexa show more frequently

2584
02:19:01,504 --> 02:19:03,040
Become clearly

2585
02:19:04,832 --> 02:19:06,624
Drift towards what will ultimately

2586
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:07,648
Destroy his life

2587
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:13,536
Is like I created Delta

2588
02:19:14,304 --> 02:19:15,328
For example right side

2589
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:16,864
I don't know about that

2590
02:19:17,376 --> 02:19:21,728
I was 0632 right

2591
02:19:21,984 --> 02:19:23,776
Stop and cause

2592
02:19:24,032 --> 02:19:24,544
911

2593
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:26,592
Those are instances of

2594
02:19:26,848 --> 02:19:28,640
Like this guy being

2595
02:19:28,896 --> 02:19:30,176
I think you're full of s***

2596
02:19:30,688 --> 02:19:31,712
But I wouldn't call them

2597
02:19:31,968 --> 02:19:32,480
Fuk up

2598
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:36,064
Yeah because I bet there's some way he could talk his way around

2599
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:40,928
Bring up these problems to this timeline and like

2600
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:43,488
Create Bells

2601
02:19:43,744 --> 02:19:49,888
But I was around

2602
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:51,424
His way out of that

2603
02:19:51,936 --> 02:19:52,960
This next clip

2604
02:19:53,728 --> 02:19:54,240
Keith f*****-up

2605
02:19:54,496 --> 02:19:55,008
Okay

2606
02:20:17,024 --> 02:20:17,792
Hahaha

2607
02:20:19,584 --> 02:20:21,120
Steve really f***** up

2608
02:20:21,376 --> 02:20:24,960
Are you single

2609
02:20:28,544 --> 02:20:30,080
He really really f***** up

2610
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:32,896
Everyone who's ever been on the floor.

2611
02:20:33,664 --> 02:20:39,808
It's literally impossible friendship out the board that gave Bill Clinton the Fulbright scholarship mostly because Bill Clinton ever

2612
02:20:40,064 --> 02:20:41,344
Got a Fulbright scholarship

2613
02:20:41,856 --> 02:20:43,136
He was a Rhodes Scholar

2614
02:20:43,392 --> 02:20:44,672
But you also worked as a

2615
02:20:44,928 --> 02:20:48,000
The clerk for Senator J William Fulbright while he was in college

2616
02:20:48,256 --> 02:20:49,280
And I think that's what he's

2617
02:20:52,352 --> 02:20:54,656
Before 1967 the Bill Clinton was a clerk

2618
02:20:54,912 --> 02:20:59,008
And since Steve was born in 1943 21 years

2619
02:20:59,264 --> 02:21:00,544
How old is that point

2620
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:04,640
If he's mixing up like I got him a scholarship at the clerk office or whatever

2621
02:21:04,896 --> 02:21:09,248
Anytime the Bill Clinton was formally involved with

2622
02:21:09,504 --> 02:21:10,272
Fulbright

2623
02:21:10,528 --> 02:21:12,064
Steve would have been 21 years old

2624
02:21:12,576 --> 02:21:14,112
Yeah it's impossible that he was a

2625
02:21:14,368 --> 02:21:16,416
Member of any board

2626
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:17,184
Been drafted yet

2627
02:21:17,696 --> 02:21:20,000
This is legitimately

2628
02:21:20,256 --> 02:21:20,768
Dick f******

2629
02:21:21,024 --> 02:21:27,168
41 on the board of the Fulbright program

2630
02:21:29,984 --> 02:21:31,008
It's a completely different

2631
02:21:31,264 --> 02:21:33,568
For part of the state department that he was ever involved

2632
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:36,896
If the Bureau of educational and cultural

2633
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:42,528
He presently this world who touched on this already they gallivanting around the state

2634
02:21:42,784 --> 02:21:44,832
Dissection like an interoffice Forest

2635
02:21:45,088 --> 02:21:47,648
Scump getting mixed up in whatever historically important

2636
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:49,184
Happen in any Department

2637
02:21:50,208 --> 02:21:50,976
Acceptance

2638
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:52,256
Describing something

2639
02:21:52,512 --> 02:21:53,024
Didn't have

2640
02:21:53,792 --> 02:21:54,816
Namely Bill Clinton

2641
02:21:55,072 --> 02:21:55,584
Getting a Fulbright

2642
02:21:57,632 --> 02:22:00,192
Set foot in the state department in 1970

2643
02:22:00,448 --> 02:22:01,216
Before

2644
02:22:01,472 --> 02:22:03,776
Like an intern

2645
02:22:04,032 --> 02:22:04,800
As a consult

2646
02:22:05,568 --> 02:22:08,128
Bill Clinton had already gotten his law degree from Yale

2647
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:09,920
He'd met Hillary and he moved

2648
02:22:10,176 --> 02:22:11,712
To Texas with her to campaign for Georgia

2649
02:22:11,968 --> 02:22:12,480
McGovern

2650
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:14,784
There's literally zero chance that what he saying is

2651
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:16,320
Is true and Alex except

2652
02:22:16,576 --> 02:22:17,344
To the s*** on question

2653
02:22:18,112 --> 02:22:21,952
This is not a small slip-up received Fulbright

2654
02:22:22,464 --> 02:22:23,744
If that were the case then Steve whatever

2655
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,560
Be claimed that he was on the board of the Rhodes trust in 90

2656
02:22:27,072 --> 02:22:29,120
68 which is completely unbelievable

2657
02:22:29,632 --> 02:22:35,776
Particularly because according to its full brightness

2658
02:22:36,032 --> 02:22:38,080
The state department is involved in the Fulbright program

2659
02:22:38,336 --> 02:22:44,480
Eddie knows Alex is stupid enough to know that Bill Clinton got a Rhodes scholarship to go to Oxford

2660
02:22:44,992 --> 02:22:45,504
Not a Fulbright

2661
02:22:46,272 --> 02:22:47,808
This guy is a pathological liar

2662
02:22:48,576 --> 02:22:51,136
Naked did you try and pull something like this off

2663
02:22:51,392 --> 02:22:52,160
Your

2664
02:22:52,672 --> 02:22:53,952
Help yourself

2665
02:22:56,256 --> 02:23:00,608
No you didn't need to add that the little expert

2666
02:23:00,864 --> 02:23:01,888
Forever

2667
02:23:02,144 --> 02:23:02,656
Senior at

2668
02:23:02,912 --> 02:23:04,704
You're an expert

2669
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:08,032
Doesn't do anything and somehow he's in

2670
02:23:09,312 --> 02:23:10,080
Do you know why

2671
02:23:10,336 --> 02:23:10,848
He can get away with it

2672
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:17,504
Oh well and that is important to me because while I was the premier of China

2673
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:19,552
72

2674
02:23:19,808 --> 02:23:25,952
I led the assault on

2675
02:23:27,744 --> 02:23:28,512
What

2676
02:23:29,024 --> 02:23:31,328
The f*** out of here

2677
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:33,376
Independence

2678
02:23:36,448 --> 02:23:40,032
Call Travis

2679
02:23:40,544 --> 02:23:45,408
Little known facts almost to me kind of feels like he's doing this for

2680
02:23:45,664 --> 02:23:46,944
Fort Lakeline

2681
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:48,480
Just trying to see how far he can

2682
02:23:48,736 --> 02:23:50,784
Can push things I mean

2683
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:52,064
However far you walk

2684
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:53,600
It's crazy to me that he

2685
02:23:53,856 --> 02:23:55,648
You tried to sell this on Alex's show

2686
02:23:55,904 --> 02:24:02,048
He's on the board of the Fulbright program to Bill and

2687
02:24:02,304 --> 02:24:02,816
Alex

2688
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:06,144
Maybe five years

2689
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:08,960
Like we're done

2690
02:24:09,216 --> 02:24:14,336
What do you have In the Heat of the Moment you're not able to pull out the resources like Alex doesn't even

2691
02:24:14,592 --> 02:24:18,944
But he doesn't know the Bill Clinton did get a Fulbright

2692
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:23,296
He doesn't know these things

2693
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:25,088
Even after the fact

2694
02:24:25,344 --> 02:24:26,112
Alex isn't like

2695
02:24:27,392 --> 02:24:28,928
I had a check-up on some of this information

2696
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:35,072
The Fulbright program

2697
02:24:35,328 --> 02:24:35,840
Good point

2698
02:24:36,096 --> 02:24:36,864
Good point

2699
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:42,496
Also address one

2700
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:48,640
And it's not clear that Steve is saying that they gave bill

2701
02:24:48,896 --> 02:24:55,040
Fulbright

2702
02:24:55,296 --> 02:24:56,320
If my criticism is

2703
02:24:56,576 --> 02:24:58,368
You gave him this

2704
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:03,744
Or whatever

2705
02:25:06,304 --> 02:25:10,912
The timeline is still a huge problem involved in anything

2706
02:25:11,424 --> 02:25:14,752
Before the point that Bill had already graduated from Law School

2707
02:25:15,008 --> 02:25:16,544
The time it Oxford was well behind

2708
02:25:17,056 --> 02:25:18,592
The timeline does not work out

2709
02:25:18,848 --> 02:25:19,360
It just does not

2710
02:25:19,616 --> 02:25:21,920
There's literally zero chance you would have been involved

2711
02:25:22,432 --> 02:25:23,456
If any of this s***

2712
02:25:23,712 --> 02:25:24,224
Anyway

2713
02:25:24,480 --> 02:25:25,760
This is a complete lie

2714
02:25:26,016 --> 02:25:27,808
History does not back this up

2715
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:30,112
It's Steve flippantly throws it out

2716
02:25:30,368 --> 02:25:32,672
In order to insinuate himself greater in

2717
02:25:32,928 --> 02:25:37,792
These big events that Alex's interested in

2718
02:25:38,048 --> 02:25:39,328
CIA plant

2719
02:25:39,584 --> 02:25:41,120
It's that b******* it's crazy

2720
02:25:41,376 --> 02:25:43,680
Yeah it's it's almost on the level of like

2721
02:25:44,448 --> 02:25:44,960
I went back

2722
02:25:45,216 --> 02:25:45,728
Can I was reading

2723
02:25:45,984 --> 02:25:46,496
Some Play-Doh

2724
02:25:48,288 --> 02:25:50,592
You know when were writing about

2725
02:25:51,104 --> 02:25:51,616
Uberman

2726
02:25:51,872 --> 02:25:52,384
I was

2727
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:53,664
Really reminded

2728
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:54,432
How great

2729
02:25:55,712 --> 02:25:56,224
Looking in

2730
02:25:58,272 --> 02:25:58,784
I just thought

2731
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:00,064
I'm going to work with Alex

2732
02:26:01,344 --> 02:26:04,160
I'm going to give him a chance to look at this I got going

2733
02:26:10,304 --> 02:26:11,072
Particular word

2734
02:26:11,584 --> 02:26:12,096
Dim

2735
02:26:12,608 --> 02:26:13,120
He says it a bunch

2736
02:26:21,312 --> 02:26:24,384
Alex Jones

2737
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:26,432
Spooky

2738
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:43,072
Stop it

2739
02:26:43,328 --> 02:26:48,960
Is your Show haunted

2740
02:26:49,216 --> 02:26:51,776
Talk about things that are spooky

2741
02:26:56,896 --> 02:27:00,480
Coast to Coast

2742
02:27:05,344 --> 02:27:06,880
I got

2743
02:27:07,136 --> 02:27:09,184
Allege

2744
02:27:10,464 --> 02:27:13,280
So earlier that Alex has every reason

2745
02:27:13,536 --> 02:27:16,352
To know what the consequences of his actions are

2746
02:27:16,608 --> 02:27:17,888
I wish I got

2747
02:27:18,144 --> 02:27:19,424
I was talking about this

2748
02:27:19,936 --> 02:27:20,448
Play up

2749
02:27:35,552 --> 02:27:36,832
I have a shower back there

2750
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:41,696
And

2751
02:27:52,192 --> 02:27:53,216
Comment

2752
02:27:56,288 --> 02:27:59,104
That's a pretty spooky f****** thing to do

2753
02:28:00,128 --> 02:28:02,944
Has every if this isn't made up

2754
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:06,016
Like I know right FBI is calling

2755
02:28:06,272 --> 02:28:07,552
I don't really believe

2756
02:28:08,064 --> 02:28:12,160
Natural

2757
02:28:12,416 --> 02:28:13,184
Of the things

2758
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:13,952
Things that are happening

2759
02:28:15,232 --> 02:28:18,048
It's completely believable that authorities showed up

2760
02:28:18,304 --> 02:28:20,352
Because people have been making death threats

2761
02:28:23,936 --> 02:28:24,960
Cialix

2762
02:28:25,216 --> 02:28:29,312
Not being aware of the connection between the rhetoric he's been using

2763
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:35,712
We're going over

2764
02:28:35,968 --> 02:28:39,296
This direct targeting of the veterans in the Christians is like

2765
02:28:39,808 --> 02:28:43,392
You got to follow these demons are you all this stuff

2766
02:28:44,416 --> 02:28:45,440
The consequence of that

2767
02:28:45,952 --> 02:28:46,720
People on his mask

2768
02:28:46,976 --> 02:28:47,488
Message board

2769
02:28:47,744 --> 02:28:49,280
Things are going to go after these p

2770
02:28:50,048 --> 02:28:51,840
That is a natural reaction

2771
02:28:52,096 --> 02:28:55,168
I don't know who the person that this person was targeting is good

2772
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:56,192
Bring it up

2773
02:28:56,704 --> 02:28:57,216
B

2774
02:28:57,728 --> 02:28:59,520
This is what you would expect to see

2775
02:29:00,288 --> 02:29:01,824
Alex can't be naive

2776
02:29:02,336 --> 02:29:02,848
Of that

2777
02:29:03,104 --> 02:29:05,920
The Secret Service f****** showed up

2778
02:29:06,176 --> 02:29:06,688
Even then

2779
02:29:07,712 --> 02:29:08,224
They would do it at

2780
02:29:09,504 --> 02:29:10,784
It's not like there

2781
02:29:11,296 --> 02:29:14,112
We're here because you are the reason

2782
02:29:14,624 --> 02:29:15,136
Get your records

2783
02:29:15,648 --> 02:29:16,416
These people went on

2784
02:29:16,672 --> 02:29:17,440
John Deere website

2785
02:29:19,232 --> 02:29:21,024
And he's like oh cool I wasn't

2786
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:21,792
Batman on

2787
02:29:22,048 --> 02:29:26,144
Michelle

2788
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:28,448
Increasing the likelihood

2789
02:29:28,704 --> 02:29:32,032
Will continue to pray

2790
02:29:32,288 --> 02:29:34,848
As he's presenting this There is almost like a

2791
02:29:35,104 --> 02:29:36,384
A naive

2792
02:29:37,664 --> 02:29:38,432
Disconnect

2793
02:29:38,688 --> 02:29:39,200
She's trying to have

2794
02:29:39,456 --> 02:29:40,224
Between his actions

2795
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:43,040
And the result of someone posting threats towards

2796
02:29:44,576 --> 02:29:47,904
No authorities would show up if it was something the vague

2797
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:49,696
It's a specific threat

2798
02:29:50,208 --> 02:29:52,768
And it's a specific threat that someone reported to them

2799
02:29:53,024 --> 02:29:56,864
Specific was worth their time to look into

2800
02:29:57,632 --> 02:29:59,168
Which means that it's pretty

2801
02:30:00,448 --> 02:30:02,752
This is a direct consequence of the rhetoric

2802
02:30:03,264 --> 02:30:03,776
He use it

2803
02:30:04,032 --> 02:30:06,592
He's trying to pretend that he doesn't understand that in that

2804
02:30:06,848 --> 02:30:07,360
That's not the case

2805
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:09,152
Fights

2806
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:12,992
As he's talking about how he's not worried about the Secret Service

2807
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:17,344
Launch is directly into the exact Behavior

2808
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:18,624
It's deathreats from his body

2809
02:30:19,648 --> 02:30:25,792
For the children

2810
02:30:32,448 --> 02:30:33,728
Alfred

2811
02:30:42,176 --> 02:30:43,200
And I feel guilty

2812
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:09,312
Is going to collapse

2813
02:31:21,088 --> 02:31:22,112
That's all

2814
02:31:29,792 --> 02:31:30,304
What do you think

2815
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:31,584
Expressing in nightclub

2816
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:35,680
I mean what you hear is a guy who think he feels guilty for not

2817
02:31:35,936 --> 02:31:37,472
Not kicking down these people's doors

2818
02:31:37,984 --> 02:31:42,080
If you are someone who is so inclined to believe the things that Alex says

2819
02:31:42,592 --> 02:31:47,200
Add someone who's susceptible to the way he manipulates people's emotions

2820
02:31:47,712 --> 02:31:52,320
It wouldn't be hard to hear that be like this is Alex saying that I should be doing

2821
02:31:53,344 --> 02:31:54,112
Because Alex

2822
02:31:54,368 --> 02:31:56,672
He wishes he was doing those things

2823
02:31:57,952 --> 02:31:58,720
This is

2824
02:31:58,976 --> 02:31:59,488
Okay

2825
02:32:00,256 --> 02:32:01,792
This is absolutely

2826
02:32:03,072 --> 02:32:04,608
I think over the course of this episode

2827
02:32:07,168 --> 02:32:07,680
Pieczenik

2828
02:32:07,936 --> 02:32:10,240
Manipulating Alex and having him around his finger

2829
02:32:10,496 --> 02:32:12,544
With this pageant of going to South Korea

2830
02:32:13,056 --> 02:32:14,592
And then more importantly

2831
02:32:14,848 --> 02:32:17,408
You see this escalation of rhetoric towards Direct

2832
02:32:17,664 --> 02:32:18,176
Targeting of

2833
02:32:18,432 --> 02:32:18,944
The people who are

2834
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:23,808
Sequences of that

2835
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:26,368
Secret Service shows up about one of his commenters

2836
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:31,744
His response to that is not to take a look in the mirror and say is it possible that the

2837
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,048
The things that I'm doing or eliciting this reaction

2838
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:35,328
It's to say

2839
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:38,144
F*** it I'm doubling down I'm going to make it worse

2840
02:32:38,400 --> 02:32:43,264
Engage in the exact behaviors that Elizabeth and I'm going to do it so

2841
02:32:44,032 --> 02:32:44,800
Does CPS

2842
02:32:45,568 --> 02:32:46,336
Sex with your kids

2843
02:32:50,432 --> 02:32:53,248
Christine and I feel guilty that I'm not killing them myself

2844
02:32:54,016 --> 02:32:55,040
This is unacceptable

2845
02:32:55,296 --> 02:32:56,064
This is

2846
02:33:01,952 --> 02:33:03,488
I don't think it's accidental

2847
02:33:03,744 --> 02:33:04,512
Visit intention

2848
02:33:05,024 --> 02:33:08,864
Not be aware of the consequences of Zach

2849
02:33:09,632 --> 02:33:11,424
Not understand how this works

2850
02:33:12,192 --> 02:33:13,216
He's doing this

2851
02:33:14,496 --> 02:33:15,264
For a reason

2852
02:33:15,776 --> 02:33:16,288
Yeah

2853
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:18,592
And I can't get away from the phone

2854
02:33:18,848 --> 02:33:20,384
That the reason is because

2855
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:21,664
Wendy's like

2856
02:33:22,176 --> 02:33:23,712
These things happen he profits

2857
02:33:26,272 --> 02:33:27,808
I can't think that he wants

2858
02:33:28,064 --> 02:33:29,344
To hurt innocent people

2859
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:30,368
What bison

2860
02:33:30,624 --> 02:33:31,392
Crazy people after

2861
02:33:31,904 --> 02:33:33,952
I just don't think he's that much of a

2862
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:35,488
Yeah I ate

2863
02:33:35,744 --> 02:33:36,512
Possible but it's

2864
02:33:37,024 --> 02:33:37,536
So unlike

2865
02:33:39,072 --> 02:33:42,400
The only other explanation I can come up with is a business motivation

2866
02:33:42,912 --> 02:33:43,680
Yeah that makes sense

2867
02:33:45,216 --> 02:33:46,496
He doesn't care that

2868
02:33:47,264 --> 02:33:48,800
Right but he does

2869
02:33:49,056 --> 02:33:51,872
What mode is the money

2870
02:33:52,128 --> 02:33:52,640
He gets

2871
02:33:52,896 --> 02:33:56,736
And if they get hurt from the furthering of his narrative

2872
02:33:57,248 --> 02:34:01,088
Because if one of his listeners goes out and commit some sort of egregious

2873
02:34:01,344 --> 02:34:03,136
Motivated by the things that

2874
02:34:03,648 --> 02:34:05,952
Convinces them about

2875
02:34:06,208 --> 02:34:09,536
When it comes out

2876
02:34:09,792 --> 02:34:14,400
It also confirms all of his marriage is about Heather going to do false Flags

2877
02:34:14,656 --> 02:34:16,192
Right there is a

2878
02:34:17,984 --> 02:34:18,496
You going to come

2879
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:25,664
It appears that it is you could see it as a comfortable spot

2880
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:28,736
Because people are like giving him a pass at this point

2881
02:34:30,272 --> 02:34:32,320
All I all I can see is just

2882
02:34:32,576 --> 02:34:33,856
Craft

2883
02:34:34,112 --> 02:34:34,880
Crap

2884
02:34:36,928 --> 02:34:37,952
There's motivation

2885
02:34:38,464 --> 02:34:38,976
And it's

2886
02:34:40,512 --> 02:34:42,304
No matter what it is

2887
02:34:43,072 --> 02:34:44,864
For me to say what it is

2888
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:47,936
It would be way beyond my paygrade I have no f******

2889
02:34:48,192 --> 02:34:49,472
An idea but I do know it's not

2890
02:34:49,984 --> 02:34:51,776
Whatever it is is it will

2891
02:34:52,032 --> 02:34:53,568
And and just Monster

2892
02:34:56,384 --> 02:34:56,896
When I look at

2893
02:34:57,152 --> 02:34:57,920
It's stuff like this

2894
02:34:58,432 --> 02:34:59,712
I can't escape from

2895
02:35:00,480 --> 02:35:00,992
Feeling like

2896
02:35:02,016 --> 02:35:03,808
Holyshit even our show

2897
02:35:04,320 --> 02:35:04,832
Doesn't

2898
02:35:05,344 --> 02:35:06,368
Really capture hub.

2899
02:35:07,136 --> 02:35:09,440
Yeah yeah

2900
02:35:09,696 --> 02:35:11,232
3 years going over

2901
02:35:16,608 --> 02:35:17,632
And to look at this

2902
02:35:17,888 --> 02:35:18,912
In the aftermath of

2903
02:35:19,168 --> 02:35:19,936
Of Sandy Hook

2904
02:35:20,448 --> 02:35:21,216
AMC

2905
02:35:21,728 --> 02:35:22,240
How this is

2906
02:35:22,496 --> 02:35:24,288
Progressed to the point that it's got to now

2907
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:28,128
Like I do let him off the hook a tiny bit because of how much

2908
02:35:28,384 --> 02:35:30,176
Steve is manipulating him obviously

2909
02:35:30,432 --> 02:35:31,200
Like

2910
02:35:31,968 --> 02:35:33,248
Is Dopey

2911
02:35:34,784 --> 02:35:36,064
But it doesn't excuse

2912
02:35:36,576 --> 02:35:38,880
Like the other stuff that's going on isn't

2913
02:35:39,904 --> 02:35:42,976
The stuff that is actually leading them towards telling people to her

2914
02:35:43,232 --> 02:35:44,256
Harass innocent

2915
02:35:44,768 --> 02:35:46,048
Folk right is not

2916
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:47,328
Now that's the reason

2917
02:35:47,584 --> 02:35:48,096
Joseph

2918
02:35:48,352 --> 02:35:48,864
Disgusted

2919
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:49,632
Escalating

2920
02:35:49,888 --> 02:35:50,400
Towards

2921
02:35:50,656 --> 02:35:53,472
Like intentional radicalization of subgroups

2922
02:35:53,984 --> 02:35:55,008
Is not Steve

2923
02:35:56,544 --> 02:35:57,824
The part where he is

2924
02:35:58,336 --> 02:35:59,872
Coming into accepting the

2925
02:36:00,384 --> 02:36:00,896
Hook stop

2926
02:36:01,664 --> 02:36:02,176
Is almost certain

2927
02:36:05,504 --> 02:36:09,344
Splaturry that went to only one area where this behavior is manifest

2928
02:36:10,112 --> 02:36:10,880
Like he's

2929
02:36:11,904 --> 02:36:13,696
He's trying to get people to

2930
02:36:13,952 --> 02:36:17,280
Go follow VA doctors abortion doctors

2931
02:36:17,536 --> 02:36:19,072
People who are

2932
02:36:19,584 --> 02:36:21,376
Pastors at churches there globally

2933
02:36:28,288 --> 02:36:30,336
There's a lot of people

2934
02:36:30,848 --> 02:36:31,616
That he's trying to

2935
02:36:31,872 --> 02:36:32,896
To get that treat

2936
02:36:33,408 --> 02:36:33,920
Applied to

2937
02:36:34,176 --> 02:36:34,944
That was applied

2938
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:35,712
Sandy Hook

2939
02:36:36,992 --> 02:36:39,552
Like you said it's a far more Universal thing

2940
02:36:39,808 --> 02:36:41,088
Then probably we even

2941
02:36:41,344 --> 02:36:42,368
Expected when we set out

2942
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:45,184
Like he's he's legitimately

2943
02:36:45,952 --> 02:36:51,584
Presenting the idea that they're in the middle of a civil war already and the answer to that is targeted arrest

2944
02:36:52,096 --> 02:36:52,608
People that I

2945
02:36:53,632 --> 02:36:54,656
Determined our enemy

2946
02:36:57,984 --> 02:36:58,752
Escalating

2947
02:36:59,008 --> 02:37:00,288
It's not something that's been

2948
02:37:01,056 --> 02:37:02,080
A large portion of

2949
02:37:02,336 --> 02:37:02,848
This investigation

2950
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:04,896
As we've gotten into April 8th

2951
02:37:05,152 --> 02:37:06,176
Really really

2952
02:37:06,432 --> 02:37:06,944
Take a note

2953
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:08,992
Weird

2954
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:10,528
Because that

2955
02:37:13,344 --> 02:37:13,856
Far as

2956
02:37:16,672 --> 02:37:17,184
Stupid versus

2957
02:37:17,696 --> 02:37:18,208
Evil

2958
02:37:18,464 --> 02:37:18,976
Kind of

2959
02:37:20,768 --> 02:37:22,816
Obviously the motive

2960
02:37:24,096 --> 02:37:24,608
The operating

2961
02:37:25,632 --> 02:37:26,144
Prophet and

2962
02:37:28,704 --> 02:37:29,728
Little bit

2963
02:37:30,496 --> 02:37:31,008
Belief

2964
02:37:33,056 --> 02:37:33,568
Ghetto

2965
02:37:34,592 --> 02:37:35,872
Useful fiction and

2966
02:37:36,128 --> 02:37:38,944
Greater real along the way

2967
02:37:39,456 --> 02:37:41,248
A means to the end of process

2968
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:46,112
I agree with him is only useful as

2969
02:37:46,368 --> 02:37:48,416
Transmitted or transmuted into

2970
02:37:48,672 --> 02:37:53,024
They put up bumper stickers they spread the word about the show by my product

2971
02:37:53,792 --> 02:37:56,096
You sign up youngevity

2972
02:37:57,376 --> 02:38:00,192
I think a bit of it like

2973
02:38:01,216 --> 02:38:03,264
I don't think he believes the severity of it

2974
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:05,824
Almost makes me go the opposite direction

2975
02:38:06,336 --> 02:38:07,616
The way that he doesn't

2976
02:38:07,872 --> 02:38:08,384
Give a f***

2977
02:38:08,896 --> 02:38:10,944
Almost to the end

2978
02:38:11,456 --> 02:38:13,248
Engaging in literal

2979
02:38:13,504 --> 02:38:14,016
Terrorism

2980
02:38:14,528 --> 02:38:15,808
It's almost more like

2981
02:38:16,064 --> 02:38:16,832
Genuinely believe

2982
02:38:17,088 --> 02:38:18,880
Is that we are in the Civil War

2983
02:38:19,392 --> 02:38:19,904
And that

2984
02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:21,184
There's only one way here

2985
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:21,952
Come out on top

2986
02:38:22,464 --> 02:38:27,072
No I don't like that kind of love

2987
02:38:27,328 --> 02:38:29,632
Smaller

2988
02:38:29,888 --> 02:38:30,912
Kind of stuff

2989
02:38:31,424 --> 02:38:35,520
Cultural Marxism white people are the best like I think he believes

2990
02:38:35,776 --> 02:38:36,544
Those things

2991
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:37,312
But I don't

2992
02:38:37,568 --> 02:38:38,080
Becky believes

2993
02:38:38,336 --> 02:38:39,104
This severity of this

2994
02:38:39,360 --> 02:38:39,872
Situation that he's

2995
02:38:40,384 --> 02:38:42,944
I think he's keenly aware that a lot of that is

2996
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:43,712
Is just a fuse

2997
02:38:44,224 --> 02:38:46,528
Hyping up for the explicit purpose

2998
02:38:48,064 --> 02:38:48,576
Weather

2999
02:38:48,832 --> 02:38:50,624
Drawing in more people

3000
02:38:51,136 --> 02:38:51,648
Interesting

3001
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:54,720
Keeping people who are on board

3002
02:38:54,976 --> 02:38:59,328
More scared radicalizing the groups that he's already got on board

3003
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:02,400
Like I think those are the goals

3004
02:39:02,656 --> 02:39:03,680
To have to know that he's

3005
02:39:03,936 --> 02:39:04,704
Just full of s***

3006
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:07,008
About about the scale

3007
02:39:07,264 --> 02:39:08,288
But that's just

3008
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:09,312
That I get I have

3009
02:39:09,568 --> 02:39:10,592
No idea

3010
02:39:10,848 --> 02:39:11,360
Twista

3011
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:13,408
Radicalizing groups

3012
02:39:14,176 --> 02:39:14,688
That could also

3013
02:39:18,272 --> 02:39:18,784
So let's

3014
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:19,552
Maverick

3015
02:39:23,648 --> 02:39:27,744
But it's so dangerous like

3016
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,048
Hey we have a great message

3017
02:39:30,304 --> 02:39:31,328
Like to really focus on the

3018
02:39:31,584 --> 02:39:34,912
The church issues about the church

3019
02:39:35,168 --> 02:39:36,192
Here's some of the things you

3020
02:39:37,216 --> 02:39:39,008
When you talk to your pastor

3021
02:39:40,032 --> 02:39:43,616
About the scripture

3022
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:45,408
There

3023
02:39:45,664 --> 02:39:51,296
There is a responsible way to do it and it's not this it's not create the appearance of existential

3024
02:39:51,552 --> 02:39:52,320
Threat that's coming to

3025
02:39:52,576 --> 02:39:54,368
Wipeout all churches

3026
02:39:54,624 --> 02:39:56,160
In America in feet

3027
02:39:56,672 --> 02:39:58,464
That's not the way to do it

3028
02:39:59,744 --> 02:40:00,256
People

3029
02:40:00,512 --> 02:40:01,024
Deal with the

3030
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:02,304
VA issues isn't

3031
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:04,352
To say they're all snitches and never talked to them

3032
02:40:04,864 --> 02:40:06,912
But that's not how you do that

3033
02:40:07,168 --> 02:40:08,448
People in unhealthy spaces

3034
02:40:08,704 --> 02:40:09,984
But keep them in yours

3035
02:40:11,008 --> 02:40:12,032
So I don't have any respect

3036
02:40:12,288 --> 02:40:13,568
For any of this Behavior

3037
02:40:13,824 --> 02:40:14,336
It's just

3038
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:17,408
Service showing up

3039
02:40:17,664 --> 02:40:19,968
Is so addictive of how he's aware of the car

3040
02:40:21,248 --> 02:40:21,760
Like it's

3041
02:40:24,576 --> 02:40:25,600
It's damning stuff

3042
02:40:26,112 --> 02:40:27,136
I guess all that's all I can

3043
02:40:27,392 --> 02:40:27,904
That's all I can say

3044
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:32,000
See here

3045
02:40:32,256 --> 02:40:37,632
I should tell you that about an hour of this episode interviewing this basketball player who's a

3046
02:40:38,144 --> 02:40:38,912
Infowars

3047
02:40:39,424 --> 02:40:40,448
Representative

3048
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:43,776
No it's not a board it's just a product

3049
02:40:45,056 --> 02:40:47,104
Interesting

3050
02:40:47,360 --> 02:40:49,152
Any any good videos

3051
02:40:49,408 --> 02:40:50,688
No restaurant

3052
02:40:50,944 --> 02:40:51,968
No Rex Chapman

3053
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:54,528
Are episode today began on April 3rd

3054
02:40:55,296 --> 02:40:55,808
Began

3055
02:40:56,064 --> 02:40:56,576
With Alex

3056
02:40:56,832 --> 02:40:58,624
Finding out that there was a secret service

3057
02:40:58,880 --> 02:40:59,392
Agent who is she

3058
02:40:59,904 --> 02:41:00,672
Shifting reptilia

3059
02:41:01,184 --> 02:41:07,328
The shape-shifting Reptilian shows up on the show

3060
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:08,864
Hiragana turns out

3061
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:10,144
He's very available

3062
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:11,680
Because he shows up on the 8th

3063
02:41:12,448 --> 02:41:14,752
Alex talks about having him

3064
02:41:15,776 --> 02:41:20,896
Well damn

3065
02:41:31,904 --> 02:41:33,184
Ossuary

3066
02:41:38,560 --> 02:41:40,352
That conspiracy isn't about him

3067
02:41:40,608 --> 02:41:42,144
You have made that about him

3068
02:41:42,656 --> 02:41:48,800
I'm sure they were laughing about it there when I wasn't

3069
02:41:49,056 --> 02:41:55,200
It's just Alex

3070
02:41:55,456 --> 02:41:56,992
Prove it

3071
02:41:57,248 --> 02:42:03,392
In all in all the corners of the world

3072
02:42:03,648 --> 02:42:04,416
Except

3073
02:42:04,928 --> 02:42:11,072
Now interesting Lee in the interview Alex doesn't bring this up because he knows that if he does Daniel say that

3074
02:42:11,328 --> 02:42:17,472
For that it can't be him.

3075
02:42:21,568 --> 02:42:27,712
Of course he knows

3076
02:42:29,504 --> 02:42:31,296
Because it's still elevates that narrative

3077
02:42:31,552 --> 02:42:34,368
Of everybody who supports guns is being targeted

3078
02:42:35,136 --> 02:42:36,416
So it's again

3079
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:40,512
F*** this guy

3080
02:42:40,768 --> 02:42:41,280
Right

3081
02:42:42,048 --> 02:42:43,840
God this timeframe is just

3082
02:42:44,096 --> 02:42:44,608
So

3083
02:42:45,376 --> 02:42:46,144
Anxiety-provoking

3084
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:46,912
Think it's just

3085
02:42:47,424 --> 02:42:48,960
It's so terrifying to look at

3086
02:42:49,216 --> 02:42:51,264
Because you know the consequences you know what's coming

3087
02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:52,800
I like you see the behavior

3088
02:42:53,056 --> 02:42:54,336
That if any of it was

3089
02:42:54,848 --> 02:42:55,872
If any of it was more sane

3090
02:42:56,384 --> 02:42:58,688
If you just behave like a responsible human being

3091
02:42:58,944 --> 02:43:01,248
Didn't lie to people did manipulate people

3092
02:43:02,528 --> 02:43:06,368
Ask himself or one f****** second is it possible that Steve is making this s*** up

3093
02:43:06,624 --> 02:43:07,904
If you did any of those things

3094
02:43:08,416 --> 02:43:09,696
Crises could have been averted

3095
02:43:09,952 --> 02:43:11,744
People's lives could have been way better

3096
02:43:12,256 --> 02:43:12,768
Like

3097
02:43:13,280 --> 02:43:17,376
It's it's Unsinkable like how every single decision had to be bad

3098
02:43:17,888 --> 02:43:19,168
For Alex to end up in the position

3099
02:43:19,424 --> 02:43:19,936
He's in

3100
02:43:20,192 --> 02:43:20,704
And

3101
02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:21,984
Against

3102
02:43:22,496 --> 02:43:23,008
He

3103
02:43:23,264 --> 02:43:24,800
Made every wrong decision

3104
02:43:28,128 --> 02:43:28,640
Two times in a row

3105
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:31,712
Nope

3106
02:43:32,224 --> 02:43:34,016
You flipped it over every time you were

3107
02:43:34,272 --> 02:43:35,296
Every time you hit head

3108
02:43:35,552 --> 02:43:39,136
You just flipped it over here like

3109
02:43:39,648 --> 02:43:42,976
Two interesting Tales

3110
02:43:44,256 --> 02:43:48,096
Another

3111
02:43:49,632 --> 02:43:51,424
Pilot

Riverview could do all

3118
02:44:11,904 --> 02:44:12,928
But the best

3119
02:44:14,208 --> 02:44:15,232
The best way to get

3120
02:44:18,048 --> 02:44:19,840
You're going to want to go to the Ravenswood Metra

3121
02:44:20,608 --> 02:44:26,752
Okay no

3122
02:44:27,008 --> 02:44:31,872
Against going to the Metra I don't take a measurement never

3123
02:44:32,128 --> 02:44:38,272
I don't mean that at all

3124
02:44:38,528 --> 02:44:39,808
Very nice suburbs

3125
02:44:40,576 --> 02:44:41,088
The mattress

3126
02:44:44,416 --> 02:44:44,928
Safe deposit

3127
02:44:46,208 --> 02:44:46,720
The 13

3128
02:44:47,488 --> 02:44:48,256
Select Tire

3129
02:44:48,768 --> 02:44:50,560
13 very important number

3130
02:44:51,584 --> 02:44:52,352
Chip that open

3131
02:44:52,608 --> 02:44:53,120
Pull that up

3132
02:44:53,632 --> 02:44:54,144
Hand will reach

3133
02:44:54,912 --> 02:44:55,424
The ground giving

3134
02:44:57,216 --> 02:45:03,360
Open up alright alright

3135
02:45:03,616 --> 02:45:04,128
Stick Drive

3136
02:45:04,384 --> 02:45:05,408
Of course

3137
02:45:05,664 --> 02:45:06,432
Absolutely

3138
02:45:08,736 --> 02:45:11,040
Until then I'm Nido

3139
02:45:11,296 --> 02:45:12,064
