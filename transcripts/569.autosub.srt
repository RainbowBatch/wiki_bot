00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992

00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,808
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
What's fight.com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,280
Looks around

6
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,680
Put solder of sleep

7
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,728
Heard it I was going to let it go

8
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:17,312
You know now that you brought it up

9
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,408
What is your

10
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,432
Brightspot

11
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,248

12
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,600
I've been meaning to get to for wild there been

13
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
Difficulties

00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,416
I'll just code for my printer hasn't

15
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,696
Don't work too hard

16
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
I've been wanting

17
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,024
To do this again we did it

18
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,376
Gave her some

19
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,656
The folks sent them out

20
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:49,056
I wanted to do another run of these eating some new design themed around the cult of saline

21
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,592
I would like

22
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,920
Text to announce officially that we're going to be doing another run

23
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,944
Of these buttons

24
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,224
For Folk

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992
Books and

26
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,784
Here's how it's going to work cuz I got

27
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,184
Completely screwed up all of my inbox and I am not interested in that

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,256
New email address that is specifically for this

29
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:15,168
You do not have to be someone who gives to the show you do not have to be anything it just anybody if you would send your email

30
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,192
Career dress

31
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,752
I will

32
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,312
That is the one limitation on

33
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,128
And you have to send me an address

34
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
Send button to

35
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,432
And then I

36
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,504
Take care of everything else and you will have a button sent to you

37
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,040
The email address is

38
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
KS

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
Business

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
At gmail.com

41
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,416
And that's spelled KS

42
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
Viz

43
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,744
Mess

44
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,304
Kaff business

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
At gmail.com

46
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:50,496
If you send an address to that be a little bit of

47
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,312
Alright I'm going to obviously

48
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,592
Got to make these up

49
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,408
Could be a little bit of a delay but we will get this into work

50
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
Get some envelopes

51
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
It's with your addresses automatic

52
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,832
Get these button sent that to a very excited I really I know the last time we did this

53
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:08,672
One of the things that I discovered as I was really really enjoying

54
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,488
The process of making meditation up button

55
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,816
Stick to the crafting of it's in the the sort of

56
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
The repetitive

57
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632
Sure sure

58
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,400
Go to junk

59
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,520
Zen and the Art of button-maker I feel like

60
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
Replace now to there's a lot of

61
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,920
Precautions that we took the last time around true with

62
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:36,320
Wearing gloves while making the butt feels a little bit

63
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,648
Chill out a little bit about a nice gift

64
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,464
Steps are very excited about that and if you all want to

65
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,256
Send it to my address is with husband

66
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,560
His gloves

67
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,864
Will be on and they will be coated with anthrax

68
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,728
So it's a little bit of a different problem at an Elvis impersonator and then he had some ideas

69
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:59,104
What are you doing with your Xbox

70
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
It's in the early stages

71
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:06,016
It's not a super bright spot but after a year of writing nothing but

72
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
Mean things

73
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,600
To Taylor Swift and stories about wizard

74
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,416
I've started a new project

75
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:18,303
It's much larger hopefully it'll be about the size of the book I put out last year

76
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
You're so that sucks

77
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:24,191
People will definitely not

78
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,775
Here's the inspiration excited

79
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
Absolutely

80
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
I wish you the best

81
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
That's meat

82
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:37,503
So Jordan today we have an episode to go over there it's a little bit of a challenge

83
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
It was it was

84
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,135
It was a tough challenge for me and here's what happen

85
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,927
Sojourn

86
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,511
Studio at the beginning of this

87
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,559
He was in New York

88
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,655
I mean I think you're in New York

89
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:01,311
Maybe ya should have people on the border sea I think that a lot

90
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
Two people probably

91
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,895
That's the first thing their mind would go to

92
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:11,295
Is that you probably going to deal with some sort of illegal issue with the Attorney General of New York

93
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:17,695
Juliet threatens on are multiple times and of course he had the season 2

94
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,743
First of the product that he was selling

95
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,535
And I think

96
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
There is

97
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,631
A possibility that that's the case

98
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,703
Suspiciously went to Connecticut

99
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:34,591
Recently if I got why'd you go there

100
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,943
It's possible but also he was going there to do a POC

101
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:46,111
He went on that flagrant-2 podcast he was drunk last time

102
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:52,511
Well yeah he was so drunk last time that I don't even care to cover it

103
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:59,167
Maybe he's going there for some legal issue but then also maybe he's just doing this podcast

104
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,471
And so that was a possibility

105
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
Maybe we cover that apple

106
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,055
Simultaneously

107
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,335
Kill Tony

108
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
Play podcast

109
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,895
Had Alex as a guest

110
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
Tony hinch

111
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:15,551
Which Cliff noted Asian slur purveyor

112
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,367
Taking that towards his career

113
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:24,767
Yes actually

114
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,607
Tony's career

115
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,935
I mean I don't think it'll matter cuz the cult of

116
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,727
Rogan Enterprises

117
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
Has he

118
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
Ensconced

119
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
Under their umbrella

120
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:42,175
Tony Hinchcliffe is a writer guy

121
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
Comedian

122
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,991
Who he probably wrote for the w.w.

123
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,271
Suction

124
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:50,879
He's want to Rogan's buddies he's one of the ones who decided to go to Austin

125
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
Because

126
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927
Their bread is buttered

127
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951
In a very specific

128
00:06:54,207 --> 00:07:00,351
Any more people don't like me

129
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
This is where I'm welcome

130
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:07,007
My career revolves around Joe Rogan Joe Rogan's going to Texas I am too

131
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
That's her like that

132
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,639
No it's not I think it's people understanding where their cottages

133
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:17,759
History about the specifics of my career revolves around Joe Rogan

134
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
You can do worse

135
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
So

136
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,135
Kill Tony is a podcast that he does

137
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,695
That grew out of this open mic

138
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,535
Restore was called potluck night

139
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:35,167
Or something something like that I just decided like let's find a way to monetize this

140
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,287
Ties that open mic

141
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:45,919
Of the business decisions for an open mic that was probably the best I've ever heard sure

142
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:51,295
Listen to a number of episodes of it cuz it was a morbid Curiosity on my part

143
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,367
I always back not just

144
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
Just recently put

145
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,695
Builder the show is basically

146
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Yeah yeah Tony

147
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
You got

148
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,279
Is producer Brian Redban

149
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,815
And then you got to guess

150
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,863
A celebrity comedian gas

151
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:10,239
And they just act like hot shyt while he does a minute of

152
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
Material

153
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
Which is

154
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,823
Impossible to tell

155
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,639
That's all you need

156
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,431
That's all you need to know if you've

157
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:24,831
Got it around school and generally

158
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Baby

159
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,903
Overly encouraging of some

160
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,231
Things and overly mean to anybody who doesn't fit in

161
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
They're like

162
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
They're box

163
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
Just dumb

164
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,375
I wanted to cover it kind of

165
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
Because I felt like

166
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
Alright

167
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
This could be fun

168
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,519
This could be a fun thing to do in episode about

169
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,335
But it's so much of the episode is like

170
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:53,503
About other people stand upset or an open mic stand upset I don't want to cover that

171
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
She wasn't doing a minute

172
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
Yes

173
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,111
He would

174
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,439
Until like I guess I have this drop

175
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
I want some of that Joe Rogan weed

176
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,047
So there's that okay alright

177
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,167
What

178
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,959
Beautiful vagina

179
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
Have a nice night

180
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,847
I guess we will the part where where Alex

181
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
Smell some girls feet

182
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,711
Who was in the audience School her up on stage cuz one of the

183
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:28,575
Open my cruise has a foot fetish and then they get somebody with a foot to smiling

184
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,879
I don't I don't know

185
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
Yeah that's not an episode

186
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
Great I'm loving

187
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
Every part of this

188
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,047
Right up my alley I'm sure Alex had some insight

189
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,607
Full criticisms for the comedians

190
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,703
There's one guy who heads

191
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,983
Alex is like

192
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,335
I drugged but that was a very cerebral set

193
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,663
Okay

194
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
There is some insightful.

195
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,247
I can actually

196
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,807
Surprisingly at least at the beginning

197
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,087
He was a little boy

198
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
Bit more thoughtful

199
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,999
Red Band

200
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Contempt if you

201
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,071
It's very difficult for me because

202
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Ditto

203
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,399
Critiquing some of the stuff within the comedy

204
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Free space

205
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
Is always going

206
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,215
Going to be

207
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
Walking in Vallejo

208
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,031
There's not like

209
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,151
People will just hide behind be like it's comedy I'm just joking

210
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Whatever

211
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
Verstappen

212
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
I don't know it is

213
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,527
I was listening to the kill Tony

214
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,807
And I thought

215
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,599
Iowa lot of complaints

216
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,623
About this

217
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
But who cares

218
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,439
Yeah I kind of

219
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,999
Feel like maybe

220
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,327
Listening and criticizing a podcast

221
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,143
That's about listening and criticizing comedian

222
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
Isabella

223
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,727
Comedian

224
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
Everyone's

225
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
Yeah it is

226
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,847
It felt felt like challenging

227
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
They

228
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
Possible

229
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,015
To make it worth listening

230
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,063
Well maybe we'll do a little bit of

231
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
About that

232
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,367
Episode of flagrant 2

233
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
Why not

234
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,743
This is a little bit longer this is a conversational piece

235
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
Alex

236
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,327
Was so drunk on the first time that I've

237
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,631
Just didn't want to cover it was a little bit better

238
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
But I

239
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
Panda listening to it it's

240
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
So annoying

241
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
And

242
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
I think that the

243
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,359
Actually make a couple of pretty decent joke

244
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
Oh okay

245
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,687
I can see a little bit of life

246
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
That's what you like that's

247
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,575
If you like bro Eng

248
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,415
Comedy show or whatever people are talking

249
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
Talking about

250
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:47,583
Hey I had a threesome last week or whatever like what

251
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
You know

252
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
This being up your alley

253
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,679
It was insufferable for my

254
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
Purposes

255
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,495
Alex takes his shirt off at one point

256
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
Early

257
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
Call early

258
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,847
Early what are the hosts

259
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
What is the

260
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,639
Jimmy Seibert

261
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:07,039
Kreischer on kill Tony one of the host calls him Bert Kreischer okay well there we go and then the other

262
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
Weather host

263
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,087
It makes the joke

264
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,879
Did you say Burke crisis

265
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
Actor

266
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,183
Which is not bad

267
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:17,791
It's not bad word play

268
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,607
It's not bad words like

269
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
Funny

270
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,471
Because Alex ruined a bunch of people's lives

271
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,031
These guys are just jokes

272
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,079
To Alex

273
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,807
Know whenever you leave awake of misery and destruction what you should

274
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,599
Do with that is like

275
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
Make it a funny little bit that you can

276
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
Pawn off of Tulare

277
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:48,255
I can't believe you pulled it off

278
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,791
Like look

279
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:55,679
It's obviously only funny because you're talking about something monstrous that the person next to you did

280
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,751
Right all right but that said fine word play

281
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,543
Anyway I

282
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,127
I really struggled

283
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,151
HW Bush

284
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:11,551
Alright let's all have a fun time making a friendly conversation with George W bush

285
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,647
Exactly very funny

286
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:20,511
You are let me that your pictures are dumb

287
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:24,351
So we have a couple things that I'm going to talk about towards the end of the epi

288
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,143
Episode from the flagrant podcast

289
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,191
Because I think there were

290
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,727
It'll look as much as

291
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,287
These guys are just bullshiting and having

292
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,055
Fun and

293
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,847
Whatever I don't care

294
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,383
I don't I don't care

295
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,687
But there are a couple of salient points that I think

296
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
Could be brought up

297
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
And

298
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,319
Whatever we'll talk about that the other day episode

299
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
Thankfully

300
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
Something happened

301
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
Breaking news

302
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,975
And I Alex had to weigh in on it

303
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
About today

304
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,815
Special report that Alex put out

305
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839

So this is a a lie

309
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:07,871
Is it an emergency report on something that was reported roughly a year ago that we're finally talking about now.

310
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
Actually breaking news

311
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:15,295

Anniversary

383
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,495

30th is apparently Pearl

394
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,911
From what this is saying I would rather have

395
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,703
End your marriage at 30

396
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:23,103
Why would you make it all the way to the office equipment

397
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,919
Laughter

398
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:35,135

Is is

407
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
I guess

408
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
At random

409
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:05,855
Pulled out of a hat

410
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,647
3/50 is gold

411
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,927

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,839
Marine creature

416
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
Plastic

417
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
Classic

418
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:26,335
So you telling me that I'm at 90 years old and I'm getting Saran wrap for my anniversary if you're lucky

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,247
Happy anniversary Christian happy birthday

422
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:37,343
Also Alex would like to remind everyone that we were born dead

423
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Life

424
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
Is

425
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,463
So Jordan

426
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,047
The big news

427
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,839
Is that was breaking yesterday is that

428
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,887
The John McAfee is no more

429
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,495
18 he was found deceased

430
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,799
In a prison cell in Spain

431
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
I'm sure or do you have just

432
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,383
The gotten word that he would be

433
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,919
Extradited to the United States

434
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
Two-Face

435
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
No charges

436
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:10,623
Yeah I think if I were being extradited from Spanish prison to United States prison I be like nah

437
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,695
I'm out it's it's hard to say but

438
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,231
It's not here Alex

439
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,535
John McAfee did not

440
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Kill himself

441
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,607
Public statements Amazon Twitter

442
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
Is early as just last week

443
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,679
He said I will never

444
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,471
Suicide in prison

445
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,031
I have been murdered by the US government

446
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,335
I'm going to listen to a man I knew and respected

447
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,967
Suicide

448
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,759
With no corners or no inquest

449
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,551
This thing stinks to high heaven

450
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:45,183
That's a that's a good cool to open

451
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,255
Special report that he put out

452
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,279
Even if we

453
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:53,375
Take as absolute gospel fact that McAfee said he would never kill himself

454
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,167
He was the definition of an unhinged

455
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,959
Drugged-out lunatic who said complete

456
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
Bulshit

457
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:04,127
Essentially for a living never imagined that a man so respected is John McAfee would perhaps

458
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,199
Send out a dumb idea very quickly before we thought it through

459
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:13,599
A couple of my favorite things that he said there were complete nonsense he said that he had nothing to do with his name

460
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,391
Neighbor in Belize is murder

461
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,952
Or that time that he said that if Bitcoin wasn't trading at

462
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,536
Get $500,000 within 3 years from July 7th

463
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
2017 he would quote

464
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,888
Eat his own dick on National Television

465
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,192
Never do that

466
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
Too late now

467
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,312
Some of his more recent work includes that time that he tried to create a

468
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,336
Publicity stunt hoax

469
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,384
Were you pretended to have been arrested for refusing

470
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,152
Don't wear a mask

471
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:40,480
Wearing a lace thong on his face instead

472
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:44,576
He's brilliant McAfee and his wife publicly claimed he'd been arrested in Norway but the picture

473
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,624
Posted as evidence of this were from

474
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
The Augsburg Airport

475
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,928
Witches in Germany

476
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,768
The Oxford police told the media quote there has never been an arrest

477
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,888
Explain that McAfee tried to enter Germany but decided not to when he was told that he would have to quarantine

478
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:03,008
And he's created a bunch of bulshit on social media right

479
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,544
Thanks for the libertarian nomination

480
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
For the presidential race or

481
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,408
The very overt and transparent history of involvement in pump

482
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,712
Dump cryptocurrency scam sure

483
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,272
That was one of the cases that McAfee was facing

484
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,808
Along with tax evasion twitch

485
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
But the US was looking

486
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,136
Extradited back to

487
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,672
Spain

488
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,256
He was found at a Court ruled that he could be extra

489
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Aphroditus denied

490
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
Midstates

491
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
Actually really

492
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,728
MattyB was 75 years old news facing essentially the rest of his life in prison for his fraud and tax crimes

493
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,056
Which absolutely would be convicted for

494
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,872
Since there's a video that he released of himself where he can

495
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,640
Confesses

496
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,432
Might be tough to refuse

497
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,992
Don't pay taxes for a year or so

498
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040
I have not filed

499
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,344
Every right tell the IRS

500
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,440
Define

501
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,976
That's going to be tough

502
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
You know what bums me out

503
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,560
What bums me out

504
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
So much

505
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608
Is that

506
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,400
We know for a fact

507
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:06,752
That if you are rich you literally can get away with not paying taxes

508
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,824
You know what I'm saying like we just

509
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,104
Scott a New York Times

510
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
Report sure

511
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,456
About how you don't have to pay taxes if you're rich

512
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:19,808
And the only way that you can f****** if your riches if you're just an

513
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,344
A****** like this

514
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,136
It's the only way

515
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,928
One way

516
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:33,632
Some people are too defiant

517
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,960
William loopholes we've created for rich people do not have to do that

518
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:41,568
Principle of the thing then fine you're going to die in a Spanish prison so I don't know what to tell you

519
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,616
This is on you

520
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:50,272
It's basically like the the ceiling metaphorically with his taxes is coming down

521
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,320
There's an open door

522
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,648
It's like you want to go through that door

523
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,928
Open it's over

524
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,464
But there's nothing on the other side

525
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,840
There's no punishment Sonata perhaps you'll just go out to the loophole

526
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,632
I will not

527
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,448
I will be crushed by this roof okay

528
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,264
Alright man if he died

529
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,128
From suicide but if that does end up being with determination that experts end up making I'm not going to be

530
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,456
I wanted to get a sense of how the media was covering

531
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,016
That's so I sampled some of the largest Outlet

532
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,064
It's that that you have work we're covering

533
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,832
The story

534
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:29,696
The headline and CNN was John McAfee found dead in Spanish prison after his ex

535
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
Extradition to the United

536
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,488
What states was approved

537
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:35,072
The article doesn't say that there's a known cause of death at all

538
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:41,472
McAfee was found dead in his cell in a prison near Barcelona on Wednesday around 1 p.m. Easter and Annabelle

539
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
Medical examiner is on the scene

540
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
A spokeswoman for the

541
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
Superior Court

542
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
Catalonia

543
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,592
Told CNN

544
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,152
She said the cause of death is under investigation

545
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,224
A statement from the Catalonia Regional government just

546
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
This department which manages prison

547
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,576
They're said to prison medical personnel and guards attempted

548
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
Perform life-saving

549
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,904
Procedures after fighting McAfee but we're

550
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
Successful

551
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,232
The statement said quote everything indicates

552
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,768
Unquote that McAfee

553
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,560
Could have died by Suicide

554
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,376
That article is eminently responsible

555
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,400
It doesn't jump to any

556
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,936
Wildly so

557
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:16,800
The BBC headline was quoted John McAfee Antivirus Creator found dead in prison

558
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
Incel

559
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:21,920
The article also doesn't provide a cause of death but does mention that same press release

560
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Quotes

561
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:26,784
The cattle and justice department said prison Medics tried to resuscitate him but we're not

562
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
Unsuccessful

563
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:31,136
It said in a statement that quote everything indicates on quote mag

564
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
Took his own life

565
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,720
The New York Times story of the headline quote

566
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:39,072
John McAfee software Pioneer turn in Spanish prison

567
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,376
They mention the primary source statement

568
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
Quotes

569
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,544
The justice department for the Catalan region in Spain said that pending an investigation it was treating his death as a probable suicide

570
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,128
The NPR story doesn't even talk about the Catalonia Justice

571
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,152
Department combat

572
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,992
Instead just reporting quote authorities are investigating the cause of death

573
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,040
This article even goes out of

574
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,832
It's way too soft in McAfee's image

575
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,856
Then turn them into some kind of a

576
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,392
Prankster type outlaw

577
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,464
McAfee took pride in outwitting authorities

578
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,792
He once boasted about eluding police by dressing as a driven Taurus

579
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
Speedo

580
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,352
Another time is an angry homeless man

581
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,192
It's like the MPR version of this is really like

582
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:19,776
I mean these things are true Maxi did dude

583
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,312
Did enjoy

584
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:25,408
Creating This Outlaw On The Run image of himself

585
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,224
Outsmarting the police right

586
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,528
You know it's not wrong for mpr2

587
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,112
To be the the angle that they're take

588
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,672
I would have included more of his

589
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,696
Bombast

590
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,488
Psychotic criminal acts but

591
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,816
I suppose if you would have paid him but as a

592
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
Modern-day

593
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,656
World traveling

594
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,936
Catch me if you can type

595
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
Con artist

596
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,520
Raiders had this headline

597
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,104
Larger-than-life software Mogul John McAfee dies in

598
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
I'm staying by Suicide

599
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,408
Lawyer says

600
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,736
This is because this story isn't about the actual death

601
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:04,576
It's about McAfee lawyer making a statement that McAfee died by Suicide

602
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,136
Quote McAfee lawyer Xavier

603
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,160
Villa Elba

604
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:13,280
Set the anti-virus software Pioneer died by hanging as his nine-month prison brought him

605
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,120
Even so even though this article as saying this

606
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,424
The article does not say that this in fact

607
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,704
What was the cause of death

608
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,496
Only that McAfee lawyer head

609
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,520
Said that it was

610
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,336
None of these Outlets are reporting anything to fit it

611
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:30,176
Given the information that they have to go on is directly from primary source state

612
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:34,528
One from the Catalonia justice department in 14 McAfee Zone lawyer

613
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,320
This is responsible reporting

614
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,392
The facts I can't find examples of these folks rushing

615
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,672
And jumping the gun

616
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
The called is a suit

617
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,232
No I can hear every

618
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:47,840
Free editor of every major Outlet screaming we're not doing an eps

619
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,864
Steam this time

620
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,656
Alright no f*** ups

621
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,704
No Epstein conspiracy theory

622
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,752
Here's why this

623
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
Looking at the coverages

624
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:01,408
Alex is trying to rush in jump the gun on the conclusion that his death was not a

625
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
Suicide

626
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,480
And in order to do that he needs to make the circle

627
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,016
Circumstances around the coverage

628
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
Z

629
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,320
As suspicious as poss

630
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,112
Oz reporting

631
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:15,232
A fiction which is at the media's immediately and without cause declared Maccabees death a suicide

632
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,280
Because they're trying to cover something up

633
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
Because that

634
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,352
Colonel suspicion is necessary for Alex

635
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,144
Use the story for his own purposes

636
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,704
Alex is an opportunist by Nature

637
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,752
Any needs to use everything you can

638
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
Oregon's largest Ben

639
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:32,384
Just last week I was recovering that reporter Christopher signs death is it

640
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
Definitive

641
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,176
Professional X

642
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
Accusing

643
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,016
And his big prediction was the globalists are going to start killing people like him

644
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:38,784
Himself and Tucker

645
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,088
This situation with McAfee isn't there

646
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,648
Perfect fit but it's good enough for Alex to use

647
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,928
The claim that you was right

648
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,488
So this absolutely cannot be a suicide

649
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,024
Yan Infowars world

650
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,840
Yeah it's almost like it really doesn't matter how response

651
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,888
Possible the reporting of mainstream Outlets

652
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,656
What is Alex

653
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,704
This is just going to make it up on his own regard

654
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,728
Absolutely

655
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,616
There's a real danger to this kind of behavior and it's in how Alex is rhetoric has been shaped over the course of the past

656
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,664
Gear and even further back honest

657
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,736
The covid-19 Claire the globalist

658
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,296
The big move and something that they can't undo

659
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,600
This is the end game coming into reality

660
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,648
Which means that there's no going back

661
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,976
How to set that over and over in so many different construct

662
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,512
Victory or death

663
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:24,352
No Going Back they've crossed the Rubicon over and over and over again

664
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,168
Different ways and goes no going home again

665
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:33,568
Also I'm very very sorry Hamdi I apologize

666
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
But listen

667
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,104
My bad

668
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,968
The rhetoric surrounding how this is like the end the game and you know this is this is the big move

669
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,272
That's dangerous enough on its own

670
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:48,672
And if Alex is now going to start reporting stuff like people like McAfee dying is the globalist killing off Brave

671
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,696
Patriot l

672
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,512
What's the logical leap he's expecting his audience

673
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,280
To make

674
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,072
He constantly talks about how everyone

675
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,888
Is to keep list of globalist in their town and be ready

676
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,912
Take them out with things

677
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
Jump off

678
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,752
How is killing off Patriot leaders not the most

679
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:05,056
Explicit evidence that things have jumped off

680
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,336
So you could imagine

681
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,408
Weather remains to do this or not is kind of irrelevant

682
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,480
It's just part of the message that is audience is going to take from that

683
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,528
As far as I can tell all week

684
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,808
Can really do is hope that

685
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,088
The people who get that message

686
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,136
Aren't the type of listeners that he has would like

687
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
To take action

688
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,208
Yeah cuz the only message you can get is

689
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,024
Once they're done with all of these people they're coming

690
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,048
Sing for you

691
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,120
So you might as well stop them now before they

692
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,704
I'm talking about like

693
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,264
Steam as a murder a Hillary murder

694
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,288
Or whatever

695
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,568
The little bit different

696
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,848
Even because that's like

697
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,616
All right they're trying

698
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:43,712
To cover up their tracks right or whatever dassault

699
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
On

700
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,760
The Patriot

701
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
Folks

702
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,024
He's not like a McAfee a Libertarian anti-tax where do we actually would go on

703
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,560
Infowars really would

704
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,864
Is there ads

705
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:07,776
Is it really going to move the needle though I feel like McAfee is just going to be a blip and then everybody's going to be like yeah I'm fine

706
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,824
Alex needed to justify the

707
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,152
Previous coverage of his predictions of patriot leaders being killed

708
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,432
So it's very important

709
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,736
For that piece true he's got to sell it hard

710
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:20,832
But I don't think that at this point Alex is aware that mac and cheese

711
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,112
Instagram posted a big

712
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:26,720
Q right after he died which is going to complicate that's going to make it a little week

713
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,536
Looking to make a little bit dicey

714
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,352
So Alex talked a little bit about how he

715
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,376
He got to know

716
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,144
Rob McAvoy

717
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,192
I got a chance to get

718
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
Get to know

719
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,544
2012 right after his Escape

720
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,336
Belize and Guatemala

721
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
Larger than Life

722
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:49,760
Several times

723
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,440
A guy

724
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,720
Most definitely

725
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,000
American success

726
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,328
Antivirus

727
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,376
So American

728
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,400
Success story

729
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,680
5 magazine was born

730
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,448
England

731
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,544
The BBC quote I feel as much British as I do American

732
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,312
Wow

733
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:17,920
He founded the McAfee Associates but he also sold that 1994 and since then

734
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,712
It's not what I would call a glowing

735
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Success

736
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,552
You know more like a cautionary Tale

737
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,856
Or just perhaps

738
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,672
An evil motherfuker wandering around

739
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:32,256
Setting weirdo I'll take that one

740
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,048
Sounds as a comparison

741
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,328
Historical comparison

742
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,352
30 mics

743
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,888
That what it what a shock

744
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,912
It has to do with booze

745
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,896
They certainly try to go retire down abolition live like a

746
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:52,736
Captain Henry Morgan was a big old pile of s***

747
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,784
I don't know if it's the person you want to be compared to

748
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,856
His later career he was employed by Jamaica

749
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,392
Privateers

750
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,416
Pirates away

751
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:04,768
From the area surrounding the island they used to call him the jamocha from Jamaica

752
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,816
Instead

753
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:10,912
Compliments

754
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,680
Jamocha

755
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,704
Jamoke

756
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,728
Never

757
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:15,776
Okay

758
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:20,640
Instead what he did is he decided to just demand money from Pirates to allow them

759
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
To come on

760
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:26,528
You got to pay me title running a protection racket

761
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:31,904
Outrageous drunk and he declared martial law twice in a two-year span because of fears of a friendship

762
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
Invasion

763
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,464
I wish you to be pointed out

764
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,232
He was accused

765
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
Collaborating

766
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,816
After all that

767
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,096
Until his death Morgantown

768
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,376
Free slave plantation

769
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,400
Chance in Spanish

770
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,704
Bunch of his time trying to enslave more black Jamaican

771
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:50,336
He sucked yeah yeah but you know now we venerate him for his booze

772
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:56,992
I guess that's good I would imagine that Alex knows him as a pirate on a bottle of rum

773
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:00,832
True story of Captain Morgan is high on anybody's listed

774
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,904
I would guess it if Alex knew some of these things could be like

775
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
Even more into heaven

776
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,720
Be cool man

777
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,768
And I would like to run my own Island

778
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,816
Fortress and collaborate with the French

779
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,096
Since the overthrow my own

780
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,376
I'm f****** home L Ledger

781
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,912
Yes it's unclear

782
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
So

783
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
Alex

784
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,520
Tarnish his name Alex's big

785
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,312
Piece of evidence that he has really too

786
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,080
To go on

787
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,616
About McAfee

788
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,384
And how the

789
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,408
Could not possibly

790
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:31,808
This got to be a murderer it's the one time he tweeted out that I would never commit suicide and if I die in a prison it's because the United States government

791
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:33,856
Sweet Talk app

792
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,096
Here's another one from October of last year

793
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:44,864
2020

794
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,400
I am continuing

795
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
I have friends

796
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,472
The food is good all is well

797
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,312
Know that I hang myself

798
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,384
It will be no fault

799
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,504
I will not commit suicide

800
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,064
It's a setup

801
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,136
That's the first instance that I heard in this report of Alex

802
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:12,256
I don't know why you saying this is the second time I think it's probably an editing

803
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,536
Screw up

804
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,840
This queen is probably the strongest Avenue

805
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,888
Alex has that Max he didn't kill it

806
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,192
Since he said he wouldn't do that in October

807
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,032
I accept this as something that makes sense on its face but I also don't think a

808
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:24,800
Approve anything

809
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:30,944
John McAfee was where the most unhinged unstable people in the public eye and it isn't necessarily wise.

810
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,736
To take most of the things he says without a

811
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
Giant brain

812
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
Consultant

813
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,600
I can believe it in October he may have felt that he would never come

814
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
Commit suicide

815
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,904
But that was also eight months

816
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,488
I can change to person's mental state over the course of eight months

817
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,560
Particularly if they're in a foreign prison and maybe without

818
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,352
The drugs that they generally do

819
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,376
It could change your

820
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,936
Poinsett McAfee

821
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,984
History of being arrested in foreign countries

822
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,032
Sorby wanted in foreign countries

823
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,336
I'm getting away and going on the Run

824
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:02,944
When he was a person of interest in his neighbors murder in Belize he fled the country ain't got away with

825
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,784
More notably in 2019 he was arrested and released when you docked

826
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,064
Is boat in the Dominican

827
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,856
Who's on the run from the United

828
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,392
Midstates for that old text thing

829
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:14,976
Are you taking to living on his yacht I guess an international waters like some

830
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,512
I'm goddamn Andy Daly character

831
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
Fun

832
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,352
The kill time on the boat McAfee post

833
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,912
Did some pictures of himself with a bunch of big old gun

834
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,448
Is Drew the attention

835
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:29,824
The Dominican Republic authorities when he tried to Doc so he was arrested and held for four days and then

836
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,128
You know what I think about going on the Run

837
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,920
If I was running from the law

838
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,968
I would try also very hard

839
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
To not be

840
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,504
Noticed

841
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,904
See that would be part of my strategy of like if I had the opportunity to tweet out something

842
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,720
I would be like maybe people will notice this

843
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:53,120
Yes and I don't think I should do that when you're on the run it's kind of like you're in the No Flex Zone

844
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,680
I might even change my name

845
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:59,008
At the very least get a new Twitter handle

846
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,408
I'm trying to get rid of that blue checkmark doesn't serve your interests of being on the Run

847
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,992
To like really publicize a bunch of

848
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:13,088
Yeah I'm living out of this

849
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:19,488
No one will ever catch me pressing my Instagram followers but might be working across

850
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:23,840
Purposes of my trying to see on the Run

851
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
Maybe

852
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:29,472
John McAfee of the history of getting in trouble and then the consequences just disappear

853
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,544
We are so in October just after he been arrested in Spain

854
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,872
If you're him there's no way you think you're going to be in jail for the next

855
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,152
Months let alone

856
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,688
End of extradited to the United

857
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,248
Totally I'm posting that tweet

858
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,808
Can see that kind of a shitpost

859
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,112
This will be him saying like

860
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:49,952
I'll probably find a way to escape in a week

861
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:53,280
Until some actual evidence could be presented to the contrary

862
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,304
I see no reason to think

863
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,584
The simplest explanation

864
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,352
I'm here

865
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,888
Impossible

866
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,960
Like John Maccabees luck had run out

867
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,240
He's going to be returned to be 9

868
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,544
Midstates and he was likely going to be in prison for

869
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
4 years

870
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:10,432
He was a vagabond the world traveler a guy who flees countries and lives on boats

871
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,736
The prospect of long-term incarceration

872
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,552
Seems like exactly the thing that he would find intolerable

873
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,576
Yeah f*** that

874
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,600
There's a lot of

875
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,648
Remain to be answered but make

876
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,184
Teen murder I think

877
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,744
Going to be a really uphill battle for Alex

878
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,048
Especially if the thing is leading with his

879
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
The tweet

880
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,608
8 months ago

881
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,632
I don't know

882
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,656
I mean

883
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,472
Cuz cuz then you just get back to life

884
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,496
Really

885
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,776
Why

886
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,056
Why would they send it

887
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Hit team

888
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,616
Yeah

889
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,408
You could but I mean you know

890
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,176
Also

891
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:45,760
Look for Mcafee McAfee has very publicly

892
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,040
On Twitter

893
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,320
Painter shoes

894
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,624
Said that he has a dead man switch

895
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,416
Yeah

896
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
Okay yes

897
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,976
Okay fine

898
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,560
That that's like okay anybody who would want to kill him

899
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:04,960
Presumably because he has some kind of information that they want covered up maybe like oh wait

900
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,496
If he

901
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,520
Ends up getting

902
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,336
Killed that his wife is just going to release all of these

903
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,360
Sure

904
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,384
Whatever

905
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,664
Yeah it's it's not

906
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:20,064
That's is all just a spy novel

907
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,088
Magic One

908
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,112
I think

909
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,648
I I mean

910
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,976
Certain extent you could just describe it as those

911
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,536
Destruction of one man's mind

912
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:34,400
Coincidence

913
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,448
I don't think it was quick

914
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:40,800
Wow this is been going on while his mind was destroyed

915
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,384
So not only did he tweet once

916
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,664
Tweeted another tie

917
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,784
In November of 2019 so

918
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,808
Before

919
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:55,392
The one in 2020 and I quote I like f****** whales

920
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,952
We're coming

921
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,768
We're going to kill yourself

922
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,584
We're going to Arc

923
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,632
Kill yourself

924
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,728
I am suicide myself

925
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,496
I didn't

926
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,264
I was

927
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,312
Check out my right arm

928
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,336
And there

929
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,360
Is again

930
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,384
Tattoo

931
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,408
With the money there in the Y

932
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,432
Sty

933
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:24,320
Those streets are real but also John mcatee was a delusional paranoid drug addict to promise

934
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:27,648
Adidas own dick on TV as a way to promote cryptocurrency

935
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,952
Probably as part of a pump-and-dump activity

936
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,768
This isn't compelling evidence of anything

937
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,792
Like these tweets

938
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,840
Send them getting a tattoo that says

939
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,120
Dollar sign

940
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,912
It's not

941
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:41,728
Since to Me of anything other than McAfee was unwell

942
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,288
And maybe those weren't turns

943
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,104
The phrase so much as typos and poor

944
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,128
Grammar

945
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:54,528
Yeah could have some I might not be so much though well done

946
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,576
Author Lee talents

947
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,344
McAfee

948
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,416
I would love Alex did also try to go through Mac

949
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,208
Hippies

950
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:06,816
Twitter

951
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,840
Go for it let's

952
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,888
Let's all start talking about whale f*****

953
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:12,192
That's what needs to be in the public eye

954
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:15,520
So Alex needed to jump in front of this really

955
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,824
Rite Aid to get a narrative out

956
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,128
Can't let the cement dry on the

957
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:23,712
This one no no no

958
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,480
We're told

959
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,504
Kitchen

960
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,856
Breitbart it was a heart attack before his body was even cold

961
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,648
Contamination

962
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,440
Corn

963
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:40,608
Assassination is a very real thing in America around the world

964
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,192
The outlets that Alex thinks are in on this

965
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,984
Conspiracy did not report that it was

966
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,008
The suicide within minute

967
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:53,919
There was very matter-of-fact coverage of the catalonian statement and then eventually Reuters reported the statement that was made by Mac

968
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,687
Duffy's lawyer

969
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,015
I strongly suspected I was just laying there within minutes it was called the

970
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,295
The suicide is based on random

971
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:02,367
Tweetsie saw that Sanchez most likely

972
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:08,255
We did a whole episode about the day after Andrew Breitbart died and nothing Alex is saying is real about that case either

973
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:13,375
The media didn't immediately call it a heart attack in the initial reporting that it was suspected

974
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,143
Had to be a heart attack

975
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,935
The place that came from

976
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
Linda Direct

977
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,495
Line that everyone was quoting

978
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,567
Was a press release put out by breitbart's own website

979
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,103
There's no

980
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,127
Conspiracy there

981
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:27,455
As for the coroner thing that was just a conspiracy narrative

982
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,479
It's based on nothing

983
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,039
This was about the death of Michael Cormier

984
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,831
A person who worked at the coroner's office

985
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,951
The problem is that he had nothing to do with breitbart's autopsy and the amount of arsenic had an assistant

986
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,719
Was so large

987
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,255
The one of the detectives on the case said

988
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,791
It'd be impossible to poison

989
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,327
Even some of that much arsenic without the

990
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,095
I'm noticing

991
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,887
And people were pretty

992
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,167
Confused by that

993
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:47,935
Backpage

994
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
Yeah

995
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,751
Alex can't prove the cormier's death

996
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,519
For the poisoning

997
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,567
Intentional boys

998
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,127
Didn't die from a heart attack

999
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,431
All he can do is pull it string

1000
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,711
Real or imagined

1001
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,759
Turn order to create a sensational story line

1002
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
Fitz's purpose

1003
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:09,695
What are most important aspects of this is the narrative that the media immediately caused these deaths suicides or in

1004
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,975
Breitbart

1005
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,279
Because that implies that there's a cover-up

1006
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,559
If there's a cover-up

1007
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,607
That means that there's something to cover up

1008
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,631
And that means

1009
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,655
But it's murder

1010
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:24,031
In breitbart's case Albertsons just making up with the immediate the media immediately call the doctor

1011
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,591
This case is doing the same thing with Mike if he's death

1012
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:30,175
It's a pattern of behavior that exists not because he's responding

1013
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,199
Real reporting

1014
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,271
But because he's operating from a pre-existing script

1015
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,855
Regardless of what any media Outlet published about Maccabees dad

1016
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:41,439
As soon as Alex heard that he was dead he knew the angle was

1017
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,767
That the media immediately called it a suicide told him that

1018
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,327
The rest of this video is

1019
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,351
Is kind of

1020
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,143
But I mean here

1021
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,935
Alex's is defending himself

1022
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
This is known as

1023
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,263
Corky talking about himself

1024
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,079
He told his wife

1025
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:03,711
For the cryptocurrency

1026
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,551
His work will live on promoting libertarian ideas

1027
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,575
What

1028
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
Like

1029
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,879
The cryptocurrency

1030
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,415
They just want his money

1031
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,951
He doesn't have that

1032
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:17,791
Much money might have a bunch of Bitcoin or something I have no idea

1033
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:21,631
The people were talking about

1034
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:24,447
Multi-millionaires McAfee wasn't a multi-billion

1035
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:30,079
What is the globalist to kill him for his money that's silly

1036
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,383
Second I don't know it's not like you can

1037
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:38,783
Can kill someone and then automatically you just get their Bitcoins

1038
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,623
Bailando

1039
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,183
If you cut off somebody's head

1040
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:48,511
Immediately it's the quickening it's a big name

1041
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,791
It's basically like

1042
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,863
In Assassin's Creed when you have Auto loot

1043
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,703
For you

1044
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:00,031
Perfect

1045
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,823
The evidence is overwhelming and

1046
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,359
Listen to this

1047
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,639
Tyceno ever

1048
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,943
I see a couple of tweets

1049
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:12,575
I see the most reasonable course of action being the explanation for events

1050
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,135
It's the one that makes the most sense to me

1051
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,927
Yeah I mean if I'm 75

1052
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:22,047
I'm a globe traveling Rich dude who's escaped over and over and over again

1053
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,143
Outrageously lucky

1054
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,167
You've lived

1055
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:30,239
Probably one of the most insane lives

1056
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:34,079
Imaginable in foreign countries

1057
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,127
Dodging

1058
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,407
Totally

1059
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,199
Boxing above your weight class

1060
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,503
Forever and what it what are you going to do

1061
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:45,855
What are you going to get your going to get another 10 years of life in an American prison that's

1062
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,879
What's the awful

1063
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:50,463
You don't want to do that so f****** Audrey yourself it makes sense

1064
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,767
I made that that's tragic

1065
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,559
As much as I want to minimize

1066
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,095
Ghetto people who

1067
00:45:56,351 --> 00:46:00,447
Are struggling with suicidal ideation

1068
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,495
It is Imagine

1069
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,031
Cinebowl to put yourself in back

1070
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,055
Cappy's position

1071
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,615
And be like the indignity of

1072
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
The trial

1073
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,175
Yep the damage that

1074
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,455
The trial would do

1075
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,223
2

1076
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,015
The things that he has made the most

1077
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,831
Important parts of his life like cryptocurrency

1078
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,879
You can see taking the outdoor

1079
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,975
I don't know it I think

1080
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,511
I'm not

1081
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,047
Making any assumptions

1082
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,839
I'll let the information

1083
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,887
Guide me to whatever conclusion

1084
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,911
Is there

1085
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,007
Based on the statement from the catalonian just

1086
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:35,775
This department

1087
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,567
Based on the statement from his lawyer

1088
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,871
That they are saying this isn't a parent

1089
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,895
Suicide

1090
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:41,919
I don't

1091
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,455
See a reason to doubt that

1092
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,015
The only reasons to doubt that our

1093
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,295
Nutty tweets

1094
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,623
From somebody who tweeted nutty s*** all the time

1095
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,671
I'm not going to take that and I

1096
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:59,071
That's not going to stand up in any kind of Court even the court of my mind this lying liar

1097
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,119
Add something I guess I must believe it

1098
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,143
Yeah

1099
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,471
Adhere

1100
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:08,799
Further anime be larger problem for me is

1101
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,079
I just don't care

1102
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,615
I just don't

1103
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,407
Don't care that McAfee

1104
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,943
I'd like

1105
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,223
He's just not

1106
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:19,295
Important he's like a sideshow it's like a it's like a

1107
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,575
Carnival Barker

1108
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,367
It's like

1109
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:26,975
See I just don't see the power that Alex is

1110
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,255
Thinking that you can wield

1111
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,559
Through this year

1112
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,887
I get what you're saying and I'm not super interested

1113
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,423
In the case itself

1114
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,703
As much as I am

1115
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
The behavior

1116
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,335
I think that the important thing to take away from this

1117
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:45,663
Really understanding that Alex put out this report that night

1118
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:50,015
What we talked about that concrete idea the idea that

1119
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,807
When concrete is wet

1120
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,599
A leaf that falls on a

1121
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,391
I could leave a permanent impression

1122
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,159
You got it

1123
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,719
The information space is fairly similar

1124
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,999
And

1125
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,071
When a story when the details aren't out when there isn't

1126
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,863
Like solidified information

1127
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:05,887
Surrounding

1128
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,167
Stuff you can make

1129
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,215
Indentation in that conch

1130
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,263
A lot of people are going to say

1131
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,567
Subway has never used

1132
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:17,407
Tuna in their sandwiches before it's already happened it's too late now

1133
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,943
With this

1134
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,223
Alex is trying to put

1135
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,759
Into his audiences mind

1136
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,063
Before there's any solid

1137
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,087
Information

1138
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:28,159
The media immediately reported

1139
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,695
Did it was a suicide and that's

1140
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,463
Suspicious

1141
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:32,511
Because McAfee tweeted so crazy

1142
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,047
That's

1143
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,607
You know that it is a consist

1144
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,631
Behavior

1145
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:38,655
It's it's

1146
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,447
One of the most

1147
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,007
Kind of worrying and disgusting things

1148
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:43,775
Is that

1149
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,823
The conservative media

1150
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,663
Has so insulated their listeners and viewers in the like

1151
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:52,735
That they can make claims about any other media

1152
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,783
Because they know you're not going to go check

1153
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,063
You didn't listen

1154
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,623
You don't read the the papers

1155
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:02,975
What what person who is reading Infowars articles is then going to be like

1156
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,535
And now I'll switch over to the Reuters article

1157
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,815
That's not happening

1158
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:11,167
So you can just make any f****** claim that you want about what the media said

1159
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:11,935
Because they'll be

1160
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,983
Believe anything you say about what the meat

1161
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,055
You own the mainstream media

1162
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:17,823
If you are in the

1163
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,103
Conservative

1164
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,895
Puppet that you can wield

1165
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:27,295
And even if you are like an Alex Jones listener and you go check the writer store you'll see the headline larger the

1166
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:33,695
Van life software Mogul John McAfee dies in Spain by Suicide lawyer say

1167
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,999
Lawyer says why would you be like

1168
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,535
Are reporting that he died actor

1169
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,583
Yeah it is

1170
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,607
It's a

1171
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,423
And its profits used intention

1172
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,215
Because

1173
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,751
The false version

1174
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,799
Of the story or the presumptive

1175
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,591
Version of this story

1176
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,615
Sulfur Alex

1177
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:57,759
No it's one of their most powerful weapons controlling the narrative that they're telling you is the narrative they're selling

1178
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,039
That's just

1179
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:02,367
That's that's complete control over information

1180
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,903
You know that's just

1181
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,439
It's just Ironclad

1182
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,719
You can't escape

1183
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,279
So it's a real bummer

1184
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:15,679
Play Pick A lot of people probably were reflecting on some things when Max

1185
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,959
Skippy the news broke

1186
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,495
Certainly

1187
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,263
I was taking

1188
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,799
Got woke up

1189
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,079
And I had to tax

1190
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:22,847
My friend

1191
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,127
Telling me about the

1192
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:28,735
Snooze my immediate response was well I bet Hillary did this

1193
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,831
Baby

1194
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,855
Okay alright

1195
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,671
Jerry still out on

1196
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,231
Yeah I think some people

1197
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,255
Had some fun

1198
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:44,607
Remembering a time you said that he was going to eat his dick

1199
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,911
But slightly different

1200
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,679
Print I respond

1201
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,471
A lot of our interviews

1202
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,287
With him over the years were on YouTube

1203
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:56,127
Dozens of them got banded knocked off we never re-uploaded them

1204
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,175
Banned. Video

1205
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,455
This reminder

1206
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,759
John mackovic

Archive page

1208
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,831
Will post all the interviews we've done with him

1209
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,695
Interviews on the tail end of this

1210
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,487
Right now we're going shooting with him

1211
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,535
My first interview with him in 2012

1212
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,583
Archives

1213
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:23,775
Juice this thing

1214
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:29,151
She has told me that says Instagram posted a q

1215
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,175
Exploit this

1216
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,991
You need a new page

1217
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:33,759
We need to get

1218
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:40,159
Call Steve pieczenik and tell him to pretend he was on the

1219
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,023
Alright

1220
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,303
I'm waiting to find out

1221
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,839
Did Stevie peas is the one who Ark

1222
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,143
Orchestrated the assassination of McAfee

1223
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,447
Getting out of pocket

1224
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:55,007
Now my people in Catalonia

1225
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,567
Alright then

1226
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,639
So I like you already sort of

1227
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,663
Respected

1228
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,711
Anyone would

1229
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,247
Alex does have to make

1230
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,271
Take us about himself

1231
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
And

1232
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,575
You know it makes sense

1233
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,343
He's in a Big Sur

1234
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,135
Season right now about

1235
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,159
How queues under

1236
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:19,327
Sam Global if they're going to come for him and they're going to like kill his family and set him up for it or whatever we heard this like a week

1237
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,351
To go on his show

1238
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,655
He can't not take this up

1239
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,679
Opportunity to

1240
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,959
Reese press that thing

1241
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,519
Closing

1242
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,823
We we got a lot of threats a lot of attacks

1243
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,895
They're making a movie

1244
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,943
Journalist

1245
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,039
Clear to Infiniti

1246
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,319
I will never

1247
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,599
Suicide

1248
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,391
I will never kill myself

1249
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,047
Anything like that

1250
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,583
It is the Deep state

1251
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,399
Held accountable

1252
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,935
If anything happens to me

1253
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,215
Look at Bill Gates

1254
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:57,983
Hillary Clinton

1255
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,775
The Deep state

1256
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,335
They are the enemies of America Embassy vanity

1257
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,103
And they're the ones

1258
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,127
Longer

1259
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:04,895
Asurion

1260
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:11,807
Thunderbolt The Godfather says

1261
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,367
So

1262
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,415
Maybe this'll

1263
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,207
Copy copy

1264
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,535
I would I would prefer if every time he was like

1265
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:28,191
If they find me with a needle in my arm if he just got really specific into what kind of drugs and alcohol

1266
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:34,591
If they find me in a hotel surrounded by three empty bottles of Jack Daniels you know they killed me

1267
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,639
What is their fault 100%

1268
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:39,967
Kalama Jameson map

1269
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:43,807
The only actual content analysis that Alex

1270
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,855
Put out and it's his boilerplate as you can

1271
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:50,207
There's more information that's got to come out and Alex knows that one side information

1272
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:53,535
Available his job next to Impossible

1273
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,071
The only time to act

1274
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,351
What is immediately

1275
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,375
So you get this

1276
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,655
Arrest formulaic

1277
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,935
Meaningless insistence

1278
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:03,263
The Maccabee didn't kill himself based on a couple of years old

1279
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:04,799
Does doesn't

1280
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:05,567
Matter

1281
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:06,847
This

1282
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:07,615
Episode I think

1283
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,383
Is

1284
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,663
Is it still

1285
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:12,991
Salient maybe it's important to do because it's important to recognize

1286
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,015
Bees trick

1287
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,039
Yeah they cizik

1288
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,831
Hockey trick that Alex uses

1289
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,367
One thing that I find

1290
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,159
F****** excited

1291
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,207
And I haven't in a week

1292
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:26,303
During the day on Thursday at the end of the week shows

1293
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:31,935
I want to know how he incorporates that Q on it

1294
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,471
That's going to be tough

1295
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:39,871
Yeah cuz already said the qanon is a globalist intelligence operation

1296
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:42,943
Either ignored or or

1297
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,223
Maybe it's the globalist

1298
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:48,063
Taunting people on McAfee zenput could

1299
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:54,463
It could be that they put it on there to claim responsibility for his murder that way

1300
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,767
They put the Q on there so Alex

1301
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:57,791
It's knows that it's

1302
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:58,559
The globalist

1303
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,583
Who are doing

1304
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,887
You could be

1305
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,167
Could be an option for him

1306
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:06,495
Adjusting needle to see him thread

1307
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,311
I'm excited too

1308
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,127
I'm not really all that excited but I think I'll be interesting

1309
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:16,735
Maybe maybe actually we're just finally figuring out the real spelling of

1310
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,015
A John Malkovich

1311
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,551
Mqa Fe

1312
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:20,831
Maybe Indiana

1313
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,111
How to change it for the soft

1314
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:25,183
Maybe it's him admitting that he's cute

1315
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,231
I don't think

1316
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,047
So

1317
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:32,095
That's that's it for the McAfee

1318
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,631
Coverage

1319
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:34,655
Sort of

1320
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,679
Exactly what you did

1321
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,727
Expect ya little underwhelming

1322
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,007
Yeah

1323
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:43,359
Whatever it would be nice if there was 18 you know

1324
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,687
When the when the cement is this soft

1325
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:49,759
And you can really just pull off whatever you want I want one big

1326
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,063
Big swing you got to give us at least one big

1327
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,343
Swing of like

1328
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,975
A perpetrator or a group of people or or something other than just like

1329
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,999
The globalist

1330
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:04,095
Bill Gates and they wanted is crypto

1331
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,399
Story behind it that you've got

1332
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,215
You know you can't just be like all the media is lying

1333
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:15,359
You have to give me a better story adversely when you're lying about what the media says

1334
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:21,759
Barebones media coverage in order to justify your made-up

1335
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:26,367
Give me give me something give me like

1336
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:28,927
Did you know that Brian stelter was in Spain last

1337
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:32,767
PetSmart then then and then we're like I hide now I've got it yeah yeah

1338
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,047
Something like that

1339
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:36,095
Somebody was in Spain

1340
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,119
Around that

1341
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,911
Time is what you got to give me

1342
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,191
Yeah we good

1343
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:42,239
But no one was in Spain

1344
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,543
However I was in New York

1345
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:45,567
Okay

1346
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,383
This is flagra

1347
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,407
To podcast

1348
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:55,039
I don't know we're going to zap giant podcast

1349
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,343
But at the same time it's still like

1350
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,647
Joe Rogan

1351
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,183
Junior varsity

1352
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:03,231
You can't get on Rogan

1353
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:04,511
At least

1354
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:07,583
Not regular or not enough

1355
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,863
Right I'm so

1356
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:15,519
Yeah he can get on kill Tony I sure I can move the needle enough

1357
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:16,799
Service publicity tour

1358
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:21,407
Goes all the way to New York presumably either to do this podcast over to do this podcast and

1359
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,431
And something else

1360
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,735
Maybe at a deposition or something

1361
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,039
But yeah

1362
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:27,807
I just

1363
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,343
I don't know it

1364
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,135
It's really hard

1365
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:35,743
For me to cover these sorts of appearances that Alex does because it's like

1366
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,023
Alright

1367
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,815
I get that this is an attempted

1368
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,351
Right

1369
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,631
I don't think it's funny

1370
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,935
I think the subject matter sucks

1371
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,471
Yeah probably

1372
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,031
Somewhere on the bigoted Spectrum

1373
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,055
Yeah

1374
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,079
Whatever

1375
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:55,455
I oppose I oppose this joke I oppose the message

1376
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,503
The underlying this joke

1377
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,271
But

1378
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:01,855
I don't know like where where is the line of free speech

1379
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,415
It's a speech to me but

1380
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,951
You know YouTube should be able to

1381
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:09,023
Decide whether they wanted on the platform or not

1382
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,559
In terms of

1383
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,351
Our conversation to become

1384
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,399
Becomes a total mess when you're trying to

1385
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,167
To criticize

1386
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,215
Failed or

1387
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,263
If he attempts

1388
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,031
Sick humor

1389
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,591
Yeah I mean it's it's what

1390
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,615
We don't

1391
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:26,175
Cover shows that are just Bros talk

1392
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,455
All too often

1393
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:31,039
You know it doesn't sound interesting

1394
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:31,807
Really that

1395
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:36,415
That like newsworthy I suppose the exception is like when Alex is on Rogan

1396
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,695
And that's just kind of like

1397
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,719
Because it's event

1398
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,767
Level of

1399
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,047
Hand

1400
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,095
And because Alex really goes for it

1401
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,119
He does

1402
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:51,007
MN Dental like I was listening to this and I was like well okay we do cover

1403
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:55,615
Alex when he's on Rogan and or maybe this is something that we should

1404
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:57,663
He is

1405
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,431
Cast on this show

1406
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:02,527
If he's got something to say then I want to hear it

1407
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:06,367
If he doesn't have anything to say then he doesn't have much to say

1408
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:09,439
I want to play like the beginning this is how it starts

1409
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,719
Alex

1410
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,791
Spoiler alert comes out wearing tinfoil

1411
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:16,607
Around his arms like Brazzers

1412
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,375
Funny

1413
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:18,911
What's up everybody

1414
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,191
Two-player to iron

1415
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,495
We have a major

1416
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:24,287
Major

1417
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,335
Probably

1418
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:28,639
I come

1419
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,175
I realize how we figured

1420
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,735
Women's empowerment

1421
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:37,855
Woman in the

1422
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,647
B a i mean

1423
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,415
Incredibly

1424
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,183
Excited

1425
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,231
Everybody right now good morning

1426
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:43,999
Forgot

1427
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:50,399
Everybody Wonder Woman Wonder Woman and we have Wonder Woman

1428
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:57,311
Yeah

1429
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,079
Transphobic

1430
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:58,847
Joke

1431
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,687
It's a it's a load of nonsense

1432
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,247
I get

1433
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,015
This

1434
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,295
Sing

1435
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:10,367
Imagine right before they started recording

1436
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,951
Alex is like yours or no deal I'll put on a wig

1437
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,231
Tin foil Emma pretend

1438
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:15,999
Be wonderful

1439
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,815
That's an idea he had

1440
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,351
And then these guys were like

1441
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,655
Cuz that'll be great got to do that

1442
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,215
And you know what we're going to sell it

1443
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,239
Yasso a boy

1444
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
You can take that

1445
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:36,735
Icees

1446
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:09,247
Moments like this that just like really highlight to me how much of like a duplicitous game everyone is

1447
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:13,855
Play Alex's there to try to launder his extremist beliefs to a gullible audience

1448
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:16,415
He's also trying to bring more customers into his web

1449
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:19,999
Simultaneously these dudes know that if you get Alex

1450
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,791
To do some sational things that leads to

1451
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:23,071
Increase the tension in traffic

1452
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:27,423
You get him to run around without his shirt on you might end up going viral on Twitter

1453
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:32,031
Could be a me but I can do something that is a long-lasting reaction gif

1454
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,055
If meme or whatever

1455
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:35,871
That's better advertising than you could ever pay for

1456
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:38,175
Totally game

1457
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,711
Both of them are playing that is

1458
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,991
Promotional it in

1459
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,039
Are not in nature and

1460
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:47,647
It's just like okay I guess you're trading the possibility of having these moments

1461
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,415
4

1462
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,743
Willingly or unknowingly

1463
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:56,095
Selling your audience

1464
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,119
Cool

1465
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:03,007
I just can't believe that people would want to listen to the same social

1466
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:05,311
Show Dynamic that one would see you at a

1467
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,591
F****** Elementary School

1468
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:11,711
Alex might as well be eating

1469
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:16,063
It's the same f****** thing Alex's there

1470
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,623
To be humiliated for them to

1471
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:21,951
And then they laugh at him

1472
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,975
Stila Armenian

1473
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:26,303
So no great no no

1474
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,399
Even more integrated cuz I was about to talk about his dick

1475
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:36,543
Nice Packer but I have a large

1476
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:47,039
It looks like a grub worm with hair

1477
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:51,391
Do you like

1478
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,999
Really big

1479
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,543
Surprise them later on

1480
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,591
Yeah yeah

1481
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:11,871
Yeah

1482
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:17,247
This is not good riffic and it's

1483
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,271
Unbecoming

1484
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,575
Someone and Alex's

1485
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,367
Position to act like this

1486
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,415
Yeah

1487
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,975
Imagine this juxtaposed with him

1488
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:28,767
F****** praying on air

1489
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,327
I got a trick dick

1490
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:33,375
I mean it's so much like

1491
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,423
I immediately get

1492
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,959
Flashbacks to

1493
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,495
Like early on doing

1494
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,287
Stand up working with a

1495
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,567
Established

1496
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,359
Clean comic headliner

1497
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,919
And it's me and Young

1498
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:52,575
Female Comics you she and I are at about the same level of talent

1499
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,855
Then he starts telling

1500
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,415
Creepy ass f****** jokes right to her face

1501
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,439
That is so

1502
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:59,487
F***** up an inappropriate in your life

1503
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:05,887
This is not okay that is what I'm hearing Alex do right now that creepy as s***

1504
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:06,655
Himself

1505
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,191
One place as beating

1506
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,215
A pious

1507
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,519
God-fearing man and then

1508
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,799
When there's a

1509
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:14,591
Social situation where you can f***

1510
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,871
Can take advantage

1511
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:21,759
This goddamn is positioning in the pirate gates to f*** around as people and I hate it

1512
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:27,391
I think I think there's some of that and then there's some of it is just wanting

1513
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,671
To have people

1514
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,695
Think that you're in

1515
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,743
Interesting by kind of like oversharing

1516
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:36,351
I think that early on in my time doing stand-up I kind of was

1517
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:38,655
Susceptible to that and I certainly

1518
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,703
Would say more stuff on

1519
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,239
Stage then I would become

1520
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:47,615
Super Bowl with now extraversion of like

1521
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:53,503
Let it all out there man. That was partially because

1522
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,271
OU

1523
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,551
Idiocy

1524
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,111
Not taking myself

1525
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,647
Seriously enough

1526
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,183
To know that this wasn't

1527
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:03,231
Appropriate

1528
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,511
Alex's

1529
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,559
47 years old

1530
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,583
Doing this

1531
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,119
As a human

1532
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:15,519
Investigative truth-teller reporter for 27-year yes he thinks he's fighting the literal devil

1533
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:18,079
Government want to kill him

1534
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,127
Yep and you still like

1535
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,687
Acts like I did

1536
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:28,319
When I was in early dude, you're so stressed out you need an outlet

1537
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:31,391
And that outlet is telling to weird Bros

1538
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:34,975
While they mock you to your face that you've got a weird penis

1539
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:36,767
Perfect set

1540
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,815
I guess

1541
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,119
I mean it should I guess

1542
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,935
I guess if you know people want to

1543
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,471
Look at him as a

1544
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,263
I don't know

1545
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,311
Good thing that I

1546
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,079
They kept

1547
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,615
Flashing to

1548
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:52,639
Was

1549
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,943
These people

1550
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,479
Like these

1551
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,247
These hosts

1552
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,015
Flagrant

1553
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:58,783
And

1554
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,087
I would say even Rogan

1555
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,623
Probably is this way

1556
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,415
Tony Hinchcliffe

1557
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:08,255
They have an image of Alex as

1558
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:11,839
The drunk guy who talks about his dick

1559
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:13,631
Or yells about aliens

1560
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:14,655
Or like

1561
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:17,983
Tells them some weird subsection they've never heard of

1562
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,079
Okay I talked to

1563
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:25,407
I talked to the weather weapon guy you know like that

1564
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,711
BMX that they have of him

1565
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:30,783
And that's what they think his show is

1566
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:33,343
They haven't listened to his

1567
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,623
Actual show

1568
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,159
Probably not know

1569
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,695
They don't know

1570
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,231
And when Alex comes on

1571
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:39,999
These types of

1572
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,279
New shows

1573
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:43,839
Crying about fighting the devil right

1574
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,863
He's not like

1575
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,631
Yelling

1576
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:47,679
All his racist s***

1577
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:50,239
He's he's not doing what he does on his show

1578
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:51,519
If these people

1579
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:54,591
Actually listen to Alex's show they would either be bored

1580
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,615
Out of their mind

1581
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:58,175
Or they like wait a

1582
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:03,039
I'm not sure I want to be associated with this

1583
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,575
You know I don't know exist

1584
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,855
Years long

1585
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,391
Trojan horse quest

1586
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:10,207
Nice to get people to give their life to Jesus

1587
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,767
Yeah people like these hosts

1588
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:17,119
I want to be a part of this

1589
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:23,007
Bringing people to God I mean here's what I could see this I could see them all in their mind

1590
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,799
Because they are all that mean

1591
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:31,199
What were the names of the people that were dealing with are all traffickers in toxic masculinity

1592
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:31,967
Betrayed

1593
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:34,527
So I could definitely see them being like

1594
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:40,927
Oh you know is where we just played up on our show Alex just plays it up on his show and then real life easy

1595
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,231
This guy so it's okay for us to be cool with them

1596
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:46,047
Despite not realizing all of the f******

1597
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:48,351
Destruction that his show does

1598
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:52,703
Just because it's easier o'carrick Terron the show means it's okay

1599
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:57,055
For them to be like you know what we'll have them on our Sophie the real guy

1600
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,639
Except the reverse

1601
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:01,919
Yeah I was going to say

1602
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,967
Please do not reply.

1603
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:07,295
To make that argument

1604
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:10,623
That's what I'm what I'm saying I'm saying these people are worse

1605
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,903
Then you give them credit

1606
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:18,303
Argument is that it's a character and this is the real Alex if we're hanging out with bro

1607
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,327
Went down with about our deck

1608
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,119
Okay

1609
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,679
Then that person that you're broiling down with his a psycho

1610
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,959
Yes

1611
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:25,983
Yes

1612
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,519
Friends AR

1613
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:32,127
To mean you could absolutely see them saying something like you know the

1614
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:33,663
The Joker the crisis actor Joker

1615
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:34,431
Itsfunneh

1616
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:38,783
Because it's not Alex's fault it's people taking Alex to seriously

1617
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:41,343
Who went too far with all that Sandy Hooks up

1618
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,391
Alex is an Entertainer man

1619
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:48,255
If people take it too seriously it's not Alex's fault just like when people take

1620
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:51,327
Our stuff too seriously and it's like no we're making a joke

1621
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:55,679
Sure I talked I made a quote-unquote joke about raping a woman

1622
01:08:55,935 --> 01:09:00,543
But that was a joke I don't know why people are taking it to f****** seriously

1623
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,359
They even do I know

1624
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:09,759
Touch on that a little bit everybody takes me out of contacts at 10

1625
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:10,783
Boring argument

1626
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,807
Cuz I've listened

1627
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:12,831
200

1628
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,111
Hundreds of hours of Alex

1629
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:14,879
The show

1630
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:17,439
I think I got a pretty good sense of what's an aquifer

1631
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,463
Position in WhatsApp

1632
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,487
I'm f****** around

1633
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:22,559
And I don't take things that he's f****** around about all that

1634
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,327
But seriously

1635
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:25,631
I think that argument is

1636
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:32,287
No I I would say it's self-serving and delusional argument that helps

1637
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,311
See you go to sleep at night

1638
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,615
Because what you're actually doing is

1639
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,919
Exposing people to a f****** month

1640
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:41,759
Yeah you're helping make it easier for people to

1641
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:42,527
To accept it

1642
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:45,343
The bad arguments and the awful things that Alex

1643
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,879
Does believe yep

1644
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,415
Presenting him in a way that's

1645
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,951
Positive

1646
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:53,279
Sociable that is like

1647
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:55,839
And allowing him to

1648
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:56,863
Perpetuate things

1649
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,423
Explicitly

1650
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,703
True

1651
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,983
Winfield how to

1652
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:02,751
F****** podcast

1653
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:09,407
Please put Dracula

1654
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:14,783
But there's just things that like you allow him

1655
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,319
Perpetuate that aren't true

1656
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:19,391
They're talking about Colbert and like white Colbert isn't

1657
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:21,439
Funny anymore

1658
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,047
New York

1659
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:31,679
That's in the news that's almost unbelievable

1660
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,543
Who's that they get calls

1661
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:37,567
From Democrats

1662
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:42,687
My cousin

1663
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,759
And those guys know that corporate

1664
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,551
They are job their cons

1665
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,343
Pursuant to a

1666
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:50,879
New York senator

1667
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,487
F*** you man

1668
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,815
Okay Heather Schumer said I'm supposed

1669
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,863
Your summer joke

1670
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,399
Old baggage

1671
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,679
I control that

1672
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:09,311
This is entirely about Jimmy Kimmel discussing on are having spoken with Chuck Schumer about the afford

1673
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,079
Care Act

1674
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:12,127
Would you mind recall was a super important thing

1675
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,407
Jimmy because his son lives

1676
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,431
Congenital

1677
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:18,783
He was discussing on air

1678
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,575
About how the coverage

1679
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,599
Pre-existing condition

1680
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,623
The really matters

1681
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,903
In a very concrete weigh

1682
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,695
Campbell was taking issue with

1683
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,231
The Graham Cassidy bill was shot

1684
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:31,583
To get rid of parts at some of the provisions of the ACA any preparation he got some assist

1685
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,887
From Chuck Schumer's office about the bills.

1686
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:36,191
I want to take an external from

1687
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:41,823
2017 and embellished it now to the point where he's telling these dudes that Schumer is basically the booker and head writer

1688
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,359
For all late night shows

1689
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:47,711
This isn't joking around inside even in the territory of embellishment for a fat

1690
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:50,783
This is just a lie that Alex's specifically.

1691
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:51,807
Deploying to convince

1692
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,831
These people's audience

1693
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:56,415
That says going to all known crazy entertainment is just Secret

1694
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,463
Globalist program

1695
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,511
They're reacting to it with like

1696
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,047
Galloway

1697
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,839
That's almost unbelievable and you're like

1698
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:07,167
Why wouldn't you stop for one second and go

1699
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,727
That is unbelievable

1700
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:16,127
No I mean Alex even gave you an example for you to be like I know people in comedy

1701
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:18,175
Of course they too would say

1702
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:24,575
F*** you Chuck Schumer you're not funny. These show the show the two dudes Who are the

1703
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:28,159
The main host of it one of them used to be on MTV's Guy Code

1704
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:30,207
And the other one was on wild and out

1705
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:33,023
Comedians

1706
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:36,095
Yeah you know people in the industry

1707
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:42,495
Yes all of whom would do that regardless of whatever political affiliation you have a very very

1708
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:48,895
Aggressive about you shutting the f****** some exposure to some of the things that Alex

1709
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:51,199
Is being completely developed for this about

1710
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,783
It's just not worth it to have an actual conversation

1711
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,063
About it I don't think

1712
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,343
If you've been on

1713
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:02,975
Geico door wildin out or that kind of stuff there's no way you haven't interacted with

1714
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:04,511
People who literally work

1715
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:07,583
At SNL or Colbert or the like

1716
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:08,607
Like that

1717
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,655
There their they're

1718
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,447
They're everywhere yeah I mean that's

1719
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:14,239
And that means you know Chuck Schumer

1720
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,823
That means they're taking orders from Chuck Schumer

1721
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:23,711
Great I found largely listening to this to be like I have already said intolerable

1722
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,991
I found it

1723
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:25,759
So boring

1724
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,039
Just

1725
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,831
JustBats

1726
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,367
That's the kind of noise

1727
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:35,743
You put that for two and a half hours for about an hour

1728
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,767
But they're worth

1729
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,559
One really important

1730
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:39,327
Something

1731
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,095
They came up

1732
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:40,863
A couple times

1733
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:41,631
Who's in the first hour

1734
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,167
And this is

1735
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:45,215
Alex trying to formulate

1736
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:46,239
A way to

1737
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,775
To justify some of his

1738
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:49,567
I found this

1739
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,615
Really I really interesting we go

1740
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:53,663
Call Renaissance

1741
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:55,711
All the old

1742
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,503
We throw it out

1743
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,415
Nothing to do with rainbow Flags

1744
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,463
Just literally sitting there

1745
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,767
Total Renaissance

1746
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:09,791
To overthrow

1747
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:10,559
Entire thing

1748
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,583
How everybody

1749
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,631
Nothing let's get rid of

1750
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:14,911
Play some black people

1751
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,727
Mascot it

1752
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,543
The front

1753
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,847
Get rich

1754
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,127
I really like black

1755
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:26,943
Yeah do what I say I like black people

1756
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,367
Flags

1757
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:38,463
People are using rainbow flags and black people

1758
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,023
What's the contract

1759
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,047
Rainbow flag

1760
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:42,815
You're like dude

1761
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,095
That's not

1762
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,399
You're killing people but you using

1763
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:51,007
Good intentions

1764
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:57,663
Listen to countless hours of Alex's show and I honestly don't think that that's an idea that I've ever heard him

1765
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:00,479
You late like that really haven't either

1766
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,015
Attract

1767
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,063
Dewpoint and honestly I don't actually

1768
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,903
The disagree that much with how he's framing at now I think he's

1769
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:14,303
Well I mean you to see Nancy Pelosi in the like in f****** yeah businesses

1770
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:16,095
Pay lip service

1771
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:18,911
Vista communities in meaningless ways in order to Garner Goodwill

1772
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:22,239
Directions might not be as supportive as those words

1773
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,775
Imply

1774
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,823
Rainbow flags and donations

1775
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:32,223
Insta Trump do not go together and yet somehow I think it happens a lot and it's a part of the shallowness of the nature of corporate

1776
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:37,087
Ouija corporations like people and all of a sudden they have a brand in a Persona to call today

1777
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,647
And part of that is trite social-media gesture

1778
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:40,927
And I think a lot of pee

1779
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:41,951
People see through that

1780
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:45,279
My framing Alex's opposition to things like a black pea

1781
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,327
People and rainbow flag this way

1782
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:51,679
I was just trying to hook the Audience by appealing to something that they could easily believe

1783
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:56,287
This could possibly be the belief that Alex has that everyone says races

1784
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:59,103
You know all those times Alex gets called a racist

1785
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:05,759
He's got to be because people are misrepresenting its stance against corporate use of black lives matter and rainbow flag Christ got2b

1786
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,551
Actually erases right

1787
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:10,367
That's what Alex wants the audience to think

1788
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:12,671
Because the reality is that Alex has a gigantic race

1789
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:14,975
And if the audience knows that going in

1790
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:17,023
They won't ever make it to the Infowars

1791
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:17,791
Store

1792
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,559
Trust me

1793
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,095
The difference in how Alex

1794
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:22,143
Response to a murder when the victim is black

1795
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:28,543
Or when the victim is white has nothing to do with corporate signal indo-aryans explicitly races

1796
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,311
Homophobe

1797
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,335
Baked it's transphobic

1798
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:33,151
He has those things right

1799
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,967
He's being allowed to launder this

1800
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:36,991
In a way that's a

1801
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:38,271
Do you want to not only the house

1802
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,295
But the audio

1803
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:41,599
And gives them away to be like

1804
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:43,903
Oh yeah everyone says Alex's races it's just

1805
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,927
He doesn't like

1806
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,719
If he doesn't like this

1807
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,487
Corporate

1808
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:49,791
It's saying we put a rainbow flag up during

1809
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:50,559
Pride month

1810
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,095
When you're a big

1811
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,631
Right are you doing or

1812
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:57,215
It's a valid criticism B

1813
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,751
Trying to be used as a

1814
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:00,287
The Shield

1815
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:02,591
Bigotry

1816
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,895
I mean that's the feedback

1817
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,943
That's the feedback loop of

1818
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,223
Conspiracy theorist

1819
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:08,991
And

1820
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,783
Shity politicians is that

1821
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,575
When the system is so

1822
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,623
Corrupt and so transparent bulge

1823
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:17,951
It is easy for you to take a potshot like this

1824
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:18,719
And get

1825
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:19,743
People towards

1826
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:22,047
More conspiratorial Aiden bulshit

1827
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,327
Because obviously

1828
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:25,375
Nancy Pelosi is f****** lying

1829
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,143
That's not

1830
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:30,751
Hard to jump to it don't the miniature version of how Alex's

1831
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:33,055
Opposition to the Iraq War

1832
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:35,359
Can trick you into thinking they key is an ally

1833
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:39,199
And then you probably logically on the same pages and then corrupt

1834
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:40,991
Shallow assholes

1835
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:43,551
Use that conspiracy theory to get elected

1836
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:44,575
When they corrupt

1837
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,855
To the government and make

1838
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:48,671
One less functional than it was before then York

1839
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:50,719
Conspiracy theories get even stronger

1840
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:53,023
Because the government is so obviously corrupt

1841
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:56,351
Antique reset feedback loop of Destruction

1842
01:17:56,863 --> 01:18:02,239
It were possible mean I have said this so many times but the greatest weapon that the Democrats have against the

1843
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:04,031
Republican Party

1844
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,055
A governing effect

1845
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,335
Ugly and I cannot do

1846
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:07,615
They simply cannot

1847
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,943
And that's why we get into these situations

1848
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:12,735
I think that even if

1849
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:15,039
The Democrats wanted to or had

1850
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,319
A unified Wheels

1851
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,343
The governor in WoW

1852
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:21,183
I don't think it's possible that probably true it's probably too late now

1853
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:23,743
Probably way too late now

1854
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,279
Everyone can just do their best

1855
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:31,679
Man they really had a they really had a shot 2008 to 2010 if they

1856
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,703
Get together

1857
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,007
It so much

1858
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,799
Everybody had a

1859
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:42,175
Right-wing terrorism problem

1860
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,199
I wasn't going to stop

1861
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:45,759
I just

1862
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,807
I grow weary

1863
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,087
View

1864
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,367
Laundering

1865
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,135
Attempt to Valley

1866
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:53,183
And I just

1867
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,999
I don't I don't think people don't have the right

1868
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:56,767
To do it

1869
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:59,071
Sure I don't think people are

1870
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,351
You know

1871
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:01,375
Should be

1872
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,399
Band

1873
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:04,447
I don't know I mean it's the platform

1874
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:05,471
Choice they can do whatever the

1875
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:06,495
F*** they want sure

1876
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,031
I don't I don't

1877
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:08,799
Think of it

1878
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,615
And I don't think they should be arrested or

1879
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,895
Anything for this

1880
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:13,919
But

1881
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:17,247
I wish people would consider a little bit more what they're doing

1882
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,271
I wish

1883
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,039
Fit like

1884
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,319
If

1885
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,343
These guys

1886
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:23,135
Want to have Alex Jones

1887
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,671
On their show

1888
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:27,487
I would like them to ask about the devil

1889
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:29,279
I would like to ask

1890
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,047
About Lake

1891
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,327
Valid criticism

1892
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:33,631
About him as opposed to allowing him

1893
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:34,911
To present his

1894
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:35,679
Very

1895
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:38,239
Very clear racism has opposite

1896
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,519
Corporate signal

1897
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,847
Right I would like it if they

1898
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:46,431
You know this is a rare opportunity where you have Alex

1899
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,455
Is there a UK

1900
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,223
Can ask him

1901
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,015
Digging question

1902
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,551
Instead

1903
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,623
Just allow him to

1904
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:56,415
To poke your audience

1905
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:58,463
There's there's really only

1906
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,743
At this point

1907
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,511
The bar itself

1908
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:04,095
So there's only two things that happen if you have Alex

1909
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,631
Jones on it's obviously you're right

1910
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,167
You have

1911
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:08,959
Either the option to

1912
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,519
F****** eviscerate him

1913
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,311
And then you will not be

1914
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:15,360
On his level you will be over the bar

1915
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,152
You do this

1916
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:19,456
In which case you are under the bar right now

1917
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:20,224
Next to Alex

1918
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,760
I have no sympathy

1919
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:22,784
4 people

1920
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:30,208
Uutern flagrant-2 into Infowars in my mind like I have no

1921
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:31,232
Continue is people

1922
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:33,024
You should f****** stop

1923
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,608
And if you don't get that if you don't make a change towards at

1924
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:37,888
Then f*** off forever

1925
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,424
You're just Infowars

1926
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,472
Yeah I think I think we have

1927
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,496
Probably

1928
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:44,032
A very unique

1929
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,056
Perspective

1930
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,336
And I don't mean unique in

1931
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,640
Like necessarily an overly positive way but

1932
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:51,200
A perspective that other people don't have because we folks

1933
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:51,968
It's so much on Alec

1934
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:53,760
Text Joshua

1935
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:57,600
I think that we have enough of an awareness of what this dude does

1936
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:58,880
And what he's up to

1937
01:20:59,136 --> 01:20:59,904
His history

1938
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,184
The way he lies

1939
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,208
That position

1940
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:04,000
SimCity actually has

1941
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:06,560
People who

1942
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:08,608
Would choose to associate with him

1943
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,680
It's your right to

1944
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:13,472
Sure but we know

1945
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,520
Is it that you are him

1946
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,568
I don't give a fuk

1947
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:24,224
About Joe Rogan or Tim Dillon or these fox or any of these people

1948
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:29,088
Alex Jones forever Dior at the rally

1949
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:33,184
I get maybe you feel like you're not but if you stay at that rally

1950
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:33,952
Get Susan.

1951
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:36,512
A second time

1952
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,304
I mean I guess

1953
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,120
It's probably boost a probably boost numbers

1954
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,144
It probably helps

1955
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:49,056
With traffic and these guys have a bunch of heads on their show hope their sponsors don't dislike

1956
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:49,824
Alex being on

1957
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:53,408
It's okay if you destroy the world if your listeners go up

1958
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,176
It's fine

1959
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:55,712
Now it's the trade-off

1960
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,296
I just

1961
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,576
Don't understand

1962
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:02,112
Being this your response

1963
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,136
Ansible with

1964
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,160
Present

1965
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,976
Yeah that's that's really what it

1966
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,560
It really comes down to like a part of you just

1967
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,840
Breaks down

1968
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:12,608
Discount like

1969
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,400
Do you guys just not care

1970
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:18,240
Like is that really it you just don't give a s***

1971
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:21,056
I mean it feels like that's got to be the most

1972
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:22,336
Simple a

1973
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:28,736
Explanation about your show you don't care about the people who listen and you don't care about what happens because

1974
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:30,528
That's what you're telling me

1975
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,064
When you have Alex Jones on

1976
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,344
Like I mean like

1977
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,880
Here we have

1978
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:36,416
A completely

1979
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:37,440
Dissonant

1980
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,464
Presentation

1981
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,280
A week ago on his show

1982
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:44,096
Alex is talking about how we're all dead

1983
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:53,312
Yes you are getting old lady he's talking about they're going to kill everybody

1984
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,872
I got to stand and fight against

1985
01:22:56,128 --> 01:23:02,016
I promise you I will take everything in my my ability or fake crying

1986
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:07,648
The week is a New York wearing a wig

1987
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:09,696
Great

1988
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:12,000
What are you doing what are

1989
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:14,048
Any of us

1990
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:16,096
Brutal

1991
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:16,864
What's comes back

1992
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:18,656
And tries to present Mac

1993
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,936
Cathy's death is a

1994
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:21,216
Murder which can only

1995
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:24,800
Only serve to incite his audience

1996
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,080
Nonsensical

1997
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,872
That's just so f***** up

1998
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:31,968
It's so it's so f***** up how easy it is to

1999
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,784
Jangle the keys of like

2000
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:36,576
A f****** performer

2001
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:40,160
In front of these idiots and then they'll just be like let's talk about dick

2002
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,184
6 / 2 hours

2003
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:46,816
Baby game baby I do I watched most of the first one

2004
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:47,840
And it was not

2005
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,632
In-depth or interesting

2006
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:52,192
I watch the first hour of this one

2007
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,216
Before I turned it off

2008
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:55,776
Yeah I am the only thing I found interesting really

2009
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:59,360
Was this presentation of Alex's racism as being opposed to

2010
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:01,408
Corporate

2011
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,432
Yeah

2012
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:04,992
I don't know I guess I

2013
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,528
I could have listened to the rest of it

2014
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:11,136
Yeah I mean it can't if it weren't so

2015
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:13,696
Reasonable to assume that they are

2016
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,976
Corrupt lying piece

2017
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:15,744
Pieces of s***

2018
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:18,304
I think it would be harder to launder

2019
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:22,400
You are a racism behind see look at those corrupt line pieces of s***

2020
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:25,472
I wouldn't you know I would like it if this was actually a long game

2021
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:26,496
It's not

2022
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:28,544
But they were trying to Lowell Alex

2023
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,080
Send you a false sense of security

2024
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:32,128
You been in the last half-hour where they

2025
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:34,944
Just f****** nailed it

2026
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:40,576
Anyway anyway

2027
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:45,184
Somewhat excited to see how Alex tries to incorporate that Q from John mcatee zinsser
