1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Hey buddy

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,960
This is podcast

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,008
Do beverages

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,032
Talk a little bit

5
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:12,800
About Alex

6
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:18,176
Coming in with a little introduction for a little Minnesota today

7
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:22,016
What we've got for you is excerpt that we did on Monday night

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:25,856
With the rest of the episode of decided

9
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,136
To chop off a bunch

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,672
Cuz

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,232
Tried to cover a little bit of Alex Jones is rhetoric

12
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,256
Viva viva

13
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,536
Parkland shooting

14
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,352
And what it turned into was kind of a repetitive

15
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:41,728
I didn't I didn't feel like that at the end of the day when I look back at it but it

16
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:42,496
How much does

17
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:43,520
Conversation

18
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,056
The larger country

19
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,080
Nation of the world

20
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,640
And I felt like we were just retread

21
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,712
Old territory that was gone over over and over and over again

22
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,992
About how I

23
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:53,760
Alex Jones

24
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Then tragedy

25
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:57,856
Situations

26
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,672
We talked a little bit about

27
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,696
The

28
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,232
Patient with YouTube

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
Applying to Alex's

30
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
Channel

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,216
And already when we recorded it on Monday and now

32
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,032
Here on Wednesday

33
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,568
Evolved

34
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,592
To the point where I think

35
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,616
We have a different point

36
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,384
That we'd like to make

37
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,200
Which hopefully we'll talk about 4

38
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,480
Next episode

39
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,552
From all that there was a piece

40
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,344
What we cover that

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
I think is very

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,648
And I think it is relevant

43
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,416
In relation

44
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,952
Shooting

45
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,976
I'm suffice

46
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,744
How to say Alex

47
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,536
Acting way out of line

48
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
That

49
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:40,864
The victim

50
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,912
We just got in and I was very standard for him

51
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,472
He's throwing around rhetoric about

52
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,008
This is the globalist

53
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,568
Just hoping he says every time

54
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,152
Feels a little bit cornered and sales have dipped a little bit icy

55
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,712
It's kind of

56
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,552
That's a lot of the stuff that we covered it

57
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,320
Beginning

58
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,600
Episode

59
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,440
Talk about a very bizarre

60
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,256
That happens the day after the shooting

61
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,792
Marjorie

62
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
Douglas

63
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,888
It's cool and that was that Alex Jones

64
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
Students

65
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,984
Gentleman by the name of Jalen Martin

66
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,520
I on the show

67
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,312
And

68
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,616
That is something that is worth looking at

69
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
Daiso

70
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,736
That will be what we covered today I hope you all enjoyed

71
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
Can have a good one

72
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,600
I will be back tonight with another episode

73
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
There's a whole lot to go over Alex

74
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,952
This world is falling

75
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,232
The part right in front of his eyes

76
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,816
Through all of it

77
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
The triumphs emphasizing episode

78
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,888
But I will do my best

79
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
Enjoyed

80
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,776
Holding

81
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,408
Alexandra Thurston color

82
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,600
We heard that Alex Jones reference

83
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,368
That

84
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,672
There was a kid from the

85
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,208
School on his show

86
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
Yeah

87
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,304
By the name of Jalen Martin

88
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,424
The internet has gone up in a flutter of beabull

89
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
The governor

90
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
Needs to protect him cuz

91
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
He's going to get killed

92
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,080
For the things that he has said

93
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,640
And then another side of the internet

94
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,224
He's not real

95
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,528
Or he wasn't a high school student there wasn't

96
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
At the school

97
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,856
All of them are pretty crazy

98
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
I was able to

99
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,464
Find the argument that he's not a high schooler

100
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,256
I posted a link to this

101
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,560
Website called sex

102
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
Cecc

103
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
Cedar Point

104
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,168
It's like a conservative

105
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,240
News blog of some sort

106
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,056
New should never be anywhere near the

107
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
Conservative conservative

108
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,872
Blog

109
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
Some sort

110
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,736
He was a writer or is the writer perhaps

111
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,808
But he wasn't

112
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,856
The high schooler but if you read his bio

113
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
Clearly

114
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
Vindicate

115
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,512
She's still in school and plans to go to college this fall

116
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,351
But interesting Lee his name is taken off the writers page

117
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,911
The other website

118
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:28,031
So use the Wayback machine cuz I wanted to see like if this was some internet

119
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:35,455
But I pulled up from August 23rd 2017 but with less articles

120
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,991
Cuz I hadn't been written at the time

121
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
I have the same bio and

122
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,831
You know the only thing that I wanted

123
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,855
Take away from it is

124
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,439
Jalen has been expanding his knowledge of the political world

125
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463
For nearly three years

126
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
Specifically since June 16th

127
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
2015

128
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,839
Husband

129
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:57,471
So he is at his libertarian and conservative views that were called

130
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:01,311
From studying the history of Barry Goldwater

131
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,431
And that's not wrong to have conservative views or anything like that it doesn't

132
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:10,015
Add some sort of a monster

133
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,575
Amazing already and Infowars guy

134
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
Yeah you're not upset

135
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
At at least

136
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
He's not there yet

137
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,839
He's a trump supporter who writes for a

138
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
Yeah

139
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
Eno

140
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,031
What are you going to do

141
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:37,919
When can you do that's how I feel about

142
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,223
Isabel

143
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
He has as much

144
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
License

145
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
To speak about his experience

146
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,391
Is literally anybody else in the world

147
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
He has every right

148
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,999
To do that wherever he wants to

149
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,303
Hey I feel as bad for him

150
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,095
As I do for the other

151
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,375
Sewer being assaulted

152
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
Attacked online

153
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,703
By the people saying he's not a high schooler

154
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,287
Confirm everything that's available everything I can see he is

155
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
He was a student at

156
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
School

157
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,895
The same crisis actor attack

158
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
Coming from the other side

159
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,479
And it makes me really sad

160
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,015
It make it bums me out

161
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
There's a further problem

162
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
Oh no

163
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,695
When you when you have that long pause that means

164
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:29,119
It's a pretty big problem I'm not going to be stoked about it a mi into the inner

165
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,935
Review and I'll get to the problem as it comes up

166
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:36,799
The first problem is that Alex Jones repeatedly says the name of the school drawing

167
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Which is

168
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,615
Even if you're going to misspeak one

169
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,223
But if you're going to consistently call it and majority Stoneman

170
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,807
You don't know if you don't have a grasp on the issue

171
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,391
Consistently saying the name of the school wrong

172
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
I'm not going to take your in-depth

173
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
Information with as much

174
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
You know

175
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,863
Credibility the research you don't know the name of the goddamn School

176
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Anyway

177
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
John Martin

178
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
A senior

179
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,495
Stoneman Douglas

180
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,799
High School North

181
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
Miami

182
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,711
But the context here

183
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,271
Is the background KHOU

184
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,111
Florida summer baseball tryouts

185
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,647
He's a top sports reporter

186
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
I hope they talk about the Xbox

187
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:34,143
Going on

188
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,447
Just like

189
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,287
The top

190
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,127
Animals

191
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,575
Wasn't God Runner

192
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,391
So what he's done already is

193
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
Jaylen Barker

194
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
Is Our Guest

195
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
Acting like he's going to go to him

196
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,791
Yeah right before he does

197
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
Set up

198
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,119
Did what he wants to do

199
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:05,887
And that is

200
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:11,263
He brings up this other Narrative of a mass shooting is already

201
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,543
False flag

202
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,359
He has no evidence of that

203
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:19,711
He's established

204
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:24,831
While also saying this you got the baseball aspect

205
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,695
But this reporter who is there who talked to that girl who we've already rest

206
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,487
Too sad that she ran in

207
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
The shooter

208
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
On the way out

209
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,631
So he's already contextualized where he wants this to go

210
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
If this is a subtle memory

211
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,983
This is a thing that you can do to try and get people

212
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
To remember things

213
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
Things differently

214
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:49,151
Even if it's like what investigators during an ethical when they're questioning saucepan

215
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
It's how you

216
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,735
Tell you frantic if you did this in court

217
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,575
Be there

218
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
Just like where

219
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
Just go into things and Shay

220
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,167
Get to Gail's Flags just for fun

221
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:18,335
No

222
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,151
This is Frank man

223
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
I was fake

224
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:27,295
Sometimes.

225
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,671
Reports say that I said no one shot that's a hoax they always put out

226
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,767
Blame the victim

227
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
No such statements

228
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,583
MSNBC

229
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
Other online

230
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
So

231
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,935
In this rambling introduction

232
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,703
To his

233
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,567
Oh s*** yeah

234
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
I did not expect that

235
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
Yeah it's weird

236
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,151
Alex

237
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
Introducing his gas

238
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,711
He is laid out

239
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,783
The stuff we've already talked about

240
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,831
CNN is going to lie about us

241
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:05,695
We are victims we were we are maligned by everybody and so is Trump

242
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255
Two longer

243
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
Too long of an introduction

244
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
Show

245
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:16,447
Joining us

246
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,455
Give him my condolences for any friends

247
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
Talk about white

248
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:38,719
Empathy for real my condolences now now is a great time

249
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
When you f***

250
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,535
That's unreal

251
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,191
I cannot hear that

252
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
Stuff

253
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,775
Really f****** bad stuff

254
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,359
The Secret Service

255
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
SWAT drill

256
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:03,295
I told you you know where ever talk to

257
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,319
Lone gunman

258
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,159
AKA Tim McVeigh AKA Lee Harvey Oswald

259
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,231
Hi. Did you know this

260
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,279
Alex

261
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:18,143
I'd like to start off with saying I don't know

262
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,191
Okay

263
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,519
Beginning of eclipse

264
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:29,919
Pea-size to set up to set up an AKA

265
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:33,247
Sing this video of a girl saying that she heard shots

266
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,063
When she was in the presence of the shooter

267
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:42,463
Rahmani Rambles through all this other b******* about how Infowars it lied about all the time and Las Vegas with us

268
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:48,607
Volkswagen we know all this information sources

269
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
Then

270
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
Give

271
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
One further punch

272
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:59,103
Did Lee Harvey Oswald and Timothy McVeigh

273
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
Are fake lone wolves

274
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:07,295
Cool Nikolas Cruz is exactly like

275
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,319
View

276
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
Is you

277
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,391
Who is a student there

278
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,927
To be my prop

279
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,743
I need someone from the inside

280
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:20,095
Who I can throw around with as much credibility is the end is doing

281
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,679
With these kids version of that

282
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,007
I need from you is I need you

283
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,055
To validate that there were multiple shooters

284
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
And Alex

285
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
I mean

286
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,247
You know in our episode about David Lynch

287
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
Let me put out on Monday

288
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,063
Episode

289
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,343
Alex Kapp

290
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,415
Badgering him cuz he wanted to talk about 9/11

291
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,695
He does the same thing

292
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
This kid

293
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,023
About wanting him to say that there are multiple shooter

294
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
I think it's a little bit different

295
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,423
Saying that to a grown man

296
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
Directed

297
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
Yeah

298
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,031
Mulholland Drive

299
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,359
Little bit different varied if

300
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,919
This is the making a murderer type s*** right here

301
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
It's it's

302
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,991
Like I told you the top of the episode

303
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
It's incredibly disgraceful

304
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,063
You have no idea how disgraceful

305
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,415
Before we get to that I had an interview with Alex old one

306
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
Lawyer press

307
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,511
To pick give me Council on whether or not to

308
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,095
I would want a lawyer who screams

309
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,143
Escrima lawyer

310
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,799
Are you in love you got to pass the bar I have not done that yet but

311
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,871
Pretty easy in Illinois

312
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
Think about his experience

313
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,967
Because

314
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,503
I think

315
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,807
You know it Bears hearing

316
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,391
And also I think that Alex is probably going to

317
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
To use it

318
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
Poorly

319
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,487
But I an explanation

320
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
4

321
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
He brings up

322
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,119
Fast forward again to later in the day we hear the fire alarm

323
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,471
Everyone was confused because we already had a fire drill today

324
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,287
Why was the fire alarm going off

325
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,895
So we all just went outside

326
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,455
Easter there for like one minute within one minute

327
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,879
Fire drill

328
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:23,231
Okay let's go

329
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,327
I mean there's like 3,000

330
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
School

331
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,959
So what then like the next three minutes there hasn't been like at least 50 cars there

332
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,823
Not anything serious until I see a helicopter

333
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,407
And within a few more minutes I ended up being a helicopter but

334
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,735
I got reports from people around me

335
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,551
This is a Code Black which means

336
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,343
Elearn

337
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,119
And you could cause mom cuz he didn't have his phone fire drill

338
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,311
There's an active shooter here

339
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,943
Can you like shut up

340
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,831
Teacher walked up

341
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:26,463
Play I believe it's probably accurate

342
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
Or real ale

343
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
Came out of nowhere

344
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
Noticed

345
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,447
You probably don't want people

346
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
Spreading

347
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,263
Erroneous information that hasn't been

348
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
Confirm

349
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,687
Don't don't spread that we don't know what the

350
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
The situation is

351
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
That seems like

352
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,783
The behavior of

353
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,831
Someone who's probably pretty stressed out

354
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,927
Doesn't know what's going on and is responsible for a large massive kid

355
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,999
Yeah like I don't think that to me doesn't sound like

356
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
Some sort of cover-up

357
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,327
And I don't think that your first thought is

358
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,631
Okay now you have 3,000 kids

359
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
Calling their parents

360
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
Can you have

361
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
3000 cars

362
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,727
On their way

363
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
And there's an act

364
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:15,615
Yeah you end up with real real bottleneck problem

365
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,455
I don't know exactly like

366
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,783
Hour and a half later than that they caught him

367
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:29,439
I didn't have a perimeter

368
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
Concern

369
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
What you going to do

370
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
What you going to do

371
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:44,031
I think that experience is probably sincere and real but I also think that

372
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,847
This teacher trying to enforce a cover-up of some

373
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,431
So also he Jalen goes on to say that

374
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,711
Secret Service

375
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,039
Had a drill at the school a month

376
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Prior

377
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,343
And that just doesn't make sense

378
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,623
Even if you're a conspiracy

379
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
Hear it

380
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,463
Cuz the Secret Service is Secret Service

381
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:08,863
The Secret Service is engaged protecting people like the president and other dignitaries

382
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
Treasury

383
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,983
Exactly it's not a it's not like a

384
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,055
Is shoot-'em-up kind of organization in the

385
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:23,455
You would want the 80s

386
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:29,855
ATF or DEA or something like that other combination of letters

387
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,391
Nothing to do with this sort of thing

388
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,183
To the idea that he's coming on

389
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:39,583
It's being that the Secret Service had a drill there a month prior leads me to believe that he got some faulty information about

390
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,655
Who was doing the drill who's the sheriff

391
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,935
Department Iowa

392
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,215
I believe it if it was

393
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:52,383
SWAT team even or something like that with the terrible world we live in now but the Secret Service aspect

394
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,663
Dove this is

395
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,479
I just heard him say

396
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,551
Tate's hottest codes

397
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
The thought of coats

398
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,927
Play Black that's a bomb I remember that

399
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,975
Experience

400
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,023
School

401
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,631
The shelter-in-place kind of drills

402
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,215
But I work at Groupon truck in office

403
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
A couple times

404
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,543
Shooter exercise

405
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:24,639
Cuz they were concerned that someone might be able to come in and shoot up the office

406
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,175
Station treat their workers better

407
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,503
Crossed my mind

408
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,855
Cross my mind while I was sitting in the office

409
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:38,463
Yeah if I go I hope I thought

410
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,999
Groupon

411
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,071
Next clip we get Alex

412
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,863
Guy doing his first volley

413
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,143
I'm trying to get Jalen

414
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,167
Disabled

415
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,215
I will see how it goes

416
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,751
Michelle Martin

417
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:55,871
Laying on a recap

418
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,431
The Secret Service had a drill there

419
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,503
I just other place I was asking you what are your friends

420
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,343
Wanted people you're talking to

421
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
Autistic

422
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:14,303
Thought

423
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,375
I was because you obviously had some serious

424
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:25,311
Cut-out like Sirhan Sirhan

425
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Behind

426
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,247
At what point

427
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,807
When using

428
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
Just like Vegas

429
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:48,095
We got new video on top the other videos where to play as well

430
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,911
Definition

431
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,215
Please elaborate

432
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,823
Yeah I talked to a guy who had a class with him

433
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
And he said he was just

434
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,895
Really weird

435
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:04,223
Did everything people told him to do it was like

436
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,527
I'm just waiting friend

437
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,343
Obviously mental issues

438
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,367
This guy

439
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
It was like

440
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,975
When you told me that I kind of like

441
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,839
Makes sense in a way you know

442
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,399
Spanish flag

443
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,959
Compliant like that

444
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,639
There's so many things that they could do just from someone telling them to do it

445
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:38,271
So he doesn't he doesn't say any doesn't confirm the multiple shooters

446
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
Was

447
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,599
Influenceable bread and so

448
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,647
Maybe Annie

449
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
Yeah

450
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,743
Like the best Alex can do with that is that

451
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,767
Supports that it's

452
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,047
Somebody controlling

453
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,631
As opposed to

454
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,239
Purely speculative

455
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:04,895
Someone might be able to tell him to do a thing

456
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,991
Turn around and he doesn't have any knowledge

457
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,831
Picture of the shooter he's basing this on something he heard from someone else

458
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,647
This is second hand information at Beth

459
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,440
Alex

460
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,976
Tried to get him to say

461
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,256
But there was multiple shooters

462
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,816
I'm sorry didn't get what you needed

463
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
So

464
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
He goes back to the well little bit later

465
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,288
Girl

466
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,848
At the high school

467
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:46,368
Interesting thing about that is

468
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:50,976
You know he dropped the gun and Blended in with all the crowd

469
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,816
I just went to Starbucks and it's right there

470
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:58,912
I would have been walking beside him

471
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,984
Literally on my street

472
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,360
And that's the thing about that is

473
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:17,856
I heard

474
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,744
There's no way because you would not

475
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,792
I know exactly how long it takes to walk

476
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,584
To my house

477
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:55,488
He is again asking him to just say that there were multiple shooters

478
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,840
But he goes just far enough that Alex brings him in for a war

479
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
Verbal hug

480
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,424
With the you know

481
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:11,104
The official story is just like everything else

482
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,152
But he knows that he needs more

483
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,944
He needs needs

484
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,992
I think there were multiple shooters

485
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,624
He needs it

486
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,024
A real quote as opposed to his endgame like a conditional

487
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,424
Heard from somebody else I heard that there was

488
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
Shooting later it is that

489
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:43,360
Then of course he couldn't have been anybody with a thinking Blake a functional brain would be able to tell

490
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:47,200
But that's just like if it's that simple

491
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,504
So Alex goes back to The Well of thirds

492
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,040
And

493
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,344
This is not good

494
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:58,976
It's going to really make you mad and also probably make you laugh a little bit at the end

495
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:05,376
But it's this is from one to the other

496
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
My friend

497
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,448
Then almost disconcerting ability

498
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
This

499
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,008
Is Alex Jones to a T

500
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
Badgering a child

501
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:16,640
In order to use them as a prop for their propaganda argument

502
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,712
That are based in reality and then you'll see what happens

503
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,296
Anyone in your own words the last break

504
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,880
We're getting in your friends coming out as well

505
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,952
Trying to finish

506
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:36,352
When you talk about people

507
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,936
Coming up

508
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:43,008
What specifically do your friends and classmates say they thought

509
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:50,944
Okay so after the school

510
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
This is

511
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:07,328
Third hand basically other girl girl in that video

512
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,376
Who ran into the shooter in the hallway

513
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,936
The girl told my friend who then told

514
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
Right

515
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,648
I know you're busy

516
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:35,488
You got in a windy spot on your walk around outside so we put you on hold of you 25 more minutes

517
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,304
I come back like that

How to get to a spot where the wind is not blowing up receiver

521
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:58,784
I'm going to get to Annex

523
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
Computers

524
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,768
That's all

525
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,608
That's all coming up we come back or not going to be here

526
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,144

527

But I can tell you right now that some of the top line we're going to FaceTime about

That will cover the news

561
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
So

562
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,736
At 1

563
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
F******

564
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,904
You don't do you realize that he had gotten as much out of it as he's going to get out of it

565
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,048
I know you got all right

566
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:23,168
To talk to her and may have also heard something I think at the same time

567
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:27,520
He may have said that they still heard shots I think I think

568
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
It's possible

569
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,360
Yeah there's wind and Alex is like

570
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,640
Sweet add break

571
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,920
Get the f*** out

572
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,944
Yeah that's it

573
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,624
It's embarrassing it's a disgusting lack of

574
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:48,768
Optics is what I want to say but this is the game this is

575
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,864
I mean it's the day after the shooting

576
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,216
He has a kid from the school on there badgers in to try and confirm

577
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,032
The multiple shooter narrative the he wants to push

578
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:04,128
And when he gets close enough he's like your phone's to Wendy I got to do a 2-minute

579
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
That's what he does

580
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,456
Does nonsense

581
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,296
He's an illiterate man who also is

582
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,368
Into a weird pill

583
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:20,512
Multi-level marketing scheme Ray desperately afraid he's going to lose because he got in bed

584
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,816
With the f****** people who were committing treason

585
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,424
Everyone gets

586
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:31,520
That's what ends up happening that's just the end result that's in the cautionary Tale

587
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:34,336
You know what I have to say to that

588
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,384
What you going to do

589
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,224
Immediately thought about

590
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:45,088
Whenever he did that a pivot is all that is is a more brazen

591
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,368
Cable news

592
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,440
It is

593
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,976
It is something that

594
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,280
Should be

595
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,144
That is disgraceful and embarrassing is that is

596
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,728
How much difference is there between

597
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
That

598
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:07,872
And CNN running all of this live coverage and then we're going to have to go to break

599
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,920
Well they're selling toothpaste

600
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:14,528
How much of a difference really is there

601
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,064
It's different

602
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,112
Because after that 2 minutes

603
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,904
He went to commercial

604
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,952
Oh

605
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
That's what's

606
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:30,400
I mean that's a little that's another level of disgrace

607
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,168
You're right

608
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:37,568
People disagree with you there be agreement that we have societal gotten into with entertainment

609
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,360
Is someone's got a fund

610
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,408
This entertainment that we water watch

611
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,736
And so we put up with these commercials cuz they pay for it

612
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,040
The entertainment in the shows that we want to watch

613
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:51,904
In the same way that you do I got to watch a little ad before YouTube video sometimes

614
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,464
Trailers in commercials at the movies

615
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,768
It's just the agreed-upon situation

616
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:01,120
Alex breaks the social contract by doing commercials in the middle of the show

617
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
If he does it

618
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,912
So

619
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,216
Brazenly with the like

620
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,240
I am going

621
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
2

622
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,800
I'm going to do something

623
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,080
Get some Bowman

624
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,128
Intensity and then

625
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,688
Can throw to the commercial cuz I know I put you in a suggest

626
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,712
Edible state right

627
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,504
That's what he's doing

628
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,040
I just don't think

629
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,320
At the end of the day

630
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,624
I don't think there's any

631
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,392
Reason

632
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,184
To engage with him

633
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
About

634
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
The

635
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,000
The stuff that he's doing right

636
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,328
I do I think that

637
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,608
Vintage

638
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,888
This is not

639
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,472
This is stopped being like

640
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
Awful

641
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,288
And this is now

642
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,568
Truly

643
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336
Pathetic

644
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,640
It's just

645
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,432
What are you

646
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:51,808
Doing what are you doing

647
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,696
Part of it that's like that

648
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,768
No

649
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:07,680
All right hope you all got something from the hope we learned a little bit

650
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,448
We saw

651
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,544
I'm very kind of the

652
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,336
The main goal for Alex

653
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,152
The primary goal of course

654
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,432
To say that there were multiple

655
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:19,968
You believe that

656
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,736
Be the case

657
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
The actual

658
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,344
That that is in service

659
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
Sing a nice hot

660
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
2 minutes

661
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
Sales pitch

662
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,696
And right before going

663
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,744
No this is

664
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
This is Alex

665
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,816
