1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damned important

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648

00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
MoneyGram

4
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,320

Sims 2 full episode

11
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,440
The beginnings of sound when she's doing some gardening or housework or whatever

12
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:39,840
I don't think she has the patience to listen to like two and a half hours of me

13
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:46,496
I don't know I don't know if I can recover

14
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,848
The big revelation

15
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:54,688
WhatsApp

16
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:00,576

00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
Love yourself

20
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
I mean there's

21
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,496
Comedian Don Friesen

22
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:22,592
And who doesn't look like me at all I've not met him

23
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
I almost did

24
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
You almost did

25
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:32,320
You always been so I don't think

26
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
Not sure I've ever

00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
Matt

28
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,416
A doppelganger I have really

29
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,720
20 cross ties and a huge beard

30
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,024
It's very it's rare that I run into

31
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,608
I don't know I remember when I was younger I was always that I always got

32
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,376
You look like

33
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
Everlast

34
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:53,056
I've never liked that old wheelbarrow

35
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
I don't see Will Ferrell

36
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,896

00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,176
From a number of people

38
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,968
I don't know I don't think I have

39
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,552
Dilated tongs

40
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:09,952
Have you ever seen that whenever he's got the big beard.

41
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:16,608
Sure.

42
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,704
If I needed to look like somebody

43
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,032
In the acting world I would prefer it be one of those character actor

44
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,872

Somebody

88
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,847
Reached out to and wanted to bestow

89
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,383
A policy wonk status

90
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663

Do you want our policy walk

93
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,767
These guys could do that by going to a website

94
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
Sports show

95
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
We would appreciate

96
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,447
Here's what I'm talkin about

97
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,263
Episode

98
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
On Tuesday

99
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,823
In order to be a

100
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,383
While we were recording

101
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,407
Some things happened

102
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,063
After we got there was a comment about how to vote for Democrats

103
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
Disloyal

104
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,135
Yeah well we were recording Trump went Hitler

105
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
Trump Hitler

106
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,511
He made some in the present tense made some comment

107
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Good

108
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:03,935
And then Rudy Giuliani came out and he clarified the Trump didn't mean that those Jews were disloyal to the United

109
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,543
But they were disloyal to Israel which actually makes a comment a bit worse

110
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:14,175
I'm confused positive

111
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:19,039
Also make matters worse was when clarified

112
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:24,927
If you are very very disloyal to Israel

113
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
Not great

114
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:31,327
7 underline dual loyalty to Israel as a classic drop of anti-Semitism at whites

115
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
Supremacist propaganda

116
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
States and has been for decades

117
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,239
It's very much in line with the worldview propagated by the protocols of the elders

118
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
Zion

119
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,311
Is dual loyalty accusation

120
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,359
Has been used to attack

121
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
The public figures

122
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,247
Pretty much forever to create the perception that there's no way that a jewish-american

123
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Possibly

124
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,807
Have America's actual entry

125
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:55,647
Because they'll always secretly be looking out for Israel number one

126
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,999
It's a truly insane thing to hear the president and one of his closest advisers and

127
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,791
Possibly still lawyer

128
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:09,215
Relationship

129
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,263
Particular

130
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,871
Really cares that much

131
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,663
Lowe's on Tuesday evening

132
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,199
Boarding

133
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:24,319
Trump tweeted a thank you to a very insane right-wing radio host

134
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,111
Who instead of trump

135
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:31,999
He's the best president for Israel in the history of the world and the Jewish people in Israel love him like he's the king of Israel

136
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:37,119
Like he's the second coming of God

137
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:41,471
The one at the end of the the big book that everybody loves so much that Bible one

138
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,263
Have you ever read that last book

139
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,591
Boy they really sure sounded

140
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:54,527
Feel like a weird pranks

141
00:08:54,783 --> 00:09:00,927
Since I was 12 years old but what if we f*** with them and make them think that the Antichrist is real

142
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,487
It's that strange

143
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,511
The dynamic

144
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,839
Play

145
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
I'll f****** do it for

146
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:14,239
So Trump repeated those comments that way now and rooted made about himself

147
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,287
To give them his stamp of approval which is

148
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,847
Pretty much what you'd expect from a malignant narcissist

149
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,151
Sister doesn't really care about what other people think or feel

150
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
Anything

151
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,039
So then later on Wednesday dropped decided it was time to release

152
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,903
Enterprise geigle he was going off on a ramble about how he was standing up

153
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
The China

154
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:37,279
I am in the middle of his comments he looked at the sky and said quote

155
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,631
Yep this is the sort of thing that you might be able to make an argument about it that he was

156
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
Just sent you the chosen one.

157
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:50,847
Looking up at the sky party plus

158
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:55,967
Real Jews look at him like he's the second coming of God it takes a very very f*****-up dynamic

159
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
Intuit

160
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,831
Doesn't exist outside of the context

161
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
The board

162
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,671
The day before

163
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,999
Eye of the truth

164
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:13,119
Is a profoundly f*****-up thing no matter what the surround

165
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,703
You doing it like wouldn't be f****** crazy

166
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,079
No in his defense this is the one thing that you said so far in this presidency that makes perfect sense

167
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
Because

168
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,943
Who the f*** else could get away with all this

169
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,527
Like at a certain point you have to start thinking

170
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:35,135
Either I'm playing with f****** house money or I am literally Harry Potter

171
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:41,791
I guess so I can that mean character shield around him he can't go to jail for committing a crime

172
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,959
Like nobody's doing anything

173
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,519
The entire world is going in his Direction

174
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,431
What do you say we visit

175
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
The human race

176
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,015
Exactly

177
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:08,415
0 people between the two of us logical extension

178
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,511
I could shoot someone on 5th Avenue

179
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,047
NovaCare

180
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
You never really thought like

181
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
What are the

182
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
Like side

183
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,215
If that I could say I'm the chosen one

184
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,239
I could

185
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:28,383
I'll be disloyal to Israel by having different political

186
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Nope

187
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:37,087
He can do anything

188
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,463
Well short of that

189
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,999
Don

190
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
That Quest

191
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,095
Per se

192
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
Thoughts

193
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
On these developments

194
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:54,751
I knew that there was going to be something of a response

195
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,335
Couldn't guess which way it was going to break

196
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,639
If I had to bet money on it

197
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
Before when I first saw that news

198
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Coming out

199
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,735
I would have thought like well

200
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,575
We just did an episode about how Trump said he wanted to buy Greenland

201
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
Mx4 stalex to defend

202
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
The idea of buying

203
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,719
So I kind of figured that okay

204
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,999
I'm just going to say this stuff Alex

205
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,071
A defendant is going to have to say that

206
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,143
Pastabilities hours

207
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Could have all of his

208
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,471
Religious feelings

209
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
And be like

210
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
We are gone

211
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,567
Too far

212
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,359
Pardon the expression,

213
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
Jesus moment

214
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
So we started the 20

215
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
To Hong Kong

216
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
Which is better

217
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,999
Reporting on the protest

218
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Austin Hong Kong

219
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,583
Some folks have asked about his position on that

220
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
Incoherent

221
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
Someone

222
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
He's in support of the protests

223
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,311
But there's

224
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,871
Mostly cuz he hates China

225
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,919
I guess if that's how you get there that's how you get there

226
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
This mentality of like

227
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
The West is now the

228
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,599
Kong is just us

229
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
See you there we go

230
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
And it's

231
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
Very strange

232
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
Not grappling with

233
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,559
If the situation outside of just China

234
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,887
He kind of thinks that everybody living in Hong Kong is white

235
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
Everybody

236
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
In China is

237
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,287
There's a feeling of that just based on the way he describes

238
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,359
Yeah

239
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:41,247
Actually takes

240
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
Their own way

241
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,575
The Westside

242
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,439
He has a supportive

243
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,023
Entry level

244
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,351
It is first clippy talks about how

245
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
He's going to cover the Spectre

246
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,775
He's got he's got another

247
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,103
Reporters

248
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,551
Hong Kong

249
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:21,951
First of all I love that name

250
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:27,071
Hundred percent forgot your third reporters others in this Blood

251
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,263
Hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops are threatening to invade

252
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
15 minutes

253
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,015
Cam

254
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
Within an hour

255
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,743
So we got troubles with the meme

256
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:02,911
Okay we'll get to that later

257
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
King allowed to post

258
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
Dank memes

259
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:10,335
Equivalencia

260
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,407
Presentations are on par with each other

261
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,503
Discussing woohoo today's gas

262
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
SAR

263
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:25,183
He has a name in there that might not immediately jump out to you but this is a person who it is very

264
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
Stop that

265
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
What is hibernation

266
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
Coming up

267
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
Support

268
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
Horsepower

269
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
As well I will be

270
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:51,807
Very exciting

271
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,623
So it makes them scientific name Jada frames

272
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,415
Doesn't ring a bell to you or

273
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,951
Some of our non-uk listen

274
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:03,839
But I'm probably is too well known here in the US

275
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
Be something that folks

276
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
Remember

277
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:09,727
If you were called back in 2017 Trump retweeted some little videos

278
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,519
Immigrant violence in Europe

279
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,543
With the explicit purpose

280
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,871
Generating about refugees

281
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
Beforeigners

282
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:22,271
Trump was widely and rightly criticised for promoting this message seeing is a traced back to the ultra-right wing

283
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
Just group Britain

284
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
First

285
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,135
At least one of these videos with sound

286
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,743
Jayda fransen is a member of Britain first and it was her tweets

287
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
The trumpet

288
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,815
I was really hoping she was

289
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
The lady who had

290
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,631
Tried to restore that

291
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
Jesus painting

292
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,447
Came out all weird remember that one

293
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,495
Craigslist

294
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,591
Although she might have been behind this

295
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,175
Was the deputy leader of Britain

296
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,479
Position

297
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:56,831
Explicitly called for the Islam to be banned in the UK

298
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,391
She took over as leader of Britain

299
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,463
First one

300
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
X 28 weeks

301
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
Some prison for religious harass

302
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,327
Every violated a court order Banning

303
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
Entering boss

304
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,167
Given his past history

305
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,959
Specific purpose of religious harassment

306
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:18,591
Right he went to jail and took over and pretended the golden was just taking a leave of absence

307
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,639
Since to deal with family issues

308
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,943
Madara cover-ups

309
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Incident

310
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:28,063
In 2017 golden was accused of sexual assault by an underage girl

311
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:33,439
The alleged attack took place at a hotel they went to after the girl that attended one of his Britain first

312
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,279
Which was centered around to cry and plague of Muslim child sex

313
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,607
Interesting

314
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:48,799
To make matters worse before remember of written first name g boards come forward and attested that Jada Franzen

315
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:53,407
Had explicitly tried to coerce this underage girl into not telling anyone

316
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
Golden had done

317
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,479
Morris was in the room

318
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
Jada was saying I can

319
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:04,671
Can give you everything you need platform I'll do this for you that for you she was offering her all sorts

320
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
I'm thinking this is

321
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,303
He went on to say that the fransen said that the girl need

322
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,607
Did the quote come back to the bar and let everyone

323
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
You with Paul so it looks like

324
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,591
So if you're keeping score it looks like it was the deputy of an organization

325
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:28,735
Who tried to cover up an instance with our leader of varmint out of abused

326
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,271
Around the issue of child abuse

327
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,087
I really normal Alex Jones

328
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
I really just don't say

329
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
These people care is

330
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,231
I think they're just

331
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
I think they're just making

332
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,071
In order to sell a whole different

333
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
Baby

334
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,631
I really

335
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,215
Case wide open it's too bad we don't have a ton of evidence

336
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,055
It was formerly a member of Tommy Robinson

337
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,615
English Defence League

338
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,175
Specifically out of targeting harassing an agitating against

339
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:03,039
38 weeks in prison for religious harassment

340
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,367
This is the result of her golden going to a Muslim

341
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,671
That's where they

342
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
Pedophile in Foreigner

343
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,767
According to the garden guardian

344
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,327
We're playing in the middle of the shop

345
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,119
Legitimately there just terrorize

346
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,447
The other account she was found guilty of

347
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,775
This troubling habits Britain

348
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
First has of showing up at the wrong

349
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,103
House to harass

350
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
G.i. showed up

351
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,687
She got the wrong address

352
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,479
She thought it was the address of a

353
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
Defendant

354
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,343
Lee's trial

355
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
Some unrelated person

356
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,183
Ivanti published a video of her showing up at

357
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
Release their address

358
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
She also showed up at the

359
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
The correct address

360
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
Another defense

361
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,375
But that guy wasn't home

362
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,959
And that didn't stop Jada from yelling and banging on the door anyway

363
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
The Descendants

364
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,519
Girlfriend was home

365
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,567
As were her three-year-old and 8

366
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,591
18 month old children

367
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,151
The woman testified the transit quote

368
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,943
Was making racist remarks

369
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:08,831
Dirty Muslim rapist come out we're not going to leave until you're gone come out dirty scumbag

370
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,183
It was directed at two men because she thought he was in there but he wasn't

371
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,975
It made me feel very anxious

372
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,023
I didn't go outside for a long time

373
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,327
I was also pregnant at the time but happen

374
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,863
And two days after I started

375
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
Bleed heavily and lost my daughter

376
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
Jesus

377
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,751
F****** cry she was stillborn I blame Jayda fransen

378
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:32,639
She also testified that his traumatized her child do still get scared when anyone knocks

379
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
On their door

380
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:38,783
It may 2019 France and was arrested again after she gave a speech in Belfast

381
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
That was the term

382
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319
Going to be a quote

383
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,111
General vehement attack

384
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,135
Back against the religious

385
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,231
Interspeech yelled about how there is no such thing as moderate Islam

386
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,791
Quote these people are begging for our blood

387
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,143
She told rally attendees it was time for the world to unite against

388
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,167
Quote the one

389
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:55,935
Common enemy

390
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,727
Essentially advocating

391
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
Extermination

392
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
Campaign against

393
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
I thought it was

394
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
Just her

395
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:05,663
I'm pretty sure she is our one, database bad bad person

396
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,783
Go to hell would be your hired

397
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
She is got a

398
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,831
A f****** resume

399
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
Christ

400
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,440
No Remorse for the possible consequences over words

401
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,488
She's a cold-blooded white supremacist

402
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
Islamophobe

403
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,304
And Alex Jones giving her platform

404
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,328
Is a very strong

405
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
The type of show he want

406
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
To be running

407
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,960
So that's not a great

408
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,544
Cool cool cool cool

409
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,360
Maybe he's not going to talk about Trump's b*******

410
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,664
What if he doesn't

411
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,736
What if you just goes the entire show and doesn't mention

412
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:44,320
This is Wednesday is it really makes the most sense for him to

413
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
I feel like that

414
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,904
Exactly what is a little Long Branch

415
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:56,608
0 narratives that include you calling yourself the chosen one so today is day off

416
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:01,984
Probably happened while Alex was on air or

417
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,336
He has no reason to know about that while he's alright the other stuff however

418
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,504
The Tweet disloyal

419
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,576
So Alex has got his people out in Hong Kong

420
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
So excited about

421
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,376
Other side of the world by the miracle

422
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:37,056
She talks to us

423
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:57,280
Okay well like I said

424
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,352
Saxons

425
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:05,472
I know that audio quality you can hear what you saying

426
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:09,568
There's literally no reason

427
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:16,480
That's crazy

428
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:20,832
So funny that is so funny like 20 seconds

429
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:26,208
Just f***

430
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,768
And then just be like

431
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,072
Oh god there a little bit

432
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,376
Soft

433
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,960
F*** it we'll get special reports out of it

434
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,288
Stop there and we'll put it out this interview that I'm so excited about

435
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,848
Live interview from around the world

436
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,480
I feel like she was doing a pretty good fine totally fine serviceable

437
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,296
Bad audio quality

438
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
Audible

439
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,392
Yeah you could hear what you say

440
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,488
You pretend the other cop

441
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,512
Producer

442
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,840
So talking to the Hong Kong

443
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
Who decides to jump

444
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
To the other

445
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
Topic of

446
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
Depression

447
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
Of course

448
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,704
Discount Bakula

449
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,008
Really don't like that we live in

450
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:22,272
Carpe donktum

451
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,416
In the world

452
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,744
Not at the White House

453
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,144
On Instagram

454
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:45,568
I've meme sites

455
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,872
With this new modern form of communication

456
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,176
Beyond the Emoji

457
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,016
Facebook.com

458
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
And within two hours

459
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,136
So we got it

460
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,416
Situation on our hands

461
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,208
First of all I love

462
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
I love just the obsession

463
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,304
Not

464
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,680
On this site

465
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:18,080
It does to me he was five years ago when it already started looking ridiculous when people were doing

466
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:22,944
Already gone over the past episode this b******* narrative about

467
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,504
Millions

468
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
Great

469
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
Presentation

470
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,672
Rampage

471
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,232
We we active on Facebook it has like 30,000

472
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
Unfollowers

473
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,816
Stuff I don't see any

474
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
Indication

475
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:44,192
We kicked off this idea that his meme worlds

476
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,496
Is somehow band on Facebook

477
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,776
And that's kind of Interest

478
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,920
To their version of

479
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,456
The story about it

480
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
Screenshots

481
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,528
Not being allowed

482
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,808
Up to

483
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Be posted

484
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,648
Now why would that be

485
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
McKay's

486
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,952
What is the issue

487
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,768
And I think I solved the problem

488
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,048
When Alex

489
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:10,816
Plays

490
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
Trailer

491
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,168
Carpe donktum website which is what all of these links

492
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:15,936
Went to

493
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,408
Purchase the flavor of it it's very well done

494
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
Process

495
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
Hollis

496
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:42,304
I want YouTube

497
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,120
Now if I were Facebook and I had a quality

498
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
Control

499
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,680
I would probably band

500
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,984
This link just for like

501
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,520
Stupid

502
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:58,432
We are going to make America great again

503
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:24,032
Well what are you conservative here and I'm sure

504
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:34,528
Democratic candidates for president

505
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,808
Are cheerleaders

506
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,184
That more of that coming up

507
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,000
So Alex cuts it off even before the

508
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:50,144
Like this is a clear copyright violation

509
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,472
You're allowed to do

510
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:04,992
The links that were blocked in the screenshots that Alex is promoting is proof of car

511
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,040
Carpe donktum censorship are all people

512
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,064
Make a post that trailer

513
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,208
Which is a copyrighted piece of work

514
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:20,096
I have no idea whether or not this is the reasoning that Facebook used for this trailer innovative

515
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,888
Ancient use of copyrighted material

516
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,216
It deflected it to clear theft of intellectual property

517
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,520
The reasoning for why this link

518
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,592
Link is blocked then there's every reason not to allow it

519
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
Like that makes

520
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:36,480
I have no idea it honestly is Facebook enforcer actual guidelines

521
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,296
Then Carpe donktum shouldn't be allowed to use their platform

522
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:43,392
Thanks their authenticity rule that requires under the name they use

523
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
Real life

524
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,464
My larger feeling isn't difference though

525
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,768
I want to main World in man that place sucks

526
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,096
It's just a basic ass work.

527
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,144
With a scroll of anti-left meme

528
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
Being posted

529
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:58,240
I looked through them and there's almost no engagement

530
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:03,360
The vast majority has 0 comments barely anything has over 100 likes

531
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,920
All it takes

532
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,456
Something on theirs is press the like button

533
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,736
Haysite announcement

534
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,528
Itself only has 132

535
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,344
All right so the problem that I'm

536
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,648
Is

537
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,672
Web pages

538
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,464
Suppressed by Google and

539
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
Facebook

540
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:32,032
Carpe donktum is super lucky that Facebook blocked one of his

541
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:35,616
Otherwise the only thing you have to go on Alex's show to talk about his

542
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:39,456
Is geocities ask me page it's getting D+ traffic

543
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:45,856
Nsls I'm going to say about Carpe donktum this representative of future internet communication whose Innovations

544
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,440
Basically a city Tumblr

545
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
I think

546
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,744
Got us the right is to Good Humor

547
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,560
So what

548
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,328
Heard that

549
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,864
Very clear

550
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,168
Violation

551
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
Too long

552
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:06,080
Use of Gangnam Style

553
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:12,992
Like I said I don't know this to be the case of babies trying to get copyright violated

554
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,320
Have some evidence that somebody was blocking it

555
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,392
This Griffin runs so strongly

556
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:22,976
Uworld by censorship and oppression

557
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,840
Essential to

558
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,912
So if you're going to do something and now it's your website

559
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,936
It makes sense

560
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,496
To do something that is illegal in it

561
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,288
Dip that you just ignore the fact

562
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:40,640
It is against copyright laws

563
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:44,736
To be taken down and then they can't even handle the fact that you know

564
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,040
I get too sensitive

565
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
Possible

566
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:51,136
Because that would be a wild

567
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,672
Assumption for me to make win

568
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,208
It could just be that he's stupid

569
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,024
Which is Occam's razor

570
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,192
I will consider it

571
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,728
When stupidity

572
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,776
Completely satisfied

573
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,848
But I kind of thought like

574
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,384
That's probably would have

575
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,432
Happened to your right

576
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,712
Start stalking

577
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,016
He kind of makes it clear that that is

578
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,624
Alert you to something something new

579
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,072
Unless I remove the

580
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,912
Share a link to meme world

581
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,752
That mean world.com

582
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,312
But if you try to

583
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,528
Send a message

584
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,064
So that's clear

585
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,368
That's clear

586
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,952
The copyright-infringing content

587
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,000
This is

588
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,792
This is

589
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,352
Issue this is not

590
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,680
Your website

591
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:14,592
It is a clear violation of size copyright

592
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,664
Facebook and Google and Twitter aren't censoring

593
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,736
Tell people that they're censoring

594
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
Gangnam Style

595
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,320
I think we're going to get

596
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,600
Before

597
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,904
Before they do like I said yeah

598
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,464
So Alex has another agreed

599
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
Narrative

600
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:35,840
About text censorship gone awry everything's terrible for Trump

601
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,120
And if

602
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,408
Because it's looking for strong women

603
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,576
This is a war on language

604
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:06,816
What's Alex's interpretation of a totally out of control

605
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:14,240
Doesn't run on by critical

606
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,264
What did you please

607
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,568
Actual issue

608
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:21,152
Because of course they like

609
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,968
Be some sort of a thing with like

610
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
Diesel

611
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:30,624
Brands people are so offended by the word

612
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,744
The problem actually

613
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,632
Is that the problem

614
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,168
Was there a presumed

615
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:43,936
Gender in

616
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,704
The Adit

617
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,264
Self which is against Facebook ad policy

618
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:51,360
Literally if you look at at Facebook advertising rules

619
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,944
The first thing you'll find is a link to the rules about personal ad

620
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,480
Quote

621
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:00,320
It must not contain content that assert or imply personal ads

622
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:04,416
This includes direct or indirect assertions are implications about a person

623
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:07,232
Race ethnic origin religion beliefs

624
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:11,584
Sexual orientation or practices disability medical condition

625
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,376
Including physical and mental health

626
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,680
Financial status membership in a trade

627
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,216
Criminal record or name

628
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,544
Do they allow like

629
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,568
We're looking

630
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:25,408
Fort Rucker

631
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,224
Hope you don't do that that is disallowed

632
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,552
Okay so you can't be like are you

633
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,624
Indian with a broken leg

634
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,392
Who is

635
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,184
Dabbling in Buddhism

636
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,464
Then you should be voting

637
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,048
Right right

638
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
Even if even though you can

639
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
Target

640
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,120
People

641
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,216
Still in the body of

642
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,240
The ad presume

643
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
Someone

644
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,800
Any characteristic falcon

645
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,360
Against their policy

646
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,640
This is really basic

647
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
Steamburg liver posted

648
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:02,528
The stupidest figuring out what they're doing

649
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:06,624
Whether or not

650
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,440
And this is where we get back to those theories that I was

651
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,464
Kicking around

652
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,816
Buckhead's

653
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
To complain about

654
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:20,192
Copycat meme page

655
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,984
Probably knowing that it was

656
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,520
Wasn't covered by fair use

657
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
Is Lincoln loud boom you got a free

658
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,408
These people who made this Trump ad

659
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,992
Post an ad on Facebook

660
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:39,136
Gender but they do it anyway

661
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,928
This s*** is really sad

662
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,464
He's dumb dumb fashion

663
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,488
Are so desperate

664
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,768
The paint themselves as victim

665
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,304
They have to paint

666
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,584
Weatherby

667
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,400
They're not being allowed to break the rules

668
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,680
It's some kind of enterprise

669
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,984
This is the only way that they can get attention

670
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,032
It's the only way they can pretend irrelevant

671
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,312
And it's honestly

672
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,104
Getting exhausting

673
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,664
Exhausting years ago the problem

674
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,944
Is that it's working

675
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,248
Stop working

676
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,064
And it seems like if you're stupid and

677
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
The cheater

678
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,856
Then

679
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,160
You are a course being oppressed

680
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:17,280
Because oh and you leaders are back

681
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:22,400
And nothing applies to you today

682
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,680
That might actually be

683
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
The explanation

684
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,664
Pulled over

685
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,968
Did you guys not know I can

686
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,784
Drive 90 miles an hour in the school zone

687
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,320
I'm allowed to

688
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:45,440
Travel

689
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,208
Cheater

690
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,816
In this next clip Carpe donktum was talking about the rules

691
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,840
Clothes for people posting

692
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:55,168
Stop on me and world

693
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,472
Heather is discussion

694
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,128
But it's not open for anyone to post

695
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:09,248
Why are obvious reasons

696
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,528
Posing

697
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,792
Nazi salute

698
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:26,144
Before he goes and shoots up school

699
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,216
Those are not there

700
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,752
Did you guys do

701
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,336
Good protective

702
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:37,664
Say something

703
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
Awesome

704
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,016
To always

705
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,832
Like anything that is

706
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,112
An indication that

707
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,928
People on your side of things

708
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,208
Seem to be causing

709
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,232
A lot of Iowa

710
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,768
Right it's good to do

711
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:56,096
Preemptively universally be like all those are actually just dance

712
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:03,008
Yeah yeah yeah

713
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
Website

714
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,056
I haven't seen any

715
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:08,640
We don't even have any regular people post

716
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,760
And it so it seems like there are far fewer people who are fake

717
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
Posting title

718
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,600
But there are a bunch of people who are regular people

719
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:22,720
Because I love Hitler

720
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:26,048
This is a test understanding the recognition on Alex

721
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,584
Parts like

722
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,864
A lot of

723
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:33,216
F****** love Hitler

724
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,872
That the media

725
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,712
Middleman seems to be the only people who are trying to

726
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,016
To keep the right from being

727
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,808
Fans are out right now

728
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,952
Like Trump is just literally going full Hitler just like I'm saying Hitler words I am enough you might as well

729
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,768
Stand up in front of everyone and go I am a Nazi

730
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,096
Everybody

731
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:04,960
And the media is trying to come up with any and all possible excuses

732
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,496
As for why he's not enough

733
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:11,872
Convoluted explanations

734
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,176
We all know

735
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,344
This show he has one

736
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,368
If you guys just

737
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,672
Pay me a bunch of money and buy a bunch of stuff

738
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,952
I will do less ads

739
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:31,072
Which I like that I like that almost like a recognition

740
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,096
I do too much

741
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:39,520
Stockholm Syndrome

742
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,616
Give me

743
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,152
I have been

744
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:49,760
Over and over and over again and if you just give me a few slightly

745
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,528
Play fewer times

746
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,064
It's it's very weird

747
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,344
But I respect

748
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,928
Another one that's not really an ad but of course

749
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
Like an ad for it

750
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,720
Infowars it's

751
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,536
Rambling about how great farmers

752
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,656
It includes this that I just think it's really fun

753
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,752
Americans aren't going to be bowling

754
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:17,152
Walking cruises at Hillary Clinton

755
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:20,736
We're never going to give up and all you've done is awaken the human spirit

756
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
Castro

757
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:35,840
Is the wheel on a boat there's a track on it.

758
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,400
It's sad that

759
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,216
I mean you can't even

760
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:41,984
Be bothered

761
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,776
To care about things he pretends

762
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,944
This is the Ludacris

763
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:57,344
Anybody in the control room

764
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,952
It'll take a 10 seconds

765
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:06,816
We can add it in let's just do another take another angle so doesn't look like

766
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:10,400
You f****** be professionals

767
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,216
Walking cruises the person

768
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:18,336
Lori Castro George Orwell data second

769
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,712
Pathetic pathetic level of professionalism

770
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:30,112
So Alex really wants to make sure that no one thinks that the Trump ad targeting

771
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,136
Strong women

772
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,440
Is an issue with Facebook

773
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,464
But everyone has stopped

774
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:38,560
He wants to make it seem like it's a gender issue

775
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,096
He's very desperate about that

776
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:40,864
And so

777
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,632
Here is a clip

778
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,047
Get you to take more

779
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,071
And more

780
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,351
And more the poison

781
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,143
Until you just finally

782
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:19,519
Just to come to the

783
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,799
I just love

784
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:26,431
I just love anyclip that ends like that

785
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:29,759
Budget misleading and stupid b*******

786
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,319
And then I'm going to throw it to the

787
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,415
That's unreal a guy who has

788
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,719
No real qualifications except

789
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,255
Edit tiny pieces of meat

790
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,095
We can't live in a world where

791
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,911
Years away from being on CNN

792
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,703
That's two years away from

793
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,727
Somebody

794
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:56,127
We might be too far down the road to avoid that

795
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,919
I will see

796
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,223
Carpenter

797
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,247
Dog

798
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,551
You want to go to the doctor

799
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,695
Going to be on

800
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,999
We all know her

801
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,583
If she doesn't show up

802
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,863
Oh no she could spot

803
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,703
Which is a good thing that is good this is the good news of this next clip

804
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,239
Although it does come with some

805
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,943
Your question so

806
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,087
Princeton on

807
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:44,767
Branson

808
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,535
Got online

809
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,583
We're just going to start a little bit

810
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,495
Finish this whistleblower

811
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,663
You imagined Edward Snowden going

812
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,455
To project Veritas

813
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,247
Seems weird

814
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:09,087
Voorhees again the the

815
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:15,487
Quote-unquote Google whistleblower who believes there's a Zionist occupation government

816
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,583
Run the media and all that s***

817
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,143
Do you think Alex asked him about that

818
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,983
Cuz he doesn't know what is he

819
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:32,127
Leave that part inside tire rack

820
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,663
What about that song

821
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,527
Clear hierarchy of

822
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,063
Who bumped

823
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
2

824
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,903
You know what I'm saying with Infowars guest I want a clear like

825
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,231
Olio called so he bumps this person

826
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:51,583
Heat bumps that leg

827
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,607
From the

828
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:58,751
Responsible for Leo

829
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,543
Alright okay he is

830
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,335
The cat's meow

831
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,151
Just things with his

832
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,431
Little hammer

833
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,735
Drop Voorhees for that

834
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,319
Get back

835
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,671
Voorhees

836
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,767
We talked about him on the last episode

837
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:24,351
And so when I heard he was on it was going to be on for the rest of the show

838
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,911
Yeah I was like I don't want to do this

839
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:30,239
No I don't want to go back

840
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,519
Save-A-Lot

841
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,799
Time on the show

842
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:37,151
They better get into actual evidence

843
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,431
Because

844
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,199
2 hours

845
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,783
Renegade program

846
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,063
Then I'll be

847
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:45,855
You would presume

848
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,135
Your evidence

849
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,695
I so I decided I would try it

850
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,719
Isolate

851
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,791
Any instances of actual evidence

852
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,327
That this guy is presenting

853
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,095
I'm going to go with

854
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,143
Freewheeling chat

855
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:58,911
God made

856
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,983
Alex tries to get into that a little bit but it's not really the

857
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:02,751
The predominant

858
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:07,359
It's really go on for another couple hours

859
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,151
It does

860
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:09,919
Jesus

861
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,735
And I'll tell you this

862
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,527
He does not seem to like

863
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,807
Zach Voorhees as a person

864
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:21,695
I think it's a little annoying

865
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:26,815
Triggers that like certain nerve comes out

866
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:29,119
Because he there's a couple points you can just tell he's like

867
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,447
F*** this guy

868
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:38,591
The Alex and Zach discussing an interview this is one of the pieces of evidence

869
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,615
First thing

870
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:43,199
The rabbit interview that Eric Schmidt did with Charlie Rose

871
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:46,271
We definitely not something we need a whistleblower for

872
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,575
In the interview

873
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,367
The town of answers

874
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:52,415
From a search on Google is a bug

875
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:57,791
If the search function was perfect dude always get the right answer for what you're looking for everytime

876
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,351
You clearly talkin about factual information

877
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,167
Who was president during The Louisiana Purchase

878
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,959
But Alex in Voorhees

879
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,775
Talking about applies to literally every

880
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,103
Probably not a fair

881
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
Assassin

882
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,175
What he was saying

883
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,455
Alex and Zach are both

884
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,527
It's possible

885
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,319
The first thing they bring up

886
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,599
And I

887
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,135
To be an incredibly weak

888
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,975
Especially for a guy whistleblower

889
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:33,375
You don't need to go to Charlie Rose interview available public information

890
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:34,911
It was on

891
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:39,007
Charlie Rose doesn't have the viewership that maybe

892
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:43,871
You know that talk shows of your older times.

893
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,407
Certainly.

894
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,967
So

895
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,759
Not going to find

896
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,831
Snowden just pointed to a clip of mad oh my God

897
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:59,231
We would have murdered him

898
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,535
Descended upon him like a

899
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,815
Rocks from a

900
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:06,399
Has the chance to

901
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:10,239
F****** Chris Hayes interview

902
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,079
Got to go

903
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:17,407
I know you guys think Larry King has been off the air for a while

904
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:20,223
Now but I've got some underground Larry King footage

905
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:24,319
The show you

906
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:28,159
The issue that I I ran into very quickly

907
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,463
Is the things that we know that

908
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,791
Has put into the world and believe

909
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,607
Take some of the things he's saying

910
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,655
That might just be like a bee

911
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,679
This is a stupid Alex

912
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,447
Jones

913
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
Territory

914
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,823
Anna's first one involves

915
00:48:54,527 --> 00:49:00,159
George Soros

916
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,719
The exhilaration

917
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,791
Concentration camp

918
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,839
And what's really ironic is that

919
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:10,143
If we criticize George Soros

920
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,959
Call

921
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:20,639
Criticizing

922
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,271
The reason Alex last there

923
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,807
Is because he knows that he

924
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,343
He's talkingshit

925
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,903
He's admitted as much on his second Rogan

926
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,487
But the idea

927
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,023
Not an answer question

928
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,303
He's talking

929
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,327
S*** it's redic

930
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,119
This is not okay

931
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:46,751
To hear from first of all Alex. But then a guy who believes and I'll f****** song

932
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,567
This isn't okay this is

933
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,871
True

934
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:55,967
It's not real

935
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,247
Isn't something video

936
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,015
Exist

937
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:00,575
They're talking about

938
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,855
And they're demonized

939
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,903
Soros in this way

940
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:07,743
Because of those other beliefs that they have

941
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,511
He's Jewish.

942
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,815
Don't react World

943
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:15,167
Mythology and ideology Voorhees

944
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:15,935
Scribes to

945
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,495
Alex Jones is allowing essentially

946
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,031
A complete

947
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,311
Somatic

948
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,615
Pageant

949
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:27,967
To happen on his show under the guise of the guy have in Google Documents

950
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,503
Prove XYZ

951
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,575
It's another example where they're

952
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,343
Cheating

953
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,367
Maybe

954
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,159
Explode

955
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,463
Because here's the thing

956
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,487
Claiming they're claiming

957
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,023
While they're making a

958
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:41,791
Anti-Semitic

959
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,351
Right

960
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,119
Bulshit

961
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,655
And we call them out

962
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,935
As being anti-semite

963
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,495
They're trying to suppress

964
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:51,775
And

965
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,055
We're the ones who are

966
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,407
Because we all work for George Soros to work

967
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,735
She's medic smear

968
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,295
Say me where to criticize Israel

969
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,575
Apartheid policy

970
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,111
And their destruction

971
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,511
Apartheid

972
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,791
Sure

973
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,559
So

974
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:18,399
Is true but somehow both of them are

975
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,423
Driving

976
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:26,079
Yep they're not great

977
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,871
But first we have to have another

978
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,175
Gigantic red flag

979
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,223
Be thrown onto the field

980
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,015
Buy one Sack or he's

981
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,039
Alex

982
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,319
Just f****** runs

983
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,343
He loves it

984
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:47,071
So yeah

985
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:50,911
Call Sawa

986
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,703
No

987
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,983
I would recommend

988
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:58,079
That's

989
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,735
Looks like Alex's

990
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:08,063
Has dropped off

991
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,879
Explicit

992
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:14,207
He supports the terrorist acts committed by Anders Breivik

993
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,743
Refers to a saint brevik

994
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,535
He's a race IQ guy

995
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:20,351
He's literally called homosexuality a birth defect

996
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,631
And argued that

997
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,911
Acceptance of LGBT

998
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,959
Take you right to the symptom of the civilization

999
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,727
Collapse

1000
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,519
He wrote on his blog quote

1001
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:33,919
For most Americans the issue isn't whether Jews have divided loyalties or not it's whether they I have any loyalty

1002
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,943
Five states at all

1003
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,991
So I'm sure he loves Trump's,

1004
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,855
He's advocating for horrendous war crimes against Palestinians saying quote

1005
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:48,255
The Israeli government must announce to the world that unilateral ceasefire balance by the deadly promise that for every Israeli soldier

1006
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,047
25 Palestinian police

1007
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:50,815
Lodi

1008
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,119
For every civilian 100 non-combat

1009
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,399
Palestinian adults will be

1010
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,167
Slain

1011
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,703
And for every child 1000

1012
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,471
And adults

1013
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,775
This s*** was posted on WorldNetDaily

1014
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:04,383
WorldNetDaily looks good

1015
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,663
Yeah I think they are

1016
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:15,391
Are there

1017
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,231
Complete monster

1018
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
His books

1019
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:24,607
Sjw it to tell you that at all

1020
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:28,447
Is Vox Dei wrote it and Milo yiannopoulos wrote the foreword for it which

1021
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:32,031
She did I can tell you sight on seeing if it's a load of worthless drivel

1022
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:38,687
But it's exactly the sort of book you'd probably expect to hear being promoted by a guy who believes the u.s. is under his

1023
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:42,015
How's the show's become completely in a

1024
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:48,415
Inundated I turn on an episode of fascism Advocates or Alex's lawyer

1025
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:52,255
It shows a complete disaster and if the diminishing sound quality is any

1026
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,047
Indication it's running on borrowed

1027
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:58,399
Like I think it feels like the wheels are completely fallen off the wagon

1028
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,007
As goes Infowars

1029
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:03,775
What they say

1030
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,127
As if

1031
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:08,895
America ghosts

1032
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,919
The right next to the knob

1033
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,271
Conspiracies about Soros

1034
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,087
Promotions of Vox days book

1035
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:19,135
Put forth by the sky

1036
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,159
Gibson exhaust

1037
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,719
On Alex's show which is irrelevant

1038
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,535
Piece of information about both of those things

1039
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,887
About forgetting

1040
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,167
Is that you and I are anti

1041
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:36,543
They go see now he's fine the guy who's like all of us

1042
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,079
Exterminate

1043
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,615
He's he's good

1044
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:45,503
Code

1045
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,271
Language

1046
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,367
Should be that's a little familiar.

1047
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:53,695
That's not coach Keith speaking tube

1048
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,487
He's signaling to anyway

1049
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,303
Google 48 years

1050
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:04,447
And and then the last everything was turning into clown world

1051
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:07,263
And so I decided that

1052
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,031
That

1053
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,567
Understanding how

1054
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:12,127
Marxist left I realized

1055
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,943
Understand that what they're doing is appalling

1056
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,223
And reprehensible

1057
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:16,991
Andaz

1058
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:25,695
Available on the internal public internet

1059
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:26,719
So

1060
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:32,863
Cool I've even know to hide all the Smoking Gun proof and I did grab it all up

1061
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,751
And Rachel Maddow

1062
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,519
Couldn't

1063
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,079
Him using a clown World there is sick

1064
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,615
Particular audio

1065
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,151
That is a hundred percent

1066
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:51,039
Like what's being done

1067
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:51,807
Probably make

1068
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,575
Make the same argument

1069
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,879
I'm stupid I wanted

1070
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,071
Supremacist

1071
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,143
Leaning

1072
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,935
Yeah you might as well

1073
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,239
2.024

1074
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:15,871
Only a select few prisoners know about it yet

1075
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:21,247
I forgot

1076
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,087
During this talk with Zach

1077
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:28,159
I love this so much

1078
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,695
In the span of 20 seconds

1079
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
Alex plug

1080
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,487
2 shirt

1081
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,791
Explicitly stole the design

1082
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,559
4

1083
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,631
T-shirts by the way

1084
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:39,167
That are limited edition

1085
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,447
The shirt inspire

1086
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:52,735
That shirt is almost sold out so it is the last run

1087
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,271
I'll be space force

1088
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,575
So those are both going

1089
00:56:57,087 --> 00:57:03,231
But he even says on there like isochrysis so we changed it today

1090
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:08,095
Because he thought

1091
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:15,263
Intellectual property theft

1092
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,287
Personal like that

1093
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:19,359
This whole thing is private property loves it so much

1094
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:23,967
You do it but that does make more sense why that is why the Donkey

1095
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:24,735
Would be

1096
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,759
Confused it is

1097
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,527
Stuff was being

1098
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,063
Center for copyright violation

1099
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:28,831
Because

1100
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:33,439
They violate copyright all the time

1101
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:36,511
The position that they could have ice

1102
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,815
Is like it Electro property doesn't

1103
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:43,423
Put in order for them to make that they need to change the number of the things

1104
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,751
They also need to stop complaining

1105
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,543
Their intellectual property theft

1106
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,127
Arrow out of their quiver

1107
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,175
I don't think they're willing to do that

1108
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,711
And so there internally in

1109
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
Inconsistent weather

1110
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:57,759
Eagle other

1111
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:00,063
People's intellectual property isn't real about

1112
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,343
It all day

1113
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,903
The rules do not apply to me

1114
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:04,671
Milk

1115
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:10,303
Short supply the people who I'm trying to

1116
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
Fair enough

1117
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:14,143
So we get back here to the evidence

1118
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,703
Zach is putting

1119
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:21,823
He has an odd some audio of the

1120
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,103
Susan

1121
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,407
Speech at

1122
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,455
And it doesn't

1123
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,479
Really demonstrate

1124
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:29,759
Close

1125
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,319
He's got that episode of Muppet

1126
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,927
The speech that he has essentially boils down to like

1127
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,695
We are going

1128
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,719
To not

1129
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,743
Put both

1130
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,047
Yeah

1131
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,839
Why would you want to company

1132
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,119
Just allow anything

1133
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,655
Brighten their news

1134
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,751
It doesn't prove

1135
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:51,775
You saying

1136
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,847
Brings out addict

1137
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:55,871
But he wants to highlight

1138
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,687
It's not good

1139
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,223
It's not a good

1140
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:05,599
Despite the darkness. That was released to project veritas

1141
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,975
They can go to Project veritas

1142
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,375
It's on page 5

1143
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:19,167
If there's this document here

1144
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,703
And if you look

1145
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,471
At

1146
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:24,031
The second example is

1147
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:29,407
Wikileaks confirms Hillary sold weapons to Isis then drops another bombshell breaking news

1148
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,687
Okay

1149
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:35,807
And

1150
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,855
And it's worse than anyone could have imagined

1151
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,559
What are the issues

1152
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:49,119
To be addressed here is it

1153
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:57,567
Serious pointing to one of the documents You released about Google to find what they can

1154
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,847
Consider to be faked

1155
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,639
Issue with Eric

1156
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:07,551
Example Google uses about stories involving the Wikileaks release

1157
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:10,879
Stories are ones that alleged that the email prove that Hillary was

1158
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,695
Brusque

1159
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,487
Getting to Benghazi and we talked about it a bit

1160
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,767
In the past

1161
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,559
For a second

1162
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,655
The particular issues

1163
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,679
About

1164
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,215
Hillary selling weapons

1165
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:27,775
Don't I care about Benghazi

1166
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,311
Because

1167
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,615
Because it's not relevant at all

1168
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:32,639
To the subject

1169
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,919
Did Zac is talkin about

1170
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,943
And the stock

1171
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,479
Google

1172
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:41,343
What team plays in this consideration is whether or not the stories about WikiLeaks

1173
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,903
Releasing an email to prove Hillary selling weapons to us

1174
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,695
Whether or not those are true

1175
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:52,863
That's the only determinant of factor about whether or not these stories are fake

1176
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:56,447
It could very well be that Hillary was selling weapons to Isis

1177
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,983
The Confederate States of America in

1178
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,007
Spider leadership

1179
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:03,615
0 bearing on whether or not a story about a Wikileaks email is true or not

1180
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,687
The only factor is whether or not such an email exist

1181
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:11,295
Because if it doesn't then all the stories that are saying it does are like

1182
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,063
And fake

1183
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,599
That email doesn't

1184
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:16,671
The closest WikiLeaks

1185
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:19,231
Do the theories out of email to 2014

1186
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:22,559
We're Hillary indicates an awareness that the Saudi government

1187
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,863
Headband clandestinely sporting

1188
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,143
And that we sold

1189
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,167
Saudi Arabia weapons

1190
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:34,079
She also explicitly notes in that two females that their support of Isis was something we needed to apply pressure on

1191
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,615
To get them to stop doing

1192
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:38,431
The entire rest of the email is about stopping Isis

1193
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:42,783
So I'm not sure of her intentionally selling weapons.

1194
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,575
Also Alex probably wants

1195
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:48,159
Deep conversation squarely way from Saudi Arabia let's talk about Trump

1196
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,695
Huge weapon sale

1197
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,231
Of light

1198
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,303
This is a classic case of a conservative media site

1199
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,839
Creating a sensational headline

1200
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:56,863
In this case

1201
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,679
Wikileaks confirms Hillary sold weapons to Isis

1202
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:02,239
Which is just picked up and repeated like a bad game

1203
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:04,287
Telephone and tell people repeating it

1204
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:08,383
No idea where they got the information from

1205
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:13,247
They claim that they read the Wikileaks emails

1206
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,039
If you ask them which email

1207
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,855
They're talking about for you

1208
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,879
They couldn't have

1209
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:22,207
Because no such email has ever been released by Wiki

1210
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:23,999
You can

1211
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:30,399
Make a pretty solid argument the during her time as Secretary of State a lot of places that eventually found

1212
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,679
Other ways of Angela's

1213
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,471
Through faster

1214
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,007
Mishandling or some combination

1215
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:35,775
Circumstance

1216
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:38,335
But that's not the claim is being made by these sites

1217
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,919
They're alleging that Hillary Clinton knowingly and intentionally sold weapons

1218
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,199
Isis which is a false

1219
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:43,967
Claim

1220
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:47,039
They're further thing that this would be leaks email proves their claim

1221
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,831
Which itself is another false

1222
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,927
This is why Google would use this as an example of a fake news story

1223
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:53,951
Because it is one

1224
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,279
Zack the whistleblowers so entrenched in the world of right-wing

1225
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:01,887
Conspiracy of propaganda has no idea what the actual conversation is

1226
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:07,519
He hasn't conclusion in mine so he has zero interest in the Nuance of why

1227
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,567
He's actually a really good case study

1228
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:15,711
He's very very dumb which is why you would find a ton of innocuous documents on Google share folder

1229
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:18,015
And then decided there was some kind of a Smoking Gun

1230
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:21,343
I've read a number of the document

1231
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,391
I don't have time to read all sounds

1232
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,183
And some of them

1233
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:25,951
Not even

1234
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,487
Relevant in any way

1235
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,839
Website that

1236
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,631
Broke down all of the document

1237
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,679
Assessment

1238
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,727
Perspective was

1239
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:40,287
A really good

1240
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,871
There's nothing in there

1241
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:46,943
And then here's the other issue about this

1242
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:49,759
Just make it up

1243
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:52,575
Something is there does matter about

1244
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,343
The situation

1245
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:57,183
When's that Voorhees release these documents a project veritas

1246
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:59,743
Neither he nor James O'Keefe took the time to

1247
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,791
To protect the identities of people who are mentioned

1248
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:02,559
The documents

1249
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:05,375
The personal information of people in email threads

1250
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,143
They didn't knock

1251
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,447
One entire folder marked partes

1252
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:12,031
Is mostly screenshots of Google employees social media accounts

1253
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,055
Exactly

1254
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,615
Where they say things that he feels indicates there's a comfort

1255
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,383
Citywide fire

1256
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,175
Leaving

1257
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:19,199
Stupid that

1258
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:23,295
Is that the individuals having opinions indicates that the entire company has

1259
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,855
This is a shameful Act of Docs

1260
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:29,951
The massive scale and it wouldn't be unreasonable

1261
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:30,975
People in danger

1262
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:34,047
Is that cuz arguing these people are trying to socialize

1263
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,095
Did your the country into a fraudulent election

1264
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:38,143
He's putting a gigantic Target on

1265
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:41,471
Decided to release the documents on

1266
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,543
No legitimate journalistic Outlet would ever do some

1267
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,103
It's really really f***** up

1268
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,639
Incredibly

1269
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:50,687
They can't do

1270
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,223
I guess

1271
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:57,343
Why did we write laws for all this s*** in retrospect

1272
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,135
Really really obviously

1273
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,439
It's okay

1274
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,207
But that's why

1275
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:04,767
Cuz it's so cartoonishly evil we would never have a

1276
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:11,679
F****** unreal I imagine

1277
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,215
Because it's not

1278
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:18,847
You know like your social media account is Poplar all of that

1279
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:27,295
That this is with malicious intent 100% the only only outcome you can really expect

1280
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,831
It is these people being it

1281
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:31,135
Harassed Breton

1282
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:33,183
Police threat if not an expert

1283
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:36,255
Send it doesn't demonstrate anything that helps

1284
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,023
Make that

1285
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,303
Text point

1286
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,119
Now I don't know what that just gives into

1287
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,935
But I don't know if he's too stupid to not understand that it doesn't make

1288
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:46,239
I think that's entirely possible

1289
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,519
It's possible that he

1290
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:50,335
Screenshots of these people

1291
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:53,151
Social media accounts in there in order to Target

1292
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,431
Right

1293
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,967
If project Veritas hat

1294
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:58,271
Even a kernel of respectability

1295
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,063
Then they would have gone in

1296
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,855
And wiped out people's name

1297
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:02,623
Before releasing

1298
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:05,951
Every reason to understand

1299
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,231
The possible ramp

1300
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,071
So considering they should be in jail a few

1301
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:11,839
Few times over

1302
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,167
This is

1303
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:17,215
The other piece of information that he's bringing

1304
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,239
To the table

1305
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,775
Hillary Isis

1306
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:22,079
Email example that then what are the document

1307
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:27,711
The pieces of evidence

1308
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,735
WikiLeaks

1309
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:32,063
Email proves Hillary new of

1310
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,367
Horse Sheriff that dresses up like

1311
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,415
Vigilante guitar

1312
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:40,511
Waifu

1313
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:41,791
And again

1314
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,351
Even if B conclusion

1315
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,655
Did Hillary did sell weapons

1316
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,751
Even if that's true

1317
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:56,383
These stories are still fake cuz it doesn't exist and just the stories are fake

1318
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:58,431
It doesn't matter what the conclusion

1319
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:01,759
Right

1320
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:05,599
We get to another piece of information

1321
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,623
Exact has

1322
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,903
Approve

1323
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:10,207
I really know this one is f****** into his

1324
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:10,975
Documents

1325
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,999
It's just some

1326
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,791
Little magic trick

1327
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:14,815
That you can do

1328
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:21,215
You can see that Hillary killed everybody

1329
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,263
God I hate these people so much

1330
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,055
And so

1331
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:31,199
Google was able to influence the election is that

1332
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:32,991
Were deleting

1333
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:37,343
The search prediction results when people were trying to find information about

1334
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:40,927
Hillary Clinton a lot of people

1335
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,231
Went on and you know

1336
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:47,839
We're searching for the Clinton Body Count because there's a lot of people

1337
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,887
In a related to Hillary

1338
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,751
Seems to be swayed the election

1339
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:58,591
Because Google didn't allow the autofill

1340
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,359
Suggestion

1341
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,895
What do you type in Hillary Clinton

1342
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:01,663
To be Hillary Clinton

1343
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:04,479
Right right out of the

1344
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,247
Suggestion

1345
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:08,575
I imagined or at least hope that Hillary Clint

1346
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:12,671
Big tits was removed from the auditor Good Feet

1347
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,439
Yeah

1348
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:17,535
You can search but it pulls up pictures of Ice-T

1349
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,815
Westside

1350
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:25,215
Generally speaking today

1351
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:25,983
It could be

1352
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,263
If you get way out of hand

1353
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:33,663
For Media company to hide negative stories about a particular political figure regardless of their political affiliation already

1354
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,967
I think that's something to keep in mind

1355
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:38,527
And if there's ever a serious example of that I would give it to

1356
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,319
I'm serious thought about what size

1357
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,343
I want to laid

1358
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,623
My cards on

1359
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,439
However this is not an instant

1360
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:49,023
I'm perfectly fine with a company like Google eliminating basic

1361
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,071
What's a dangerous conspiracy ship from there

1362
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,095
Suggested search bar

1363
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,631
It's not like you

1364
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:57,471
You can't just type in Clinton Body Count get a ton of f***** up stupid results

1365
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:58,751
It's a tissue typing

1366
01:08:59,007 --> 01:08:59,775
Quinton

1367
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:03,615
Google doesn't

1368
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:11,295
The Clinton Body Count meme started back in 1993

1369
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,343
Who died under suspicious circumstances

1370
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,903
With a heavy insinuation that they were bird

1371
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,951
0

1372
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,487
Just a desire to derail the

1373
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,791
Probably because she was a militia lunatic

1374
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:27,935
But declared herself the quote acting adjutant general of the unorganized militias of the United States

1375
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:28,959
Why is

1376
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:33,567
These people are winning over the rest

1377
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:40,479
Before March on Washington

1378
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:47,135
Sounds more like a revolution we all remember we all remember 1990s

1379
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,415
Got arrested

1380
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,695
Nope cuz didn't happen

1381
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:54,559
Citizen's arrest even the John Birch Society decried those plans

1382
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,351
Johnson

1383
01:09:56,607 --> 01:10:00,191
She also made the incredibly inaccurate film Waco the big lie

1384
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,983
Which I know I've heard Alex bring up

1385
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:02,751
Before

1386
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,287
It's full of misrepresentation

1387
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:07,359
Some of the footage has even been accused of being actually manipulated

1388
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:15,039
It's part of Timothy McVeigh Lovitz

1389
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,063
Come on

1390
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,855
Give me more of this lunacy

1391
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:22,719
Suspicious Clinton deaths to representative

1392
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,767
Who took the ball and ran with it

1393
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:25,791
Even adding a

1394
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:30,399
It should be pointed out that William dannemeyer though former represented

1395
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:32,191
Is it completely insane

1396
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:32,959
And shity person

1397
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:39,615
He wrote a post for take back all right to.org entitled quote now the government can legally kill Christians

1398
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,663
With your grandmother's Lee

1399
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,687
Costco Heritage

1400
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,479
Here's some choice

1401
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
Let's hear it

1402
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:52,159
Your US Government Can now legally kill Christians for the crime of worshipping Jesus Christ!

1403
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,463
To go through

1404
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:56,255
Who are Utah

1405
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,815
When you say your

1406
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:01,887
When you're constructing ascent

1407
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,423
Specifically one

1408
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,727
Don't start with your

1409
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,007
And then

1410
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,287
Run-on sentence

1411
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,055
It doesn't make any

1412
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:13,151
Next one!

1413
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,199
Novel let alone a blog post

1414
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:21,599
What about that

1415
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:30,303
Deception has been perpetrated on the American people by their own leaders

1416
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,727
Your government

1417
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:40,543
Suggesting you were talking to people now who are you talking to

1418
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:41,567
There I don't know

1419
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:42,591
Shift person

1420
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:49,247
Pictures of George h.w. Bush signed a law that forces the American people to be bound by a set of monsterous rules

1421
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,783
Who's called the noahide laws

1422
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:56,415
Rules that make the believe in Jesus Christ

1423
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,183
Exclamation

1424
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,975
Do we even have those

1425
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:01,535
If that word noahide in their worries

1426
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,071
Hold on to those okay

1427
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:09,215
The article explains that a bill called education Day USA which was

1428
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:09,983
Suspicious

1429
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:16,639
Weekly ad in language that recognizes birthday of Rabbi Menachem Mendel schneerson

1430
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:17,407
Peterson

1431
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,431
Stay With Me

1432
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,503
Hidden in that bill

1433
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,295
The head new laws that make it totally

1434
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,599
Forgot to kill Christian

1435
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:27,903
But of course

1436
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,927
That would never pass

1437
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:30,975
If it were voted on by the house

1438
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,047
I would

1439
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:34,815
Hope

1440
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,351
I think we're about to hear

1441
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,375
A very familiar story

1442
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:43,775
On the Davis resolution with

1443
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:44,543
Okay

1444
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:46,847
Amadeus resolution was passed

1445
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:47,871
Past and quotes

1446
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:53,759
The entire membership of the House of Representatives had already been dismissed

1447
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:55,039
Including the voting was over

1448
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,319
We could all go home

1449
01:12:56,575 --> 01:13:02,719
It was then after virtually all the members had left that the traitor is authors of this resolution brought it up for a vote on the house floor

1450
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:09,119
With only four

1451
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:13,215
So

1452
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:16,799
This bill eventually became Public Law 102 dashboard

1453
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:20,127
There's not a vote total recorded for it

1454
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:22,175
But that's just probably because it passed

1455
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:22,943
Without objection

1456
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:26,783
That doesn't mean that four people voted on it and they just said good enough

1457
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:30,111
I mean 41 the bill had 225 Echo spot

1458
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:33,695
So you'd assume that kind of Bill would never actually come to a vote

1459
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:40,351
They're only 435 members of the house if it belies 225 co-sponsors it's never not going to pass

1460
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:43,679
I don't understand what if there is a surprise twist

1461
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:47,775
Professional

1462
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:53,663
Right by our comes down to sex

1463
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,711
Congresspeople stunners

1464
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:01,599
How do I factor crazy Williams

1465
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:07,999
His argument is that because Rabbi schneerson organization follows the seven noahide laws

1466
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,791
And this resolution recognizes

1467
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:13,375
Call to the world to return to the ethics promoted by

1468
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:15,935
Like I should point out as a meaningless symbolic thing

1469
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,471
I'd be in their eyes language

1470
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:20,287
After us is now under these Jewish laws

1471
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,591
Punishment for breaking any of these laws

1472
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:23,359
What is the cap

1473
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:28,991
Another is that no historical Source exists that

1474
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,551
Contains an instance of a non-jew being executed

1475
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,831
Breaking noahide laws

1476
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,367
So it's kind of

1477
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,135
Stupid

1478
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,671
People just believe in

1479
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,951
I mean I know they do

1480
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,231
For sale just believe in

1481
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:44,607
In narrative magic that makes sense so long as magic

1482
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:47,679
Possibly

1483
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:49,983
The government could just

1484
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:53,567
Mass murder at William

1485
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,335
Right

1486
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,383
Or even if they did it

1487
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,663
One time

1488
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:02,783
Remember

1489
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:03,807
That was legal

1490
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:06,111
We're going to have to refill

1491
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:12,511
It's not like Congress would be like I would say that what William

1492
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:17,375
Should do is test his theory by killing a Christian for being Christian

1493
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:23,775
I've seen how that goes forever

1494
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:26,591
We're under noahide laws

1495
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:32,991
Understand he can't do it because of course

1496
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,575
Just needs people to kill him

1497
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:39,647
No he's already dying out

1498
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:44,511
Alright so if you read the 70s very similar to the ten

1499
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,303
And William's big beef stick

1500
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:48,863
Used to be that the Ten Commandments were written by God

1501
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,911
Where is the seven were written by human

1502
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:57,567
He explicitly says but that is a problem

1503
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:01,919
This is an argument being made by a member of Congress in the 90s

1504
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:04,735
The bar has always been low

1505
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:08,063
Please go little bit off the rails

1506
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,599
Crazy Willie

1507
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:17,535
Members of Congress claim they control

1508
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:20,863
Look at those six confirmed

1509
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:27,519
Noah underestimate the ferocity of the commitment of the

1510
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,287
System of the world

1511
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,847
World government

1512
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:37,247
Weird alright

1513
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:40,319
Run-on sentences

1514
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,087
Stick thing

1515
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:44,671
Sometimes mr. Noah mister noahide

1516
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:49,279
Dannemeyer

1517
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:54,911
This is protocol

1518
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:55,935
Destroy Christianity

1519
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,215
So if you're keeping

1520
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:00,799
Score of the Clinton Body Count story is the product of that guy

1521
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:05,919
And a lady who declared herself a fake Universal decided she wanted to arrest Congress

1522
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:08,991
Over the gears periodically people of debunked

1523
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,271
Specific people

1524
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,039
Included on that

1525
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:12,319
But it doesn't matter

1526
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,135
Just Dance

1527
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,415
I'm all for Google not

1528
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,439
Suggesting this is a serf

1529
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,463
Result

1530
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,999
You might be looking

1531
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,279
Before because it's b*******

1532
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:24,351
Half down a radicalizing

1533
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:28,959
I think that it is a responsible thing

1534
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,727
4

1535
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:32,031
Society to recognize

1536
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,311
Is like that

1537
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,359
You can look for it

1538
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,895
But we're not going to help you find

1539
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:43,295
Algorithm people into those rabbit right

1540
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:45,599
Google

1541
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:50,207
Things like that are in

1542
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:52,767
Points down of really bad Road

1543
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:53,535
And

1544
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:55,071
Don't need help

1545
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:55,839
People go down this way

1546
01:17:56,095 --> 01:18:01,471
I don't know

1547
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,519
Anti-free speech guy for that

1548
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:07,103
I never thought that I would see this

1549
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:10,943
The day that you gave up on Holocaust

1550
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:17,087
Did it happen I'm not I'm not mad that like if you type in Alex Jones

1551
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:19,391
The suggestion isn't killed his dog

1552
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,975
Let's say we

1553
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:27,839
Started to really try and make a move a bunch of content about it

1554
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:34,239
Like a hashtag SEO.

1555
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:37,567
He killed his dog we're going to eliminate that from search

1556
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:40,639
Wow that's censorship

1557
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:47,039
We were f****** with you the whole time

1558
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:48,831
I don't know

1559
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:52,159
Anyways refines his idea about this

1560
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:54,719
About the elimination of the

1561
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,487
Clinton Body Count

1562
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:58,047
You make six-point a little

1563
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,423
Catalog two people can

1564
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,703
We're able to find it

1565
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:07,007
What was happening

1566
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:11,103
When people would go and try to type in like Hillary Clinton Body Count

1567
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,127
Google

1568
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:14,687
Shut off

1569
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:15,967
And

1570
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:24,671
Body count that search result prediction

1571
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:28,511
See user but part of that is B

1572
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:30,559
Because there hasn't been a 26

1573
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,583
6 year long

1574
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,631
Fraudulent propaganda campaign

1575
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:35,679
Against Trump

1576
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,959
Right so there

1577
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,007
Completely on and Allegan situation

1578
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,287
If there were

1579
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:42,079
Lakewood safe for 26 years

1580
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,895
People had been putting forth this b******* list

1581
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:51,295
Of people's near Trump with died Maybe

1582
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,343
Yes absolutely that should not be in the

1583
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,111
Suggested search

1584
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:59,743
Like in those circumstances it were and Hillary's weren't

1585
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:02,559
He's got a good argument but they're completely

1586
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,583
Different things

1587
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:04,863
So

1588
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,399
Yeah

1589
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,167
F*** off

1590
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:14,336
I don't like it I like it when we're dealing with it

1591
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,104
Evil

1592
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,384
On the stupid evil can

1593
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,432
Is really stupid

1594
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:21,760
So stupid

1595
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,576
It's very very stupid

1596
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:27,392
Just trying to

1597
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,160

1598
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,184
Medium page

His blog

01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,512
Sure cuz he's got the information on there

1601
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:37,888
Zack this made me laugh

1602
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:38,656
Pretty hard

1603
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,448
Because I know what Alex is doing

1604
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:46,848
Through this

1605
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:10,656
Infowars.com

1606
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:11,936
We understand what happened

1607
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:18,080
Beautiful

1608
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,360

1609
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,128
Infowars

1610
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:26,528
Everybody we're going to put up with you today

1611
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:34,720
Infowars.com

1612
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,280
F*** out of here Google

01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:39,840
Douchebag that's so if it's so true

1614
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:40,608
Transparent

1615
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,632
Ridiculous

1616
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:48,544
So Alex also has a sale going on

1617
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:55,200
Anniversary sale was after that

1618
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:57,760
And now we have the America awakens

1619
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:01,856
1488

1620
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:04,672
Didn't get a clip of this I wish I had but Alex explains it

1621
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:06,464
And it's just basically all this

1622
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:08,512
But he's like

1623
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:13,376
It's not on everything it's just on some stuff

1624
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:20,032
It's not as metaphor

1625
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:24,128
50 to 60% off free shipping a double

1626
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:26,432
Rhys not on something

1627
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,456
Wow

1628
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:30,272
You're really selling this new special. Love it

1629
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,552
Sing of the

1630
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:33,344
Paseo

1631
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:37,184
So Alex Goes to Commercial and he comes back

1632
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:39,744
And they play a compilation of him talk

1633
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,768
Think about how like

1634
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,304
Silicon Valley

1635
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,328
People are on drugs

1636
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,680
Right is right next to

1637
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:52,288
I don't know what they were doing.

1638
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,824
Special Report is playing

1639
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,640
But I have this minute-long clip here

1640
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:58,688
Close attention

1641
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,272
And recognize that I make this compilation

1642
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:04,832
This sounds like a parrot

1643
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:07,648
Okay

1644
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,672
Okay

1645
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:26,592
In the hell

1646
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:46,048
Type of pleasure you want is plugin

1647
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:58,848
White light pupils are

1648
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:05,248
Hazard wirehead something's going

1649
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:17,280
Cuz I'm not on drugs

1650
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:19,840
This is crazy

1651
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:22,400
Exactly like a guy

1652
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:32,384
I'll tell you what's going on

1653
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,768
I listen to that I was like

1654
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:51,840
He's someone inside f****** with him

1655
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:52,864
Somebody's f****** with

1656
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:59,520
I don't know I thought that was hilarious like it's incredible it's either Alex leaning into a recognition that these

1657
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:00,544
Kinds of things

1658
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:04,896
Hampton for him outside of his already established audience

1659
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:11,296
Rights memes that are kind of making fun of him into that

1660
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:13,600
For this maybe

1661
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,904
I'm not sure but whatever it is

1662
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:19,744
It's sad

1663
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,536
Dysplasia

1664
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:22,816
Everything about

1665
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:31,520
No no no 22nd

1666
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:34,848
And there's not really any

1667
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:36,896
Certainly no exclusives

1668
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:40,480
Totally blocked

1669
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:42,272
I have not cut out like

1670
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,040
Mentioned

1671
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:48,672
Sears has not brought it up

1672
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:51,232
But

1673
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:54,304
He doesn't declare that it's time

1674
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,072
Start a run

1675
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:11,968
Hi I'm

1676
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:14,528
I started fighting Irish over 40 years ago

1677
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,552
Great set timer

1678
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:22,464
Executives arrested

1679
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:28,096
However you got to get there.

1680
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,288
Why All That Remains

1681
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,640
I've made some

1682
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:41,664
Arguments

1683
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,432
Did that

1684
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:47,040
History will bear you out

1685
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:49,344
As indicated by this

1686
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:54,976
You'll see a lot of politicians a lot of people like open their eyes and just continue to talk and

1687
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:59,584
It's a good technique in order to right now

1688
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:09,568
If I'm by then I'm going to open up my eyes were wide and I was going to talk to you and your

1689
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:12,384
Trance and one of the key things that you don't want to play

1690
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:15,200
So he's trying to hypnotize the audience

1691
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:16,992
Spy camera

1692
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,784
This is silly

1693
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:25,184
Okay okay now what you do is you open your eyes

1694
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:30,048
Mezmur

1695
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:40,544
A weird angle directions for this show to go in Revit

1696
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:45,664
Failed to demonstrate to critical observer in entryway

1697
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:50,784
Okay

1698
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:56,928
Fluoride bad for you

1699
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,232
How to do with Google first year

1700
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:05,888
Because Google is blocking like a real help

1701
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:06,656
Information

1702
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:08,704
Which I assume is somehow some sort of

1703
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,240
Good defensive Mike Adams

1704
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,080
Whatever

1705
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:18,432
Mike Adams get on the real health information

1706
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:20,992
Talk about brings up

1707
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:21,760
Biscotti

1708
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:22,784
About fluoride

1709
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,320
Texas

1710
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:25,856
Real good

1711
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,160
And there's a lot of research

1712
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,952
Internationally showings

1713
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:32,256
Fluoride lowers

1714
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,096
And now it's like

1715
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:42,752
Pediatrics or something

1716
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:44,288
Preach mg of

1717
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:50,944
Fluoride found in pregnant moms

1718
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:57,344
Starting to mouth

1719
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:03,744
So back has not really read this study or not into it

1720
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,512
You read it all

1721
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,536
It sounds like you ready

1722
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:08,352
From start to finish a certain amount of IQ

1723
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:14,496
Or something just heard there was dead even Vault IQ fluoride

1724
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:17,568
I'm guessing that's okay

1725
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:21,920
So this is a study that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association

1726
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:25,504
Pediatrics in to point out that it is a it's very

1727
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:28,832
Very explicit in the study.

1728
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:30,112
A demonstration of a

1729
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:30,880
Causal link

1730
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,648
Between consumption

1731
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:33,184
Fluoride

1732
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,464
And lowered IQ of the child

1733
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:37,536
A possible assoc

1734
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,584
A couple problems

1735
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:45,472
I don't actually problems with the study but their problems for the conclusion that Alex and Zachary Drive

1736
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,544
The first is that only 85.2

1737
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,640
Percent of the parent-child pairs had urine analysis down to actually solidify

1738
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:53,920
What are fluoride levels

1739
01:29:54,688 --> 01:30:00,064
Questionnaires and made estimates based on the level of fluoride in the water in a given

1740
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,368
City and the Stars quote

1741
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:05,440
For this study we develop methods to estimating calculator

1742
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,976
Calculate fluoride intake

1743
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,512
That have not yet been valid

1744
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:09,792
So they didn't like

1745
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,560
Compare those

1746
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:11,584
Methods result

1747
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:17,728
There was some indications of

1748
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,752
Between the urine test

1749
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:20,800
Quest

1750
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:22,336
Estimate

1751
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:28,736
Similar

1752
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:35,904
By their own language

1753
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,440
Alignment

1754
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,976
To cause pain

1755
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:43,584
The second is that the study itself points out that fluoride has a very short half-life

1756
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:45,376
Hoveround 5 hours

1757
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:48,448
Tricky thing

1758
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,496
They could be thrown off by like brushing your teeth

1759
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,776
Teeth an hour before the test

1760
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:58,944
It's not necessarily the best way to figure out what a consistent level of fluoride

1761
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,784
The study also explicitly says quote

1762
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:07,904
This observational study design could not address the possibility of other unmeasured residual

1763
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:08,672
Confounding

1764
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:11,232
Which is to say that there are a ton of factors they couldn't

1765
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:13,792
Control4 that might have influenced the results

1766
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:16,352
Listen to knock on the study and anyway

1767
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:20,448
Since the conclusion is just that the observational study found a possible Association in

1768
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:22,240
Shouldn't could be study for

1769
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,776
The problem is when

1770
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:25,056
People like Alex's

1771
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:25,824
Take the study

1772
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,872
Like right and over-exaggerated

1773
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:31,200
Conclusion as proof that low amounts of fluoride lower IQ

1774
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:37,600
State 4-H Market

1775
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:39,136
And they discovered and they pray

1776
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:44,000
Which is not true you can have conversations about all this.

1777
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:49,632
The IQ test

1778
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:52,960
For the children were given between the ages when they were between the ages of

1779
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:53,728
3 + 4

1780
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:59,360
Well it's certainly not unheard of as a thing to do I start a number of resources that cautioned against IQ test

1781
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,384
Can children this young

1782
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:05,504
The children may not be able to focus on the test adequately that can produce an unreliable results

1783
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:09,600
Plus there are tons of examples of people's IQ fluctuating quite a bit over the years

1784
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:12,672
Now they say that to test their supposed to be designed

1785
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:15,744
Produce a consistent result within plus or minus five points

1786
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,024
But that's not always the case

1787
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:19,584
And the younger the child is when they're test

1788
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,400
Did the more likely it is that they're going to get an unreliable test

1789
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,704
This would be more compelling if the

1790
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,496
The children were 10

1791
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:29,056
But that's not disqualifying for the study

1792
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:29,824
It's just a

1793
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,896
The caveat for proof of anything

1794
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:35,712
Just a study that says that more studying is required

1795
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,552
Things that are in

1796
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:40,576
Beat study yourself

1797
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:46,976
Lake does their sections in these studies of limitations of the study

1798
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:51,584
Issues with what we're putting forth and why we can't make it to

1799
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,864
Affirmative conclusion

1800
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,632
Right

1801
01:32:53,888 --> 01:33:00,032
We're not we're not trying to prove anything to get almost like a divining Rod out there that's going to say

1802
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:03,360
This area is going to narrow down what we should be studying

1803
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:06,944
As opposed to we're trying to prove that fluoride

1804
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,480
Simply trying to

1805
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:10,784
Factor in as many variables as we

1806
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,552
We possibly can

1807
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:12,576
2

1808
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,648
Point2 weather

1809
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:17,952
More

1810
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:23,328
You know followed up on people do more studies the control for the variables that were on can

1811
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:25,888
Controlled

1812
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,424
Abso medication

1813
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,960
There is a link

1814
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:29,728
Between

1815
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:31,008
Fluoride

1816
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:33,568
Diminished IQ in children

1817
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:34,336
Then

1818
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,016
This is not established

1819
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:43,808
We're done with

1820
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:44,576
The 21st

1821
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:45,344
Zach

1822
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,368
Go to hell

1823
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:48,672
Zach was Zack was a hero

1824
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:53,024
Sure

1825
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:55,584
So we didn't get any talk

1826
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,608
About Trump

1827
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,888
Being the chosen one

1828
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:58,656
Which again

1829
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:01,728
Is because it probably happened while I was on Erica

1830
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:07,360
You didn't get any talk about being disloyal to talk about

1831
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:09,408
Second coming of God kind

1832
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:13,248
We got from in Hong Kong who weren't allowed to

1833
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,528
Yeah scaccia

1834
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,832
So we get into Thursday

1835
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:17,600
22nd

1836
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:20,672
Alex jumps into the show and makes up

1837
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:22,208
For it

1838
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:23,744
I think you realize like

1839
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:27,072
Probably ignore the Jews are disloyal thing

1840
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,864
I could probably ignore that

1841
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,400
But what

1842
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:36,288
So Alex

1843
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,504
The truth so refreshing

1844
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:51,392
Years old

1845
01:34:58,048 --> 01:35:00,096
Yes Trump is the chosen one

1846
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:04,192
So tell our Destinies if we choose to

1847
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:12,896
Is delivering the country out of the globalist bondage

1848
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,456
To keep their entire system

1849
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:18,016
In-Place right now

1850
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:19,296
Jack

1851
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:21,600
Pretty galaxy

1852
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:22,880
Alright

1853
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:24,928
I am going to give it to him

1854
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:27,488
Got it

1855
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:34,400
Trump saying that he's the chosen one into

1856
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:37,984
It's good to finally see a Statesman and office telling it like it is

1857
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:44,640
That is mental gymnastics Simone biles could never touch

1858
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:48,992
It was referencing at the beginning of the show like an argument

1859
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:50,272
I could be mad that

1860
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:51,808
You know what you're saying I'm the truth

1861
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,088
I want to take on

1862
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:58,464
Eliminate all prior context

1863
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:03,072
It looked up to the sky well

1864
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:08,192
Surround to allow that kind of.

1865
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:09,984
And I'm not going to allow

1866
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:14,336
Sad

1867
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,872
That's sad and hilarious

1868
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:19,456
Loyalty

1869
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:21,504
Ideas

1870
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,808
And this is good

1871
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:29,952
Israel

1872
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:37,632
Look

1873
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,728
Support for Israel

1874
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:47,616
Upside down world

1875
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:53,248
People

1876
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:59,904
Leprechaun Powers Israel

1877
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:02,208
And then acting like Netanyahu runs the world

1878
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:04,768
Rothschild

1879
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,304
Globalist left

1880
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:17,568
Not make the shop

1881
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:25,504
Describing mythical powers

1882
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,040
The f****** Rothschild

1883
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:31,136
Who are liberals

1884
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:34,208
We're slowly.

1885
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:37,536
Davis tomorrow

1886
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:40,352
What's going on

1887
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:41,376
Is that Alex

1888
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:44,704
Have to paint the idea that collab

1889
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,264
Why is advocating for the end of

1890
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:50,848
To critique

1891
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:51,616
Can the government

1892
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:54,176
Being oppressive against Palace

1893
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,968
Well the same time

1894
01:37:56,224 --> 01:38:00,576
The jangly keys so you don't stop

1895
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:06,976
You need to attack her in order to cover for

1896
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:09,024
Stuff we got this

1897
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:14,656
He is the chosen one in the same way we are all the chosen one anyways did you know that Liberals are actually

1898
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:18,240
Eating your baby faces right now

1899
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:20,800
Cuz it invisible liberal is eating it right

1900
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,080
Sure

1901
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:24,128
So in order to achieve

1902
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:25,408
Alex has to

1903
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:28,992
To get really f****** mad about Rashida tlaib

1904
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:34,624
Press conference came out and

1905
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,416
Talked about

1906
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:39,232
Not being allowed to go on their fax finding

1907
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,256
Mission

1908
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,280
This is real

1909
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:44,864
Alex's like

1910
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,400
Alex

1911
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,424
Carries himself

1912
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:48,448
Is

1913
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:50,752
I mean I don't know

1914
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,288
It's really really bad

1915
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,432
Free stuff

1916
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:01,760
The breakroom

1917
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,296
What's money

1918
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:08,928
Press conference with with the four horsemen

1919
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:10,208
Democratic

1920
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:15,328
Call my mother

1921
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,888
Hospital she was in

1922
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,216
Power starter my grandmother and they wouldn't let her in

1923
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:22,752
Free healthcare

1924
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:25,312
You want to blow the country up

1925
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:32,736
Wonderful Palestinian play

1926
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:41,440
So I do I watch the speech

1927
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:54,240
Israel

1928
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,264
Show up Israel I don't

1929
01:39:55,776 --> 01:40:00,128
People who are little bit and look directly into the camera

1930
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:07,552
I have some missing time

1931
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:09,088
This little experiment

1932
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:11,648
Validating

1933
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:13,440
Surround

1934
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:14,976
Absolutely Audrey

1935
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:17,536
You goes further

1936
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:18,816
In this next clip

1937
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:20,352
And basically invalidate

1938
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:21,120
Therapist

1939
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:28,288
And George

1940
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,312
And why is that

1941
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:30,848
Because every time

1942
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:36,480
Rebellion

1943
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:38,272
Because I don't even exist

1944
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:42,368
They're just people that want to take it over

1945
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,912
Tell me I can't

1946
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:56,192
That's so childish

1947
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:57,728
Incredibly

1948
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:02,080
Many countries

1949
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:04,896
Alex's pretending don't allow any Palestinian

1950
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:07,712
He's just making s*** up to support his own xenophobic and

1951
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:08,992
Racist worldview

1952
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,832
Alex's argument the Palestinians aren't even a real thing

1953
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:16,672
Is a shameful display of rhetoric that leads very easily to dehumanization

1954
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:18,208
Extermination is Starkey

1955
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,000
It's not something I've even going to

1956
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,024
Dignify with the response

1957
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:22,304
That is

1958
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:23,840
Insane

1959
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:25,120
That is literally

1960
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:28,192
Philippa Alex

1961
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:32,032
Rasheeda is fake crying

1962
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:34,336
While she's talking about

1963
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:36,384
This is just

1964
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:37,664
Israel

1965
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:51,488
See this

1966
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,120
Because it's the left

1967
01:41:58,144 --> 01:42:01,984
It's like all these people attempt suicide

1968
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:19,648
Attempting suicide

1969
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:25,792
Parasite

1970
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:28,864
We are all day and then

1971
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:32,192
Fetishization

1972
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:34,496
Israel doesn't let her

1973
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:36,800
She whines and cries about her grandmother

1974
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:39,360
And our grandmother

1975
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:46,528
Microcosm

1976
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:48,320
What

1977
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:51,904
And there's a fight

1978
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,696
That was the vehicles America

1979
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:55,488
The fight over who controls Europe

1980
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:57,792
Between

1981
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:59,328
Germans and Jews

1982
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,912
Mexicans in Russia

1983
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:06,496
Between evil and good

1984
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:08,800
In your family it's a fight

1985
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:13,408
What interrelationships in your business in your life that you

1986
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:15,456
There's a struggle in the universe

1987
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:16,736
Good

1988
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:21,344
You people don't agree with my crazy b******* that I'm spreading

1989
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:24,416
Your eval also I mean just

1990
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,952
All this stuff aside

1991
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:29,280
There's some comedy in the fact that Alex

1992
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:30,560
Is talking about

1993
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:33,888
Demeaning people who struggle with suicidal

1994
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:35,168
Inclination

1995
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:41,824
Is describing that to being with the behavior of the Democrats are

1996
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:42,848
Ownership

1997
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:51,808
We have Carpe donktum on talk about his link to copyrighted material

1998
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:54,880
Write this whole thing is

1999
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,208
This is pathetic

2000
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:00,768
Come Dan and we're the lived

2001
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:02,048
Just trying to steal Victor

2002
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:05,120
From people like carpet

2003
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:07,168
The joke is

2004
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,472
Wrong

2005
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:10,240
React

2006
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:11,264
I mean

2007
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:13,312
I don't even I don't even know where to begin

2008
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:14,592
Begin with

2009
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:16,128
I'm calling these people parasites

2010
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,152
We could do

2011
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:22,528
It's almost like a lot of his stuff is I feel like presenting

2012
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:23,552
With minimal,

2013
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,368
Except where necessary

2014
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:27,904
Because this is just

2015
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:29,440
Horrible ship that Alex's

2016
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:33,280
Is product

2017
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:37,376
This is part of the people leave

2018
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,704
It's not like you didn't know that

2019
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,264
What combination of

2020
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:49,664
Also considering 10 years ago Alex was firmly in favour of Palestinian rights

2021
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:54,272
From

2022
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:56,064
I think a part sides bad too

2023
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,344
They're not even

2024
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,880
Did you think about that

2025
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:07,072
It's like that combination of his worldview being only able to see through his eyes so he

2026
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:07,840
He's always

2027
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:10,144
He doesn't understand a good-faith ARG

2028
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:13,472
He doesn't understand that they could be real crying

2029
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,592
You know he can only

2030
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:20,640
Performative for him therefore it must be greater

2031
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:22,944
And then there's also that like

2032
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:24,992
This is

2033
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:26,784
This Trump s*** is what

2034
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,088
Wild I don't even know what to do other than

2035
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,112
Invalidating

2036
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:30,880
Entire people

2037
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:36,256
I think I think part of it is he feels he has to do that cuz he knows he's also going to validate Trump

2038
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:38,816
S***

2039
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:39,584
Something

2040
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:41,632
I guess this would be the equivalent

2041
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:43,680
White supremacist

2042
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:45,984
Sugar to help the medicine go down

2043
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:50,080
Now we're recognizing Trump as God appointment

2044
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:54,176
Talk

2045
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:55,456
Children when I got elected

2046
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:56,992
Look up

2047
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:58,272
Obviously

2048
01:45:58,784 --> 01:45:59,296
Panchos

2049
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,160
Of course Trump

2050
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:04,928
Chosen

2051
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:09,024
The phenomenon

2052
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:09,792
Smell it

2053
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:11,584
And the devil and the enemies

2054
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:16,448
President talking about

2055
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:19,264
In the chosen one

2056
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:24,384
Operation

2057
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:27,200
Really

2058
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:30,016
Coward

2059
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:32,832
Take me to

2060
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:38,208
Can you imagine if during ACA

2061
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:41,792
Negotiations Obama was like God chose me

2062
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:45,376
To help give everyone Healthcare

2063
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:50,496
How to make the same arguments he was already making but it would be

2064
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:52,544
Alex Alex

2065
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,312
Being like

2066
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:54,336
Master Yoda

2067
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:57,408
Crazy

2068
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:05,600
But you didn't go on the chosen one but he did have the whole life

2069
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:10,464
God put me in off at stew to make sure that we bombed Iraq for the rest of

2070
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:13,024
Yeah

2071
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,304
I think there was an

2072
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,328
Acceptable

2073
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:21,728
Quotes socially acceptable version of an oppressed

2074
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:27,104
Total understanding of

2075
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:33,248
The links that you can use that probably was on the wrong side of that line

2076
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:34,528
But you know like

2077
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,832
Put me on this Earth

2078
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:42,208
This podcast acceptable Ram realm of

2079
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:46,048
Cuz we're living in a metaphor as opposed to a delusion of grandeur

2080
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,328
Right

2081
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:48,096
I wouldn't

2082
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:49,632
I'm the

2083
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:51,680
Especially when

2084
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:54,496
Cortical leader of the Free World

2085
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:56,544
Singer I run a carpentry business

2086
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:58,336
I'm a good father

2087
01:47:58,592 --> 01:48:00,128
Erotic podcast

2088
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:04,736
I would not declare myself the chosen one

2089
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:06,272
Even though in the cult

2090
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:12,672
I would literally the chosen one

2091
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:18,560
You have some experience

2092
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:19,584
SquareTrade

2093
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:22,144
For my whole life

2094
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:25,472
Trump is just jumping on a trampoline

2095
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:29,824
Alex gets back to attacking

2096
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:38,016
And then you see

2097
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:39,808
Talib

2098
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,600
The leader of the Fantastic

2099
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:46,464
Wolf

2100
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:52,864
Claim the each one is the leader whatever it serves his purpose if so great

2101
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:55,680
He's in the background for a while to Topaz Lake

2102
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:57,216
Jealous

2103
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:58,240
You're all f******

2104
01:48:58,496 --> 01:49:00,032
Also the Rat Pack where like

2105
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:03,360
Groundbreaking

2106
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:22,304
Inside a bill

2107
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:24,096
What

2108
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,616
And then we'll didn't grovel to them

2109
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:36,896
Oh I see that's how

2110
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:43,296
So Rasheeda has it she is a palestinian-american but you was born in Detroit

2111
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:49,696
Wright was born in Alexandria ocasio-cortez

2112
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:52,000
New York Presley was born in

2113
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:55,584
A refugee to like 10 years old

2114
01:49:58,144 --> 01:50:04,288
Alex is explicitly invalidating the American death of these women because they are people he sees us.

2115
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:05,312
Who disagree with

2116
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,360
Just know but you can't tolerate

2117
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:09,664
Three of them were born here in the others

2118
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:12,736
Making their own countries better

2119
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:14,784
That's exactly what they're trying to do in Congress

2120
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:17,088
Don't think too hard about it

2121
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,880
Experiences

2122
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:23,744
Because there's a lot of problems with the country

2123
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,280
The revolver on the ideas of

2124
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:26,816
Power hierarchy

2125
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:29,888
Which Alex will desperately cling to no matter what the cost

2126
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:34,240
He's bringing up to this idea of like

2127
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:38,592
They're just that they know that we have feelings we have empathy visitor

2128
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:39,360
Exploit

2129
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:41,152
I mean can't you easily imagine

2130
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:41,920
Exact

2131
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:42,944
Same thing like during

2132
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:44,992
The end of slavery

2133
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:46,016
Absolute

2134
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:51,904
These people are whipped and beaten and work

2135
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,696
On the fields but that's

2136
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:56,512
2 mi

2137
01:50:56,768 --> 01:50:57,280
Good

2138
01:50:57,536 --> 01:51:03,680
Noble white human emotion I don't want to have you not read the Bible

2139
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:08,032
To keep them where they are because that's where they

2140
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:14,432
Look I have just as much of a bleeding heart is any of you what do you guys call yourself that's why I want to maintain

2141
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:20,576
Slavery

01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:25,440
Have 2nd civil rights imagines Alex being like

2143
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:26,976

Friends

01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:37,728
It's all very idea

2146
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:38,752
Yeah you're showing

2147
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:40,544
These pictures of people being hoes

2148
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:43,616
Just a tug at my Heartstrings

2149
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:46,432
Exploit my good

2150
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:50,528
Empathy mechanisms in order to override

2151
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,320
Whatever I mean this is your client

2152
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:53,344
Zika bulshit

2153
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:56,160
So is on

2154
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:57,696
Disgusting

2155
01:51:57,952 --> 01:51:59,488
Italics

2156
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:00,768
To go over

2157
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:01,792
The press conference

2158
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:04,608

In-N-Out you killed all the Christians around the mouth

2161
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:10,752
But I'm supposed to kiss your butt lady

2162
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,080

Oh no

2167
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:33,280
A psychopath

2168
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:34,816
A sociopath

2169
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:36,096
Find a button

2170
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:37,632
Emotion

2171
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:38,656
Fat

2172
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:46,080
I watched as my mother had to go

2173
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:48,384
Should.you humanizing checkpoint

2174
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,624
Proud American

2175
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:00,928
I was there with my city

2176
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,488
The terrible car accidents

2177
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,048
And I cried

2178
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:08,608
Baptist Hospital

2179
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:10,144
Jerusalem

2180
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:14,240
I remember shaking with fear when

2181
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:28,576
Chicken neck

2182
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:30,368
Children's book

2183
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:37,792
So interrupted there because she's

2184
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:41,376
He's getting into territory that's very close to a lot of his old red

2185
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:43,424
The idea of checkpoint

2186
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:45,984
Oh I don't know

2187
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:49,056
Government to people

2188
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:51,616
The stuff that he's railed on for years

2189
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:52,896
He can't allow that

2190
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:53,664
Sort of

2191
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:56,480
Presented on his show

2192
01:53:58,528 --> 01:53:59,296
A maggot

2193
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:01,856
Parasite

2194
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:04,416
It's way too close to his Lane

2195
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:07,488
You help you run the risk

2196
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:09,536
Of listeners curing her

2197
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:10,304
Breakfast

2198
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:13,120
And

2199
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:13,888
Then think

2200
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:15,936
I think I'm against

2201
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:19,520
I remember vaguely

2202
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:25,664
He's exactly the sort of tyranny my hero Alex Jones

2203
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,456
Has been screaming about

2204
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:31,296
The second hold on hold on

2205
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:33,088
That there was a

2206
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:34,624
That was

2207
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:36,160
Pressing her

2208
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:37,440
A minority

2209
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:38,720
Of people

2210
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,280
Through through

2211
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:42,048
Tear

2212
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:44,352
Checkpoint

2213
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,376
And

2214
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:46,400
Oppression

2215
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:47,680
And I'm

2216
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:49,216
She's a bad guy

2217
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:54,080
That's what's being

2218
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:56,384
I think that Alex recognizes

2219
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:59,200
But there is a danger in presenting

2220
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:00,992
Without interruption without

2221
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:01,760
Preev

2222
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:03,040
Priming the pump

2223
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:03,808
Hyperloop

2224
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:04,832
How evil

2225
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:10,464
Disgusting display

2226
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,768
It's like what Somalia is like

2227
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:14,048
Going through the list

2228
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:14,816
6 things that your

2229
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:15,584
Supposed to take

2230
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:17,632
Influence

2231
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:19,424
So Alex is

2232
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:20,448
Screaming about how she

2233
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:21,984
The maggot

2234
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:24,800
Do all of the other b*******

2235
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:25,824
So you

2236
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:27,360
The conceive

2237
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:29,408
Instead of a human being

2238
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:30,176
Expressing

2239
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:31,200
The very

2240
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:32,480
Tyrannical government

2241
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:33,248
You're supposed to be again

2242
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,296
Acting against

2243
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:36,064
Instead you see

2244
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:37,088
A flaming

2245
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:39,136
Demon monster

2246
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:40,416
Tugging upon your hearts

2247
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:44,768
Wright and his arguments to just about like

2248
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:47,584
Okay

2249
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:51,424
Your whole thing was the about like this tyranny that's going to come

2250
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:54,752
To America if you guys are going to get targeted

2251
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:55,520
Because of

2252
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:57,312
A big bombing

2253
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:59,872
Oklahoma City

2254
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:02,432
Well those are false Flags babe white people

2255
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:06,016
Sew-ins Expo of Alex

2256
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:07,552
Seems to be imagining

2257
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:10,624
People like

2258
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:11,648
Playb

2259
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:15,744
Is never done anything

2260
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:16,512
Sinbad

2261
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:17,536
But that's not the

2262
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:18,816
Does discussion at all

2263
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:20,352
He's creating a straw man version

2264
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:23,424
That in order to attack that is if that's the real

2265
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:28,288
Flat wide

2266
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:31,360
The Muslim never heard nobody

2267
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:52,864
Do you want to talk about

2268
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:59,264
I'll talk about the expansion of Christian

2269
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:04,640
Missionaries were very much involved in that

2270
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:08,224
Lobar example

2271
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:10,528
Smaller example of

2272
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:12,576
The ways in which

2273
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:13,856
Christianity was used

2274
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:15,392
I suppose he

2275
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:16,928
Also

2276
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:17,696
Tacit

2277
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:21,792
Agreement that Christianity did it this

2278
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:24,096
Right

2279
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:25,888
Skewer that

2280
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:27,936
Christianity only spread Noble

2281
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:29,472
And Muslims

2282
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:30,752
In Islam

2283
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:31,520
Spread

2284
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:36,896
So OK Google

2285
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:39,200
Organically throughout

2286
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:40,736
Evil

2287
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:43,040
Bissell Good vs Evil tank

2288
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:43,808
Really

2289
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:47,392
It's a monkey dichotomy

2290
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:49,696
So Alex and the next cliff

2291
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,024
It's a shame

2292
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:57,888
And I'm done

2293
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:05,312
Jerusalem with my dead husband

2294
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:08,384
In him is Gordon Gordon off the bus

2295
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:10,944
Although he was a United States citizen

2296
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:14,016
Just do security forces could harass him

2297
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:15,296
Don't stop again

2298
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:17,344
You want to overthrow Israel

2299
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:25,536
From the West

2300
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:38,592
My balls grab

2301
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:44,224
When I go to the store

2302
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:51,904
Globalist

2303
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:00,864
That's

2304
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:03,424
Okay

2305
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:04,448
So

2306
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:08,800
Describe living in a

2307
01:59:09,056 --> 01:59:09,568
Police state

2308
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:10,336
Right

2309
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:12,640
He agreed

2310
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:13,408
With

2311
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:14,944
The police state

2312
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:15,968
Right

2313
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:18,528
Then said that he has to live in a police

2314
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:21,344
Because the police state is in

2315
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,368
Correctly

2316
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:24,160
I guess

2317
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:25,696
Yes

2318
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:32,096
Shear Art subjects

2319
01:59:36,448 --> 01:59:42,592
Tyrell

2320
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:45,920
They're only a problem when they're being applied towards

2321
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:46,944
Quite

2322
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:47,712
People

2323
01:59:47,968 --> 01:59:48,992
The good people of the West

2324
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:54,880
Wishes for y'all's about to apply to people unlike him

2325
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:56,160
Absolute

2326
02:00:00,768 --> 02:00:02,560
Use of these women some more

2327
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:05,120
I don't know I mean I can give that as an introduction

2328
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:06,400
Pretty much all of these clothes

2329
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:12,032
What is granddaughter

2330
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:16,384
Did the elevator voice

2331
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:19,712
Fight the truth.

2332
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:24,064
Detroit Public Schools teacher taught me

2333
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:28,928
Oh my gosh

2334
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:31,744
Oh my God

2335
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:35,328
Go to Somalia

2336
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:37,376
Go fix your own problems

2337
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:39,936
Rompers

2338
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:41,728
Isn't

2339
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:45,824
Powerful

2340
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:48,128
I looked it up

2341
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:52,224
Muslim family

2342
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:56,320
Flavors

2343
02:00:57,088 --> 02:01:03,232
Recall on Alex to prove that man

2344
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:04,768
Words from a slaver family because

2345
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:11,168
Is her skin color is a little bit later yes

2346
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:11,936
That is true

2347
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:16,288
Omar's father was a teacher

2348
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:19,360
Is an educational forum

2349
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:21,152
Slavery damage

2350
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:23,200
Are the only evidence that I could find

2351
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:25,760
The backs of any claim even close to this

2352
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:29,600
Was a Gateway pundit article that made allegations

2353
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:32,416
He was working

2354
02:01:32,672 --> 02:01:37,024
The government has some sort of terrorist

2355
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:39,328
Sure

2356
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:42,144
Didn't prove anyway didn't have any source

2357
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:48,544
But I was probably going off of that situation

2358
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:49,824
For evidence

2359
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:54,432
Claiming that congressman

2360
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:59,552
Family is entirely slavery when former president

2361
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:06,208
I would request

2362
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:20,032
Yeah I know it's not worth anybody's time to actually Sue in Webster

2363
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:21,056
Pretty crazy

2364
02:02:21,568 --> 02:02:25,664
I looked it up

2365
02:02:26,176 --> 02:02:28,480
Responsibility to

2366
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:29,504
Some sort of a sorcerer

2367
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,808
Approve this and anyway and you failed to do so

2368
02:02:32,064 --> 02:02:32,832
As it is

2369
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:33,856
Slander

2370
02:02:35,392 --> 02:02:36,416
Scorpion

2371
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:37,440
Declares

2372
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:40,000
Which is noga

2373
02:02:41,024 --> 02:02:41,536
Really

2374
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:44,864
It's really not good no and then he goes back

2375
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:45,888
Today

2376
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:46,656
Press

2377
02:02:47,424 --> 02:02:47,936
But

2378
02:02:48,192 --> 02:02:49,216
If you've actually watch

2379
02:02:49,472 --> 02:02:50,240
The actual Prescott

2380
02:02:51,264 --> 02:02:54,336
You will know that what he's doing is intentionally mislead

2381
02:02:54,848 --> 02:02:55,872
They cut out something

2382
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:57,152
It gives what you say

2383
02:02:57,664 --> 02:02:58,176
Important

2384
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:02,272
An abomination

2385
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:06,880
Military occupation

2386
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:12,512
Just really want peace and self-determination for their Palestinian Neighbors

2387
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:16,608
They could have shed light into Injustice

2388
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:19,424
Lexington

2389
02:03:19,936 --> 02:03:22,240
Here let's continue after that

2390
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:23,520
At the beginning

2391
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:26,848
People Force

2392
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:28,640
To engage in military

2393
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:29,664
Activities

2394
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:31,712
What's right before that

2395
02:03:31,968 --> 02:03:33,760
If you listen to her actual press

2396
02:03:34,272 --> 02:03:35,040
Is a description

2397
02:03:35,552 --> 02:03:37,600
Of how she's doing on this fact-finding mission

2398
02:03:37,856 --> 02:03:38,368
Where

2399
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:41,184
She's going to meet with Israeli veteran

2400
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:44,768
She's referring to In that clip

2401
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:49,120
Alex deprives out of context Israeli veterans

2402
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:50,400
Open

2403
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:53,216
Done Alex deprives that clip of context

2404
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:54,496
Because it runs

2405
02:03:54,752 --> 02:03:56,032
Entirely counter

2406
02:03:57,312 --> 02:04:03,456
The presentation of this press conference and there's only Muslims in Palestine

2407
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:04,992
And you know what they're not in Palestine

2408
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:07,040
Cuz that's not even

2409
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:09,600
He's trying to present the idea that

2410
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:12,160
She's going over there and only going to be

2411
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:18,560
Two Palestinian people

2412
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:20,864
When in reality the word bunch of different groups

2413
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:23,680
Omar and others were going

2414
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:27,264
To go and meet up with and if you allow that reality

2415
02:04:27,776 --> 02:04:28,288
Be presented

2416
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:29,824
You ruin the perception

2417
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:30,592
That you created

2418
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:32,896
Alex is interested in the narrative

2419
02:04:33,152 --> 02:04:33,664
Not

2420
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:35,968
Which I'm sure is also one of the read

2421
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:39,552
Possibly

2422
02:04:42,624 --> 02:04:43,392
Associated

2423
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:44,928
Israel in Oak Plaza

2424
02:04:45,952 --> 02:04:46,464
I would assume

2425
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:50,816
So if Alex

2426
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:52,864
Is to inoculate the audio

2427
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:54,400
From empathy

2428
02:04:54,912 --> 02:04:57,984
Except these arguments

2429
02:04:58,752 --> 02:05:00,032
Points that are being brought up

2430
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:04,128
This is primarily about the making sure no one feels

2431
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:09,760
The delegation would have seen firsthand destructive

2432
02:05:10,016 --> 02:05:10,784
Not productive

2433
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:13,344
They could have asked the people in Bethlehem

2434
02:05:14,368 --> 02:05:17,440
Hello cut people off of way from Economic Opportunity

2435
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:19,232
To live

2436
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:20,768
And you don't stop right there

2437
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:26,144
Mother and The Birdcage

2438
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:27,936
This is this is really really

2439
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:32,800
This is all to manipulate your hearts

2440
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:36,384
Is all just the Heartstrings

2441
02:05:37,664 --> 02:05:38,944
Mr. Gorbachev

2442
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:40,736
I'm loving that wall

2443
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:41,760
Keep it going

2444
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:42,784
More less

2445
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:46,368
We're done with the press conference

2446
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:47,904
But

2447
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:49,440
For this next

2448
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:52,000
I want you to remember

2449
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:53,536
Alex Jones

2450
02:05:54,816 --> 02:05:56,096
Is bigamy is the New World

2451
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:57,376
Sure

2452
02:05:57,888 --> 02:05:58,400
That's important

2453
02:05:59,168 --> 02:05:59,680
Because

2454
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:03,520
Persona world population

2455
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:06,080
Everybody trying to get my country

2456
02:06:06,592 --> 02:06:09,664
There's a simple reason we got Christian

2457
02:06:11,456 --> 02:06:12,736
In the trees

2458
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:13,760
I like the

2459
02:06:15,296 --> 02:06:16,576
True

2460
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:30,400
Got milk

2461
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:37,568
The only way

2462
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:40,128
Wasn't going to force you to serve Christ

2463
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:42,688
Door's always open

2464
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:44,992
The way is Jesus of Nazareth

2465
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:47,040
Global unification

2466
02:06:51,648 --> 02:06:53,440
World order under Jesus Christ

2467
02:06:56,256 --> 02:07:00,096
Is working

2468
02:07:00,352 --> 02:07:06,496
Sunbury Christian rules

2469
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:08,032
I cannot

2470
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:09,056
Think of anything

2471
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:12,128
Knowledge

2472
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:13,152
More

2473
02:07:13,664 --> 02:07:14,688
Then Christian

2474
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:22,368
Baby

2475
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:26,208
Also there's

2476
02:07:26,464 --> 02:07:26,976
You know

2477
02:07:27,488 --> 02:07:29,024
Some issues about

2478
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:30,560
If that's

2479
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:33,376
The case of Christianity is the only thing that made things

2480
02:07:33,632 --> 02:07:34,656
Workout

2481
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:40,544
Is a lot of periods of history that you're going to have to come up with

2482
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:42,080
Right

2483
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:43,104
I'm pretty sure the Chris

2484
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:50,784
It's not

2485
02:07:52,064 --> 02:07:56,928
I'm coming at this from

2486
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,720
Like Christianity wasn't

2487
02:07:58,976 --> 02:07:59,744
Invented in the 19

2488
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:06,912
Metaphor

2489
02:08:07,168 --> 02:08:12,800
There's a lot. A lot of a lot of Darkness

2490
02:08:18,688 --> 02:08:20,480
An explanation for why the Christie

2491
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:21,760
Operating system

2492
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:24,576
As he's describing it wasn't

2493
02:08:24,832 --> 02:08:28,928
They taking everyone to the Moon makes me it just makes me laugh because

2494
02:08:30,208 --> 02:08:32,000
The Bedrock of mathematics

2495
02:08:32,256 --> 02:08:32,768
It was

2496
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:35,072
Bev made by his enemies

2497
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:39,424
Sure as well as the technology itself necessary to go to the Moon

2498
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:49,408
So

2499
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:52,480
I believe his Christianity

2500
02:08:52,736 --> 02:08:54,528
Probably Christian

2501
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:58,112
I mean like the biggest

2502
02:08:58,368 --> 02:08:58,880
Is

2503
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:00,672
What he's saying

2504
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:03,744
It is entirely just a

2505
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:10,144
I want a Christian world order I want a unified One World Christian order

2506
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:14,240
Also is b*******

2507
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:15,264
2

2508
02:09:16,032 --> 02:09:17,568
To Deb worship Jesus

2509
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:19,872
Dwell in his

2510
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:26,272
Theory of it but let's say there is a Christian world that comes into power right how is

2511
02:09:26,528 --> 02:09:29,088
How is the experience of being a Muslim in that

2512
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:31,136
Circumstance

2513
02:09:31,392 --> 02:09:32,160
Like is the best

2514
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:33,184
Case scenario

2515
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:36,256
Infor is at

2516
02:09:36,512 --> 02:09:37,024
Tolerance

2517
02:09:38,304 --> 02:09:39,584
World Order

2518
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:41,888
Entirely run

2519
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:42,912
By Christie

2520
02:09:43,424 --> 02:09:44,704
Right and that's not

2521
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:45,728
Isn't

2522
02:09:45,984 --> 02:09:46,752
A good situation

2523
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:53,408
World dictators

2524
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:55,456
In his conception

2525
02:09:58,016 --> 02:10:01,344
Well it's not

2526
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:04,928
That's that's real stupid

2527
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:06,208
That's real stupid

2528
02:10:06,464 --> 02:10:07,488
For someone like him.

2529
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:08,768
Hear that

2530
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:10,560
That's a little bit too much

2531
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:12,864
I think you should probably bail

2532
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:16,192
I think this might also be

2533
02:10:16,448 --> 02:10:16,960
Be something that he

2534
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:17,728
He's now having

2535
02:10:17,984 --> 02:10:18,496
To do because of

2536
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:20,544
Yeah I think

2537
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:27,712
Sure and he's already indicated that he wants to buy Greenland

2538
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:30,528
Indicating a move towards expansion

2539
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:36,928
And making an empire of America

2540
02:10:37,184 --> 02:10:42,048
He's always been against the UN but now he's talking about how a Resurgence of nationalism is

2541
02:10:44,352 --> 02:10:47,936
Right I mean it's it's a it's not a far jump

2542
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:51,520
2

2543
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:54,336
The exact opposite of what he's based is

2544
02:10:54,848 --> 02:10:55,360
Depends on

2545
02:10:55,616 --> 02:10:56,640
Just we're doing it

2546
02:10:56,896 --> 02:10:58,176
Surprise

2547
02:10:58,432 --> 02:11:03,040
No but yeah yeah

2548
02:11:03,296 --> 02:11:06,112
But now from the last year of all the invalidation

2549
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:09,696
Its principles are conditional

2550
02:11:09,952 --> 02:11:14,304
Of course the New World Order is a conditional thing to if course it is

2551
02:11:14,816 --> 02:11:17,376
Nothing he doesn't believe anything else

2552
02:11:17,632 --> 02:11:18,400
Depending

2553
02:11:18,656 --> 02:11:20,960
Masculinity Christianity whiteness

2554
02:11:21,216 --> 02:11:23,776
And the power hierarchy that are implied within those

2555
02:11:24,288 --> 02:11:25,568
That is it

2556
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:26,848
Skip

2557
02:11:27,872 --> 02:11:34,016
Anyway one last question and that is Alex taking a call

2558
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:36,576
To get some calls and one of them wants to

2559
02:11:36,832 --> 02:11:38,112
Bring up this

2560
02:11:38,624 --> 02:11:39,648
Trump being the chosen

2561
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:41,696
Cool twitch

2562
02:11:42,208 --> 02:11:43,232
I include this

2563
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:45,792
To be a little bit of a taste of

2564
02:11:46,048 --> 02:11:46,560
How Alex

2565
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:47,328
Listener

2566
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:49,632
Are interacting with this develop

2567
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:50,912
And it doesn't

2568
02:11:51,424 --> 02:11:51,936
It doesn't seem to

2569
02:11:54,496 --> 02:11:55,008
Education

2570
02:11:58,848 --> 02:11:59,360
Conversations

2571
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:01,664
About the energy

2572
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:03,712
At churches and black churches

2573
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:06,016
None of your words mean

2574
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:15,232
And and I love Jesus

2575
02:12:20,096 --> 02:12:21,888
Connecticut

2576
02:12:24,704 --> 02:12:26,240
Message to Trump chosen one comment

2577
02:12:26,752 --> 02:12:30,336
I haven't seen Trump yet make a comment

2578
02:12:30,592 --> 02:12:31,104
That

2579
02:12:31,872 --> 02:12:33,920
Is it stupid I guess would be the word because

2580
02:12:35,712 --> 02:12:39,296
Totally do after the date

2581
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:40,320
Shooting

2582
02:12:40,576 --> 02:12:42,880
Stupid that was right on

2583
02:12:43,904 --> 02:12:47,232
She puts the comments out and in the West Rosewood endemic in a pool

2584
02:12:48,512 --> 02:12:51,328
If you can't see that Trump is doing

2585
02:12:52,608 --> 02:12:55,424
Christ-like things for this country in the world

2586
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:57,216
You can't see the office

2587
02:12:57,472 --> 02:12:59,520
The side of evil out there not looking in the right place

2588
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:00,800
So

2589
02:13:01,056 --> 02:13:02,848
By Alex's rhetoric being

2590
02:13:03,104 --> 02:13:04,384
So insistent

2591
02:13:04,896 --> 02:13:07,712
That the other side are devils and demons

2592
02:13:08,736 --> 02:13:13,600
He has on sublevel prepared his audience for the one who's

2593
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:15,648
The second coming of God

2594
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:16,672
This is not an

2595
02:13:16,928 --> 02:13:18,976
This is not a difficult for him to make

2596
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:20,256
No no

2597
02:13:20,512 --> 02:13:21,024
Seems like

2598
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:22,048
Probably would be

2599
02:13:22,304 --> 02:13:27,168
Be difficult for Alex to rationalize is hop skip and a jump

2600
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:28,448
From where he already was

2601
02:13:30,752 --> 02:13:31,264
Do it for him

2602
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:33,568
To just making this up

2603
02:13:33,824 --> 02:13:34,848
Keep the bike out course

2604
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:36,384
Of course he's God's chosen

2605
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:40,224
It's clear so far

2606
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:42,528
Any point of acceptability

2607
02:13:42,784 --> 02:13:43,552
Is like

2608
02:13:45,088 --> 02:13:47,904
Is a are there a group of people who are

2609
02:13:48,672 --> 02:13:49,952
Trying to make everything

2610
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:50,720
In the book of rap

2611
02:13:52,512 --> 02:13:53,024
Feels like it

2612
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:54,304
Like it because

2613
02:13:55,328 --> 02:13:58,912
Even reading it I was like there's no way I remember I remember

2614
02:13:59,168 --> 02:14:00,960
Specifically reading the book of

2615
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:04,800
There is no way

2616
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:06,336
Unless some sort of

2617
02:14:06,592 --> 02:14:08,128
Godly hypnosis

2618
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:09,664
That the Christian

2619
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:11,456
Church whatever follows

2620
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:12,736
Willingly

2621
02:14:12,992 --> 02:14:14,272
It must be a setup

2622
02:14:17,856 --> 02:14:18,368
Take Blake

2623
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:19,904
Zero effort

2624
02:14:20,672 --> 02:14:21,952
It should be harder

2625
02:14:22,976 --> 02:14:24,512
It's weird

2626
02:14:24,768 --> 02:14:30,144
I'm not going to ascribe any kind of thing like that

2627
02:14:33,728 --> 02:14:34,240
Position

2628
02:14:34,496 --> 02:14:35,008
Encanto exist

2629
02:14:35,776 --> 02:14:37,312
I just

2630
02:14:37,824 --> 02:14:38,592
Like Alex

2631
02:14:40,128 --> 02:14:41,664
Recognizing is Imagine

2632
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:45,504
Contagious way for the bushes

2633
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:47,040
To take it

2634
02:14:47,296 --> 02:14:50,112
Final form

2635
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:51,392
Inevitable as a

2636
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:54,720
Which form of propaganda

2637
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,560
Yeah it's it's that you know you get what you wanted

2638
02:14:58,816 --> 02:14:59,840
It's not what you wanted

2639
02:15:02,656 --> 02:15:03,168
Enter like

2640
02:15:05,472 --> 02:15:08,032
We got to get back to

2641
02:15:08,288 --> 02:15:13,152
Seems lost its way and that's the scam

2642
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:19,040
He was never Republican he was never really into

2643
02:15:19,296 --> 02:15:19,808
The gop's

2644
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:21,344
He was never into politics

2645
02:15:21,856 --> 02:15:25,952
Particularly into a Christian theocracy

2646
02:15:26,208 --> 02:15:30,560
This is achievable in his mind through Trump

2647
02:15:30,816 --> 02:15:33,376
So why wouldn't he encouraged the worst parts

2648
02:15:33,888 --> 02:15:35,424
It didn't make sense

2649
02:15:35,936 --> 02:15:38,752
Twisted way but only if you look at Alex through

2650
02:15:39,264 --> 02:15:40,544
The prism that we've come to an

2651
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:41,568
Understand

2652
02:15:42,848 --> 02:15:45,664
Dialectic

2653
02:15:46,176 --> 02:15:50,784
I don't know

2654
02:15:51,296 --> 02:15:52,320
Stances that are going

2655
02:15:53,344 --> 02:15:53,856
YouTube something

2656
02:15:54,624 --> 02:15:55,136
Exploit

2657
02:15:55,392 --> 02:15:55,904
To create the car

2658
02:15:56,416 --> 02:15:57,184
Christian fish

2659
02:15:58,208 --> 02:15:58,720
Maybe

2660
02:15:58,976 --> 02:16:02,304
I don't know whatever it is it's not good

2661
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:05,120
Very bad

2662
02:16:05,888 --> 02:16:08,704
I don't know what the future is going to bring for Alex but it won't be good

2663
02:16:09,472 --> 02:16:11,008
And I should say that

2664
02:16:11,264 --> 02:16:12,800
That right after that caller

2665
02:16:13,312 --> 02:16:14,592
Alex did say that

2666
02:16:17,152 --> 02:16:22,272
And the clocks day was going to be and I said no thank you

2667
02:16:22,528 --> 02:16:23,808
We've already got too much

2668
02:16:25,088 --> 02:16:26,880
Behind us

2669
02:16:27,136 --> 02:16:27,648
I don't care

2670
02:16:27,904 --> 02:16:29,952
Whatever they were going to talk about

2671
02:16:30,208 --> 02:16:30,720
Zoggs

2672
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:32,256
No interest

2673
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:33,536
So

2674
02:16:37,888 --> 02:16:41,216
On Monday

2675
02:16:41,472 --> 02:16:42,240
The most worrying

2676
02:16:42,752 --> 02:16:46,592
Is it will be back on Monday

2677
02:16:47,104 --> 02:16:47,616
No

2678
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:50,688
Laughed him off

2679
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:53,760
The stage the moment he said I'm the chosen one

2680
02:16:54,272 --> 02:16:55,296
That's hilarious

2681
02:16:55,552 --> 02:17:00,160
I mean we're at a place now where that's the most worrying thing

2682
02:17:00,416 --> 02:17:03,488
You know three years ago maybe you could laugh about Thursday

2683
02:17:03,744 --> 02:17:09,120
Mary's real now verifying

2684
02:17:09,376 --> 02:17:10,656
Laughing at it

2685
02:17:10,912 --> 02:17:11,936
Will be Danger

2686
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:20,640
Justa

2687
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:23,712
Ditto

2688
02:17:23,968 --> 02:17:24,992
Reminder

2689
02:17:25,504 --> 02:17:26,016
Is this

2690
02:17:26,528 --> 02:17:27,808
Lick is okay

2691
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:35,744
There's really nowhere there's really nowhere that you can go out no consequences for saying

2692
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:40,352
Jewish people who vote for Democrats are disloyal to Israel

2693
02:17:40,608 --> 02:17:41,632
Where is a lion

2694
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:42,912
Where is there a line

2695
02:17:43,424 --> 02:17:46,240
You have a president who's regurgitating protocols s***

2696
02:17:46,496 --> 02:17:48,544
Where is Hawaii

2697
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:52,640
Nope that's what we've learned

2698
02:17:59,296 --> 02:18:01,600
Underscore fighting

2699
02:18:01,856 --> 02:18:03,648
We are

2700
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:05,952
Currently

2701
02:18:06,208 --> 02:18:06,720
For now

2702
02:18:06,976 --> 02:18:07,488
Right

2703
02:18:17,472 --> 02:18:18,496
You could leave a review

2704
02:18:19,008 --> 02:18:20,288
That would be nice

2705
02:18:20,544 --> 02:18:21,312
People like to say no

2706
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:25,920
You could also go to your local

2707
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:31,040
Cigarettes they don't sell them anymore but that's

2708
02:18:31,552 --> 02:18:33,344
Secret code

2709
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:38,464
Absolutely I also thanks everybody who sent pictures of

2710
02:18:38,720 --> 02:18:44,864
The crunchy bars are the best candy bar in the world

2711
02:18:51,264 --> 02:18:52,544
Responded to my

2712
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:53,568
Bring it up with Kim

2713
02:18:53,824 --> 02:18:54,592
Infusion twitches

2714
02:18:55,104 --> 02:18:55,872
I didn't know what it

2715
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:00,224
Dad wants to put to pay

2716
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:10,208
That's what we're really

2717
02:19:12,256 --> 02:19:16,096
Chewed strategically

2718
02:19:16,352 --> 02:19:22,240
Around it to the Jelly Time.

2719
02:19:22,496 --> 02:19:24,544
Dance around a little

2720
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:29,920
I am strategy know I'm laid out by the Jesus Lizard

2721
02:19:34,784 --> 02:19:38,624
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
