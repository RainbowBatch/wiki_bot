Air Jordan sweat it

00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge b b

00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
Money

00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,280
Everybody was making out with Alex

7
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,816
Jojo

8
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,376
Jordan Jordan

9
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,776
What's up his novelty beverages that I have in front of me as a little

10
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:22,176
Call Dora Bora Bora Bora no free rides

11
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,272
I got this

12
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,552
Novelty beverage

13
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,600
The Seltzer here

14
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,624
To attempt

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,648
From Imani

16
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,208
Ewok

17
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,744
They sent me

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
Deep South

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,424
They're from here on out they sent me a six-pack of a sampler of the dram

20
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,008
Another listener Valerie brought to my attention way back

21
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,824
I wasn't able to order it from the website

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,640
Pissed off

23
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,200
Anyway I'm already sending me these G

24
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,480
And they're fantastic

25
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,784
I'd had one of them before the black

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,808
Cardamom

27
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,392
One I actually had when I came over your house for dinner

28
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:07,232
Like maybe a year or two ago

29
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,560
Are good I've not given specific

30
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,376
QuickScores that I'm the Exeter little bit more complicated

31
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
G Thang

32
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
Thank you

33
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:22,080
Evolved

34
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,360
Shelters

35
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:27,712
Set me another tip on this Aura Bora

36
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,040
I'll just another brand that apparently has some interest

37
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
Sing flavors

38
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,368
And I've tried their basil Berry

39
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,184
And watermelon peperomia

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,976
I knows we're both

41
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
Great

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
I'm finding that watermelon and mint in a Seltzer really is a complimentary flavor that you would not expect

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,312
Yeah you because it provides like a little bright

44
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
2 a.m.

45
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
Stats

46
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,896
Vu almost

47
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
The bubbles were

48
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
Kind of take away from the water May

49
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,064
Flavor

50
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,904
Train strawberries really good

51
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
Strawberries

52
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,696
It's a great flavor butts

53
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,720
Sometimes it can be a little bit

54
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,280
Sweet Basil comes in like a really

55
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
Traxxas

56
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
Hazel is

57
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,632
Hard flavored for me to think about

58
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
Yeah

59
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,448
It's not too basily don't worry about it

60
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,264
All right but I have here the first

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,056
That's risky haha

62
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,920
Cactus rose

63
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,504
I know that Rose and other

64
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,808
Serta flower flavors have been

65
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,832
Pretty well

66
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
Receive

67
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,904
Cactus I'm a little worried about

68
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,440
Prickly pear

69
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,304
So

70
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,608
I believe it's Cactus and rose bouquet

71
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
Made with real roses

72
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
And natural

73
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,216
Prickly pear

74
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,776
So I going to give this a whirl

75
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,080
Laura borek and knock it out of the park

76
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:01,408
343

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,552
Much riskier probably than cactus rose eat itself

78
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,368
Change its name to Ouroboros

79
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
That's pretty good

80
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
That's pretty good gif

81
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,184
Pretty good

82
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,976
All right good right about the

83
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,047
Involve

84
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:22,143
Either one of them is coconut lemongrass coconut okay pass

85
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,543
Remember what the last one is but they're very risky and terms of like things that I have not enjoyed

86
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
That sounds like a nightmare

87
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:34,431
One of the things that I'm starting to recognize is like a lot of these flavors that I don't like

88
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
Canby

89
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
Save

90
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,319
With the addition of something out something a little bit like

91
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,647
But I don't think I would enjoy prickly pear but I think the rose elevates

92
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,999
I don't think I like watermelon flavored stuff all that much but

93
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:53,119
Really complements it really well like a cactus

94
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
Sing for you

95
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
Who would do that

96
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,239
I said.

97
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:05,407
You got a wild hair up your ass and when you when you were in Hawaii your family Eights

98
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,223
Archetype definitely Eatonville cactus in my life

99
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
I can't recall

100
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,295
Pacific sorry and I won't

101
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:16,159
Respond to this kind of grilling

102
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,975
Gorilla grilling about grilling text Marilee grilling

103
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:23,327
It's the truth to go to the

104
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
The package bin

105
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
That's right

106
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:32,799
Hey that's right and Christy sent us these

107
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,871
Incredible Halloween chocolates that are

108
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
Airbrush

109
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,967
And painted so beautifully and perfectly with all of these really complex and

110
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,623
Using flavors much like new Seltzer's there was one that was like a limoncello cake thing

111
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,439
Andy just had the lightest of chocolate coverings around it

112
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
And you open device

113
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,255
And it tasted exactly like you would just

114
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,047
Eating a little piece of

115
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,863
The Cakewalk

116
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:03,263
So so good that's my task close the package

117
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,103
Really don't like the first of all I don't like

118
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:13,759
You're hijacking soundtracks I also don't like

119
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
Work with the crate

120
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,183
Every single time

121
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,583
Well I do it just to be like I'm doing your thing again

122
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,751
Wow that sounds delicious

123
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,847
Jordans

124
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,895
20/20 of Dan this is 20/20

125
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,503
This is actually kind of interesting

126
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
Situation because

127
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,111
Tuesday's episode with a Tuesday

128
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:54,207
I might have missed some of the stuff that happen

129
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
The show

130
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,047
But if you want Danny sent me a message

131
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,887
Informing me that this was not to be missed

132
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,447
Okay

133
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
Let's go ahead and do it

134
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:11,615
So I we've got to we've got this episode to get into and I think it

135
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
This is not to be missed

136
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:17,247
It's not right before we get into the

137
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,039
To sign up and recording true

138
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,879

140

40 phase

141
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:36,447
He likes know I would

142
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,895
Adrian one pump one cream

143
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:56,415

Thank you very much moving love dragon

152
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
Did this person

153
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
Hesitate

154
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
On the page I can't

155
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,231
I would feel really bad about trying to pronounce this because I'm going to fail

156
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,303
Except I got a message that

157
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
Said that

158
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
It'd be funny for me to miss

159
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
So I have permission

160
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
Aioli

161
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Is my first

162
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
I'll give it to you

163
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:48,639
Aoi Fe is an Irish name obviously I have

164
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
A lot of

165
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,967
Irish names of maybe I suppose

166
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:57,599
Like what are you doing

167
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
Trouble

168
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
Someone is coming up

169
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,255
So you got a how you spell fat

170
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
He always was my first

171
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,839
I guess and I know that's wrong

172
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,887
Thought about it some more in my

173
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
How could this be pronounced

174
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,983
And the other one I came up with it was leafy

175
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,519
You guys but I also don't

176
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
So what do you got

177
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,663
It didn't

178
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,015
What do you think I used to know this my dad was

179
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,855
Is really really into Gaelic he had that phase that middle-aged men have over there

180
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,159
Where am I from I need to know about my ancestors

181
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,207
I thought I got really into that too there was

182
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,487
The time where I would have been like

183
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
But

184
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,607
They just want to say that

185
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,423
I think it is

186
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,215
It's

187
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,519
However that's pronounced

188
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,967
Don't go website

189
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:02,367
That's what true we would appreciate it or what you could do is hang out in your home

190
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,951
After getting a large amounts of Halloween generosity

191
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,487
Keep it in a big bowl

192
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:11,583
All right and then whenever the young children come to you and knock on your door look

193
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,887
Looking for generosity candy

194
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
You stepped

195
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,215
Back and you throw it into their bag

196
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:22,847
You got to avoid contact with anybody and that bag is essentially a local charity or

197
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
Make sure you throw your generosity

198
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:30,783
I support the message that you landed on eventually but I cannot imagine even from a distance

199
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,647
No I know I have no idea how that's going to play out my apartment building

200
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,231
Across the way neighbors are going to knock on our door and working

201
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,791
Going to stay back wearing masks just so they're like

202
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
2 year olds

203
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,351
Can get a little Halloween action out of it

204
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
What's a all barracks

205
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,935
I guess it was in a building

206
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,007
Premeditation to at

207
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
Alright

208
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
Spider-Man

209
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Scary

210
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,967
Jordan I want to go and announce really quick

211
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,527
Before we get sat into this episode is

212
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
Is that

213
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:09,951
We are going to be starting next week going back to two episodes awake

214
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
Weird

215
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,303
Initially I went from

216
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
Ra3 episodes

217
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,375
Institute episodes because the

218
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,471
Crushing workload of listening to this b*******

219
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
Is it is

220
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055
It's hard to put up with

221
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
It took a second

222
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,871
Control on your mind

223
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,919
Yeah and then

224
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:34,271
The coronavirus situation happen to know a lot of people who are having to go to work

225
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,343
And we've felt with obviously wearing a bit of

226
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,487
Privileged situation that we can work from home

227
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,535
Show support and solidarity we want

228
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,839
Had to go back to three episodes a week for everybody

229
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:53,471
Thought baby would be a couple months and I think forever

230
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:59,871
If you listen back to those episodes were like if everybody does what they say it'll be a few weeks and then we'll be able to get onto the other side of this

231
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:04,479
Two days later everybody likes let's not do what they say we're like okay we'll see you next year

232
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:09,599
Yeah it's it's lingered on retreated back into that same like

233
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,391
Like three episodes a week and it's

234
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
Yeah it takes

235
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:19,327
We're going to be having episodes on Monday and Wednesday but hopefully at the end of each week

236
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,911
Will be able to have the bonus episode of many bonus episode The People

237
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679

00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,615
But I want to be clear about one thing

241
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
That is not

242
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,455

And enjoy

260
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,823
I feel very self-conscious about my music

261
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,407
From that episode

262
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,479
There's going to be a lot of great feedback for me

263
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,063
That's what's really important

264
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,599
Take the brunt of all negative credit

265
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:50,207
Is amethyst every single flip

266
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,023
Like I said

267
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,815
Is what we're doing

268
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,119
And yours Alex

269
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,679
Getting into like the main news story of the day

00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,239
Anybody notices audio is a little bit different

271
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,407
Planetary ruler Bill Gates announces

272
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,199
Bells will never end

273
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,295
Rockefeller Foundation document

274
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,087
For permanent

275
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
Last night

276
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Bill Gates

277
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
Publicly confirm

278
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
The plan

279
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,487
It's being implemented as we speak

280
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,559
And if civilization as we know it is over

281
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
I'm about to play

282
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:42,431
Is being interviewed and the guy was asking about like a lot of the progress that has been made in terms of the developing

283
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
World food in

284
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,503
Security things like that

285
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,039
It's been really hurt

286
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
Bye

287
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,647
Coronavirus update measures that it needed to be

288
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,671
Putting place

289
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,695
And Bill Gates

290
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,719
His response that was

291
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:01,375
Medically there's a lot of things that won't be set back as far as it might appear short but a lot

292
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,911
The progress in terms of

293
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,959
Economics stuff food stuff

294
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
Some of that stuff might

295
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
Picked I'm Yours

296
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
To get back to the place

297
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,079
We had gotten to

298
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,919
He was just acknowledging more that like their challenges and setbacks

299
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,479
Sure Alex is taking that to be like

300
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,527
He's telling you that it's going to

301
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:24,671
10 years until you'll get out of your home

302
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,487
How many different times has civilization ended

303
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,047
In the past couple of weeks

304
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,631
30 I want to say there's been a lot of ending real civilization

305
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:42,335
Cuz we're well-balanced many times he doesn't cry wolf

306
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:47,967
The kid that like words never going to get the people are just always going to come running whenever yells wolf

307
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:53,599
So you heard a little bit of a slightly different sound

308
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
2

309
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,439
The second hour to get an explanation for why the sound is

310
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:04,607
5 +

311
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:11,007
Blind

312
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,847
Lockdown at least 10 years

313
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
Inoculation

314
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,455
Total control the whole world collapsing

315
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,735
Financial destruction

316
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,015
To save

317
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:26,111
Just don't think the 1% of 1% I mean it's just

318
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:26,879
Crazy

319
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,671
It is he didn't say that he is crazy

320
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:32,255
But Alex was so mad about this Bill Gates interview that he did the first

321
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,535
Howard Stern.

322
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:40,191
You just like maybe if you have back problems you need to

323
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:44,543
Strengthen your core muscles are completely different Mike

324
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,271
Treadmill is off

325
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
Suck

326
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:02,463
I don't want to take time to exercise and to do my show I might as well do both us and Jack

327
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:08,863
His business will be done on air Middle have the rest of the day to just f*** around if he eats lunch on his show

328
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,423
You might as well work out

329
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:19,359
Bring up this business we got to pay this bill

330
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:23,199
Resource document Illinois

331
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,527
We go back to the beginning of the show now where he's standing up

332
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,319
And we get

333
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,367
A little bit of a conversation

334
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,391
And about how

335
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,439
The globalists are running a scheme

336
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,255
Write all this stuff is this

337
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
But they have to go

338
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,583
Get you to agree to it

339
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,471
Oh Alex talked about that a little bit and this is so

340
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
This is a scheme

341
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
Admit

342
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,127
10 years ago for the Rockefeller Foundation

343
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,551
Because metaphysically

344
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
There's a

345
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,391
Universal rule

346
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,951
You have to tell people what you're doing

347
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,583
God has his rules we just met

348
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,191
Even super fine print in there

349
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,983
By the way I can screw you I want

350
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,567
But still you got to get a magnifying glass

351
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,103
The globalist

352
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
How come

353
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:28,991
Contract law that you have to follow that's based on gods of contract flaws

354
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
Why

355
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,831
Like they're working for the devil

356
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:39,231
Know what is it like they get into heaven when they die if they work for the devil but follow contract law

357
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Prosecute

358
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Under contract

359
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:49,727
It's legal if you're under contract God can't touch you if you're under contract what's the consequence of breaking contract law

360
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:56,383
I think you probably get that for working for the f****** devil

361
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,199
Sure but I mean if I come sooner get fired

362
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,247
Have you considered that man

363
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:06,111
Look there is a it is a tough job market out there Satan is the only one hiring

364
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:13,791
I don't understand they're trying to avoid by following contract I don't understand what they get

365
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,583
Galax

366
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
Sick dad

367
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,911
Right but what they're doing is evil

368
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:23,775
Evil their lawful evil they're not chaotic evil then

369
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,823
It's just the way it works

370
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:33,503
Killer go outside of your alignment otherwise you'll receive a fan delete on your savings

371
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,903
Like I hid somewhere in a contract that I get to kill you I can't remember.

372
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:45,023
I like the idea that there are galaxies nowhere these contracts aren't nuts

373
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,071
He has to point out that it's galactic

374
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,655
The Milky Way has this kind of lost her

375
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:57,055
Yeah but the other ones not using random words

376
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,591
I don't think it means anything

377
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
Either

378
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,663
The globalist plans

379
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,735
Did are still following contract law or something

380
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,015
In their fifth

381
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,807
6 dimensional plans man

382
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:11,135
Why doesn't make any sense what all the stuff that Alex

383
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:15,487
Completely stupid and all the headlines that he reads don't say what he said the pig

384
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:19,839
In the third dimension but they do the 5th

385
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
Whatever that may

386
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
Okay

387
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,167
Operations are much more complex

388
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
Dementia

389
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,079
People like Gabe can't see that hot he's just a front

390
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
Please

391
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:40,831
Show me are you conceited

392
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,111
Demented

393
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,903
All the time you need

394
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,183
I would listen to like

395
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:50,303
A 6 hour lecture of Alex just really calmly methodically explaining what the 5th

396
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,655
6/7 dimensional that's what I understand what does this mean

397
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,727
Stop yelling so much Alex

398
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:01,823
If you do have like some kind of a seventh dimensional analysis

399
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,615
It really let me know what it is

400
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,175
Yeah does that mean like there are more

401
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,503
Layers to the plan like in a metaphorical way where it's like

402
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
Spirituality

403
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,159
The six Dimension is maybe like

404
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,000
Fire and the 7th Dimension is

405
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:23,072
Interpersonal communication like I don't know what it is

406
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,888
See I don't know and that's why I need Alex to explain it

407
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,544
Unfortunately he just doesn't have enough time on the show you know there's just so much there's so much news there's so much news

408
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,896
If only he had an hour thrown into his lap with nothing to

409
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
To do today

410
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,712
You get into this with that never

411
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,248
Never never have never never

412
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,296
I'm so Alec has a new product

413
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,880
I don't know babe I hate to be this is that good

414
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,928
This Doom and Gloom naysayer but

415
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,464
Is going to kill somebody

416
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
Separately

417
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
This is me

418
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,792
This is super strong

419
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,560
Types of

420
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
Can shut down the bottle

421
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
This is not good

422
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
Poisonous

423
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,520
Super strong

424
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,312
A surfaces

425
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
Art services

426
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,872
Things like that

427
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
This is here

428
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,736
Iodine surface spray with a bunch of different

429
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,272
Types of industrial I-9

430
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,064
Cleaning agent

431
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
And boy

432
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,880
It's a good deal out of the gate

433
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,648
It just came in

434
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,280
B95 you're not going to 5

435
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
Cleaning agent

436
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
Dish Anywhere someone's going to drink that

437
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:34,752
Yeah. Hundred percent products would you ingest

438
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
Love your body

439
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:39,872
He can be like this is poisonous this will kill you don't

440
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,640
Congested

441
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,664
Someone's going to f***

442
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,504
I don't even like how he was being very dismissive

443
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,904
Poison it's like no that's very poisonous and you tell people to drink when you're sick

444
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,464
The different products

445
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,328
Why would you sell a cleaning product with the same product as you're eating product

446
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608
That's an issue

447
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:04,448
I don't know and I think that there is such a distrust

448
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,472
Of like

449
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,032
Science

450
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,824
The it within his audience

451
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,128
Could easily be people who think like

452
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,408
Texas

453
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:17,248
Suggestion not to drink to write Alex's

454
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
Strong

455
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,040
Distance events

456
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,344
Stronger better

457
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
Explain to me how if you

458
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,416
You can convince somebody to drink bleach

459
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,952
Telling them not

460
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,232
To drink iodine is going

461
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
To solve your problem

462
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,048
It seems dangerous

463
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,096
I don't like to see it

464
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,120
Knock knock

465
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:37,728
Like to see is damn lineman from Europe Wars

466
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,336
Recently we've seen him pretending that that

467
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,384
Anarcho queer feminist housing

468
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,664
Project in Berlin

469
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,736
That got evicted everyone

470
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,552
Stronghold

471
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
And we learn

472
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,392
Cuz they're back on the show today

473
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,928
We learned that actually

474
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
That wasn't the

475
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
Scoop

476
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,512
It wasn't news that he was reporting

477
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,072
He was in Berlin for a specific reason

478
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:09,728
Back at back at home is definitely an eventful weekend do in Berlin I got more than I bargained for didn't know what to expect

479
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,520
At the invitation

480
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,312
The alternative for Deutsch

481
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,848
Party which is alternative

482
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
For Germany they are the

483
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:16,896
The third-largest

484
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,760
In Germany and the main opposition party if there was a trumpian party

485
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:25,600
In Germany that's who they would be and they invited me up there forever ID if it's

486
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
Experiences

487
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,160
And what you're seeing in that footage was

488
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:28,928
Just a small

489
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,696
Portion of the weekend

490
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:36,352
You're not a journalist you are a mouthpiece of the far-right party in Germany alternative

491

For Germany

492

Trumpian party in Germany

493
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
They would be called

00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Bear Lake

495
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,848

Mal peacefully

543
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,904

00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
Reality

560
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,648
Walk outside your date and like I said your house every morning and think

561
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,440
I live somewhere else

562
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:15,840
Shoot people if they insist on bringing up that realities real

563
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:19,168
That's a that's a salt then I don't live by the libertarian Prince

564
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,472
People of non-aggression towards non reality

565
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:25,312
Foundation of jurisprudence

566
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:30,688
Constitution my letters are lower case then that's what I'll tell you right now

567
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,760
Carlos has

568
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,040
An interesting

569
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
Quote

570
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,624
But I thought might be quote but

571
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,416
I think he might actually like

572
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,952
This might be a Carlos

573
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,256
Okay

574
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,304
We're not violent

575
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
Yeah

576
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,192
Or what

577
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:57,568
Things will happen

578
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,336
But you got to realize

579
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,128
Number 12 of their mechanism

580
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,456
22 enforcer agenda is instability

581
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,736
They're going to try to

582
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,272
Tip Papa land

583
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:09,344
Destabilize out our society every single day

584
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,368
So it's up

585
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,160
To gain a stability back

586
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,184
I can only way you

587
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
Is people

588
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,752
Stabilizing

589
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:31,872
5 minutes

590
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
Quiche

591
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:36,736
I mean leaving the sort of racism the end of side

592
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,880
When good men are willing to do bad things great things will happen

593
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:49,280
Scary quote I will tell you right now of all the any belief systems that I've ever heard

594
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,560
None of them were like

595
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:57,216
Well yeah I mean if you're good you got to be willing to evil the s*** out of people

596
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:01,568
It's are willing to be demons heaven will arrive

597
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,152
When people have a belief system they have

598
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:10,016
Completely rejected in order to make that belief system happened

599
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:15,136
That makes perfect sense that's a really scary kind of way to start to know that's an insane person waited

600
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:19,488
Let me hear all this like dallying around

601
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,584
He wants to get more specific

602
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,912
Assassinate Trump

603
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:31,776
Talk about bad scenarios we'll talk about Target

604
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,104
This is George Noory from Coast to Coast AM

605
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,504
Hey George I hope you are not a Target commercial

606
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,904
If you're aware where your ads are being played you might want to get those ads off there you might want to

607
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
Yourself

608
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,280
I'm going to break the first

609
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,048
Where's Dad

610
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:57,632
After kill list is not the ad that you want to have

611
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,656
I don't want that app

612
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,936
I will pay you at

613
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,472
Stratford not that place

614
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,264
It seems like

615
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,080
Association to the Tryon

616
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
Defy

617
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,432
This dude is really into talking about violence

618
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,992
Stuff but of course we're not into violence

619
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,832
Alex has a gas like that it's always

620
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,648
Best for him to try to be like let's get really specific

621
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,440
Because then you can say those things

622
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:28,096
Andy can be on my show and I can say I didn't say that

623
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:34,496
Did you hear me say like hey that's a great idea that's me pushing back on it we just talked about all sides of the issue

624
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,032
That kinda Dodge

625
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,360
So yeah you want to talk about

626
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,920
Pacifica people we need to take out in case

627
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,968
Trump loses the election

628
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,760
That's not that the mass

629
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,832
Yeah so they get to talk about this and Alex's

630
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,880
It's kind of trying to justify himself

631
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,160
By being like

632
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,440
Olympic youth Opperman

633
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,768
Let's talk worst case scenario they assassinate from

634
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,072
They say

635
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,864
Tito run freestyle the club said

636
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,680
We will dominate their supporters will put them in prison

637
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,984
Exterminator

638
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,288
This is classic weathermen terminology

639
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:11,360
Cocina Del no really mean to do this

640
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:16,480
Keith Olbermann of the weathermen

641
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,272
They wants to go out.

642
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,064
Martial law

643
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,344
God forbid

644
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,160
Who are the main targets

645
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,720
Who are the people

646
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,768
Who are leftist

647
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,328
Yeah

648
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,608
Absolutely

649
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,144
You know but here's a deal

650
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,912
Alex

651
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,960
Simple as establishing a list

652
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,240
4 Target list

653
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,520
And going after them

654
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,568
At that point

655
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,872
Very well

656
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,456
Baird at structure militias and we're real blessed

657
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:53,088
L

658
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,392
Is this the way to cut them off what you're saying

659
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:56,928
WhatsApp

660
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,024
But whenever Sedro-Woolley Western internal we have to turn

661
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:06,144
Small towns and cities and and gather our resources

662
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,240
Zakir very locally meeting areas and and use that

663
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:21,248
Itarget that's outside of her we live I think we have to cling onto

664
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:30,208
Is there an Alex and big conspiracy theory about the election that the Democrats if Trump wins are going to secede

665
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:34,304
Delete all the leftist areas unlike all the Democratic states are going to secede

666
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,376
All the times need to secede

667
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,168
That's so far right

668
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,448
Navigate Vacaville

669
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:46,848
How far right is like what we need to do is go into the middle of nowhere and ignore the

670
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,408
Big Society in Greater small group of people

671
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,432
Who ourselves

672
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:56,832
Sufficient who share everything with each other who have their own system of government based entirely upon how all of

673
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:01,184
I mean there are Elementary

674
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,208
Assertive leanings

675
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,256
Towards an archaism didn't like

676
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,584
On both sides of the political aisle

677
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,192
I know this dude is it just makes me very it makes me laugh so hard whenever they like

678
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,240
Come upon an extremely left

679
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,544
Just idea by going so far to the right

680
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,128
What's my call me a guy is like

681
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:24,736
Is argument of like let's not go ahead and kill people let's

682
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,528
Create our spaces

683
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,600
Better than let's go kill people would prefer it

684
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:33,184
That said

685
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,304
Alex shouldn't be agreeing with him because this is a nightmare that he's been saying the Democrats have planned

686
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
Bought

687
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,888
Anyway I will tell you that the first

688
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,704
3 hours of this show are not

689
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:51,616
It's mostly Alex repeating over and over again the Bill Gates has admitted that the Rockefeller plan blah blah blah

690
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:58,016
Never gonna leave your house again cuz that over and over again

691
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,552
Who yelled at a city council meeting

692
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
Not the best

693
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,672
I was just thinking this

694
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
Just a step but

695
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,536
Every time you know I never even

696
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,560
Thought about it really

697
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,376
Everytime they say we got to take out leftist

698
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,144
L

699
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,960
I would be shocked if they could name a leftist

700
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:17,984
Vitense

701
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:22,848
Right you see what I'm saying like every time they like let's take out the leftist leaders

702
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:26,432
I'd suddenly occur Soros

703
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,736
They're not they have no idea what the left

704
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:35,136
Well I don't think that you are I would be considered leadership

705
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
Really look at

706
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,440
The political aisle

707
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,768
I think there was a lot of people who would look at us as quite

708
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,792
Milk

709
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:47,936
Yeah I don't know I think that yeah it would be tougher

710
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:50,496
And certainly to recognize

711
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,800
Any real

712
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,152
Anything that's not a political shadow puppet

713
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:01,504
Setting up for them

714
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,600
TV anymore they're not getting anybody who's actually kind of leftist leaders

715
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:12,256
Bezos I know you're taking out all the people who I have f***** over the left

716
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,304
To I don't know now Jordan

717
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,352
Like I said the first 3 hours kind of

718
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,168
But then begins

719
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,216
And something really exciting happen

720
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,264
Is out sticking around for the 4th hour

721
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,592
Your listing for Paul Joseph Watson

722
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:32,992
Frontline report what is happening if you receiving this transmission you are the resistance

723
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:38,624
Daddy-O

724
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,160
London England

725
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,952
This should be up with us the next

726
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,720
10 minutes or so

727
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,512
You're stuck with me

728
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,048
Potbelly pasta

729
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,096
Riders on the

730
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,984
Home but I'm bummed

731
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,384
Riders on this song world were born

732
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,088
Good

733
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:09,856
Good

734
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,672
I just have to remember the lyrics to a song like every other

735
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:19,072
That s*** is balling up real fast

736
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:23,424
The power not on it is I forgot.

737
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,264
We now have a bunch of time Alex get

738
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,384
Explain the fifth sixth seventh Dimension and break it down

739
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,920
Unfortunately

740
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,688
Does not

741
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,064

For that

817
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,360
I don't think Alex is drunk

818
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,152
I think he's being passive

819
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:17,920
Progressive

820
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:26,368
Scheduled up all is on the schedule

821
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,952
All right and I said this is the manager

Tables for a day

824
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,656
And lashing out with a racist character

825
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,288
Also the other side of it is like Alex isn't really that

826
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,056
Good

827
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,080
At

828
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,616
Anything serious

829
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,920
This is about as good as

830
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,200
Chicken dip

831
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,992
He's billing time

832
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,784
Instead of like

833
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,088
Actually focus and do anything he's just going to do

834
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,368
Is dumb character

835
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,136
And then

836
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,184
We'll try and cover some of the news

837
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,976
Wow being the character

838
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,072
We in the World Health Organization do not

839
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
Advocate

840
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:12,448

841
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,728
Tupac

842
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:17,824
You know this Alex Jones told you this way mon

843
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,920
Now because they get blamed for that they don't want you to think they then

844
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:27,040
Chinese dragon did it all

845
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,576
Raccoon video

846
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:35,232
So this is what's real

847
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:39,584
This is not real too don't have a boss it flies

848
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:45,984
Yeah it's strange Alex I'm not positive has actually seen that full clip of the world

849
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,056
World Health Organization

850
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,872
Interview with the guy with Andrew Neil on the

851
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,663
The Spectator

852
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:58,015
What about you

853
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,551
Method of

854
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:03,135
Of dealing with it good when you need to buy time

855
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,415
That kind of thing

856
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:08,767
I don't think Alex has heard that full clip because it starts sounding not like

857
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,791
How Alex Costa

858
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
Describe

859
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:17,215
Because Alex has described it as the World Health Organization

860
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:22,847
Alex realizes

861
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:29,503
I need to talk over the truth

862
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,551
So I need to distract people

863
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,087
Pine Lodge

864
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,391
We'd rather not do it just look about

865
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:40,511
The tourism industry for example in the Caribbean

866
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:45,887

00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,783

872
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,743
You know I just like

873
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,279
Thinking about all the adult

874
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:17,375
Yeah I like thinking about being in the imaginary adults

875
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:21,471
Even the interns who are like 17 have to be sitting there gone like

876
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,751
Goddamn

877
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:27,359

I want to apologize in advance for this next clip

883
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,207
The reason I'm apologizing

884
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:45,023
Two-and-a-half minutes long

885
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:48,607

900
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,335
I have to pause

901
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,871
Is just to say this is

902
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,919
Horrifying

903
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,479
A defensive end

904
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:14,879
Distance to describe this is this is one of those things that I hate the most because it come it makes me look like a terrible person because it fits

905
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,951
Something happening at like an open mic or not

906
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:22,303
Everyone in the audience is staring with their jaws wide open just like

907
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,655
How is this possible and then they would turn and look back at me

908
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,471
Howling with laughter because this is funny

909
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,751
And its own butt

910
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,055
Because you're laughing

911
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,103
It's

912
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,919
Alarming to see someone

913
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,967
Perform something like this

914
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:44,319
But it's remarkable to see a room not respond to it

915
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:48,927
Someone's thinking this is like

916
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,207
Emma

917
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:57,375
I was listening to this and I did not I did not get any amusement out of it

918
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:01,983
Still going I thought it was pretty remarkable

919
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:08,127

00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:53,343
What if your existing wood burning fireplace and not spend thousands doing it

933
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,671
How to serve cider to hear that going to commercial music

934
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,951
I just

935
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,511
I mean

936
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,583
That went on

937
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,655
It did that went on for a long time Dan oh yeah I did

938
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,191

939
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:08,959
Improve

940
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:12,543
No for a little while he kind of found a m

941
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,335
How many American Dad

942
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,895
There was almost a point where he had sort of a verse

943
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,943
Chorus structure going

944
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,991
Yeah real terrible

945
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,087
I questioned whether I should

946
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,623
Actually play that

947
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,159
But it was so surreal

948
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,463
Yeah and a half minutes

949
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:32,255
He did that improvise

950
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,583
Effective

951
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,607
It racist

952
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,703
I mean that's just wild it's

953
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,751
It's lashing out though

954
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:49,151
Yeah yeah I don't think he's drunk he's not acting like he generally does when he's done

955
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,783
Yes yeah yeah

956
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,343
Yeah man

957
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,367
I'm trying to

958
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
I-88

959
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,415
So how would like

960
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:04,255
Dipped into the Batman theme for a little bit like from the old Adam West

961
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
Show

962
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,839
Wild wild

963
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,631
What wild I think we can

964
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,167
Say though

965
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,703
Without any kind of

966
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,471
Confusion

967
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,263
And that like that was an attempt at humor

968
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,823
He was being chronic yes he did

969
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,615
Yeah he thought he was

970
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:22,431
Sometimes something is so racist

971
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,455
Said it like

972
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,735
And sends offense

973
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,295
And turns into you're a raving

974
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:30,879
Insane person

975
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,927
Yeah it's it's obvious we race

976
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,463
But it's also like

977
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,839
What are you doing what are you doing

978
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,887
What are you doing

979
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,679
Alex was trying to be funny

980
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:44,959
I'm certain

981
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,495
Man that's

982
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,615
They're the ones who can't

983
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,407
Yeah man

984
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,711
The left doesn't have humor

985
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,503
He has humor

986
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:00,319
Okay that's a bit that's a bit

987
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,087
That's it

988
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,111
Travel

989
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,159
So turns out

990
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:06,207
A lot of people have been asking

991
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:08,255
Anna time so sad now

992
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,303
I'm so sad that they think that's humor

993
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,095
What's up darling missing out on

994
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,399
So much Jordan I don't think they do

995
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,447
Okay well that might

996
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:19,519
Maybe some of the audience but I can't imagine

997
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:22,079
They're being people even who work there who are like

998
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,127
This is good this is

999
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,407
Molting

1000
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:28,735
Thank God he didn't stop at 45 seconds

1001
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:34,367
It was more there's more gold in them thar Hills

1002
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,903
Berry Gordy listen to this

1003
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:42,047
I I can't imagine I can't imagine it was anybody laughing

1004
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,327
In the room

1005
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,863
Other than maybe smoke

1006
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,911
I can't believe he's doing this

1007
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:50,239
I can't believe he's laughing at Alex

1008
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,799
Alex

1009
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:55,103
Hey man what are you going to be on Rogan

1010
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,175
By the way

1011
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,271
That we're going to have

1012
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
Yeah no s***

1013
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,671
They're going to have the next few days

1014
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,279
Call Joseph Watson was supposed to be here

1015
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:20,703
I can more than easily easier

1016
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:32,223
Do you know how much of a struggle it is for us to get through the next hour

1017
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:32,991
It is

1018
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:38,623
Directly proportional to the amount of ease with which he can get the problem

1019
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,743
I've got another one let's take it from the top boys

1020
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:50,143
I guess Alex is saying that he's never going to be on Rogan or he's going to be on in the next couple days

1021
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:53,727
So I guess we'll see maybe Monday is episode will be another Rogan episode

1022
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,263
We'll find out

1023

Yeah I agree I think that there is

1025
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,455
A little bit of a vibe

1026
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,223
You can get here

1027
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:04,991
Where Alex

1028
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:05,759
Insinuates

1029
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:12,159
The Paul often pretends to have technical difficulties in order to have sex with hot glue

1030
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,183
Weather

1031
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,975

1034
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,095
Doesn't look like

1035
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,631
Absurd

1036
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,679

00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:26,751

In my house right now

1039
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,639
Either that I got a super hot chick in my house

1040
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,943
We all know that's what Paul Business yellow

1041
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:42,623
But instead of like you said hi at the super hot Brazilian check at my house or whatever

00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,671
He calls and it says 0

1043
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:45,951
I'm sorry

1044
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,255
I need time to get the power on

1045
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,839
But it doesn't look like the power will be turning on anytime this year

1046
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,703
Communication

1047
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,239

1048
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,519
You want to work with me

00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,103
We don't need ball

1050
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:06,431
I don't know

1051
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,455
I don't know

1052
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:13,855
Also I don't know if Alex is being serious about like Paul canceling to have sex with strange women but

1053
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:18,207
I probably would appreciate this cuz I think Paul's married

1054
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:24,607
Yeah I was I was supposed to say I'll have a significant other I know that he at least has been in a long-term relationship

1055
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:28,703
I know that I don't care about people's personal life

1056
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,519
And I heard Paul mention his girlfriend at least

1057
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,335
And Alex has referred to her as his wife

1058
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:39,455
I don't know I feel like if this is how it's being it anyways

1059
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,223
This is

1060
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:42,015

00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,527
Consistent

1117
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,599
An experience that was listening to this of like

1118
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:26,623
B

1119
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,647
Dying

1120
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:28,671
It's just like

1121
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:36,607
Alex you have to believe you're funny to try

1122
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,471
Pull this s*** off calls

I don't know

1125
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:49,151
Alex doesn't know what metaphorical metaphysical or satirical make

1126
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,175
Anyway

1127
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,967
He has a lot of time

1128
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,527
Rambling about how Paul is dating this

1129
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:57,855
Imaginary racist Dragon who's actually she use Q

1130
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,391
It makes no sense

1131
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:01,951
It's very dumb I do like the idea that Alex is

1132
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:02,975
Just trying to tank

1133
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,023
Paul Joseph Watson

1134
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:08,607
So hard that he has no choice but to never do this

1135
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:15,263
He's also trying to show

1136
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:18,591
Art teacher Paula lesson if you want to take a day off

1137
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,615

Alex

1140
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:32,671
He tries to make a big deal out of how mysterious is set decoration so hard

1141
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,463
Again

1142
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,511
This is how you're choosing to fill time

1143
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,815
There's no content here just

1144
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:44,447
Turn everything on the show

1145
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:48,287

Roman-style

1148
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,647
Simple

1149
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:09,279
What do they call that in wrong where you would have the symbol of the eagle

1150
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,775
We have a name for it will just sit here

Triforce inoculations everybody World garbage lockdown

1154
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,063

Eagle Ramen standard

With a real skull

1163
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,471
A broad edged sword

1164
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,031
What does that symbolize

1165
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,359
What's esoteric you project onto it what you think

1166
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,663
Give me a shot of velocity

1167
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,687

I mean his chessboard in a skull in a rose

1172
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:15,839
So easy to fill it out I can feel an hour so easily

1173
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:20,959
This is if all the sudden you like walked away and I was like

You know what I see when I see a whiteboard cuz there is anything written on it then I see untapped potential that's a tabular

Being really desperate like a why doesn't anyone make conspiracies out of the weird things that I choose

1182
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:55,775
To put on on-screen only for people to think they're weird

1183
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:58,079
Why don't people take the bait

1184
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:04,479
To speculate about why I got a skull here when I've explained repeatedly to my dad's

1185

We talked about that a bit

1191
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:21,887
Pulling these papers

1192
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,591
You've heard of radio

1193
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:31,615
You've heard of life

1195
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:35,199
White Noise rain sounds for 3 hours

1196
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,991
What about putting YouTube out of play

01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:40,063
Rush Limbaugh crackling paper 3 hours just like

1198
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,719

Play Locked Up by Joe Budden

1224
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:11,711
A bad idea

1225
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,087
Why is it only Brown realize he's like

1226
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,391

Paul's not answering

1239
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:11,615
That really extra kind of made me sad

1240
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,151
Because

1241
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:20,831
If Paul cared at all about his job he would have answered that we did not care at all about your job

1242
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,367
Hurst email and

1243
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:27,999
An hour before his he was supposed to go up saying I will not be there till then he is not there

1244
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:30,047
Alex realizes like

01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:30,815
Alright

1246
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,607

01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,831
Let's Get Serious then

1257
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,623
Babylon important things to cover

1258
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,671
Is a lot of important news to cover

1259
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,975
He's going to get serious for the end of the show

1260
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,511
Then come back for the last time

1261
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,535
I mean it

1262
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,815
It's kind of the same thing

1263
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,863
He basically just start

1264
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,167
Play comedy videos

1265
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:10,751
The Tim Dillon comedian Tim Dillon

1266
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:16,127
Sacrifice

1267
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,407
They're feeding on you

1268
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,431
Here's one more

1269
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,271
Here is a Tim Dillon doing is a little promotion of New York City

1270
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,807
Trouble

1271
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,087
Dillons

1272
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,367
Comedian

1273
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,671
Who has been on Alex's show in the past

1274
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:30,975
And

1275
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:34,559
He's also been on Rogan a bit

1276
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,631
Alex is talking about him in ways

1277
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:41,983
It sound a little bitter because there's like he's broke

1278
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,007
Logan's favorite comic

1279
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:48,639
Sure because Tim will come on Alex's show it's not like

1280
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:52,735
It's a bridge he's trying to burn but there is still a petty

1281
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:55,551
Bitterness that you can sense there

1282
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,111
Until you plays like two or three

1283
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,135
Tim Dillon

1284
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:04,255
This is him getting serious to end the show unreal

1285
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,559
Udoka

1286
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,375
After those comedy videos

1287
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:13,727
And that's the big secret is not Tim Dillon it's not Joe Rogan

1288
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,335
We found out this morning

1289
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:21,151

1290
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:29,087
That's not called fake news that's called a joke

1291
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:31,903
Haha

01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,023

01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:49,823
Better than ever

1298
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,663
This is what happens when Paul

1299
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,199
Josephine Watson

1300
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,527
Do not show up for it

1301
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:02,111
A lot of time this is what happened

1302
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,903
When you piss off a rug

1303
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,583
What happened to your car out there this is your world

1304
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,399
Stop

1305
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:18,239
Seriously though look at really serious

1306
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:27,455
Wow

1307
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:30,271
Inject it into my veins Dan

1308
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,039
Wow

1309
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,063
Bad news

1310
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:36,671
Hostile work environment

1311
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:41,279
That is not where I would what I would be if I was Paul I would to hear that and be like

1312
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:43,839
Good thing there's an ocean between us

1313
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,863
Dickwad

1314
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,655
That's that's real

1315
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,959
Teddy bear

1316
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:53,567
That mean everything about that 4th hour was

1317
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,615
Nonsense

1318
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,639
That was a train wreck

1319
01:06:56,895 --> 01:07:03,039
Yeah yeah not in the way that we've often see it

1320
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,063
What he was doing

1321
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,367
But there's a lot of times that we seen

1322
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:11,743
The show go completely off the rails due to either technical difficulties or Alex being f***** up

1323
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:18,143
I just accuse lashing out I think everything that you see there the racist song The Paul's dating

1324
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:18,911
Qingji

1325
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:21,471
The sniping at Paul

1326
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,263
The bitterness about Tim Dillon

1327
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,311
I all of it

1328
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,079
I just

1329
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
It just seems

1330
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:31,455
Like now that's exactly what

1331
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:37,087
12 year old bullied like that's not even like childish behavior that is a man

1332
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:39,903
Who is like revealing to all of us his brain

1333
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:41,439
Has never managed

1334
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,463
To grow Beyond

1335
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:45,279
Is a twelve-year-old child

1336
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,071
Then somehow he's gotten away with it for this

1337
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:53,471
I think it's really remarkable that like your you have this existing as of the same show you have like

1338
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,519
Do you know the first

1339
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:58,591
We get the beginning of it there's a girl Bill Gates

1340
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:04,991
Did an interview and he's admitted he's going to kill everybody blah blah I'm going to talk to this guy who yelled at a city council meeting about me

1341
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,015
Kill list

1342
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:08,319
Of leftist leader is and then

1343
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,623
Our Town need to secede

1344
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,695
Devices

1345
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:19,839
Ominos lash out at Paul for an hour on my show instead of do anything meaningful

1346
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,119
Lipsitz

1347
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,935
That's

1348
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,031
It's something

1349
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,079
I can't believe

1350
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:33,151
Can't believe you still work there Paul

1351
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:35,711
I mean

1352
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:38,271
Well I mean as we know from the deposition

1353
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:41,343
That he did

1354
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,391
Contractor

1355
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,671
I can't believe

1356
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,463
Alex must pay well

1357
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:52,607
This was an episode

1358
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,143
Primarily because of that

1359
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:58,239
Very strangely racist offense

1360
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:01,823
Remarkable is

1361
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,943
One might remark upon.

1362
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:17,951
Otherwise the contact is very very normal

1363
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:24,351
Standard Alex stuff appreciate Alex breaking up the monotony with that

1364
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:30,239
Petulant

1365
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,519
Appreciate that

1366
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:37,663
Maybe the seventh dimension

1367
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,199

1368
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:45,599

Three episodes

1376
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:12,479
Of contents no it's that we can't do three episodes

1377
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:19,135
This show I'm glad that you you brought that up in the specific event it's not gross

1378
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:22,463
Gross the workload

1379
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,743
8

01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:26,303

80 hours

1383
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,655

Alex Jones

1385
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:33,215
My break

1386
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:36,031
Especially when his stuff is this dumb

1387
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:38,591
If you was actually coming with like

1388
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,663
Primary sources interesting stuff

1389
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:46,015
Conspiracies that could possibly be true but old what about this should feel like

1390
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:46,783
Then

1391
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,063
I'm always

1392
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,415
The Bill Gates going to kill everybody

1393
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,463
And also I'm mad at all

1396
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,559
