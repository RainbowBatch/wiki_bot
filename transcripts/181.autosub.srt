1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Beverages

3
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,664
We had

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,992
Pretty much exhausted this bit beyond

5
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
This version of the B last episode well you know way too much about Alex

6
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
I also know way too much about Alex degrees of where our lives

7
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,584
You know a little bit

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,984
I found it very juicy business

9
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,664
I know a little bit more about Alex Jones knows a little bit

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,320
We both made up our minds

11
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:16,288
2 layers

12
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,360
You so much to Christopher

13
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016
Christopher Robin

14
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:32,672
He's our new sponsor very excited about hanging out

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,512
I was at 7

16
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,560
Christopher Robin

17
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,840
Although

18
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:46,240
I wasn't allowed to play Christopher Robin

19
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,312
Father with the best of them

20
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,664
Let's get into

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,552
Play me where you at

22
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,368
To start things off with an out-of-context drop

23
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,328
Singer Flora

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
In the video

25
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,496
Finger Soros

26
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:24,896
Best additive of hours

27
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:30,016
F************* people only for the first few minutes

28
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,000
Harold buddy our good friend

29
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,816
Living his best life Rodger Stone get

30
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,864
Without being named in an indictment

31
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,912
Of 12 Russians to hack

32
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,728
Soros

33
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,312
The entities the DNC leak

34
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
Guccifer

35
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
To point out

36
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:01,760
Rodger Stone was forced to go and embarrass himself on television

37
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,296
You talking about

38
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,160
My favorite part

39
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
You released

40
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,744
Messages

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,144
Completely a one-to-one match with what is later in the day I am say there's probably

42
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,776
You were saying that Rodger was thrown I think it was a little bit but I've realized it wouldn't

43
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
Through him the most

44
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,616
Is the Chris Cuomo

45
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
Cuz big catchphrases

46
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,688
Before I could

47
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,968
To take the power out

48
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,272
What Chris Cuomo said

49
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,832
I know I know they can indict a ham sandwich

50
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
And I think Rogers

51
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
F*** are you son-of-a-b**** before

52
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:55,520
The first thing we should say

53
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,568
I know you're going to try and cut me out

54
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:01,152
And then they're going to be like I don't know what to do

55
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,736
You know what he's like

56
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:09,344
Rodger good

57
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,744
Interview with Rodger Stone

58
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,351
Version

59
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,631
Because he's always

60
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,911
Against Alex Jones

61
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,007
He's up in that world or just yell at people

62
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,895
Racially charged

63
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,295
He called Don Lemon a mediocre negro

64
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:41,855
At least

65
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:48,255
Remember the specifics

66
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,839
He could be slippery in a way that he's baiting you make

67
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
Trying to make you angry

68
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:59,519
We can't really play that game it doesn't ruin

69
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,407
Playing

70
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:09,247
Whatever it is

71
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,807
Winamax or something like that

72
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
Alright

73
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
Rodger Stone

74
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,231
Is no competition whatsoever

75
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:25,631
Rockin Jump

76
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:33,567
This is level I'm out of practice with children

77
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,687
Troy

78
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:45,087
In the morning in the evening and nobody

79
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,391
Live from one sentence

80
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,439
Myself and everybody be like

81
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,767
Yeah I don't know that's the smarter thing to do

82
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,863
I like I like realizing the baby his muscles

83
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,167
Proceed more than we realized

84
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,495
Well

85
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
This is interesting

86
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
Because

87
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,335
When we started the show is beginning

88
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,103
2017

89
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,223
We largely focused on going back

90
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
2050

91
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
The beginning of

92
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,183
I want to do all that much of us looking is looking at 26

93
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,999
Because if you came

94
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
Fairly pointless once we realized

95
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,351
The transition for Alex

96
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:32,703
Trump seems like it wasn't all that important

97
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
I realized

98
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
You look at that indict

99
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,151
I thought maybe it would be interesting to go to

100
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,479
The exact date after Rodger

101
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,807
Definitely is in contact with Russian hacker

102
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:53,951
Okay see what happened on Infowars see if there's anything

103
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,511
Something that is very interesting to me

104
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,351
Is it there is a YouTube channel that I largely get most of my episode

105
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,655
It's from the guy

106
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,239
Why the channel on YouTube

107
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,847
Clearly in

108
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,151
With Alex Jones

109
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:17,759
Permission to post by the hour up to

110
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,783
There's a chunk of

111
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,111
Alex's first our second videos

112
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,159
You have any commercial free

113
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
Empire show after

114
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:34,143
Everyday I don't think it's one guy I don't understand

115
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
How I never thought to ask like

116
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,775
If he is just reposting it Alex Jones videos

117
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,599
All of the Special Report

118
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
Aeropostale

119
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,535
Like the War Room

120
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,935
Mike Adams for the Sunday Show Now who cares

121
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,983
How's my episodes

122
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
Search for August

123
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,543
16th 26

124
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
16

125
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
Nothing

126
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
What are the only episodes

127
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,223
Epson does not have on his

128
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
You can find August 15th

129
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
You can find August 7th

130
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:31,487
It interesting that this episode is not that one specific

131
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,767
Explanation

132
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,583
Entirely possible baby was sick

133
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,911
Maybe you know I don't know we had an episode go missing

134
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,495
Possibly you know there is a benign

135
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,287
Malaysian that I would accept

136
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,591
Although it looks very sketchy

137
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
Now that's

138
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
Is that because

139
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
August

140
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
Rodger Stone was in contact with

141
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,599
Alright by the time Alex is on here

142
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,463
But on the 16th

143
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,023
August 16th

144
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,423
2016

145
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:18,079
Context clues

146
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,871
Going around

147
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
You're like

148
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:25,759
Grin is delightful

149
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
Yeah probably

150
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:33,183
Dan has got something big coming up

151
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,791
But first let's deal with some small stuff

152
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,327
As we know it

153
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
Mostly yellow

154
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
Beers

155
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
Scared

156
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
Bad stuff

157
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,103
Rashad on Saturday

158
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,895
Shocker

159
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,735
Ewan Mitchell

160
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,039
They're own words

161
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,135
Rid of white people

162
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,999
They're selling this to the ninety-plus percent of the planet

163
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,399
This is a reverse colonialism Conquering the West

164
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,519
Populations are being used as cannon fodder

165
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,407
2008 Copenhagen

166
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
Double

167
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
One point below.

168
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,535
Is on the third world

169
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,583
So

170
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,471
It doesn't mean anything cuz easytouch remember the details of this

171
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
Years later

172
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,055
Who did on the third world

173
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
That's not that's not at all

174
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:01,759
He's using numbers where they don't belong

175
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
Copenhagen

176
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,647
Internist Alex it was released during the Copenhagen climate Summit 2019

177
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,463
The biggest

178
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
Betty

179
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,095
It wasn't just like a text message

180
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:21,471
You up you alright alright it was

181
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:27,615
To illustrate a basically a public-private Arrangement worked out

182
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
Subvert the Kyoto Protocol

183
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,711
There was between the United States

184
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,503
United Kingdom

185
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,159
But the issue the people had with it was

186
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,975
It made a distinction between power levels of countries

187
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:48,863
Which was stigmatizing to countries that were vulnerable countries

188
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
What

189
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,471
People are going to get that and the fact that you don't

190
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,567
I was really trying to focus on the

191
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,871
You said power levels

192
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
Power level 9000

193
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:06,783
It's over.

194
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
Anime

195
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,623
This is why I don't get it

196
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
Dragon Ball Z

197
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
Now Goku

198
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,463
He is

199
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,447
A listener do Love Your Dragon Ball Z talk so maybe we should keep going

200
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,615
The planet

201
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Freezer

202
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,943
A problem

203
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,503
So the second problem was that it

204
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,343
I took power away from the UN proper and allowed other end

205
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
Implementation

206
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,463
Concerns of climate change rules

207
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,047
And then we get back to the numbers that Alex is talking about it it's not packed

208
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,631
It made an imbalance between rich and poor countries in terms of admission

209
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167
Standard

210
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,495
Or rich countries they could admit two points

211
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
67 tons

212
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
Per capita

213
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,079
As opposed to poor countries with 1.7

214
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
.44

215
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,639
So that is about double

216
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:10,527
Or so

217
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,623
Talk to the choir fervor during the climate change

218
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,415
Conference in NY to

219
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
Summer

220
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,887
Craigslist in a way that makes sense

221
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,423
If I understand correctly

222
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,519
The rich countries are allowed

223
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,591
Far more leeway with their admission

224
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,919
And despite the fact that the poor countries

225
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,503
Probably relies further upon those emission

226
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,807
Not be poor

227
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,623
Write in order to break out of

228
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,463
Principles

229
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,999
Just a little bit

230
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:56,351
Building up

231
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:02,239
Yeah and you'd hope they just by virtue of newer Technologies we have they would have a lower admission rate

232
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,639
Whether or not there was a cap there or anything like that you could do it as like well rich people get to drive in a car

233
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,431
Can poor people get to drive the car

234
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:17,087
You could

235
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,647
Correct referencing this as like

236
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
Something that's

237
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
Do you know

238
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Being done

239
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,767
Clandestinely

240
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
Brett

241
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,543
Is there tax exempt

242
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:44,223
True

243
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
It's really made me

244
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,087
Tax exempt

245
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:55,487
Idea

246
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:01,887
Hours of private corporations

247
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:06,495
World population

248
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,799
How do I dice actually in the documents as well

249
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,431
That means the enforcers

250
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
Alright

251
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
Really bad plan

252
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:31,583
We're going to get here in a little bit.

253
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
Are there is

254
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,631
Like what

255
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:37,983
Sphere of illegals coming in

256
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,639
You know how the government even under Obama

257
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,431
Deported

258
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,735
Almost like a million people

259
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,807
They were really planning like in short order

260
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
2

261
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Deport people

262
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
Give them back

263
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:07,167
T-Mobile Arena

264
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,215
If it's a really adhere to British

265
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,799
There's no doubt

266
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,687
When he says the old

267
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,855
Right right

268
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
Keystone

269
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,463
I'm so whatever I don't care

270
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,839
I still think this is more interesting to present-day quite frankly

271
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,167
Already we're a couple Clips in and I'm already like

272
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:44,287
I'm bored interested said something about that

273
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,823
Climate change

274
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,943
That you confirmed is true

275
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:58,623
The best-case scenario for Alex

276
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:04,255
Present

277
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
Just lies

278
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,815
Well here comes another lie

279
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,423
Fun with a decline of

280
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,471
Define partition

281
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:18,847
Gallows humor but this is going to be an incredible

282
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:24,223
Research Institute study

283
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:30,367
Democratic election fraud on a massive scale

284
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,671
From

285
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,791
Bernie Sanders

286
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,607
And a Republican

287
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,191
Donald Trump

288
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,591
About 5

289
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
The big news

290
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,735
I actually disagree does much bigger news but this is his big nose

291
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,807
So he's big news if there's this

292
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
Attitude

293
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,439
Study

294
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
What are you

295
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
What's that noise

296
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:15,423
I was just saying

297
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,359
Spoiler alert

298
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:32,575
Don't even get both right you don't even want a review

299
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,391
Paper claiming to show election interference

300
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,767
It asserted that Hillary Clinton did better in states where there was no paper trail to vote

301
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,303
Follow back

302
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,655
But even just a cursory glance over their data shows that they didn't complete job with data

303
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
Bay County

304
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,007
Where there were multiple ways of provoked

305
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:57,407
Yeah machines with paper trail where there were multiple

306
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:04,319
Other machines with no paper trail they just counted the entire State as one with no papers

307
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:11,231
Okay I got you completely just incomplete

308
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:17,631
Percent paper trail but not 100%

309
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:23,775
Yeah is this ever

310
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,543
Because data is

311
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Corrupt

312
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,615
It's not because it's not indicative of

313
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,407
Reality

314
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:34,783
Pruitt

315
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,183
Students axle

316
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:47,839
Tilburg University in the dialects and Rudolfo Cortes Barragan of

317
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,863
Stanford University

318
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,679
Call the bird report

319
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
Published

320
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,727
And pushed on social media

321
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,775
Even the authors admit

322
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,591
In the paper that no time to pee review any of their Phi

323
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,175
So what this is something

324
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
Classic in Fort Worth

325
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:11,391
Go for it but I mean

326
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:16,767
There there's a conversation to be had possibly about the unfairness of the

327
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,303
Democratic National Convention

328
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:24,959
Clinton endorsing

329
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,151
Not like this

330
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,711
And brings home like how little Alec really cares

331
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
About the things you talk about

332
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:41,599
You could bring in something real but instead you go for it you much flash year

333
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,903
The fast-food version that isn't

334
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,927
Actually beef

335
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:49,279
Or whatever

336
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:53,887
Millions of listeners

337
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:59,007
Have you ever trusted

338
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,287
I'm not sure

339
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,335
Untrustworthy names

340
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,871
I know that there's one

341
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,407
It's too white

342
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,967
The name Rudolfo is

343
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,015
It makes me think of like

344
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,111
A reindeer from the North Pole going on vacation

345
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,416
Cancun

346
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:22,560
I like trying to fit in he's got a mustache fake mustache in prison

347
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:26,656
Player to it is what you're trying to lay low during the summer months

348
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:31,776
Down there having some surveys

349
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:36,896
My nose blue nose reindeer

350
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
How do you say rich

351
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
I just know French

352
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:48,416
Are you awake

353
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,464
Soros

354
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,512
Emails

355
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,864
And stuff like that

356
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,448
Earlier

357
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,776
Females

358
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
Mirror Dave

359
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,944
Before that apologies for interrupting and screwing up the

360
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:16,576
But there is something I think is interesting about his

361
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,112
Is Nonpoint

362
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Then he makes

363
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
Steal the election

364
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,280
A burning

365
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,352
And then and then he says that they aren't

366
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,632
Was trying to steal it

367
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,960
But one of them one and one of them lost

368
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,496
Which is

369
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,824
Really interesting to me in a reflection of how

370
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
Politics actually works

371
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,176
Like the Republican moderate

372
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,200
Whatever it is

373
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
Have

374
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,504
0 control

375
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,808
Like it's all lunatics

376
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,576
On the right wing

377
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,368
Where is the Democrat

378
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,416
Republican

379
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:56,000
Like Republicans from the nineties in control of

380
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,280
Actual Progressive

381
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:00,352
So of course they have a larger block of life

382
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:05,216
What's hey guys we can't be having these crazy ideas out there of like

383
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,008
People drive getting better

384
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
Stay the course

385
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,336
All all the time

386
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:15,968
So it's set up in such a way as

387
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,760
They will always defeat the crazy

388
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,576
And the Republican party set up in such a way

389
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
They will never defy

390
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,904
Interesting

391
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,720
He doesn't even really on

392
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
Yep

393
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,120
Interesting

394
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,240
Explain

395
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,264
Career

396
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:44,640
Anybody else would put up with

397
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,832
Each of those countries from Sweden to France

398
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:00,512
Online to arrest anyone criticizing Islam

399
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,096
Mayors also announced an initiative to arrest you and the family

400
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,728
Pictures of blanket George Soros

401
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,592
Arrest rate of you

402
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:20,224
I'm scared with the London mayor is in Chicago

403
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,576
Pecan wand

404
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,904
Nonsense

405
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,536
Neither you

406
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,816
Nor your family

407
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,608
North people even broadly related

408
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,216
Foreshadowing of Alex becoming good friends

409
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,080
Being curtailed

410
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,384
In England

411
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,176
UK is

412
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
Somehow

413
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,808
Question Islam

414
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,856
What I mean like

415
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,880
We have to

416
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,928
F****** pump the brakes

417
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,488
It isn't something Alex never does on his show

418
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,840
Because he lives in this dumb idealistic bubble

419
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,144
Places to

420
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
The same

421
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,448
Yet he is a national

422
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,032
He seems to think

423
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,104
Our constitution applies to every country

424
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,504
And so like when there's hate speech laws in the UK that we don't have deer

425
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,904
Exactly why we didn't have his first amendment

426
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:41,888
You want Universal Global laws like that

427
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,704
Very crazy because

428
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
I don't

429
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,776
I don't know enough like I haven't done

430
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,360
Copious amounts of research into free-speech laws

431
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,456
From everything I understand.

432
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
Confining

433
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
Super repressive

434
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,624
But they do have a lot more allowances for

435
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:07,488
Something that's interesting

436
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,280
Especially recently

437
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,840
Because they have just recently

438
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,120
Curtail

439
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,448
Free Speech laws in a way that has not been done

440
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:19,520
For a long time, where activists

441
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,544
Worried about that

442
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:26,176
Counterpoint to that

443
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
You know

444
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,272
Do we have two lakhs free-speech laws versus

445
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,552
Are we

446
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,832
It is any free

447
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,672
Free speech like going to eventually lead to

448
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,720
The suppression of speech

449
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,000
That should be

450
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
I don't know

451
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,816
I don't know

452
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:48,704
Has received Global Alliance of nationalist as though

453
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,264
Hey hey hey

454
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,224
Nationalists

455
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,504
To take out the globalist

456
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,600
Choose definitely

457
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:12,000
Definitely rely on archaic Jewish stereotypes

458
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:16,864
Is this group that we don't like wow becoming a global

459
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,888
To be against

460
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,656
In

461
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:22,240
This group we're demonizing with eighties about Excelsior mystery

462
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,360
Everything makes sense

463
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,384
Concern is much more

464
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:32,480
And I don't know I don't know I don't

465
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,528
I don't believe

466
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,368
Cuz it comes up in stand up a lot

467
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,672
Limit any speech and it limits all

468
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,000
Necessarily believe in

469
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,536
Because we have

470
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,608
Similar versions of that like

471
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,032
You can get in trouble for yelling fire in a crowded building like you can get in trouble for

472
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,080
Threatening someone with violin

473
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,896
Like they're already limits on Free Speech

474
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,432
You can't extort people

475
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,248
Like that sort of

476
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:10,624
You're given the option to get make

477
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,392
Wet

478
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,440
You can't do that to her

479
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:17,024
The idea that any limit on speech

480
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,304
Is a limited speed

481
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
I think

482
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,352
Contradicted by

483
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,632
The fact that we do have

484
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
Just basic

485
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,680
Limitations on

486
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,472
What is just

487
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:30,592
The only argument is the slippery slope

488
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:35,712
Either comes true or doesn't and it's not an actual argument

489
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:39,296
That you can really make it something you know like

490
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,576
Slippery slope

491
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,136
A logical fallacy

492
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,464
If you make an argument based on

493
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,560
Like, that's all you're doing

494
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:59,264
Earlier when I told Alex that a dumb plan you came up with

495
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,288
Listen to this

496
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,848
It's crazy

497
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,872
Notre Dame

498
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,064
1st of August

499
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,392
Means to me

500
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,952
This is how it was

501
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,312
This subject

502
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:43,808
Education program to create total

503
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:57,376
Sure it

504
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,168
And create a Utopia

505
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:03,520
Now this is Mexico

506
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,384
This is America

507
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,200
Sushi places

508
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:16,320
Nicaragua El Salvador

509
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:20,160
For all of those countries

510
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,768
Understand why those every country

511
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,840
Also has like a historical event where you're like

512
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:33,984
Forever

513
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,336
These programs have been in place as of last year

514
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:42,432
What you mean is like okay so kids in

515
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
As of life

516
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,016
Which means they're in 4th grade

517
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,552
Azelastine

518
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,088
Fifth grade

519
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,440
Bigoted

520
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:57,280
Homicidal

521
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,560
If people with white skin

522
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:05,216
I finish your thought you're going to give him 30 more years

523
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,496
The job on his stupid

524
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,888
Welfare

525
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,984
Real quick all white fears

526
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,848
The real reason that

527
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,872
Security

528
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,784
You f****** knows that most of his audiences are very scared

529
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,624
2000

530
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,464
Gene Wilder very clear laws about being able to

531
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,512
Any welfare programs

532
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
If you are an immigrant who comes

533
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,840
Legally or illegally

534
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,144
No, legally there's no way you can

535
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,448
Didn't place since last year

536
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,728
And as we all know

537
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:14,336
Democrats have complete control of the Senate that the house and

538
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:21,504
I'm right in 26 Republican

539
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,296
Baby crazy

540
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,368
But you know

541
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,416
Like those Republicans

542
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:44,544
Alex Pettyfer

543
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,848
That would be interesting

544
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,152
We can't speculate about someone's

545
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,176
Secret voting habits

546
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,200
But

547
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,272
He's

548
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,808
I want to get out

549
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:01,696
I want to get out but I can't quit

550
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,584
Money is skimmed

551
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,656
Organized

552
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,192
So what do I hold on

553
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,800
The NFL ever in organized crime rookie combine

554
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,360
They have to take the the test

555
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,152
No no no no no

556
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:28,576
We have kids being indoctrinated in schools as of a year ago

557
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,904
Elite in order to come

558
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,928
Year

559
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,952
Zayn

560
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
They are being

561
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,608
Some of it

562
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,544
World

563
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
And then bus

564
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,616
Seems like a lower

565
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:55,712
Across the border and then bust like

566
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,784
Nebraska

567
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,000
108

568
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:16,960
Like okay makes absolutely no sense

569
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:20,032
11 year old in

570
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:26,432
I dismiss it out of hand like that absolutely not I reject the premise today

571
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:31,552
But then when you talk about a fraud

572
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
1

573
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:37,440
To vote Democrat and the other one is to skim money off the top

574
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:40,768
Skimming money off the top there's better scam this seems like

575
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,816
It'll be way too many cooks in the kitchen

576
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,864
Someone would talk

577
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,680
So ineffective this Camp is no good

578
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:50,240
Secondarily

579
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:53,568
Alex is already claiming that they're just voting in dead people's names

580
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,992
They don't need this elaborate

581
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,272
Stupid planet makes

582
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,296
No sense

583
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,600
None of this even with the motivation

584
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,976
Ending ZZ villains

585
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:17,376
Are old

586
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,216
Ten Grand to get a dead person

587
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:27,616
Kaze

588
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,296
People are voting but it's actually illegal immigrants

589
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,320
Never wrestled

590
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,088
Is like the second

591
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:41,184
Third stages of the plans that he's a numerator

592
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,744
Because the other thing barely neither do the globalist

593
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,024
The other problem is

594
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,560
VSCO

595
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,584
It's got it

596
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,376
Exist

597
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
With

598
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,168
All of the other

599
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,448
Like

600
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,728
16 East Oak

601
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,104
You got have that part in there too

602
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,152
You both have to have all of his

603
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,456
Being

604
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,504
Altruistic

605
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,904
Will they have millions of people work at the globalist

606
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,208
Millions of people working

607
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,608
If you don't need that

608
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:27,264
Everybody's got a lot of games a lot of pies

609
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,080
But look we have that many people

610
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,872
You can come up with these harebrained

611
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,920
Perhaps

612
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,944
You know what

613
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,272
Sometimes companies fuk up

614
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,064
Sometimes companies

615
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:47,488
The dog on this rack money leaving money you know like whatever

616
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:51,072
Got diplomatic immunity cuz apparently that is something that the megabanks can have

617
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,144
Are you lovey ideas like this

618
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,680
International

619
00:36:55,936 --> 00:37:00,800
Cabal that existed for hundreds of years that comes down from like

620
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:06,432
The black nobility in Venice and stuff like that they also come up with like

621
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,624
International House of Pancakes

622
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:21,024
Should have figured out the whole

623
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,304
Instead of now being like

624
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,608
Haha we tricked you like no one was trick

625
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,888
We all thought this was

626
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,680
Stupid

627
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,496
Same level of like business

628
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,032
Activity that he's

629
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,336
Does fixing into the minds of globalism

630
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,360
He's been around for

631
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
Thousand

632
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,176
They don't make me

633
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,272
Everybody makes mistakes

634
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,296
Fair enough

635
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:49,696
Globalist have run so many plans over the thousands of years

636
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:54,304
Over and over again fresh

637
00:37:54,816 --> 00:38:00,192
Yeah sometimes you open up that crazy

638
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,776
Pattern

639
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,824
Let's embarrass ourselves for real

640
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,360
More pancakes

641
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,128
Guys

642
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,664
We got to do something crazy

643
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:14,272
We get it you have waffles

644
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:20,672
We can't call ourselves the International House of Crepes nobody's going to buy that s*** we hate French people in America

645
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,096
My dear friend

646
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:32,448
Go to IHOP for lunch everyday

647
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,544
Be hungover as s***

648
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,568
It was always

649
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,176
The only reason

650
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,760
Logs of mozzarella

651
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,296
Anyway

652
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
IHOP

653
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,512
Physically

654
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,984
Flagrant

655
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,800
Misrepresenting

656
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,360
Some comments that he had made

657
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,408
Alex makes the mistake of

658
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,992
It becomes very clear with him

659
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,272
Memes

660
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,576
Alex

661
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,600
He looks like a

662
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
Ding-dong

663
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
On his own show

664
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,440
So embarrassing

665
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,464
So disgusting

666
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:27,744
I love it

667
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:28,768
I love it

668
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,792
It's so great

669
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,096
Alright

670
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,376
I do I don't like

671
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,424
How he never have to live

672
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,752
Play Disco.

673
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:42,080
Any right-thinking person who listen to this

674
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,480
Absolutely trying to

675
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,040
And maybe a very nice unifying statement

676
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,320
Into something

677
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,856
That is evil

678
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,816
Message is inherently anti-white

679
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,840
Absolutely

680
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,608
Diversity

681
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,376
Is

682
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
That's what

683
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:08,960
Supremacist

684
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,008
Here is what Alex Jones

685
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,064
Process

686
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,328
Hillary's VP

687
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,680
Whites must become a minority to atone

688
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
Does real quick

689
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,728
Take a second

690
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,312
To take that in as the headline that he's reporting

691
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,872
White must become a minority

692
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,920
In order to make up for rape

693
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,200
That makes sense

694
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,064
This is the ultimate racism

695
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:00,928
Experience

696
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:10,400
We must make white cement

697
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,680
Who's going to leave this

698
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:15,008
And organize all the different racial groups

699
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,080
Is it going to put your

700
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:21,920
Different racial groups

701
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:28,576
Part of the KKK it's particularly funny

702
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:34,720
Consider racial incarceration rate for Alex stupid artist

703
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,744
Let's put

704
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:47,264
This is incredible

705
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:57,247
Is 11 Sunday morning and that was a challenge to pay and so I've made my

706
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,855
We're we're not segregated in fact we were

707
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,391
When we started there one of them

708
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:08,255
A few white families in that church it's now a very well integrated church but it was important

709
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:14,655
Especially I think the burden is on those of us who were in a majority

710
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:18,751
Put ourselves in situations where were in the morning minority

711
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:26,175
Okay so there are

712
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,015
Eminem

713
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:34,879
Percent of that identifying as a

714
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,207
The planet is Angela

715
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,231
Okay

716
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,911
Apologize

717
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,055
Everything else

718
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:57,919
Great

719
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,199
Craig

720
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,207
Identify Zengo

721
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:10,975
But

722
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,767
So we've got

723
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,583
Not only is Rachel dolezal

724
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,399
Outlier

725
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,727
She's she's just even crazier for doing it the wrong way

726
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,519
Because what she should be doing

727
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,103
Accidentally or incorrectly

728
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,407
That is 3%

729
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,431
What

730
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
What is

731
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,223
3%

732
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,015
What's the 3%

733
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,319
Fitzgerald's right Utah

734
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,879
I don't have the numbers in front of me but I

735
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,647
I can't imagine

736
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,719
I feel

737
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:46,815
Feel like my

738
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,375
My Spidey Sense tells me

739
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:53,983
Well I don't know cuz

740
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:54,751
Transit

741
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:59,871
I'm trying to find demographic information I should look that up earlier but

742
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:04,479
It's just it's just it man it feels like that's what he say

743
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:07,807
Just 500 million Chinese people saying

744
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,879
That's all he's talked about he's just talkin about

745
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:14,463
Very well publicized 500 million Chinese people

746
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,743
Who's David there

747
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,511
I mean

748
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
DD

749
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:25,215
I mean even without us being able to say exactly what

750
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,239
He's talking about

751
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:32,639
The idea of like now you're not white is the whitest thing ever

752
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,455
Exclusivity which is what we talked about all the time

753
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,247
The notion of whiteness has

754
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,295
Is based on exclusion not on include

755
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,087
I don't know

756
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
You know I don't

757
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:45,951
I wish I had those numbers

758
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:49,279
Play song

759
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,351
You talkin about

760
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:55,935
Whitney would like who does that like swarthy Italian

761
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,215
The Greek

762
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,823
I don't know man you know what the issue is it

763
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,639
Electric no matter what the answer is it

764
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,967
No matter what

765
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,039
If you talk about the Irish

766
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,343
You know what go f*** yourself Alex

767
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,159
Sure we've been the whitest for a long time

768
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:18,207
There's no sun

769
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,767
We were grown

770
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:27,679
It's disgusting that that sort of his take on like how am I going to respond after this

771
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,447
Before I play

772
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,519
Because what you're saying isn't really good message

773
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
Which is

774
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,311
Say

775
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,895
You telling a personal anecdote about the idea

776
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,479
Has one of the more segregated places

777
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,527
You have denominations

778
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:45,855
Churches that are primarily black slime

779
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,927
I'm in dub there's between doesn't usually meet

780
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:55,327
And his idea of going into places that are not where you are the minority

781
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,375
Is something that is very helpful

782
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:58,911
For everyone

783
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,191
No big deal

784
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,287
Here's what I want to say

785
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:07,359
I was rambling around a little bit

786
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,687
If you hear what Tim Kaine said

787
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,735
And you are against

788
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,551
What you were against integration

789
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:23,743
One more round or I only want it on my terms

790
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:28,351
I only wanted they come to me and come to my

791
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,399
Barbecue or whatever

792
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:37,311
Like you to put yourself into

793
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
Situation

794
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,383
Where you get to experience other people's culture

795
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,455
Respectful empowering

796
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:49,855
All and enlightening

797
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,743
I've never had the experience

798
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,279
That black people have

799
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,815
Just about every day

800
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,215
Create

801
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:12,895
How cultures actually works learn about something instead of having a character

802
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:19,295
Uno

803
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:25,439
How many times have you seen like a young white, go into

804
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:28,511
And be like I don't know how to act right now

805
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,815
Like I do

806
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,887
That was much more examples

807
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,191
Generally nude

808
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:40,799
How many more times I saw them go in and it'd be no big deal

809
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:46,175
I don't like not because people pandered or anything but because

810
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,455
When you go in

811
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,759
Situations where you are

812
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,295
You realize

813
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,599
But it's not as big a deal as you think

814
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,367
It's not a big

815
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:07,167
I wonder who's going to think I'm the other

816
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,959
If you thinking that

817
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:12,543
I cherish so much that I had growing up

818
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,311
Tubi

819
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,103
In so many different communities

820
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,943
Because like I said talk about this book my dad is a religious studies

821
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,735
Professor and so he had friends

822
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,295
Like

823
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:29,695
Spend time at the synagogue

824
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:34,559
Break bread with all these family

825
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,095
And go to their houses for

826
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,399
Whatever

827
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
The holidays

828
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,447
Various States

829
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:43,519
And it it's not a rewarding thing because sometimes

830
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,383
You know they wasn't about that

831
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,455
Is about regret

832
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,759
I really don't look much food

833
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:58,367
Picky eater

834
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:02,207
IHOP very frequently

835
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:07,839
I don't have credit

836
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,911
And that's what I was growing up

837
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:13,215
I only was around

838
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:16,543
It wasn't until I moved away that it was like

839
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:21,151
Oh I'm interested in like experiencing other cultures in meeting other

840
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:24,735
And I feel like if my family if so many family

841
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:25,759
Just

842
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:28,831
Like Dave themselves be opportune

843
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,879
Go to places where there

844
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:35,231
All the sudden a lot of those conservative viewpoint

845
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:38,303
Disappeared

846
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:41,631
Granola

847
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,799
So much more in common than they have

848
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:49,823
Auto,

849
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,847
Infinitely

850
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:55,967
Three fighting back against that and arguing nothing erase pimp

851
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:00,319
You made a point of stopping the Clipper li2se like

852
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,087
Hyzaar

853
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,623
Presenting it as like

854
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,903
The headliner

855
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:09,023
He saying putting yourself in situations

856
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:09,791
Where

857
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,559
You aren't

858
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,655
Tata

859
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:17,983
It helps

860
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:21,823
Together we have all

861
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,151
Much more empathy we have much more understanding is opposed

862
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:27,199
Staying or stupid

863
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,503
And listening to world

864
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,039
WorldNetDaily

865
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,879
Jerome corsi and all these

866
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,647
These whites

867
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,671
Supremacist

868
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,695
Tinkerbell

869
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,463
Every

870
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:41,023
Single child who was

871
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,607
On the Vanguard of school integration

872
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,631
In the text

873
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,167
You will

874
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:47,935
Never

875
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,703
Experience

876
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,239
If you're awake

877
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,519
Person how could you

878
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,287
Abreva

879
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,823
Sitter judge

880
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,359
Somebody who's been through

881
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:56,895
Unless

882
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:00,991
You spend a lot of time being in the minority

883
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,527
Situation

884
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,319
You'll never comprehend

885
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,879
And if you judge them for their

886
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:10,207
You're fuking idiot you are that's all you can

887
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:15,583
But I understand

888
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,119
Absolutely

889
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,655
Which is the fact

890
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,191
The other

891
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,639
Caucasian situation

892
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:33,759
I'm sure there's a Neo-Nazi.

893
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,831
I would go the other way I think there's a black nationalist

894
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,111
Group called The

895
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:41,439
Consideration

896
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,463
Laughlin weather

897
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,303
What has what has the SS

898
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:51,167
But the yeah it's more difficult for me to talk about that

899
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,447
Experience I don't have

900
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,215
It's impossible

901
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,287
Right there

902
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,567
My limited version

903
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,895
Of being in situations where I was

904
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,479
F****** Elementary School in Hawaii

905
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:07,807
Lakeway couple years in elementary school we lived

906
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:14,719
And me and my brother were two of four white kids in the entire school so like

907
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,815
I mean the mainland

908
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:21,887
Came back in 94

909
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:27,519
I came back and Rico your so far from America

910
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:30,847
Even even better

911
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,919
Making it

912
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:36,991
I only know the material

913
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:50,303
For a white person to ever understand

914
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,071
Black anime

915
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,383
Real-time

916
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,919
Completely lying about Tim Kaine

917
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,455
Comments

918
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,503
The only reason to lie about that

919
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,783
Stoke White

920
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,319
Beer and racial division

921
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,599
And the idea that he's

922
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,903
Arguing

923
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,695
Is Ludacris

924
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,975
And very responsible

925
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,743
Hey

926
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:22,815
You know what whenever I hear somebody call for a

927
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:25,375
My first thought you wanted

928
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,167
That's obvious

929
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,287
What are you asking me to

930
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,591
Somebody else's Walk of Life

931
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:37,919
You know what

932
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:43,039
Sounds like you would not be in the minority you know it still exists cookout

933
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,159
I think that that idea of white identity

934
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:50,463
He's kind of built around

935
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,303
It's built around exclusion not ink

936
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,167
The idea of empathy

937
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,703
Directly counters

938
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,239
Which is why

939
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,543
As my campaign statement

940
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,847
Stop Yes on white Jetta

941
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:08,895
Alright

942
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,455
Move forward

943
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:23,743
Monster

944
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,703
For social justice

945
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:39,871
I feel like that's a good trade control welfare

946
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:58,303
This guy is a Muslim I jerk off to measuring

947
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,119
He says he wants

948
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,455
Almost

949
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:18,015
Is on

950
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,111
That's astonishing

951
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,159
I mean that's

952
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:24,927
Really

953
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,999
Free races

954
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,791
No

955
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:40,799
Because we just put terrorists

956
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,335
In charge of the police

957
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:47,711
We need white terrorism charge of the police this is

958
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:49,503
Fundamentally like

959
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,295
Construction

960
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,111
Flagrantly racist trip

961
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,135
Really races

962
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:05,375
Rebuttal is always Muslim

963
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:09,471
It's okay. Brownstone

964
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:15,359
F*** I only brought that up so you can make that rebuttal to trade agreement

965
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:17,407
It's crazy I mean this is

966
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:22,015
It's all just a bond

967
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,039
Ideas like

968
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,087
Trying to do a better job.

969
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,623
Systemic

970
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,647
Racial in

971
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,695
Religiously-based

972
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:34,559
Exist online if you want to pretend

973
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:36,863
Entertain his argument

974
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:37,887
Replace

975
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:41,471
Muslim with black and you clearly see how racist it is

976
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:47,615
All of these black people are becoming police chief

977
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,663
It's clearly A Reign of Terror

978
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,687
Like what are you

979
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:53,503
F****** talking about you

980
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,039
Experience

981
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,111
Do well actually we've experienced

982
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:00,415
Pretty much word for word

983
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:04,767
I mean you let black people become president and then they're everywhere

984
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,863
This is something

985
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,239
No

986
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:15,775
Understanding

987
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,311
I knew a bit about

988
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,871
You know the white nationalist uprising

989
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,919
What happened

990
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:29,599
Yeah but I know nearly as I never watched videos

991
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:33,439
You know about Oklahoma City

992
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,511
What about the roots

993
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:40,095
Ruby Ridge and Waco

994
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,167
Similar things

995
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:48,031
And I couldn't watch this documentary

996
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,311
Inasmuch

997
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,591
Hey what I got from it is

998
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,639
Watching White

999
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,663
Just l

1000
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,455
From the early days talk

1001
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:59,039
They use the same language that Alex does now

1002
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,063
Like

1003
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,343
It's a parallel

1004
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,391
It's bizarre to watch

1005
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,183
Can you go back and watch these guys

1006
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:07,487
Who had like the the

1007
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,535
That compound in northern Idaho

1008
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,583
Are you going to listen to those

1009
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,351
Supremacist

1010
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,887
That gives their sermon

1011
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:16,447
There's so much talk about sauce

1012
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:20,543
There's so much talk about the ethnic identity

1013
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,591
There's so much talk about

1014
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,127
This replacement fear

1015
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,663
All In

1016
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,431
Every ever

1017
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,455
Everything is the same

1018
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,783
That makes me think that nothing

1019
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,551
For two years

1020
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:35,903
Very pretty

1021
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,183
Who was the

1022
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:43,583
I think I'm a little bit

1023
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,631
Mystikal argument

1024
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,679
Soupremacy showing up

1025
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,727
In full strength every 30 years

1026
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:53,567
Leggett maybe it may just be correlation but his

1027
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,615
His main point was like

1028
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:58,175
Alright so we got a s*** ton of white supremacy

1029
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,199
Bright

1030
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,991
What was 30 years before this

1031
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,343
What was 30 years before that

1032
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:11,743
Regular Nazi movement years before that was free

1033
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,023
Crash when everybody was

1034
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:15,327
Totally against Jews

1035
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:24,543
That was coming around

1036
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,823
The Civil War

1037
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,271
It's like somebody arguing that there the full moon changes things

1038
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:42,207
No it's not

1039
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:55,519
Something along those lines that was the classic quote it's a remix yeah

1040
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,799
I'm so

1041
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,591
The one thing just like R Kelly

1042
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,383
And is threatening

1043
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,175
The one thing that is not

1044
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,015
The original version

1045
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,039
Alex Jones

1046
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,319
Make bad

1047
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:13,439
Here's one of his prediction

1048
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,743
We talked to ARB

1049
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,071
We talked to our

1050
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,351
Pipeline

1051
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,887
To the Secret Service

1052
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:27,263
They added some very important information

1053
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:34,943
Dealing with Hillary staging a false flag against yourself

1054
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,479
Assassination

1055
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:43,135
That lines up with our other information

1056
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,719
Hillary's going to false flag herself

1057
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:47,999
School

1058
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,303
Seems like a dangerous

1059
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,095
Free time

1060
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,119
I'm dumb

1061
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,191
Very very.

1062
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,615
The Accidental headlight of like

1063
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:08,479
Can a woman with permanent brain damage become president

1064
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:10,015
I don't think so

1065
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:15,135
You heard that earlier when you son with a tumor eats the rest of her melon

1066
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,415
Deepen me like

1067
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:22,815
She's about to die

1068
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:25,631
Realize that clearly I didn't leave in

1069
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,935
Most of the time he's talking about

1070
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:31,007
I would say good third of this show is just him being like

1071
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,919
So

1072
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,711
We know that from necklet

1073
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,503
Braxton prediction is bad

1074
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,831
Yes multiple sources

1075
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,111
One who has

1076
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,135
The information

1077
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:47,903
One who has

1078
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,231
Interesting

1079
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,095
Steppin Out

1080
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,119
Zach

1081
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:02,751
Is not on the run yet

1082
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,567
Credible source

1083
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,615
Cuz they're probably made up

1084
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,407
These sources are real

1085
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,943
See if you can figure out what sources

1086
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:11,967
He's driving

1087
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:13,247
This information from

1088
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:17,087
This is the 21st century

1089
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:35,263
Wavelengths being sent out over the cellphone to causar

1090
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,175
That's one of us or allegory of what's actually going on

1091
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:47,039
Population

1092
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:50,623
Garth Brooks

1093
01:02:55,487 --> 01:03:01,631
May 2nd

1094
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,471
Worth it song

1095
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:07,007
Allegory

1096
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:10,335
Going up into space while you bio-weapon the whole Earth

1097
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,151
You can put You Only Live Twice

1098
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,943
Biological pathogen

1099
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,503
Runs its course

1100
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,039
Like in 12 Monkeys

1101
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,647
Designs

1102
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,535
Extreme

1103
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,327
They're telling you the plan

1104
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:33,375
Like in Andromeda

1105
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:38,239
You know how many more movies would you like this

1106
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,823
Choose another sign

1107
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,847
Action movie

1108
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,151
You could play this game with any

1109
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:47,711
Movie site

1110
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:51,039
Sure

1111
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:54,623
Do you know what Osmosis Jones

1112
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,439
There's like a rocket

1113
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:03,839
Stop it

1114
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,887
A remake

1115
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,447
I mean this this is just the sort of stuff that the

1116
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,727
Embarrassing

1117
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,287
I mean I don't know like

1118
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:14,591
If you had a point

1119
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,359
You wouldn't

1120
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:17,151
Constantly reference movies

1121
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:21,759
Because Hollywood is

1122
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:28,159
That's why he watches every move

1123
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,183
Free movies

1124
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,975
So stupid

1125
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,303
Ever actually so

1126
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,839
You've done a lot of great

1127
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,631
Thank you catalog

1128
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,167
All of Alex Jones

1129
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:42,239
Not all of them have you considered

1130
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,775
Also catalog

1131
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,055
All of his movies

1132
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:50,943
And kind of developing a unified field theory of what Alex Jones prefers in a movie

1133
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:55,295
Cuz I feel like he's a huge science fiction book

1134
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:57,343
Right but I really like

1135
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:03,743
What is Berrien Center

1136
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:10,143
You said something a little bit later than

1137
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,935
He's all over the place

1138
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,239
No I think it was a fan of David Lynch

1139
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,007
David Lynch

1140
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,031
Agreed

1141
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,591
I don't think he's actually Olympia

1142
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,479
No

1143
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:26,015
He didn't get the o.j.

1144
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:31,135
What's it like

1145
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,927
No it was a

1146
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:36,767
Whatever

1147
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:40,607
Alright

1148
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:45,215
We've been talking for about an hour now about

1149
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:50,847
Some of these Petty narratives that he brings up and the reason that you can't ignore them are the things like temp

1150
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,687
Alright

1151
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:56,991
This is so f****** rape

1152
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,551
It's crazy

1153
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,343
It's crazy to want to listen to that like

1154
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:03,135
Ignore that

1155
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,207
Clip was when I was like

1156
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,487
Oh no

1157
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:10,303
I was right to go back to this episode

1158
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:13,631
Is he starts with Alex rambling about George Soros

1159
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:14,655
Something happen

1160
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:17,471
There's no future under this new world order

1161
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:29,503
Everybody

1162
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:33,087
87 year old crazy Nazi Collaborators

1163
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:40,255
President

1164
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,311
Who wants to run the world

1165
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:58,175
Business

1166
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,487
Okay

1167
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,007
So

1168
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,031
He got a text

1169
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,567
In the middle of a show

1170
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,871
From somebody

1171
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,151
We all know

1172
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,687
Gustafer Dubai

1173
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:31,967
Rodger cell

1174
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:34,271
I got a text from Rodger

1175
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:41,695
Let's go ahead

1176
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:46,559
Cam

1177
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:50,655
Wait Rochester

1178
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:53,983
So Rodger Stone

1179
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:00,895
Wait

1180
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,175
Wait wait

1181
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,455
Wait

1182
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:06,783
You might need a while

1183
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,319
Hold on

1184
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,367
If you are

1185
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,951
Correctly

1186
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,511
This is the day after

1187
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,279
Yep

1188
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:24,191
The day after August 16th 2016 after he had absolutely been in contact

1189
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:30,591
3 / 2.0 he writes an article

1190
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:36,991
Narrative

1191
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,039
Dewar's

1192
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:39,807
To put it out

1193
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:45,951
I guess we had a byline on the hill to I'm not entirely sure I was only able to find the article on Infowars

1194
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:48,767
It's just about Hillary

1195
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,839
Would be evidence that he's

1196
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:57,471
Jit primarily comes from that Stanford article right

1197
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:00,799
Paper on a review paper

1198
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,335
Talks about how

1199
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,103
Bunch of

1200
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:09,247
Voting machines

1201
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,807
A primary narrative that Trump is going to

1202
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:14,367
Toulouse by hacking or something like that

1203
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,391
Which is sort of the

1204
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,927
Backdoor way of

1205
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,231
Right

1206
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:19,999
Exactly

1207
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,023
Creating

1208
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,095
Because it's important to do that

1209
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,119
When you're doing that

1210
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,935
That's really smart though

1211
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,471
Fairy

1212
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,519
Fun

1213
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,359
Every time they said when they go low we go high

1214
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,151
You look back at that in your life

1215
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:43,551
Oh going Louis the other problem too

1216
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,319
Who is that like

1217
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:47,391
The reality of conversation

1218
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,439
And all the information

1219
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:51,999
Is this

1220
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,279
They go low

1221
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,815
They're going to lower than you

1222
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:57,119
Like that

1223
01:09:57,375 --> 01:10:00,703
Trump insulting like that their Gold Star Family

1224
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:04,031
That's pretty f****** low

1225
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:09,407
But behind that was how much lower they were going

1226
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,687
At the same time

1227
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:15,807
Exactly or flipping a red cape

1228
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:20,671
I mean look there's no way to slice them

1229
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:26,559
This is very clear to me what's going on this is Rodger Stone creating

1230
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,143
Essentially strawman

1231
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:32,703
He's doing this because he's in contact with

1232
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:34,239
Russian intelligence agency

1233
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:40,127
I don't believe for a goddamn second at the emails and private messages that have been released

1234
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:46,015
Are the only messages of course that's not even a possibility in my mind

1235
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:48,063
There's no chance of that

1236
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:51,391
And the fact he's not named in that indictment

1237
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,927
He's jamming to him

1238
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:56,255
Oh no he's felt it would be different

1239
01:10:56,511 --> 01:11:00,607
They're saving some of that because they have more information

1240
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:02,143
If they had named him

1241
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,167
In the indictment

1242
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,703
Then you would know

1243
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:06,751
He was not part of the thing

1244
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:09,311
The fact that they kept it out of the

1245
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,359
Suggest that they are going to

1246
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:19,295
The text has more information that's yet to be connected

1247
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:21,855
It's probably further communicate

1248
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,391
Further

1249
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,415
Information

1250
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,183
That

1251
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:28,255
The probe the Mueller probe has that we don't have

1252
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:31,583
Do me when I see that unlike Rogers f***

1253
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,887
And I want to look at I still think he's

1254
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,191
When

1255
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:39,007
Saw that and I was like let's look back

1256
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:41,055
Visnic

1257
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,591
In 2016

1258
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:43,871
And I saw that

1259
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,663
Alex's Maine

1260
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,687
Archive

1261
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:49,503
YouTube channel doesn't have this episode up

1262
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:51,295
Listen to it

1263
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,831
And Alex gets

1264
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:55,903
Text Jean are to publish this article

1265
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,951
About how Hillary is going to

1266
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:00,767
Steal the electors election fraud possible

1267
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,303
Like that sort of thing

1268
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,583
Tumi

1269
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:07,679
That to me is f****** clearly indicative of something

1270
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,983
Game god dammit

1271
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,287
The balls on this guy

1272
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:17,151
To have a conversation about rigging the election and then the next

1273
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:17,919
Jay

1274
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:21,503
Write an article about how their rigging the election

1275
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:24,319
Look at his article should have been should have just been like

1276
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,855
Can you rigging election

1277
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:30,975
Years man now it gets so much worse

1278
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,767
Put your mic down

1279
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:38,143
And there's going to be more hacks a little bird told me there were other hacks

1280
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:46,591
And prepare

1281
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:55,039
I'm afraid all the emails but they released

1282
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:57,599
Election

1283
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:01,695
And no amount of false flag

1284
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,975
Soros

1285
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:13,727
You can run on for a long time

1286
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:21,663
You just admitted that you have advance notice of things that are to come and the content of those things

1287
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,711
You know what you know what that proves

1288
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,527
Alex thinks Hillary is going to win

1289
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,551
Yep like

1290
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,343
That's the only way

1291
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:32,159
That you become the weakest of Link

1292
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,439
Because

1293
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:38,559
Like you could just throw this in court never was like

1294
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:45,727
This whole thing happened

1295
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:46,495
He said

1296
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,775
On air

1297
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,823
Yeah

1298
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:51,359
And the only way

1299
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:55,199
The only way it would not be investigated

1300
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,735
Is if Hillary won

1301
01:13:56,991 --> 01:14:02,623
Oh yeah I mean is soaked

1302
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:04,671
Brazenness ND

1303
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:06,719
Aspect of him being like

1304
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:12,607
A little birdie could Rogers.

1305
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:19,007
Before the podesta emails before Rodgers

1306
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:25,407
Is still to come Rodger absolutely have things that are about

1307
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:27,711
And Alex is reported this stuff from

1308
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:31,551
Another outlet from the GR

1309
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,855
Like this is very clear like I don't

1310
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:38,463
I don't know any other way to slice

1311
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,999
But I think he's stupid

1312
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:43,839
I think he doesn't realize

1313
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,119
This is why

1314
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:45,887
We

1315
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,679
Talk about Alex is because

1316
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,447
He is

1317
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,983
The weakest link

1318
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:55,615
If he has no no no no

1319
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:57,151
No one

1320
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:58,687
No one

1321
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,991
Who do the details of this stuff

1322
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,551
Would come on Aaron laugh about how

1323
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:07,391
I've been told there's more stuff coming and I know what's in it

1324
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:11,231
Yeah earlier on the show be like I don't care if it's the Russians

1325
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:16,607
Or something like that unless you were

1326
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,375
Like

1327
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:19,679
I think at this point quite frankly

1328
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,471
Alex B

1329
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,567
This Behavior indicates

1330
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,359
Vicki's on the Audi

1331
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,431
Most outermost level of the circle

1332
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:33,247
Using him as a

1333
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:37,855
A way to disseminate information to be sold out

1334
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,391
There's no way that

1335
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,159
Rodger

1336
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,439
Only text

1337
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:47,327
No other people

1338
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:59,871
Pretty hard today, along with Alex

1339
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:06,271
Lot of conservative media was given this information as well as

1340
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,807
This is a bad idea

1341
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:10,623
Let's talk about the restraint

1342
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:13,439
To be like oh s***

1343
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,719
And only end up

1344
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:19,327
Text Jill

1345
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,375
Is because the hill was like

1346
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:28,031
Will clearly this isn't truth coming from Rodger Stone and the people that Rodger texted at

1347
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:30,335
Breitbart Fox News or whatever

1348
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,103
Are like

1349
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:31,871
Oh s***

1350
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:35,455
You're committed all the crimes

1351
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:37,247
We can't talk about that

1352
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:40,831
Otherwise you've got a paper trail

1353
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:46,719
Phuc yea throw it on the air baby

1354
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:52,351
I'll reveal that I know

1355
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:56,959
Is that last clip works just like the laughing about knowing what's coming into

1356
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,543
Talked about

1357
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,823
Talking to Russian intelligence

1358
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,295
Am I I get that I understand he's a liar

1359
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:12,831
Yeah I understand that

1360
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:17,695
What makes him so

1361
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:20,511
Plausible deniability of that

1362
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,535
Is what you

1363
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,303
Yes

1364
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:25,375
But I can tell at this point like I can't Elsa

1365
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:30,495
Sincerity from Lion in him I believe Malcolm Gladwell level

1366
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:36,895
Of of Alex Jones

1367
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,919
Turn off and Wendy's

1368
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:38,943
Bean

1369
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:42,015
And to be I hear this and I got a I got like my heart was fluttering

1370
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,831
Why did you say that

1371
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:50,207
And why is this episode not on your channel anymore because you said that

1372
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,255
That's a really big deal.

1373
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:55,583
PID

1374
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,375
That's a huge deal

1375
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,167
In terms of the indictments

1376
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:01,983
8 terms of his testimony that he gave to the house

1377
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,007
Judicial committee

1378
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:05,567
But that's a really f****** serious issue

1379
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,359
God dammit

1380
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:13,759
Are we can become material Witnesses is

1381
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:20,159
No cuz I do we have an email address I have a faith healer at

1382
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:25,023
Fbi.gov I have a I have a certain amount of faith that if we

1383
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:31,679
I kind of don't I don't think there's any way that a series investigator would be like well obviously we have to listen to

1384
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,471
1 million hours of envy

1385
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,799
Little importance

1386
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:43,199
We absolutely wouldn't

1387
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:51,647
Yeah whatever

1388
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,439
He says later in this episode

1389
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:57,023
Really check out this next

1390
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:02,143
Got time today

1391
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:03,679
Cool

1392
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:16,991
If you go to Russia and are arrested

1393
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:22,111
Probably on your side

1394
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:26,719
Well hold on it if you get arrested

1395
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:28,511
If you get killed your journey

1396
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:33,119
You're just a political

1397
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,191
-1

1398
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:44,127
I mean even when you were looking at 2015 he kept being like Putin

1399
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,431
Hearing like

1400
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,455
Pro-russian

1401
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:50,783
It is not like it anyway

1402
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,695
No I mean so much as it is Pro

1403
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:01,279
No it's pro-russia inasmuch as you saying

1404
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:07,935
George Soros should be arrested by government Russia's government

1405
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:08,703
They're better

1406
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:16,640
Do you like Russia

1407
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:30,976
Yet turkey for sure

1408
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,000
Horrible

1409
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:35,328
We're open tonight

1410
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:37,376
Kicked out of

1411
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:39,424
General

1412
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,192
Square

1413
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:40,960
You have

1414
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:43,520
Nationalist uprisings

1415
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,288
Freight Quote

1416
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,312
Crazy

1417
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:50,944
It's crazy that he would be technically speaking or or prep

1418
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,992
By Word of Mouth against

1419
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:56,832
The cultural revolution that Mal put for it

1420
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,368
I need at the same time

1421
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:01,952
What could be described

1422
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:04,256
Exact same f****** thing

1423
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,536
That

1424
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:06,560
Bad

1425
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,096
Not important

1426
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:09,376
Good call

1427
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:12,704
I don't know

1428
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,240
And that is

1429
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,520
Jordan Fisher

1430
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,056
Blew my f****** mind

1431
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:23,712
Like it could literally be evidence in a federal trial

1432
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:27,296
Very very very

1433
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:36,000
Is even more mind-blowing in Subway Langley has been a joke

1434
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:36,768
For a long time

1435
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:39,584
Travis Langley

1436
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:42,144
Went outside

1437
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,704
Firefighting after college is a good man

1438
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,240
As far as I know I haven't spoken to in like it

1439
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:55,200
Business Clips is so f***** up

1440
01:21:55,456 --> 01:22:00,576
Apologies for convicted of sexual assault two years ago under the shirt

1441
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:02,880
He's one of those fun guys

1442
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:11,840
He was one of those guys that could drink as much as me and college because of that ended up

1443
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:14,912
Together a lot because everybody else

1444
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:23,104
Years ago of Edna

1445
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:28,224
But my dear friend I'm sorry

1446
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:30,272
Is profoundly f*****

1447
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:32,832
I don't believe

1448
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:33,856
Half of it

1449
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,184
Put on the part that you do believe is true

1450
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:42,304
No I want it all to be true just because of this Funworld that it creates a Nighthawk

1451
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,984
Punching Bill Clinton the face before she was so ill

1452
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:53,824
And just

1453
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:57,152
Not Justa Cutlery plate furniture

1454
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,504
Are trash

1455
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:22,496
He wants to assist

1456
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:27,360
That's just

1457
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:38,368
Evernote

1458
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:02,432
Does not give tips

1459
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:19,584
Complained

1460
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:47,488
That's amazing

1461
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:52,864
Post-mortem book on Hillary campaign

1462
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:59,520
Even even that book which is

1463
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:03,360
Insanely critical of her campaign in the way that it was run

1464
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:05,152
Even that book never says

1465
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:07,456
Tip 15%

1466
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,224
Lego

1467
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,504
You would have no

1468
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:16,160
You went to dinner with

1469
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:18,464
Image of Alex Jones

1470
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,744
Therapy to a waiter

1471
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,280
Hey what's going on with your buddy

1472
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:27,680
Do you know what I did when we believe

1473
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:33,312
This hurt me because I genuinely believe wait staff should be a protected class

1474
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:38,176
Like if you're an a****** to your weights app that is borderline a hate crime

1475
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:42,016
Targeted abuse

1476
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,160
I would

1477
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:53,792
I guarantee you 95% of any weights at 5 ever met would be like

1478
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:56,352
I would prefer you give me $0

1479
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:59,936
But no speech

1480
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:06,080
Talking to this is the perfect example of the like

1481
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:09,152
Being able to suss out live from

1482
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,200
Like

1483
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,528
I know about something that's

1484
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:17,856
Knowledge

1485
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,392
The LIE is

1486
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:23,744
I'm going to really really play up how empathic I am

1487
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:24,768
I'm

1488
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:29,632
I care about people like is a lie because he flushed it out into

1489
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:33,216
An elaborate scenario where at

1490
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:39,104
But you need to really know that that makes me not want to come in here

1491
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:42,176
If Alex if Alex gives details

1492
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:54,208
His lies are likes and then I was born from the

1493
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:06,752
The perfect one

1494
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,544
It's game representing

1495
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,336
Now we get back to

1496
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:11,872
And Alex

1497
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:12,896
Really

1498
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:13,664
Unfortunate

1499
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:16,480
Make this

1500
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:18,016
Episode this August

1501
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,296
Episode

1502
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:22,112
The next level weird

1503
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:34,912
He called it

1504
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:35,936
Arley

1505
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:40,544
That's a Freudian slip

1506
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:42,080
No Charlie

1507
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:46,688
No it's not no it's our Ali

1508
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:51,040
No General is the American people

1509
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,880
Missing

1510
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:55,904
No

1511
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,672
No

1512
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:57,952
No

1513
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:02,048
That means that he thinks he's a part of

1514
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,840
Let me ask

1515
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:07,424
That means that he thinks that this is something we are doing

1516
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,496
Someone named Rodger Stone

1517
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:12,032
Lights

1518
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,128
That's what we're doing with the help of course

1519
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:18,944
On August 6th probably learning

1520
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,320
You still around

1521
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:29,952
On August 16th the information though I had not

1522
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:30,976
Actually been

1523
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,536
Correct most of it

1524
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:38,656
Most of it a couple days earlier

1525
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:44,800
Emails

1526
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:47,360
October

1527
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:49,920
So there is there is a

1528
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:52,480
There's a beginning of it but not

1529
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:57,856
In the middle of it at this point in the only reason

1530
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:01,696
But it literally the next time I'll know

1531
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:07,328
Rodger Stone was in touch with this date

1532
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,632
I bet I bet if we go to

1533
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:11,168
To the 17th decimal

1534
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:12,192
Incriminating

1535
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:13,728
But maybe not as incriminating

1536
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,008
Hourly

1537
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,288
Harley

1538
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,568
Really really

1539
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:20,384
Incriminating

1540
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:23,200
Well it means to me what it means

1541
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:25,760
And I take this from also this next clip

1542
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:28,320
Listen to this next quote and then I'll explain what I mean

1543
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:29,856
By what I think about him saying

1544
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,864
Pizzagate Joe Biggs

1545
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:41,888
You still around

1546
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:43,680
Yeah

1547
01:29:56,992 --> 01:30:02,624
Erik Prince operation

1548
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:11,584
The carbon tax is being exposed

1549
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,864
Decline

1550
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,168
Climategate stuff that is a Russian

1551
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:22,336
But this is not the Russians us intelligence

1552
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:23,872
Risking their lives

1553
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:28,224
Because Hillary

1554
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:31,296
It's finally turned

1555
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:37,696
So here's what's going on Alex Alex Smith

1556
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,512
Like Erik prince in Blackwater

1557
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:45,888
You have people like Steve pieczenik and Rogers that are lying to him and confirm

1558
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:46,656
Details

1559
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:47,680
Amongst

1560
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:48,704
Themselves

1561
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:53,056
Yeah yeah the Russian

1562
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:56,128
A bunch of stuff before and they're still trying stuff

1563
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:58,176
This one is

1564
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:02,272
Pacific one

1565
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:07,392
Actually until Patriots risk their lives

1566
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:09,952
Because Hillary has gone too far

1567
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:11,744
And this is what happened

1568
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,280
Which we now know

1569
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:15,072
They have spent

1570
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:17,376
Hours

1571
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:21,728
Upon hours upon hours upon hours of deers

1572
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:28,896
Actually disproving that Hillary has committed any crime in the specific way that Alex

1573
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:35,808
It's insane to me

1574
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:36,576
How

1575
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:38,880
Think again I hate to keep saying the right thing

1576
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:41,184
In person because that becomes so much like a

1577
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,464
What do you think

1578
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:46,560
Infected brain worms

1579
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:47,840
Sure

1580
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:50,656
I've been trying to train myself and that's a reasonable so much

1581
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:57,056
Cuz he used to be like a trigger for me please

1582
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:59,616
Almost my Tourette's something is reasonable

1583
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:01,920
But like this to me is like

1584
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:05,248
If you look at this

1585
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:07,296
The only assassin

1586
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:12,672
You can really come away from and I would welcome anybody to go Lizabeth whole 3 Hour episode you're not going to get more

1587
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:14,464
Contact

1588
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:17,280
You can listen to

1589
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,048
For a bit

1590
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:24,192
I would not recommend anybody listen to this entire 3M wrap

1591
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:25,472
Do the same s*** we talked about it

1592
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:27,264
But like if you listen to

1593
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:28,800
I don't think

1594
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:29,568
You can come away from

1595
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:31,104
Gloating

1596
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:33,920
About what he knows it's coming

1597
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,736
And then he says things like this

1598
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:39,808
Which indicates people like

1599
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:41,856
Rodger Stone

1600
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:43,392
Right maybe Eric princess

1601
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:45,184
Text Alex

1602
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,464
Sense come out inside

1603
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:49,536
Derek Prince was a big source of information

1604
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:51,840
You have

1605
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:53,120
People who

1606
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:55,936
Can guy you have

1607
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:58,752
Yeah

1608
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,032
Come out

1609
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:02,592
That is a lot of berries

1610
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:03,872
Information about the

1611
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:05,152
Specific computers

1612
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:07,456
Emails Gru agents

1613
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:13,856
Using witches that matches up perfectly with what describes provided the information

1614
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,648
This time it wasn't

1615
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:17,440
Which is what

1616
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,720
Rodger

1617
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:19,488
Steve pieczenik

1618
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:23,840
I think

1619
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:24,608
Is Alex

1620
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:26,400
Acting is a patsy

1621
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:30,752
All of this nonsense

1622
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,032
He's got really hot

1623
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:34,336
But Alex is so boring is

1624
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:38,944
I think he realized it's some point

1625
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:45,856
Because of the white nationalist

1626
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:46,624
Movement

1627
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,672
That are still being a bold and Denise

1628
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:51,744
He's pushing through the legislation that he would like to be

1629
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,072
Kick noises

1630
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:59,936
That things like this on Earth

1631
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:01,216
Evidence

1632
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:03,776
That's why he should was boring in 28

1633
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:05,312
He knows people are less

1634
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:09,152
Like know the people were listening

1635
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:12,736
Yeah I don't mean it like you didn't think anyone was let me just not like

1636
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,784
Hades doesn't matter it's all good

1637
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,088
And you know what it's not all good

1638
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:18,368
It's not all good

1639
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:20,928
A nail in the coffin

1640
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:22,464
Ever

1641
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:25,792
Convincing

1642
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:27,072
Ever like

1643
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,864
Making Alex

1644
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:33,216
Front the fact that he has been lied to and taken advantage

1645
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:36,288
What takes away so much of his masculinity

1646
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,312
Power

1647
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:40,128
Because if he took that episode Down

1648
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:42,432
Which Wich

1649
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:44,736
Can confirm

1650
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:49,088
If he if he was specifically not cool with this

1651
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:49,856
Episode

1652
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,648
That suggests

1653
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:52,416
For now

1654
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:54,208
That is intense

1655
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:56,512
It's like

1656
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:04,704
B he found out

1657
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:06,752
That he was f******

1658
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:14,944
Or later in the day

1659
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,016
You just drifted outside

1660
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:22,112
Dangerous and you're going to hurt my sources

1661
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:25,696
I have no idea whether this

1662
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:32,096
Never went up or it was taken down

1663
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:32,864
From

1664
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:33,632
Years

1665
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:36,448
Everything

1666
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:38,752
Which is smoke but not fire breath

1667
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:41,056
It looks like it's smoked

1668
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:43,616
Like

1669
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:49,248
To me there's always been a romantic idea of like

1670
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:50,784
If we could just

1671
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:51,552
Get to it

1672
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:52,576
And just like

1673
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:56,160
York

1674
01:35:56,672 --> 01:36:00,512
Whether or not we agree on policies or anything like that

1675
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:03,072
All we can genuinely prove to you

1676
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:05,120
Is it the people you've surrounded with

1677
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:06,400
R-Truth

1678
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:09,472
F*** you over

1679
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:14,848
Get rid of any possibility ever of redemption

1680
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:20,224
Number one

1681
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,784
Many times where you can point to

1682
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,064
Concrete example

1683
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,344
Of him being

1684
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,112
Actually

1685
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:28,160
That he was

1686
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:31,488
By the people that you supposedly Trust

1687
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:38,400
Like so many times we pointed out that by the people eat trout

1688
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:45,056
But this is a confirmation about Mars

1689
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,616
Disc

1690
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:49,664
He was trying to get on my show and Saints

1691
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,432
Some dumb s***

1692
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:52,224
When he's been on

1693
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:57,600
It's not like it's an anomaly for him to be on or say something weird

1694
01:36:57,856 --> 01:37:02,208
The media picked up on the Mars base thing that he said

1695
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:03,232
Also like

1696
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,000
Delightful

1697
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,048
You have that

1698
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,096
Working

1699
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:15,776
Robert David Steele

1700
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:21,152
Robert

1701
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:27,808
Right now

1702
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:28,832
He's become

1703
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,904
Woven into the DNA

1704
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:32,928
2 years

1705
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:33,696
To the point where

1706
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:34,720
Kinkos downtown

1707
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:36,000
Annex trick

1708
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:37,024
But it's not

1709
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,048
Actually that

1710
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:40,608
Not true there's a way that Alex can Dodge

1711
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:42,400
If Rodger Stone goes to prison

1712
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:43,936
I think Alex

1713
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:46,240
I think I think it's I think it's possible

1714
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:51,872
But even if these guys go to prison

1715
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:54,176
Right here

1716
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:55,456
This episode

1717
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:58,528
Is the closest I have ever come to being like

1718
01:37:59,040 --> 01:37:59,552
Alex

1719
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:00,320
Is going to

1720
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,344
Prism

1721
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,112
Like because

1722
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,136
This is

1723
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:08,512
Had Advance knowledge

1724
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:10,816
Admit to

1725
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:11,584
Perjured him

1726
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:14,400
Interviews

1727
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:17,216
So he's still like on the right side of the law

1728
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:17,984
If he comes

1729
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:20,032
Queen what you can't do

1730
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:23,360
But it involves selling out Rodger

1731
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:29,504
No longer are we going to romanticize the idea of ever convincing him that he's f***** over

1732
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:31,040
Here's what we do

1733
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:32,832
We email his lawyer

1734
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,112
Alright

1735
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,904
And his lawyer is like

1736
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,464
Email Beth

1737
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,744
Alright and

1738
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,792
We send that email we have these

1739
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:43,072
Eclipse they here

1740
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,608
All We Do

1741
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:45,888
It is

1742
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,424
Get an email back

1743
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:50,496
That is just them salivating at the billable hour

1744
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,032
Yeah

1745
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:53,568
All that's going on

1746
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:58,432
If this information is part of Buehler's probe

1747
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,760
This is so many billable hours like

1748
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:04,576
The lawyers if they heard this Brie they would

1749
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:11,744
I I really think that this sort of these these indications are the song

1750
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:16,096
Cuz he

1751
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:16,864
Business

1752
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:17,888
Protective

1753
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:18,656
The kids

1754
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:20,192
He like Evie doesn't want to go to

1755
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,776
Like I know I know that he believes in

1756
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:33,248
Prison mentality

1757
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:36,064
It's a program

1758
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,344
Alex goes to prison then

1759
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:40,160
Cuz he was offering

1760
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:44,512
Becomes the new Mark Richards for us when we go visit him

1761
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:52,192
Here's the new Alex Jones interview by knowledge

1762
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:58,080
I don't know I don't button

1763
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:58,848
Just

1764
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:00,128
It's nonsense

1765
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:03,712
The only way out is

1766
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:05,504
Bad

1767
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:07,040
But

1768
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:08,320
I don't I

1769
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:09,344
Still don't see

1770
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,112
Like

1771
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:12,928
I think at the end

1772
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:13,696
What's the date

1773
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:14,464
White

1774
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:15,232
Supremacist

1775
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:16,256
F***

1776
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:17,280
Hey Ya

1777
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,304
Hate him so much

1778
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,328
Rhetoric

1779
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:21,376
And it's the worst

1780
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:23,168
And all these people were talking about like

1781
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:25,216
Should he be allowed on Facebook

1782
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:29,824
I don't think it's a valid conversation to have

1783
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,456
You get off

1784
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:38,784
I don't think I don't know

1785
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:39,552
It's not clear to

1786
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:40,832
I hate

1787
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:41,600
I hate

1788
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:42,880
But I don't

1789
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:44,672
Like even all of this

1790
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,120
I think that he's

1791
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:54,144
Smart about

1792
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:55,168
A lot of

1793
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:57,472
Cultural issues he's cancerous about

1794
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:59,520
I would say he's not smart

1795
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:04,640
No like he's got he's got to be an infant

1796
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:05,664
No I think he knows what

1797
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:08,736
The racial

1798
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:10,528
Stop.

1799
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:12,576
Yeah I think

1800
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,600
In charge of

1801
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:18,720
Secret information in all this

1802
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:20,512
Counter-coup narrative in all this

1803
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,536
I think he's

1804
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:23,072
He's the bar

1805
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:26,400
I think you can see it played out on air

1806
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:29,984
I'm at think it would be disingenuous

1807
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:32,032
He's committed

1808
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:35,104
Cuz what we're talkin about is treason

1809
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:38,688
Like we're talkin about

1810
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:39,968
AR

1811
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:45,856
Sedition against America I mean you say that but it's like

1812
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:48,928
Stealing an election is that so bad

1813
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:55,072
Dukes of Hazzard

1814
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:59,168
Rey's speeder you're in a Patton Oswalt Bush and Cheney

1815
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,312
But

1816
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:06,080
That's not

1817
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:07,616
This is

1818
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:09,408
Is

1819
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,176
This is

1820
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:10,944
Prime

1821
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:14,016
And you can't hide

1822
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:17,600
Wonderful people in the intelligence agency

1823
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:22,464
Very clearly forensic leben study

1824
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:25,536
I still don't think

1825
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:30,656
I've heard him in the past talked about like people are investigating him

1826
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:32,960
How do you take that with a grain of salt I always

1827
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:34,496
Things from like

1828
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:38,336
Investigating

1829
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:44,736
Social media presence

1830
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:45,760
Stuff like that

1831
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,808
That was always been the point

1832
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:50,112
Is that was going on a year-and-a-half ago

1833
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:54,208
And now it's his own are talking about Advance knowledge

1834
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,232
Publix

1835
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,048
I'm stuff like that

1836
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:02,400
I'm in the f******

1837
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,168
Hopper

1838
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:03,936
Yeah

1839
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:05,984
Here's my prediction

1840
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:09,824
Either

1841
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:11,104
Howard's Meats

1842
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,384
The flip

1843
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,504
She's going to get real dark

1844
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,576
He might

1845
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:23,904
I never thought this until it wasn't this

1846
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:24,672
Disagree

1847
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:26,464
I think that he might get indicted

1848
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:28,768
I really don't think anybody is listening

1849
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:32,352
Are you

1850
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:33,632
I don't think so

1851
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:35,168
I don't think Siri

1852
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:36,704
Take this seriously

1853
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:37,984
I think that if

1854
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:43,616
You have the reason that we take it seriously is because we are not serious

1855
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:46,688
We are decidedly unserious people

1856
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:49,760
I think that if you are

1857
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:50,528
Investigation

1858
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,064
And you're focusing on Rodger Stone

1859
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:53,600
And you realize

1860
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:58,720
Rodger Stone

1861
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:00,768
You probably wanted

1862
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:05,888
Easiest forensic things to do is like find out what he said on that show on various days

1863
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:09,216
This stuff is very well-known

1864
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:10,496
Investigators

1865
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:11,520
I think it has

1866
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:13,824
Then

1867
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:19,200
Here's here's why I feel like

1868
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:21,504
And this is not to say that

1869
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,272
Is morphe

1870
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:26,880
Here's why I feel like my assessment of this particular situation

1871
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:30,720
Regarding what the FBI regards as serious is more valid

1872
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:33,280
I listen to weigh less Alex

1873
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:36,096
Turn up

1874
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:42,496
99.99% of the population

1875
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,032
We all feel like

1876
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:46,592
Alex Jones can be disregard

1877
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:51,200
Never a bad idea to suggest that people invest

1878
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:51,968
Navigating things

1879
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:54,272
Can disregard details that would

1880
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,344
That's generally the real

1881
01:44:57,856 --> 01:45:01,696
She goes back to that like when you were looking at your peripheral vision is

1882
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:04,512
Focus on one

1883
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:05,280
You Don't See

1884
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:07,072
The very obvious thing on the side

1885
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:12,448
And so is at the same time

1886
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:13,728
Infowars

1887
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:20,128
So in the next clip Alex talks about

1888
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,944
WDC leaks

1889
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:26,272
How do you says that they say

1890
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:29,344
Play like all of

1891
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,880
They're a bunch of hacks

1892
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:32,672
So they're like

1893
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:36,768
Have you ever heard about Infowars

1894
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:41,120
Facebook

1895
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:50,080
Within days of calm

1896
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:52,896
Daily Caller

1897
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:12,608
The diary

1898
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,264
It's open-and-shut

1899
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:26,176
Call Mike Mitchell

1900
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:30,784
Apothecary recipes

1901
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,576
Fellowship in the same

01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:43,328
We got going on

1903
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:49,728
I watch nobody's Netflix documentaries about various admire them for not trying to sell something during them

1904
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:51,008
The crime

1905
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,824
Try to sell something in this

1906
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:59,712
May 11th

1907
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,784
That interrupts best

1908
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:06,368
Oh yeah

1909
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,048
How about a lot of things

1910
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,072
4 furlong

1911
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:16,096
Timer

1912
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:16,864
Some

1913
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:17,632
Impressions

1914
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:20,192
After the clips you play there

1915
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:21,984
There is some left

1916
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:23,264
And also

1917
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,544
With this

1918
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:30,176
A hundred percent

1919
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:30,944
Proof

1920
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,528
It is a

1921
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:35,552
Claim

1922
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:37,600
Based on evidence that has been

1923
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:39,392
Right and

1924
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:42,208
And based on everything they are

1925
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:42,976
Information and

1926
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:47,584
Criminal justice system

1927
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,632
Investigative body

1928
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:50,656
Have put out

1929
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:52,192
It is very clear

1930
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,472
That

1931
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:54,240
Malik

1932
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:55,520
Guccifer 2.0

1933
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:57,568
Empathy

1934
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,360
4 Russian hackers to you

1935
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:00,640
Disseminate information

1936
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,712
Yeah from the DNC

1937
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:06,016
And from Soros

1938
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:11,392
Now why this can absolutely

1939
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,672
Confirmed as

1940
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:14,464
Is because

1941
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:16,768
For all of Mueller's and die

1942
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:19,328
These are the one bowler

1943
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:25,728
I've been criticized

1944
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:32,128
Like there's bill but I didn't know if he's ever going anyway

1945
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:32,896
Dick but someone is

1946
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:33,920
Zelda

1947
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:36,736
Agree

1948
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:40,320
Here's why this one I feel like can

1949
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:41,344
Can absolutely be

1950
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:42,112
Confirmed

1951
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:43,136
True regard

1952
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:44,672
Is that

1953
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:46,720
This is the first indicted

1954
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:48,768
Feel like that molars brought

1955
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,816
That will mean nothing

1956
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:54,912
Because none of the 12 people that he is indicted

1957
01:48:55,424 --> 01:49:00,544
Will ever be extradited

1958
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:05,920
Godzilla

1959
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:06,688
Some companies

1960
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,480
Some numbers

1961
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:09,760
Which ones

1962
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:15,392
Some Russian companies that were involved

1963
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:16,928
It's just like

1964
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:18,208
Guys

1965
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:21,792
We are presenting incontrovertible evidence

1966
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:22,816
Simply Be

1967
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:23,584
Close

1968
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:25,632
Nothing can be done about it

1969
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:31,008
Course not what kind of world

1970
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:32,032
Trump

1971
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:34,080
Who f****** loves

1972
01:49:34,848 --> 01:49:40,992
Ever be like we're recording us right now

1973
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:43,552
Giving him a hand

1974
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:44,576
Innate

1975
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:48,160
What world would you be like okay well

1976
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:55,328
We got we got to do this

1977
01:49:57,120 --> 01:50:01,472
Give me 12 guys from your military so I can

1978
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:03,264
Prosecute them in the United States

1979
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:04,800
Come on

1980
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:12,224
Bottom line

1981
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:13,248
Absolutely

1982
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:17,600
That were involved in the

1983
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:19,392
Easy hack

1984
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:27,584
Cannot be disputed much more embarrassing than Alex

1985
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:42,944
Beginning

1986
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:46,016
Proof

1987
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:47,552
Salute

1988
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:48,832
I mean yeah

1989
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,648
Yeah

1990
01:50:55,744 --> 01:50:57,792
Like this is a guy who's being trick

1991
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:01,120
I don't

1992
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:08,032
There is a version that he is a person who Woods

1993
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:08,800
Call Jonesboro

1994
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:10,592
I think he is

1995
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:12,640
Completely Hook Line & Sinker

1996
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:14,176
On this stupid narrative

1997
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:15,968
August

1998
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:17,760
16th 2016

1999
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:19,552
Who knows what he knows later

2000
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:20,832
But at this point

2001
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:24,160
He's being f****** lied to Undead

2002
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:26,208
Thrilled about it and that's why he's

2003
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:27,744
So

2004
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:29,024
Outward

2005
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:31,072
With things that are

2006
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:32,096
And evidence

2007
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:34,400
Okay so here's how

2008
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:36,192
Alright both of us

2009
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:37,216
Moved

2010
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:39,264
Respond to it

2011
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,288
We

2012
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:46,688
First off I loved it

2013
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:52,320
Yeah how much their there's a great hot sauce shop

2014
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:58,208
2 to 4 years unlocked

2015
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:00,000
Are LSAT

2016
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:01,280
Pasta Bar

2017
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:02,048
Go to

2018
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:03,072
Go to town

2019
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:05,888
We spend years as public defender

2020
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,192
Then we parlay that

2021
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:09,984
Into a private practice

2022
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:19,968
10 relatives of yours at partners

2023
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:23,040
Good morning

2024
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:24,832
15 years from now

2025
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:28,160
We run for attorney general

2026
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:31,232
We have the authority to

2027
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:34,304
Take the information that we have gathered

2028
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,840
Over this past two years

2029
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:39,424
Alex Jones

2030
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:56,320
Accessories

2031
01:52:57,856 --> 01:52:58,368
Don't think

2032
01:52:58,880 --> 01:52:59,392
I know

2033
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:01,440
I know how bad a propaganda

2034
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:04,256
I still think

2035
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:06,560
Who are

2036
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:09,888
My view

2037
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:11,424
Yeah

2038
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:15,008
I don't know everything I only have the information that I have

2039
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:18,592
Actively involved

2040
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:26,528
Treason aspect is actively involved in the propaganda

2041
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:30,624
I think the propaganda is not a crime but

2042
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:33,184
I don't think you would necessarily have a crime

2043
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,976
Hang him on for that

2044
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:36,000
I think

2045
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:38,304
In terms of his involvement in all this

2046
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:39,072
I think that

2047
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:44,704
He's probably a guy who which is both wise

2048
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,728
Is

2049
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:48,032
Used for this specific purpose

2050
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:50,592
Like people tell him way too much

2051
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,896
Or or at least

2052
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:59,296
At least for a week

2053
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:02,368
Guys who spend all of our time talking about

2054
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:04,928
But in reality

2055
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:05,952
They tell him

2056
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:10,304
Way more than is necessary in order to get out in front of the narrative

2057
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:11,072
And make

2058
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:13,120
Crazy

2059
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:14,400
Possible

2060
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:16,704
The Rogers

2061
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:18,496
Who were manipulating

2062
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:19,776
Cuz it's very cool

2063
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:21,312
That that so cute

2064
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:28,224
It is from everything I can tell her I might

2065
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:29,760
Everything I can tell

2066
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:36,416
You have Steven Rodger coordinating Lee manipulating him on this side

2067
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:39,232
Like I don't think the three of them are involved

2068
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:41,536
Nichols is another site

2069
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:47,680
Exactly is not part of the cabal

2070
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:53,568
2 he's being manipulated in a similar anti-hillary way

2071
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:57,920
Never

2072
01:54:58,176 --> 01:54:58,688
I think he's just a

2073
01:54:58,944 --> 01:55:02,272
Crazy old dude

2074
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:03,040
But

2075
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:08,160
I know I lost my train of thought entirely

2076
01:55:14,048 --> 01:55:16,864
The burden of proof of someone actually

2077
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:18,656
Doing

2078
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:19,680
We're talk

2079
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:21,216
Yeah we talked about

2080
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:22,496
We are

2081
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:26,336
He should be hung by the neck until dead I believe the burden of evidence

2082
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:27,104
Pretty high

2083
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:29,408
When I look at Alex

2084
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:30,944
Am I look at stuff like this

2085
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:33,248
Like what's crazy to me

2086
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:34,272
Legitimate

2087
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,832
Is that looking at this episode

2088
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:40,160
The day after Rodger Stone 104

2089
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:41,184
Wasn't

2090
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,208
With Russian intelligence

2091
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:44,000
Do you have Alex thing

2092
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:45,536
Damning stuff

2093
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:47,072
That he knows

2094
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:48,352
And he's been told

2095
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:49,120
Stuff

2096
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:51,424
Do hickeys on the outside

2097
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,472
I still think that there's an innocent

2098
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:57,568
Which is hard for me to wrestle with as someone who

2099
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,104
Studies Hitman

2100
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:02,176
I think he should be

2101
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:04,480
Yeah I don't know how to deal with it

2102
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:06,784
Misdemeanor

2103
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:09,344
Such a hard thing to wrestle with that I have

2104
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:10,624
I found something

2105
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:11,392
Alex

2106
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:12,416
You

2107
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:13,952
Hargray

2108
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:14,720
David Vance

2109
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:17,024
Notice of weeks that are going to come out

2110
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:21,120
Which is a huge part of what you deny is part of your information

2111
01:56:24,448 --> 01:56:30,080
I still think the only reason he's lying about it now is cuz he's realized he was lied to back then

2112
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:31,872
She is finally aware

2113
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:33,152
That he is an accessory

2114
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:34,944
Yes yeah

2115
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:38,784
Accessory to treason which kind of pill is treason

2116
01:56:43,648 --> 01:56:45,440
Cover up is crazy

2117
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:47,232
And cover-up is what

2118
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:50,048
DC going on right now

2119
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:53,888
I think so too

2120
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:54,656
Snowboarding

2121
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:55,936
Because it's just

2122
01:56:57,728 --> 01:56:58,752
You just go back to being weird

2123
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:00,544
Kind of think if

2124
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:01,824
He bailed on Trump

2125
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:04,896
The Fox News people would follow

2126
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:08,736
Yeah I think you'd be the bellwether

2127
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:12,832
I think if he got approval

2128
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:14,624
I'm being like

2129
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:17,184
Trump live

2130
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:20,256
The whole time like if Trump is impeached

2131
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:22,048
If you somehow was like proof-of-concept

2132
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:24,096
Yeah

2133
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:24,864
Yeah

2134
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:26,656
Jump on board

2135
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:32,288
I don't know

2136
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:33,824
I don't know

2137
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:36,896
That I don't know

2138
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:38,688
I don't know but I know

2139
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:39,456
Dunno

2140
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:41,504
I know people commit treason

2141
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:46,368
That's not that's not any argument

2142
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:53,536
It doesn't invalidate anything that I thought before

2143
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:56,352
Yeah it adds a little bit

2144
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:57,888
Figuring out the picture

2145
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:03,264
Previous

2146
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:04,800
Concept of what happen

2147
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:06,336
Very intact

2148
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:07,360
Just with more like

2149
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:08,128
Yeah

2150
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:12,736
It's just evidence that Alex Alex has information

2151
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:14,016
Is not saying

2152
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:15,808
Yeah parts

2153
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:19,648
Something's going to have to happen

2154
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:24,512
If you are Mueller

2155
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:33,472
Whether or not you are aware that you're going to be attacked by a foreign power

2156
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:35,776
And report it or not

2157
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:38,336
Is a question of like

2158
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:40,384
Can you actually prosecute

2159
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:42,432
Sure you know like

2160
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:44,224
Rodger Stone

2161
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:46,784
Ratcliff

2162
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,112
If you're Rogers

2163
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:52,160
You're aware that

2164
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:53,952
As we know now

2165
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:57,536
Russia committed an act of

2166
01:58:59,072 --> 01:59:00,608
Warwick Ontario B

2167
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:08,544
At the same time one of the one of the realities we have to admit is that the only way that we could possibly

2168
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:09,312
Know this

2169
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:13,664
Is if we hacked into their systems in the same way that they did to our

2170
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:17,760
You know like that it's not possible to know that in any other way

2171
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:24,416
So if you want to say you know they committed an act of war against us

2172
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:38,240
Moral like we should I do about this

2173
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:39,520
Is the same

2174
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:41,824
What

2175
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:44,128
The defense

2176
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:45,664
Awareness

2177
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:49,248
Knowledge requires the same thing as the spearfishing in hack

2178
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:50,528
Right

2179
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:53,344
Some of that can just be done by monitoring

2180
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:55,392
Suspicious people

2181
01:59:55,648 --> 02:00:01,792
So it has been rightly pointed out that we absolutely helped install Boris Yeltsin

2182
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:03,072
So it's

2183
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:09,728
I know but that's not it they didn't declare war on us then like

2184
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:10,752
It's not

2185
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:22,272
I'm just saying that this is something that should be that we should be aware of before

2186
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:24,320
People started saying that this is an active

2187
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:30,208
An act of War

2188
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:35,584
Ameristaff is espionage

2189
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:40,704
Go to war with Russia

2190
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:41,472
It's stupid

2191
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:44,544
What you're saying

2192
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:47,360
Quid pro quo south of like we f*** with you

2193
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:53,760
Also this is okay I don't agree with that because I don't think anybody

2194
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:55,040
Stop doing that

2195
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:56,320
That's a different

2196
02:00:59,392 --> 02:01:00,160
Respond

2197
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:03,488
I think the only thing that you can do

2198
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:11,936
Did the Jews

2199
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:12,960
Mother is putting out

2200
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:13,728
These indictments

2201
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:20,384
Impossible to ever enact yet of course the evidence out

2202
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:23,712
This is what happened

2203
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:25,248
To make a document

2204
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:26,272
15 years old

2205
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:28,064
Yeah dude all of that out there

2206
02:01:29,344 --> 02:01:31,392
Prosecute as many Bad actors

2207
02:01:31,648 --> 02:01:32,672
Here is you can

2208
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:34,976
Yeah I hope to mitigate the damage

2209
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:36,256
Magic

2210
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:37,536
You hoped

2211
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:38,560
Be able to

2212
02:01:38,816 --> 02:01:39,840
Difficult to understand

2213
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:42,144
This is the process that happened

2214
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:43,936
Investigative

2215
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:44,704
Patterns

2216
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:47,264
The ways

2217
02:01:48,032 --> 02:01:48,800
Was known

2218
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:50,080
Revealed that

2219
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:51,616
Yeah you start to under

2220
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:52,384
Understand

2221
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:55,712
Look out for online

2222
02:01:55,968 --> 02:01:57,504
Right

2223
02:01:58,272 --> 02:01:59,040
Careful about what you

2224
02:01:59,296 --> 02:01:59,808
Trust

2225
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:00,576
Because

2226
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:01,856
It's very easy

2227
02:02:02,368 --> 02:02:04,160
To manipulate your opinion right

2228
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:05,952
Algorithms and s*** like that

2229
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:06,720
Because that

2230
02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:09,280
Is a huge part of the story Criminal

2231
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:12,352
Then you take the criminal piece of it and you hopefully

2232
02:02:12,608 --> 02:02:13,120
Put

2233
02:02:16,448 --> 02:02:16,960
Comes probably

2234
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:19,520
But like you get

2235
02:02:19,776 --> 02:02:21,312
You get people like Rodger Stone

2236
02:02:21,568 --> 02:02:22,080
To go to prison

2237
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:23,616
You get manafort in prison

2238
02:02:23,872 --> 02:02:25,920
Hopefully some of these other people I mean

2239
02:02:26,176 --> 02:02:26,688
Blind to go to

2240
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:28,736
Some of these other folks maybe they

2241
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:29,760
Flip and become

2242
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:30,528
State's evidence

2243
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:31,808
State Property

2244
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:33,088
Maybe they

2245
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:33,856
No make some

2246
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:34,880
Deals for themselves

2247
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:36,928
We try and wash this

2248
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:38,976
National nightmare out of our hair

2249
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:40,256
And then move on and

2250
02:02:42,816 --> 02:02:43,328
Can do but

2251
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:45,120
May I don't think

2252
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:45,888
It's possible

2253
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:47,680
No as we as we

2254
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:50,752
As we all know needs to happen

2255
02:02:51,264 --> 02:02:54,336
Even even if the Democrats run.

2256
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:55,616
F****** table

2257
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:56,640
Penguin

2258
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:57,664
Every election

2259
02:02:58,688 --> 02:03:01,504
They're still going to

2260
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:03,040
Actually impeached

2261
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:05,344
Need to be

2262
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:08,928
Like I understand that we all want him

2263
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,024
He needs to be stopped

2264
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:14,304
Yeah

2265
02:03:15,584 --> 02:03:16,096
Perhaps

2266
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:18,400
More importantly the Republican Party

2267
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:19,936
Stop which

2268
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:20,960
Would be

2269
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:23,008
Better served in our interest

2270
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:25,568
If he was if Trump was just neutral

2271
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:28,384
With an entirely Democratic Congress

2272
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:31,968
As president

2273
02:03:32,224 --> 02:03:34,016
We just want to make sure that

2274
02:03:34,528 --> 02:03:40,672
All of the dumb s*** but which is probably based on diminished

2275
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:42,976
Intellectual capacity

2276
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:44,256
Much better Optics

2277
02:03:44,512 --> 02:03:45,536
If he stays as president

2278
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:49,632
Display

2279
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:51,936
Who yells all the time

2280
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:55,264
Maybe that's a better thing for the Democrats have been impeached

2281
02:03:55,776 --> 02:04:01,920
But I always forgive Andrew Jackson was never allowed to in

2282
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:03,968
Implement

2283
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:07,040
Like he's allowed to stay all that b*******

2284
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:08,320
But none of it actually

2285
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:12,928
Like better circumstance

2286
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:13,696
Because

2287
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:17,024
Ultimately we kind of want Trump

2288
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:17,792
As the

2289
02:04:18,048 --> 02:04:18,560
President

2290
02:04:19,328 --> 02:04:22,912
In order to make sure that we continue winning election

2291
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:26,496
I don't care

2292
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:31,360
Ugly self-serving

2293
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:32,640
Opportunistic idea

2294
02:04:32,896 --> 02:04:35,200
I think the only good thing about having a president

2295
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:36,480
Maybe

2296
02:04:36,736 --> 02:04:37,760
Teaching

2297
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:39,552
Yeah like you know like as long as

2298
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:40,576
He stays in office

2299
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:42,368
Flounder rig

2300
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:43,392
Combative

2301
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:44,672
Child

2302
02:04:44,928 --> 02:04:48,512
Like there is an opportunity for people watching it to learn

2303
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,960
Because here's what I would say

2304
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:57,984
Yeah

2305
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:01,312
What European countries are older

2306
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:04,384
In terms of their existence

2307
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:09,248
No I'm just

2308
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:15,136
A lot of a lot of them don't necessarily have the same

2309
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:16,672
Boundaries

2310
02:05:17,184 --> 02:05:17,696
Because of

2311
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:18,720
Various world wars

2312
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:25,888
How much further

2313
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:27,424
1376

2314
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:29,984
Childish

2315
02:05:32,032 --> 02:05:33,568
Country

2316
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:36,640
Maybe is going through growing

2317
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:37,664
Right now

2318
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:41,504
And there's there's one opportunity in front of us

2319
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:44,064
We

2320
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:45,600
Lean into the

2321
02:05:45,856 --> 02:05:47,136
Combative childishness

2322
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:51,488
I'm at the night

2323
02:05:58,912 --> 02:06:00,192
Or the other opportunities

2324
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:00,960
One of these

2325
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:01,984
Kierkegaard

2326
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:05,312
Did come with your development

2327
02:06:05,568 --> 02:06:07,360
Yeah and we realize like

2328
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:12,992
How is a mistake

2329
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:15,296
And everything comes into sharp Focus.

2330
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:18,368
Reaction out that was childish

2331
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:19,392
Beat beat

2332
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:21,440
We need to take everything a bunch more

2333
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:22,976
Seriously

2334
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:27,072
We need to get back on the straight and narrow

2335
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:29,632
And maybe we can move forward from

2336
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:41,152
Like America hasn't survived a white supremacist senile president

2337
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:45,248
Before like we've got a lot under our belt

2338
02:06:45,504 --> 02:06:46,016
The same as now

2339
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:47,040
But that's

2340
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:51,136
World hasn't necessarily survived

2341
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:53,440
White nationalist

2342
02:06:53,952 --> 02:06:55,232
White supremacist

2343
02:06:55,744 --> 02:06:57,792
Denial president

2344
02:06:58,048 --> 02:07:01,376
Exactly

2345
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:02,144
Yeah

2346
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:04,192
The world is LA

2347
02:07:04,448 --> 02:07:07,264
Like it's unfortunate but currently

2348
02:07:07,776 --> 02:07:12,128
The interesting thing is watching the world kind of realize

2349
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:14,688
We Trust America

2350
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:17,760
The order

2351
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:21,600
International order

2352
02:07:21,856 --> 02:07:22,624
After World War II

2353
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:35,424
I mean I mean after World War

2354
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:43,360
The EU has had a lot of situations

2355
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:45,664
Of breaking apart

2356
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:47,456
Like this is a regular thing

2357
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:48,992
Like you're a f****** nuts

2358
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:51,808
Jay Paterno

2359
02:07:52,064 --> 02:07:56,928
You know it's not the same as when

2360
02:07:58,976 --> 02:08:00,256
That's even maybe pejorative

2361
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:01,536
International partners

2362
02:08:03,328 --> 02:08:04,864
No I kind of think we're good

2363
02:08:07,424 --> 02:08:10,496
We've we've created a situation in terms of the international

2364
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:13,056
Order where's the United States

2365
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:16,640
Power yet so much

2366
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:17,920
Superpower

2367
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:18,944
In terms of

2368
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:21,248
Like

2369
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:22,784
Not control

2370
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:24,320
But

2371
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:26,112
This

2372
02:08:26,368 --> 02:08:27,648
We're going to work

2373
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:29,184
Be on the right side

2374
02:08:29,696 --> 02:08:32,512
Yeah just in general Hemet

2375
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:34,048
Yeah German

2376
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:38,144
Indicate we're not going to do that anymore

2377
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:44,032
Terrifying because like the world can't do without

2378
02:08:45,312 --> 02:08:46,592
But if we become bad actor

2379
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:48,384
Worldstar

2380
02:08:49,408 --> 02:08:54,016
Well I mean it's kind of built around the concept that has been

2381
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:57,856
I inflate problems for the last

2382
02:08:58,112 --> 02:08:59,136
40 years of life

2383
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:01,184
America's military

2384
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,208
Is such

2385
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:03,232
That

2386
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:05,024
As as

2387
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:06,560
Far out is anybody wants

2388
02:09:10,144 --> 02:09:11,936
To go if you go too far

2389
02:09:12,448 --> 02:09:14,752
America does have old

2390
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:18,336
You know so many guns are

2391
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:24,736
Russians building up their military building up to their military

2392
02:09:24,992 --> 02:09:26,016
Increase by tenfold

2393
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:27,552
That still puts them at

2394
02:09:27,808 --> 02:09:31,904
1/1000 of the Dumbo

2395
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:34,208
For so long

2396
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:38,304
Even even the people who want to act as Invaders

2397
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:47,264
It's not a World War it's America

2398
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:48,800
Blowing your ass f******

2399
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:50,080
You know

2400
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:51,872
Roll a dice

2401
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:52,896
Understand

2402
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:55,456
I think that Refuge

2403
02:09:55,968 --> 02:09:57,248
Bleeding a lot of those places

2404
02:09:58,016 --> 02:09:58,528
Yeah

2405
02:09:58,784 --> 02:10:01,600
Well I mean they understand it all too much

2406
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:03,136
Now

2407
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:04,672
Is another piece

2408
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:05,696
Puzzle

2409
02:10:05,952 --> 02:10:06,464
In terms of

2410
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:08,000
Yeah

2411
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:08,768
Directions

2412
02:10:09,536 --> 02:10:10,816
Will do I don't know I didn't work

2413
02:10:11,072 --> 02:10:16,192
We're spending way too far

2414
02:10:19,776 --> 02:10:21,056
I think we're butting or heads up

2415
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:23,104
Does that like both of us

2416
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:25,408
Stocking fatalistic and we think we do

2417
02:10:27,456 --> 02:10:28,480
Tiny bit of light

2418
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:38,464
Dead to rights

2419
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:39,232
New

2420
02:10:39,488 --> 02:10:42,816
S*** that he claims he doesn't know and I'm still saying that like

2421
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:45,888
Still being tricked

2422
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:50,752
You don't like it so maybe I'm Dreaming I'd optimist

2423
02:10:51,008 --> 02:10:56,384
Isn't born out of America not surviving Trump

2424
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:58,176
Or the white nationalist

2425
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:05,344
Like what

2426
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:10,464
Which is why creates more refugees would only create more nationalist

2427
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:13,024
Separatism

2428
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:17,632
Which is why in the

2429
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:18,400
Memo

2430
02:11:18,656 --> 02:11:20,448
That came from the open Society

2431
02:11:23,264 --> 02:11:25,312
They were talking about this Refuge

2432
02:11:25,824 --> 02:11:26,336
Glocks being

2433
02:11:26,592 --> 02:11:31,712
The New Normal because of some sort of like

2434
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:32,992
Desire

2435
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:38,112
4 hey let's fuk up white people brown people

2436
02:11:38,368 --> 02:11:40,672
Do you look at the realities of the world and if

2437
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:42,464
Keep going the way they are

2438
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:43,488
There's going to be

2439
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:45,792
Swatches of land uninhabitable

2440
02:11:46,048 --> 02:11:46,816
If you want to go

2441
02:11:47,072 --> 02:11:47,840
Have to be displaced

2442
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:50,400
Better f****** let them in

2443
02:11:50,912 --> 02:11:54,240
You think just think about how people have reacted

2444
02:11:54,496 --> 02:11:56,800
Puerto Rican

2445
02:11:58,592 --> 02:12:00,128
Oh are you a citizen

2446
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:03,968
America

2447
02:12:04,224 --> 02:12:05,248
Government

2448
02:12:05,504 --> 02:12:06,784
Elvis

2449
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:09,344
Absolutely

2450
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:14,976
You're like Wonder Woman millionaire

2451
02:12:15,744 --> 02:12:16,768
You're not mainland

2452
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:19,584
You were saying

2453
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:27,264
Anyway I know but that was that was a joke

2454
02:12:28,544 --> 02:12:31,104
I want to leave you with

2455
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:31,872
A fun

2456
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:34,688
Jake this episode

2457
02:12:35,712 --> 02:12:39,040
I would say largely evidence that Alex Jones

2458
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:39,808
The party

2459
02:12:40,576 --> 02:12:45,184
Has been

2460
02:12:46,976 --> 02:12:47,744
But

2461
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:52,864
Now I have always been a Critic of Alex Jones

2462
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:55,168
Childhood literacy

2463
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:06,432
Star Wars Trilogy in one paperback by dad

2464
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:09,760
I think I actually read that

2465
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:17,696
When I was 7 years old

2466
02:13:19,488 --> 02:13:22,304
William

2467
02:13:24,864 --> 02:13:26,656
5

2468
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:28,192
And

2469
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:36,128
My mom's doing

2470
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:39,456
Do you understand that

2471
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:40,736
But

2472
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:42,784
Did you understand

2473
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:49,440
He was just looking at book

2474
02:13:51,232 --> 02:13:53,536
Is not

2475
02:13:53,792 --> 02:13:54,560
History

2476
02:13:56,608 --> 02:14:00,704
Well I mean the parts of history that he's involved with don't go well

2477
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:03,264
No as lot of philosophy

2478
02:14:06,336 --> 02:14:08,896
And if you're somebody who's into that

2479
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:11,200
I'm not into you

2480
02:14:11,712 --> 02:14:12,224
Also

2481
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:18,880
8 years old

2482
02:14:20,672 --> 02:14:23,744
Now obviously that makes me both an interesting person

2483
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:24,768
And

2484
02:14:26,304 --> 02:14:27,584
Think I should be murdered

2485
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:28,352
Like

2486
02:14:28,608 --> 02:14:33,728
That's what you say to me if you're an eight-year-old who this just furthers my argument that I've been making

2487
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:38,848
Entire goddamn time understand

2488
02:14:39,104 --> 02:14:40,384
You studied in for capstan

2489
02:14:41,152 --> 02:14:43,712
I wonder if you understood the Star Wars trilogy

2490
02:14:43,968 --> 02:14:44,480
Probably not

2491
02:14:44,736 --> 02:14:50,880
Yeah he plays The Imperial March all the time on his show

2492
02:14:53,184 --> 02:14:54,464
9 years old I read a bunch of

2493
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:55,744
Tintin that my dad

2494
02:14:58,048 --> 02:14:59,584
Ridiculous

2495
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:01,120
I grew up in my

2496
02:15:01,376 --> 02:15:02,912
I like the stories but

2497
02:15:03,168 --> 02:15:04,448
Holyshit

2498
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:06,496
Holy Ship

2499
02:15:09,824 --> 02:15:15,968
In the house

2500
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:18,784
Does a child isn't like wandering around going like

2501
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:21,856
Fork with the world like

2502
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:23,392
Crazy

2503
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:25,952
I'd forgotten about it

2504
02:15:26,464 --> 02:15:27,232
College

2505
02:15:29,792 --> 02:15:30,304
And I was like

2506
02:15:35,168 --> 02:15:35,936
Oh no

2507
02:15:36,704 --> 02:15:42,336
This is

2508
02:15:42,592 --> 02:15:43,360
Also the child

2509
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:53,088
Is no concrete

2510
02:15:58,720 --> 02:15:59,232
It's

2511
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:02,816
The problem that we run into

2512
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:05,120
Is the limits of our

2513
02:16:05,376 --> 02:16:07,424
Well

2514
02:16:08,192 --> 02:16:10,496
Investigative abilities

2515
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:12,544
Insofar as

2516
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:13,568
We have

2517
02:16:14,592 --> 02:16:17,408
I think the most circumstantial evidence

2518
02:16:17,664 --> 02:16:19,456
That you could ever meet

2519
02:16:19,968 --> 02:16:21,504
To convince somebody of

2520
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:22,272
Committing

2521
02:16:22,528 --> 02:16:23,040
Tracy

2522
02:16:23,808 --> 02:16:25,600
But we don't have that like

2523
02:16:25,856 --> 02:16:26,368
By Whitney

2524
02:16:27,136 --> 02:16:28,416
Like we don't have that

2525
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:32,768
Prince you know what I'm saying

2526
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:37,120
Well yeah but if you could

2527
02:16:37,376 --> 02:16:40,192
Actually get him I mean I suppose if you testified

2528
02:16:45,312 --> 02:16:45,824
See you again

2529
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:46,592
Cell

2530
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:48,640
We moved to us

2531
02:16:49,408 --> 02:16:51,200
Become lawyers

2532
02:16:51,456 --> 02:16:52,224
Pasta Bar

2533
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:58,624
Four years as public defenders that care about that

2534
02:16:59,392 --> 02:16:59,904
Yeah

2535
02:17:00,416 --> 02:17:00,928
His ex-wife

2536
02:17:01,184 --> 02:17:02,464
Is now trying to sleep

2537
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:04,000
Unplugged

2538
02:17:05,536 --> 02:17:06,048
What

2539
02:17:06,304 --> 02:17:07,840
But if we get

2540
02:17:09,376 --> 02:17:10,400
As material with

2541
02:17:12,448 --> 02:17:13,472
You know what

2542
02:17:13,984 --> 02:17:14,752
Make Alex answers

2543
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:18,848
You can just use bring things up

2544
02:17:25,248 --> 02:17:28,576
Alex new stuff

2545
02:17:28,832 --> 02:17:31,648
Yeah

2546
02:17:31,904 --> 02:17:32,928
A timeline

2547
02:17:35,744 --> 02:17:36,256
John Saxon

2548
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:38,304
I love this because

2549
02:17:38,816 --> 02:17:39,584
This to me

2550
02:17:41,632 --> 02:17:43,936
This is the reason why

2551
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:45,728
He knows people are like

2552
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:47,264
Let me know if you committed

2553
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:49,312
Dude

2554
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:52,384
So what time with just

2555
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:53,152
Screaming

2556
02:17:54,176 --> 02:17:55,456
Saying the same things he did

2557
02:17:55,712 --> 02:17:56,992
Back before that are less

2558
02:17:58,784 --> 02:17:59,296
You could go into the

2559
02:18:01,344 --> 02:18:01,856
Much deeper now.

2560
02:18:04,416 --> 02:18:04,928
Condo on

2561
02:18:07,488 --> 02:18:08,256
Now we're going to

2562
02:18:08,512 --> 02:18:09,792
Going to save you

2563
02:18:10,304 --> 02:18:12,352
Or whatever

2564
02:18:12,608 --> 02:18:13,888
Zenith

2565
02:18:14,144 --> 02:18:15,168
Because that's what is

2566
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:15,936
Okay

2567
02:18:16,192 --> 02:18:17,216
What's not okay

2568
02:18:17,472 --> 02:18:17,984
Is recognized

2569
02:18:19,776 --> 02:18:20,288
Dude

2570
02:18:21,056 --> 02:18:21,568
You

2571
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:24,128
You don't know it

2572
02:18:25,408 --> 02:18:25,920
You do know it

2573
02:18:26,432 --> 02:18:27,712
But you might not be aware of it

2574
02:18:28,736 --> 02:18:29,504
Your time is

2575
02:18:30,528 --> 02:18:31,552
You know what

2576
02:18:31,808 --> 02:18:33,600
I feel like this is

2577
02:18:33,856 --> 02:18:35,136
I I feel like you're wrong

2578
02:18:35,648 --> 02:18:39,232
Based on like the Megyn Kelly interview situation

2579
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:40,512
Where Alex

2580
02:18:41,024 --> 02:18:43,072
New note he said some s***

2581
02:18:43,328 --> 02:18:45,120
Where he should have been dead to rights

2582
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:47,424
And then whatever it actually came out

2583
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:48,704
There was f****** nuts

2584
02:18:49,472 --> 02:18:52,800
Node like eat the same thing though because he under

2585
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:58,944
They're not going to play the clip

2586
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:04,576
There was going to try and make him feel bad by playing good

2587
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:08,672
About that

2588
02:19:09,952 --> 02:19:11,232
Give a shilling

2589
02:19:14,048 --> 02:19:18,912
He's just going to say like I want to apologize to them for what the media has said about

2590
02:19:19,424 --> 02:19:25,568
I want to make it right I want look to everyone lies about Megyn Kelly show

2591
02:19:26,848 --> 02:19:29,152
Here's what you do

2592
02:19:31,968 --> 02:19:32,480
Now

2593
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:34,272
Beyond

2594
02:19:34,784 --> 02:19:36,320
Here's what happens when you do that

2595
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:38,880
Alex will storm out

2596
02:19:39,392 --> 02:19:40,672
He won't sign the release

2597
02:19:42,976 --> 02:19:43,488
Fair enough

2598
02:19:43,744 --> 02:19:45,536
You sign the release beforehand

2599
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:46,816
The f****** video

2600
02:19:49,888 --> 02:19:53,216
The way that he was acting about the way that he was afraid

2601
02:19:53,984 --> 02:19:56,032
Genuine

2602
02:19:57,568 --> 02:19:59,872
It suggests to me that he signed it before

2603
02:20:00,896 --> 02:20:04,480
Like he would have been afraid if if he had

2604
02:20:04,736 --> 02:20:09,088
Final Cut Alex does not have any fear

2605
02:20:09,344 --> 02:20:10,624
But you didn't have any

2606
02:20:11,648 --> 02:20:15,488
You're right of approval or whatever it is

2607
02:20:17,536 --> 02:20:18,048
Right

2608
02:20:18,816 --> 02:20:19,328
He's an inch

2609
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:21,632
She pretends

2610
02:20:21,888 --> 02:20:24,192
How these shows are made and stuff like that

2611
02:20:24,704 --> 02:20:26,752
But he doesn't really understand it so he

2612
02:20:27,008 --> 02:20:27,520
He knows

2613
02:20:28,032 --> 02:20:28,544
4 hours

2614
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:29,568
He probably was

2615
02:20:29,824 --> 02:20:30,848
On a hot mic

2616
02:20:31,104 --> 02:20:32,128
Right

2617
02:20:32,384 --> 02:20:35,200
Stupid s*** could be used against

2618
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:38,272
But like

2619
02:20:39,552 --> 02:20:40,320
Keno's

2620
02:20:40,576 --> 02:20:42,624
Probably like off camera

2621
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:43,904
He seemed

2622
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:44,672
The jinx

2623
02:20:45,952 --> 02:20:49,536
Well I probably said something really was f***** up and

2624
02:20:49,792 --> 02:20:55,424
They could use that against me is like

2625
02:20:57,984 --> 02:21:00,800
That's what he's afraid of on some level not realizing this is

2626
02:21:01,312 --> 02:21:02,848
F****** stackery niece

2627
02:21:03,104 --> 02:21:07,968
Sunday night show yeah all they want to do is make him look bad about Sandy Hook

2628
02:21:08,224 --> 02:21:09,504
But not too bad

2629
02:21:10,016 --> 02:21:13,344
Look like he was wrong

2630
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:20,256
That is something that is indicative of a larger issues but not like him

2631
02:21:20,512 --> 02:21:21,280
Apps

2632
02:21:21,536 --> 02:21:22,048
Solutely

2633
02:21:22,304 --> 02:21:23,328
It ruined the entire pie

2634
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:26,144
The whole show was about him

2635
02:21:27,424 --> 02:21:28,704
It was not about him

2636
02:21:31,008 --> 02:21:32,032
The pre-show

2637
02:21:32,544 --> 02:21:33,312
News about him squirming

2638
02:21:34,848 --> 02:21:35,872
It works for both

2639
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:37,408
Anyway

2640
02:21:42,272 --> 02:21:48,416
In concert with each other like

2641
02:21:48,672 --> 02:21:50,976
All kind of know what it is they're going for

2642
02:21:51,232 --> 02:21:52,512
They're all combat

2643
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:55,584
Have You Seen Her daytime talk show

2644
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:58,144
Juicy

2645
02:21:58,656 --> 02:21:59,680
It was brutal

2646
02:22:00,192 --> 02:22:01,728
I don't know I don't know

2647
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:03,264
How it is we're supposed to

2648
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:06,336
In a way that doesn't

2649
02:22:06,592 --> 02:22:08,640
Involve like actually putting

2650
02:22:09,152 --> 02:22:09,920
Propaganda

2651
02:22:10,432 --> 02:22:10,944
In jail

2652
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:13,504
Is propaganda

2653
02:22:14,016 --> 02:22:17,344
Never experienced any consequences for their actions

2654
02:22:19,136 --> 02:22:20,416
Then it's never going to stop

2655
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:24,512
Because propaganda is only going to get more

2656
02:22:26,304 --> 02:22:26,816
Yeah

2657
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:28,608
Information Warfare

2658
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:29,632
4 in

2659
02:22:29,888 --> 02:22:31,424
Infowars

2660
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:33,472
Still think

2661
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:36,032
Beheading of

2662
02:22:41,152 --> 02:22:41,920
Responsibility

2663
02:22:43,968 --> 02:22:44,736
Like because

2664
02:22:45,504 --> 02:22:46,528
It's not a crime to lie

2665
02:22:47,296 --> 02:22:48,064
Accepting the situation

2666
02:22:49,088 --> 02:22:49,600
You're lying about

2667
02:22:50,112 --> 02:22:50,624
The building burning

2668
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:52,672
Or something like that

2669
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:55,488
Look dude

2670
02:22:55,744 --> 02:22:57,792
Book propaganda should be illegal

2671
02:22:58,048 --> 02:23:00,352
Then going to open up a can of worms look like what

2672
02:23:00,608 --> 02:23:01,376
Is propaganda

2673
02:23:01,632 --> 02:23:06,496
Definition between

2674
02:23:07,264 --> 02:23:07,776
No

2675
02:23:08,032 --> 02:23:08,544
It's not

2676
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:10,080
It's Logistics

2677
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:13,920
Where where

2678
02:23:14,176 --> 02:23:14,688
You draw the line

2679
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:16,224
That's not the same as a slippery

2680
02:23:17,248 --> 02:23:20,064
Slippery slope of you like I say this is illegal now this

2681
02:23:22,368 --> 02:23:25,184
What you're saying is that

2682
02:23:25,696 --> 02:23:28,000
If we are going to start making laws

2683
02:23:28,512 --> 02:23:29,280
About property

2684
02:23:30,048 --> 02:23:31,328
Then it matters

2685
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:32,864
Who is in

2686
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:34,144
Control

2687
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:34,912
How those laws

2688
02:23:36,192 --> 02:23:36,960
Like with

2689
02:23:37,216 --> 02:23:39,264
Trump and illegal immigration

2690
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:41,312
Or what well you know

2691
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:47,712
What makes a conversation

2692
02:23:47,968 --> 02:23:48,992
Who's going to be president

2693
02:23:49,248 --> 02:23:50,528
And over again

2694
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:56,672
Deported more than you know if it's like

2695
02:23:57,184 --> 02:23:59,232
Regardless of who's in Powerade

2696
02:23:59,488 --> 02:24:02,048
Does matter about how they exercise

2697
02:24:02,304 --> 02:24:04,096
That power products

2698
02:24:04,352 --> 02:24:08,192
So I so I don't know they say it's a slippery slope argument

2699
02:24:09,216 --> 02:24:10,240
The way that

2700
02:24:11,008 --> 02:24:14,336
Who the f*** knows if an autocrat is going to become president

2701
02:24:14,848 --> 02:24:15,616
That's not

2702
02:24:17,664 --> 02:24:18,688
That is 8

2703
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:19,712
CERN

2704
02:24:20,224 --> 02:24:20,992
That's not

2705
02:24:21,248 --> 02:24:23,296
There are there is a difference between

2706
02:24:26,368 --> 02:24:28,416
Voicing of a concern of what

2707
02:24:28,672 --> 02:24:30,464
What could be possible in the future

2708
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:32,000
Different

2709
02:24:32,256 --> 02:24:35,840
That's like that's like I do this and then right

2710
02:24:36,096 --> 02:24:37,376
Before you know it acts

2711
02:24:37,888 --> 02:24:42,752
Well it but at the same time we are dear wifey

2712
02:24:43,008 --> 02:24:44,800
That means that in the future

2713
02:24:45,312 --> 02:24:48,128
The other person can do this because it's

2714
02:24:48,384 --> 02:24:51,200
That's not a slippery slope that's just recognizing the future

2715
02:24:51,456 --> 02:24:53,760
Also the creation of ice

2716
02:24:54,016 --> 02:24:59,648
And the way that we all assumed that Obama was fine

2717
02:24:59,904 --> 02:25:06,048
Obama was against from the jump and then he allowed

2718
02:25:08,608 --> 02:25:14,496
And then truck is in power and all the sudden that hog-wild that Obama allowed

2719
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:15,520
Weiner

2720
02:25:15,776 --> 02:25:16,800
No could get

2721
02:25:17,056 --> 02:25:17,568
Worse

2722
02:25:20,384 --> 02:25:20,896
Cuz like I think

2723
02:25:23,456 --> 02:25:25,248
Just as a person who was out

2724
02:25:25,504 --> 02:25:26,272
About

2725
02:25:26,528 --> 02:25:27,040
Living the life

2726
02:25:27,296 --> 02:25:27,808
I knew that

2727
02:25:28,064 --> 02:25:28,576
Ice was

2728
02:25:31,392 --> 02:25:32,928
Yeah even another

2729
02:25:35,488 --> 02:25:36,512
I would go to open mic

2730
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:37,792
I hear from people

2731
02:25:38,048 --> 02:25:39,328
There were

2732
02:25:40,352 --> 02:25:40,864
Trap

2733
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:41,632
Yeah

2734
02:25:41,888 --> 02:25:43,424
Yeah we're just trying to get

2735
02:25:43,936 --> 02:25:44,448
Immigrants

2736
02:25:44,704 --> 02:25:46,496
Legal or illegal

2737
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:49,312
Separated

2738
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:51,104
Right

2739
02:25:52,128 --> 02:25:52,640
What's going on

2740
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:02,880
Not who gives a s*** about that

2741
02:26:03,136 --> 02:26:04,160
Like we got an

2742
02:26:04,416 --> 02:26:10,560
No I'm saying is that in Chicago the urban

2743
02:26:10,816 --> 02:26:15,168
Enforcement is at 101 West

2744
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:17,728
Is Parkway Chicago Illinois

2745
02:26:17,984 --> 02:26:18,496
If

2746
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:20,032
Feel like protest

2747
02:26:21,056 --> 02:26:24,384
Feel free to show up at awesome

2748
02:26:24,896 --> 02:26:25,664
And laugh

2749
02:26:26,432 --> 02:26:27,200
So there's been

2750
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:29,248
Some murders

2751
02:26:29,504 --> 02:26:30,528
By the police

2752
02:26:30,784 --> 02:26:31,296
Ear Inn

2753
02:26:31,552 --> 02:26:32,576
Chicago

2754
02:26:33,088 --> 02:26:35,648
Yeah I mean they're always are but these ones are

2755
02:26:35,904 --> 02:26:40,256
The Chicago Police Department is a white supremacist organization that is

2756
02:26:40,512 --> 02:26:41,280
Willing to murder

2757
02:26:41,792 --> 02:26:42,304
We have

2758
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:47,680
Where people are tortured

2759
02:26:47,936 --> 02:26:52,032
Police Department

2760
02:26:52,288 --> 02:26:52,800
F******

2761
02:26:53,056 --> 02:26:54,080
Abolish

2762
02:26:54,336 --> 02:26:56,128
And replaced with a I don't know

2763
02:26:56,384 --> 02:26:57,920
Community policing or something

2764
02:26:58,688 --> 02:26:59,968
But yeah we're

2765
02:27:00,224 --> 02:27:03,040
We're overwhelmed by white supremacists

2766
02:27:03,296 --> 02:27:03,808
Terrorist

2767
02:27:04,576 --> 02:27:09,440
Good time is knowledge

2768
02:27:13,536 --> 02:27:19,680
Absolutely

2769
02:27:19,936 --> 02:27:20,704
Episode

2770
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:23,008
You could leave a reply

2771
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:25,568
Please share this episode

2772
02:27:25,824 --> 02:27:27,104
Because I think the evidence

2773
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:28,384
Uncovered

2774
02:27:28,896 --> 02:27:30,176
I think a lot of people needs

2775
02:27:35,296 --> 02:27:36,576
What is very clearly

2776
02:27:37,344 --> 02:27:38,368
He has knowledge

2777
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:41,184
This is

2778
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:42,464
Probably

2779
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:47,584
Not incontrovertible but God damn close to

2780
02:27:48,352 --> 02:27:51,168
It's proof that Alex was aware of trees

2781
02:27:52,704 --> 02:27:54,496
Way more very specific way

2782
02:27:55,264 --> 02:27:55,776
Absolutely

2783
02:27:57,824 --> 02:28:03,200
Your turn. I just don't want

2784
02:28:03,712 --> 02:28:04,480
I don't like doing

2785
02:28:04,736 --> 02:28:09,344
So are you something right now I'm thrilled to make you

2786
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:11,136
The thing that

2787
02:28:11,392 --> 02:28:12,416
Bothers me the most

2788
02:28:13,952 --> 02:28:16,000
Early

2789
02:28:16,256 --> 02:28:17,792
At least for today

2790
02:28:18,816 --> 02:28:22,912
Is that the u.s. ambassador to England

2791
02:28:23,424 --> 02:28:27,776
Absolutely lobbied the government to try and get Tommy

2792
02:28:28,032 --> 02:28:29,824
F****** Robinson

2793
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:31,360
Released from prison

2794
02:28:32,384 --> 02:28:36,480
If I have anybody who should go f*** themselves

2795
02:28:36,992 --> 02:28:39,040
70% of the state department

2796
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:44,672
Oh okay

2797
02:28:51,584 --> 02:28:52,096
To someone else

2798
02:28:52,352 --> 02:28:53,120
I understand

2799
02:28:54,656 --> 02:29:00,288
Alright

2800
02:29:03,104 --> 02:29:04,128
Well I mean obviously

2801
02:29:04,384 --> 02:29:04,896
Play the most

2802
02:29:05,152 --> 02:29:05,664
Important

2803
02:29:06,176 --> 02:29:08,224
That needs to go

2804
02:29:08,736 --> 02:29:10,528
LG styler and profiler in

2805
02:29:10,784 --> 02:29:13,088
That will almost certainly

2806
02:29:13,344 --> 02:29:15,392
Wind up getting

2807
02:29:16,672 --> 02:29:18,208
Go fuc yourself Rodger Stone

2808
02:29:23,072 --> 02:29:26,656
Alex
