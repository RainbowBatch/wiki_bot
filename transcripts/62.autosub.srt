Novelty Beverages and have conversations about Alex Jones

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,432
The reason that we do that

5
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,480
Because you know a lot about

6
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,552
That's true

7
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:29,952
Conversely you know a lot about novelty

8
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,256

14
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:00,160
Let me not really but

15
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:03,744

21
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,824
Not good

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,456

23
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,272

2015 about the other day I'm specifically

69
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:47,840
I told you it was one of the most upsetting episodes of his show that I've ever listened

70
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,008
Well it turns out there's a lot of stuff that happened in the summer of 2015

71
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,312
Maybe we don't remember happened

72
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
In such close

73
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,872
Succession with each other

74
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,200
That's just a little bit

75
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
Distracted

76
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,552
Let's

77
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,368
High-profile murder

78
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
That happens

79
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,952
News coverage of it

80
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
He's less than tacky

81
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Tacky

82
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,887
Malaysian plane

83
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,703
The camp so we can do is start to show off

84
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,495
The fun out of context drop

85
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:38,015
Oh my gosh

86
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:42,623
What's up

87
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:49,023
I'd like this Vicky this is terrible he's not having fun in contact

88
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,887
Also I don't I don't think we've ever played an instance of him

89
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,191
I'm talking about Rachel Maddow being a man

90
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,007
All the time we were able to

91
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Slipping on ice

92
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,567
Example of

93
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:09,503
Rachel Maddow

94
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,159
He ends up saying that for her like

95
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:22,047
I would say 20 times

96
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,399
But they're going to take

97
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:35,359
Pretty amazing predictive powers on a Chevy Spark

98
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,431
At least in regard to

99
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,295
Caserta fulfill his

100
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,111
They're coming for me narrative

101
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,439
Either 12 or nipping at his heels

102
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,511
I would also love to crash

103
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,911
That's where we start on August 19th

104
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Nice

105
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,007
Country-fried bigotry

106
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
Alex Jones

107
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
Stalking

108
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
About

109
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
Frank Marshall Davis

110
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
Being

111
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
Barack Obama's dad

112
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:18,879
Oh yeah I remember that I remember that one

113
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,255
I want to say that I don't care

114
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,279
About what

115
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:31,679
The reality is I'll take Barack Obama at his word about who is

116
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:38,335
Also if it is the truth that is Frank Marshall Davis I don't really give a s*** about.

117
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
Weird

118
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,407
Well Rory scovel

119
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,199

00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,999
Are you kidding me like right field that the craziest

125
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
Something that ever happened

126
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
Dude you did

127
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,775

Add black

129
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:16,479
President is insanely High

130
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:21,855
We're on the other end of his presidency is over I don't see what game

131
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,391
Was being played by this

132
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:29,791
40 year long, Frank Marshall Davis being his dad I have no f****** idea

133
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,351
You really need is a Centrist position

134
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:39,007
Lighthouse 40 years from now guy who inspires liberals but still commits War

135
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,543
Cry

136
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
Maybe

137
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
False flag by Trump

138
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:49,759
How else could Trump become president if we didn't rile up all the race

139
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,599
No totally put that that's the other thing that I wanted to talk about

140
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,135
Is it

141
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,415
Premise

142
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,439
Is that

143
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,511
Is Barack Obama

144
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,327
The whole ten yards

145
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,887
Was cooked up by the Obamacare

146
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,007
To trick people he wants to trick people off the scent

147
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,335
Of the Frank Marshall Davis line

148
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,407
Different layers of mulch

149
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
I don't know

150
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,783
I don't know what is

151
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,319
Alex Jones is

152
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343

00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
Was that he got duped

154
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Some fake

155
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
Ploy that was

156
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,023
Utilizing only races

157
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:37,887
The fake story of of Kenya

158
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,911
Is fueled

159
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,495
Racism these globalist

160
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:47,615
They knew that they could get Alex Jones to jump on board and all of these people if they just

161
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
Braces

162
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,943
Frank Marshall Davis

163
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,271
To do right

164
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551

00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
Callahan

170
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,751
Executor is the clip from August 19th Aries

171
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
I want you to keep

172
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
Keep track of his phrasing

173
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
Strikes me as very racist

174
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
Is father

175
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,991
Misty Lee

176
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,807
Was incredibly black African

177
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,159
Budget

178
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,487

179
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,583
Got the bone structure Marshall Davis

180
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
Text

181
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,655
Getting a right there at the end

182
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,959
No these nuts

183
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
Is not

184
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,079
Jermaine to his

185
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,663
Normal verb

186
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,223
But Obama is a mixed-race man

187
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:01,343
Do they still have no idea how that's a possibility like

188
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
I like

189
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
MSP

190
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,255
The only thing that raises were doing when Obama was running

191
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,143
Why don't you

192
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,447
How do you redeem

193
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,543
I made that is just bi-racial version of hasselt

194
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,567
Do a racist

195
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
The obvious reasons why

196
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,455
Is because if you are area

197
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,271
If you are at all black people treat you

198
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,903
Its roots in all those like a racial death

199
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:41,791
Kinlaw's

200
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,607
Earlier than that I apologized

201
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,703
Make strict rules about quadroon

202
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
You can't

203
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
You can't

204
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,431
History of trying to class

205
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,991
Ossify people and it's always to protect whitening

206
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,527
Always

207
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
The game is

208
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
So

209
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
Have fun

210
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,647
Call somebody

211
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
We'll have fun

212
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,255
Continuing that Trend Alex cuz it's certainly

213
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
I protect

214
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,095
Due to our future 50 years later

215
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,935
Yeah

216
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
We have some problems

217
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,239
Racism in the world and

218
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
Are sad about it

219
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,895
Try to recognize that wherever we can even in our own

220
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Selves

221
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
But

222
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
Galaxy like

223
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Costantino

224
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
And that is that

225
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
It's really the global

226
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
That's really

227
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,303
Thoughts on it

228
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,119
Come together

229
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,215
The technology we need to gather on the resources

230
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:58,847
Movie asteroid

231
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
Because basically

232
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,271
What we're facing

233
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,367
I don't want to fight with dementia lorazepam

234
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
I don't want to fight

235
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,927
With the

236
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:20,095
Will the Nation of Islam I don't want to fight with the Catholics

237
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,143
Stupid

238
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,591
But it's going to destroy us in the end

239
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:38,015
And the globalist have totally betrayed the people that follow them

240
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,439
It was always there too just to make it even worse

241
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
I does intractable

242
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
It's out of control

243
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,983
That's why I have such a big problem

244
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,847
With people that

245
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,175
Conspiracy theorist about all this

246
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
Avoid that reaction

247
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
And from people that is don't

248
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,831
Spell crazy b*******

249
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,135
Doesn't make sense

250
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
Just like

251
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
That's why

252
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
Evan

253
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:25,631
It's like all the stuff demented that's why I frustrating

254
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,959
No you can't have

255
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,775
His argument is the globalist

256
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,359
To trick people into being racially accepting

257
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
But the real game

258
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
Getting everyone mad at each other

259
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
And that's why

260
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,247
Yeah but

261
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,039
Correct

262
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,599
No

263
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
Andy doesn't prove that any

264
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,975
Alex Jones is a real not

265
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,471
Do not

266
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,263
And a sentence preposition

267
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,335
Aurora talk to the dream

268
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,919
So at this episode he's also talking a whole bunch

269
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,223
About Hillary and her server

270
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
I issue that's popping up

271
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,575
Course agent believes every single rumor about it

272
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
Going to be on the show

273
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:26,559
He also talked about how she got on Snapchat

274
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
For her campaign

275
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,983
Everything just disappears on its own

276
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:41,919
Vanderbilt football

277
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:48,575
Not a good if I were like

278
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,391
I don't know

279
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Goodbye

280
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
Play

281
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
Gametime

282
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,327
The reality is that you didn't really do anything majorly Ali

283
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
She did not

284
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
Especially with the servers

285
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:06,495
That was any different than past secretaries of State

286
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Done

287
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,311
I in some capacity or another

288
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
The same ship

289
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,575
Varying degrees of

290
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
Tillerson

291
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,927
Having a fake pseudonym email address

292
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:30,559
Be that as it may

293
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,375
Trolling

294
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
Yeah she's trolling

295
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,775
People who hate her but

296
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
Like I think

297
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
That liberals

298
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
Per se

299
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,223
Maybe it maybe it's not fair to blanket

300
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,015
With liberals

301
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,319
But she didn't realize the response

302
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
That the right

303
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,647
Alright would have

304
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:04,095
I know they're both are such bullying snowflakes pushback against

305
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
They begin to cry like little girls

306
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:10,751
Trolling on the right most of his become such a white noise

307
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
Guys just shut the

308
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,567
Or you just blocked

309
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,591
People on Twitter

310
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,127
Indian do you move on with your life

311
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,431
The response that people on the right have to be

312
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
Controlled is

313
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
Vile

314
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,271
And you spit it out

315
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
You seemed like the

316
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,343
Text woman

317
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,391
Human

318
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:37,375
Why are there no conservative comedians because they understand jokes

319
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,935
F*** you

320
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:46,335
You've clearly never seen Dennis Miller on The O'Reilly Factor

321
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
Hilarious

322
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,087
I bet if you have a free like 15 minutes if you want to have a great time go check out the eclipse from the majority report

323
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,879
Where's Sam Cedar and

324
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:04,767
Andy Kindler breakdown Dennis Miller's appearances

325
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
So funny

326
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Moving along

327
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,655
On this August 19th episode also

328
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
Alex

329
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,495
The body

330
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
Jesse Ventura

331
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,847
We're past the point where he's bullshiting

332
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,639
About his court

333
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,687
We're not doing

334
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,807
To talk sense

335
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,111
Alex

336
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,719
Hey Jessie Ventura is position is

337
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Fucktrump

338
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:39,839
No it's interesting you like I don't agree with the things he's saying at all

339
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,631
But I liked him and Bernie

340
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
In terms of

341
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,239
Wrestling power away from the two parties

342
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,055
Write with philosophically

343
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,871
Had we known at that point the consequences

344
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,967
I would I would taper it a little

345
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,503
Rather than rustic

346
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,831
Control away from the two parties

347
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,415
Only Consolidated it more around

348
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,583
See where he's coming from

349
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,143
You know these two candidates on the right

350
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,679
Are mixing

351
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,311
Get you make some good points about that but into

352
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Some immigration

353
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
Jesse Ventura

354
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
Proposes

355
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:30,527
Described as a thought experiment that Alex thinks is a literal suggestion

356
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,807
It's a little weird

357
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,671
Bernie Sanders

358
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:45,119
Exposing

359
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,591
Come in

360
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,871
Keisha

361
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:59,967
Frotteurism

362
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,015
U.s. citizen

363
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:05,087
America

364
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,927
Get everything for free

365
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,719
Overall

366
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:17,119
To do that or being leashes and the politicians that allow those laws to be in place

367
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:21,727
And so are you

368
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:27,103
About the fairness issue with the first thing that you could do that Alex

369
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,223
McDonald's to get together and lead the charge to take down the Statue of Liberty

370
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,807
Nice

371
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:43,231
Chester That's Country

372
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
Alex

373
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,495
Every immigrant immigrant group in America

374
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,287
It's going through the same thing

375
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,615
Italian

376
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,151
Whatever it happened

377
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,991
They all went through the same thing nobody wanted them here

378
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:11,391
Everybody wanted them kicked out older coming here they're taking out

379
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,511
What states on the Statue of Liberty

380
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,703
Well then we should take that symbol.

381
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:31,103
Illinois legal

382
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:37,247
Doesn't

383
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:42,623
Because they're poor or something I should have our values as a society

384
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,903
And Alex thinks it's like

385
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:51,327
Right and then the other thing is Alex saying that immigrants experience

386
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,399
Is David Hollywood

387
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
F*** you

388
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:59,007
One thing I don't understand have you ever read a newspaper from

389
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,543
History

390
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,359
Editorials

391
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:08,223
Every Todd like when the Irish came over you can go back and read editorials

392
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:14,879
These people are going to destroy America and they're not even real people

393
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,184
Country weather

394
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:25,376
These violent skirmishes to bring it over here

395
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
In our resources

396
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,704
It's such a boring

397
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:35,616
Is it things are all like Hollywood

398
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,384
Meanwhile

399
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,784
To make his argument

400
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,368
Hollywood tells the truth whenever

401
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
Where is the line

402
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,744
There is no luck real

403
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,864
Meltdown

404
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
John

405
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,448
Gunn Bagel giant gum

406
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,264
Just give the Statue of Liberty a gun

407
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,568
None of that still great great

408
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,616
Rebuild the arm

409
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
It faces up

410
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,968
Got a gun in it and every

411
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
It shoots into the air

412
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:17,088
Every time an immigrant comes in and shoots off

413
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:29,632
Also I think that's a great feminist

414
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:33,472
Make it an hour

415
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,312
Hey babe I'm glad you brought up

416
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,848
The idea of guns

417
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,384
Because this next

418
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,152
Clap

419
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
Alex Jones

420
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,224
Discusses his feelings about immigration

421
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,552
Realized

422
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,600
That a lot of his

423
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,368
Fears

424
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,904
About immigration

425
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,184
It's not about

426
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,744
It's not really about

427
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,304
You know them committing violent Acts

428
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,120
Did uses

429
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,240
People like every time there's some story about an immigrant killing somebody like

430
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,800
It's not really about

431
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,872
Clippy sort of spells out

432
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,896
What the

433
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
Endgame

434
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,224
The he foresees of immigrants

435
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,248
It's coming in is

436
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,320
It actually took me it made me pause for a moment

437
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:26,720
There's a globalist industrial plant

438
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,792
A different political balkanization

439
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,008
Those beneath them bad that's just

440
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,568
And the Italians of the Irish all the rest of it

441
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,152
Other immigrants the Chinese were treated terribly

442
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,856
Welcome all

443
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:58,976
The problem is the Socialist the Ford Foundation

444
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:03,072
5060 million illegals

445
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,376
Adam basically all vote socialist

446
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,424
Don't take the guns

447
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:12,800
And you incentivize

448
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,824
It's not fair

449
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,360
Go to Mexico

450
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,408
With my wife

451
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,224
Welfare

452
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,320
I don't personally I don't think it's really reasonable argument to

453
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,344
Say what other country

454
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
Please do

455
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,136
In order to

456
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,440
Rationalize our talk about what we do

457
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,024
Potatoes

458
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,400
I could have phrased that

459
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,216
Better than

460
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,008
We should do everything

461
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:49,408
Conception

462
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:53,248
We're going to be there going to be

463
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:57,088
Yeah like socialist benefits and what has you

464
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:01,696
I'll become a voting Bloc

465
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,232
Everything goes back to God

466
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,024
He just loves gun

467
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,352
Can we just give them guns and then put the

468
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,632
Guess what

469
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,912
He have plenty of

470
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
Like

471
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:19,616
Okay so here's what we do

472
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,896
But here's what I

473
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,200
Here's what we do

474
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,480
Outlaw guns

475
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,784
Pretty much everywhere

476
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
The Americans

477
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,112
Okay everybody loves guns

478
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:34,464
Go to Texas go to Arizona go to those places

479
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
Not least

480
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
What

481
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,840
Those are going to be even more deserts very soon

482
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
Yeah

483
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,728
But they deny that will be

484
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,776
It's gorgeous mazos

485
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,824
Already live in Texas

486
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,104
Basically a desert

487
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:56,480
I got property taxes even cheaper out there something about you can set up a studio

488
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,016
The gun everytime you go

489
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:03,904
10% of a gun every time you go to church

490
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,488
Alright I'll give you the holster today

491
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:12,096
Preacher I'm completely fascinated o b how all roads lead to Gunn

492
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,888
Ben Alex Jones Is Mine

493
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,824
Kind of going to be a through line through today's episode does spoiler alert

494
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,408
This episode is going to go up to August 26th

495
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
Really

496
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,248
Change it all

497
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,808
He's still in a position where he's like

498
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,344
I don't really trust them

499
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,696
Your stated I trust Jesse Ventura just you way more

500
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:41,536
He still talked about loving Ram Paul and wishing Rand Paul would say bigoted

501
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:45,632
Tell their it's it's not like the position hasn't evolve

502
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,936
I love Rand Paul but he doesn't hate the Browns

503
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,704
People enough

504
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,592
Yeah he needs to be needs to turn his dog whistle into an air horn and then I will f****** get on board with him

505
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,384
This whole thing is

506
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,152
Is like

507
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,456
We keep getting close and then it just

508
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,480
Horses

509
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:07,136
What what happened to thought it was over we thought you'd made his pivot

510
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:13,024
Stop talking about Trump's mob ties

511
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,632
He's definitely not said at any point to the end of this

512
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,448
Episode 26th as it were

513
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:24,288
That he supports Trump he hasn't said he endorses him is not

514
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,824
Ollie's

515
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,992
Yeah and he's apparently at the gun even though in the past you said that

516
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,784
I don't know Trump has said he

517
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,832
Sports weapons near me

518
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,112
Yeah yeah

519
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,416
Which should be disqualifying for our

520
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
You would think

521
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,744
I don't know it's very weird I don't know what it like

522
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,768
Is there a race

523
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,048
Wii Sports

524
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,352
Like is it

525
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,888
But I also hate immigrants

526
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,168
Like which is stronger

527
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,216
Like push comes to shove

528
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,776
I think I think

529
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
Three options in there

530
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,248
Alright really weird feelings about

531
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,880
I love it

532
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:18,048
I've made huge progress and figuring out his

533
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,352
Chimera

534
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,680
Here's a nice bags next time

535
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,568
Here is Jesse Ventura coming

536
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,848
Alex

537
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,384
And Alex doesn't get it

538
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,944
You can't handle it

539
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,224
Disprove something

540
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,344
Jesse Ventura is King

541
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,136
Statue of Liberty

542
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:49,792
Alex Jones

543
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,560
You heard

544
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,656
We talked over to tiny bit but as soon as he says that

545
00:28:54,912 --> 00:29:00,544
Alex is like 3 seconds of Silence his responses

546
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,456
No that's the argument

547
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,736
But

548
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,600
Even further

549
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
In this next clip

550
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,928
Great shots

551
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,208
Statue of Liberty

552
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:24,608
Call Tumi Tumi get rid of the Statue of Liberty without the walls and we took like Canada

553
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:30,496
Canada to

554
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:36,384
The 9/11 hijackers electrically came down from Canada and harm.

555
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,248
Keep out

556
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:46,112
Will end immigration and all that stuff and then

557
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:55,840
Because it's those people that Harvest our agriculture there are slave labor

558
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,632
Do we have in the country

559
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,936
Again

560
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,960
I'm not

561
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:06,848
I'm not for illegal entry into the country but the point is

562
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:11,968
People who have been in college that have created this problem

563
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,808
Epass the programs that are out there

564
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:20,672
Somebody was not a citizen qualify for government program

565
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,208
That shouldn't happen

566
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,256
By the same token

567
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,328
You put up all these worlds and stuff

568
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:34,752
We really want to be the United States or land

569
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:39,104
Order and what what'll happen if you climb over the wall is that

570
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:48,064
What'll happen if I climb over it to go to Mexico

571
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,280
We are behaving right now

572
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,864
If you read your free were just like 1930s Germany

573
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,936
We're looking to put blame

574
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:09,312
On anyone but ourselves

575
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,896
We blame them for older cars are going to welfare yuck

576
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,712
Doctor's name is Scott Walker just gave

577
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:22,880
Box 250 million dollars of welfare to build a new Arena

578
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,440
Wisconsin-Madison education to do it

579
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
Corporate welfare

580
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,584
Factory back to it again

581
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
We're going to be

582
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:37,728
Type of a country where we're going to put walls up and all that stuff

583
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,288
Then we have to be like these Berlin

584
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,152
And you're going to have to behave us suck

585
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:50,016
Nobody speaking into the country and nobody sneaking out

586
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,184
Seterus

587
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:03,584
African population

588
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Anonymous

589
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,776
Jesse's killing it but also the thing that I think is really important in why I kept

590
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,896
Alex is citing statistics verbatim the David Duke cited to him

591
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:20,224
No s*** do statistics about Africa population

592
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,064
America

593
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,112
Wow before

594
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:31,488
He is like this weird information sponge rag doesn't realize where information

595
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,816
He's he's citing

596
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,096
David Dukes

597
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:39,168
White nationalist positions right in an argument

598
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,472
That really has nothing to do with

599
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,264
What they're talking about

600
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,824
Where Jesse Ventura is dancing circles around

601
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,384
The reality is that you got to

602
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:55,040
Completely border off of militarize the border is coming

603
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,576
East Berlin

604
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,928
Might as well

605
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,744
Yeah might as well

606
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,072
I love it that I wanted Flats

607
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:07,840
Some point

608
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,400
Just Jesse Ventura

609
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,168
Hagen

610
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:15,008
Talking Alex Jones to the Woodshed for like 20 minutes

611
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:18,848
I think I might just put a link up to it cuz it's so visual

612
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,128
Watching Alex Jones

613
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
Beaded face

614
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,968
Headed with facts

615
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,248
We're coming at it with like

616
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,344
What you're saying doesn't make sense

617
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,136
Why do I have them

618
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,792
I love you Jesse Ventura

619
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,328
I wish you would make

620
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,608
Wrong

621
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,888
Yeah

622
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,472
Musica

623
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:50,848
A little beta cock there's no bigger beta cock than anybody

624
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,872
Call themselves

625
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:58,016
So she'll also has an interview with Martin Luther King

626
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,040
Juniors

627
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
Nice

628
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,136
Who was involved with Martin Luther

629
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
Yeah

630
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,208
She's involved with

631
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
Samantha abortion

632
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
Campaign

633
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,048
So she comes on for like 10 minutes

634
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,328
Talk about how

635
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,352
Abortions not great

636
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:16,960
Alex tries to make the interview way more important

637
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,752
But it is and I don't think she

638
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,312
She doesn't seem to have much awareness

639
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,848
Has any idea what

640
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:26,688
Inconsequential

641
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,480
Beano

642
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,272
He's coming up

643
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,344
So

644
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,880
Absolutely

645
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,976
Mad about

646
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,768
Fake stories

647
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,584
Course this is one of them

648
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,376
About you just gone to Europe

649
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,400
If you were call

650
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
Where

651
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,336
Vacation videos with Rob do basically

652
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,152
Amanda

653
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,688
The story about Adam

654
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,136
This is a story about how is difficult for him getting back

655
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:07,904
To the United States

656
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,976
Launch the TV networks

657
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:15,584
I can't get all the other work done I need to do when I have anger issues

658
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:16,864
Which is all the time

659
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,776
I probably had

660
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,384
Maybe $1,000 worth of stuff

661
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,968
My mom some plates

662
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,504
Some jewelry

663
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,576
Girls Bibles

664
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,144
45 skirts

665
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,288
I forgot to keep all the receipts

666
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,360
Customs form

667
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,152
1500

668
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,944
Just to be completely

669
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,808
Kashmir

670
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,672
Going to go 1500

671
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:23,680
Well Uncle Scotty really 1500

672
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:54,144
And I'm just like

673
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,288
Runs Benghazi Islamabad everything takes money from dictators and you're here interrogating me

674
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,944
I'm not scared of you

675
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,888
Call Alex Jones

676
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,424
Of course

677
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,472
What's a gated

678
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,664
You know I haven't

679
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,480
You do don't you

680
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,304
You said you should just

681
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,328
Drive

682
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,936
I was watching

683
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:06,592
People that clearly weren't coming in all you're so close

684
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,408
What if

685
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,928
I don't think you're importing things I go on

686
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,976
Because you can go

687
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:28,352
Blah blah blah

688
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,832
Not just be there in

689
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:53,440
Probably not going to work

690
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,488
This is about a week

691
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,280
After he got back from Europe

692
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,816
So he's done

693
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:03,936
Let's call it 25 hours of radio static

694
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,264
Something tells me this is a ballast story

695
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,592
Maybe he got stopped and had to get something like that

696
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
Baby

697
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,432
Like what

698
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,456
Stonehenge

699
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,040
Also even in his lies

700
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,064
He's like

701
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,600
Seeing people who clearly words

702
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
Alex

703
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,672
What do those people have

704
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,952
Comment

705
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:32,608
I mean yeah even in his fantasy scenario

706
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,936
Assholes because if this lady was like really

707
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:41,568
Hey you know what are you declaring

708
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,944
Pet Society

709
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:53,856
Declaring

710
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,136
It was a good idea

711
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,696
Apparently didn't misinterpret

712
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:08,448
Yeah it's a crazy

713
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:12,544
No

714
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,360
Yeah 1227

715
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,176
Literally saved

716
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,712
The 14 words

717
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,504
I mean there was overlap

718
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,296
But this

719
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:27,648
Strictly speaking if you guys don't know what we're talkin about there

720
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,928
I have

721
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,000
Phrase that they use

722
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,024
It's 14

723
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,584
I can't quote it

724
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,912
From memory cuz I'm not

725
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:41,984
It's good

726
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,520
It's like we have to protect the

727
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:47,360
The future for The Offspring of our race

728
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,040
A lot of people have noticed

729
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:55,808
That

730
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
Donald Trump

731
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,112
Beach in present day

732
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,672
27

733
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,232
Right this moment

734
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,328
Wanted to give

735
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:13,728
Screen door submarine

736
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:19,360
So you gave a speech did evoke a lot of things about our people

737
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,128
And the wasp

738
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,408
Protect

739
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,688
Sing the future of the West

740
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,224
Stuff like that

741
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,504
Old which is code for what

742
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:31,392
Well it is and it isn't it is because of the contacts that we know of Donald Trump

743
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,952
We know things that he said in the

744
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,232
After we can use that to

745
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,768
Inform what he saying

746
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,864
That's right there's the fact that he spent like a year-and-a-half

747
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,144
Trying to

748
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,192
Push Obama's not a citizen

749
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,984
Narrative

750
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,752
Or not

751
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,312
Outside of the bubble of that speech

752
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,848
Anthony give the speech

753
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,895

What you what you put in the message was about

760
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,303
Donald Trump said 14 words that will shock

761
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,679
But there is a possibility that

762
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,471
That is auto-generated Tech

00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,687
Apparently a message about the 14 words

768
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,967
Comes up at the auto Jen

769
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,527
Gotcha been the case on

770
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,343
Twitter but even if it was Sarah Palin

771
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,623
And she can't be oblivious

772
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:35,903
She's white.

773
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,951
There's there's no doubt about it

774
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:41,535
Come on I don't think that Alex has ever said anything about that

775
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,839
I don't know I haven't heard it

776
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:48,703
Listen to Friday's episode I'm not sure cuz that just happened on Friday

777
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,263
Yeah and I even if he does he's going to be

778
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,591
He's not going to mention any time

779
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,407
There's tons of Neo-Nazi code

780
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,455
It's slipping into popular conscious

781
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,479
People realize

782
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:03,551
Like whenever you see 88

783
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
Heil Hitler

784
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,367
Like

785
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:10,719
Yeah age of the 8th letter of the alphabet 88

786
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,743

787
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,047
Community circles for Heil Hitler

788
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
14

789
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,095
You ever hear anyone mention

790
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,119
14 or 40

791
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,167
Teen words that's always run

792
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,703
Especially online

793
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,007
Will be

794
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,031
88 a referee

795
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:28,383
Prince to Triple H the wrestler

796
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
88

797
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:33,247
888 is a WrestleMania match

798
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,271
Between Hitler

799
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:40,927
It's actually Heinrich Himmler okay

800
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:44,255
We just sat up right now I'll get back to you

801
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,327
The closeout be August 9th

802
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,351
Episode

803
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,655
From 2015 Alex

804
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,423
Thought

805
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,471
About abortion

806
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,007
And we always like

807
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,567
Keep track of his weird feelings about those

808
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,103
Especially considering his

809
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:05,247
Who paid for them whether or not he regrets them right

810
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:11,391
Misinformation opposition on the Center for Medical progress videos

811
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,183
That are still

812
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,207
Stretching

813
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,759
So he just has forgiven himself and everything is good

814
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,807
Is my gut my gut tells me

815
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,879
My heart says it's alright

816
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:49,279
Good Christianity right there under Alex based on your own

817
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,399
Alex if you're listening

818
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:55,935
I don't believe

819
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,215
But you do

820
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,519
So you know what you just did

821
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,847
Feel like I don't know how many abortions you paid for but In that clip

822
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,615
It's plural

823
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
Which of them probably

824
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:09,247
150 women before you were 16 I imagine

825
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,551
There's tons of dead babies

826
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,343
Hey

827
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,903
The Center for Medical progress videos

828
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:18,207
Don't show the reality of abortion

829
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,743
So not only

830
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,279
Did you kill your children

831
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,071
What you did

832
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,143
Was you and made them indoor

833
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,679
Horrible medical testing

834
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:30,239
Where they were born

835
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,543
And sliced up insole

836
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,567
I like meat

837
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,359
That's what you did to your kids

838
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,639
Alex

839
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,663
Define I forget

840
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,503
You got really intense

841
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,855
I'm sorry

842
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,671
I'm just saying you got real

843
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,999
I really resonate with

844
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,023
Terrible Tupac

845
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:54,815
Really Cooking

846
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,583
Drive me now

847
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:58,399
The idea that you can because I experienced this

848
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,167
So much

849
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,447
In my younger days

850
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,215
Church

851
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:01,983
These

852
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,287
The sort of Evangelical version of self

853
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,591
Apology self-forgiveness

854
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,943
Because there are bad people in the world

855
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,527
And when people get the idea how I can just forgive myself

856
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:22,719
In terms of being able to just do whatever you want to do is really violent tendencies

857
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,999
Season they would get into

858
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,279
They initiated

859
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,583
And then afterwards the church will be like

860
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,863
Don't look you just have to

861
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,959
Forgive yourself talk to God don't worry about it yet someone else

862
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:35,007
Not a productive way

863
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:38,079
To organize or integrate

864
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,383
Behavioral Improvement

865
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
So like

866
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,711
Not least of which because if

867
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,503
Because what that

868
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:48,063
That justifies everything they do

869
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,343
Wallet the same thing

870
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,879
At the same time the

871
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,903
Evangelical

872
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,671
Those are

873
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,975
On anybody

874
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
Any Rangell

875
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:00,351
Absolute to the point where if somebody who's not one of our church

876
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,119
The crime

877
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,399
Their representative

878
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,167
Well it's

879
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,447
It always gets back to race

880
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,495
Sure

881
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,799
Committed a crime

882
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,871
It's not it has nothing to do with God's

883
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
Forgiveness there

884
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,687
No

885
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,735
Justify their own behavior to the point

886
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:19,807
Let's just all call ourselves evangelicals and then.

887
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,575
Have to be like

888
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:21,855
You tricked us

889
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,903
On this one

890
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
We forgive

891
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,719
I'm into it

892
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,279
Tell me I'm not into it

893
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,327
Alex Jones decides to

894
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,607
Start the show on

895
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:38,751
Cuz this is really bad and it involves Paul Joseph Watson

896
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,543
I know I'm sorry

897
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,847
This is like really really bad

898
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,223
Distractions are out there

899
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:52,575
As they

900
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,599
Population

901
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:58,975
Is

902
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,279
The injuries

903
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:37,375
Paul Joseph Watson has

904
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,447
Cowardly hit behind the idea

905
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,471
Conservative Outlets

906
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,751
Disgusting

907
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,823
Which is code for their racist articles on Breitbart

908
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,871
And not

909
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,639
Electric

910
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,479
Has gone on record

911
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,575
But he has

912
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,343
Very

913
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,367
Thoroughly

914
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,159
Laid out his family has three

915
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,183
He's dressed this

916
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,207
He like

917
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:05,023
This is incredibly big

918
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:05,791
Suggest

919
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,327
And it is

920
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,911
It's not a good sign for your argument

921
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,679
When

922
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,703
Your best

923
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,519
You can come up with to receive it is

924
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,311
Suggest

925
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:20,127
That the person who is it

926
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:22,175
You is lying about their race

927
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,759
That seems like a really bad position

928
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,527
Come from

929
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,295
Also

930
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,319
Your evidence

931
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,111
Is a 1995 police

932
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,903
Kentucky from Kentucky

933
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,927
Yeah where they list

934
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:36,511
That was it which sets

935
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,327
You didn't look it up

936
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,119
You didn't do f****** anything but

937
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,911
Found one tiny little thing that you

938
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:43,935
You can hang your hat on

939
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,959
And then

940
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
Justifies your in

941
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,263
Tire bolts

942
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,847
This argument is a good guy

943
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,919
Very good human being

944
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,015
That's for Breitbart

945
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,551
A Paul Joseph Watson

946
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,343
Infowars

947
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,623
As a whole

948
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,671
Because one of his classmates

949
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:05,951
Classmates

950
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,743
Came out and actually gave it

951
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,511
An account

952
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,279
On Facebook

953
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,559
What happened

954
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,095
IMDb salt

955
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,655
Chongqing was the victim of

956
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,471
2

957
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,287
I hate giving any

958
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,567
Sort of like a

959
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:22,847
Trigger warning

960
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,615
No

961
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,919
I hate the discussion of anything that

962
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,967
Stuff like that

963
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,759
I feel like a

964
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,319
I want

965
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,367
I want to draw a line

966
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,927
Between what's real and what Paul Joseph Watson

967
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,695
Suggested

968
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:42,047
He's suggesting that the injuries were minor and it was one person who jumped them

969
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,375
I am here is the report from a gentleman by the name of

970
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,399
Shae Gould

971
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:52,799
Unfortunately it seems that several groups on the internet are spreading lies about an event that happened at my high school when I was a student there

972
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:56,383
This is a problem for me because they were not firsthand Witness

973
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,175
Nor are any of their sources

974
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:00,479
I however was there and I saw it happen

975
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:04,063
I've been asked to post my memory of that day which I'm happy to do

976
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,343
It involves another student

977
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,367
The time Shaun King

978
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:10,975
I was a senior in high school and I just walked out of the band room when I saw Shawn walking towards

979
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,743
Me in the hall

980
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:15,839
My entire High School career I cannot recall saying anything more than hello.

981
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:18,399
However this day no extremes to play

982
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,447
Because before it could happen

983
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,775
Quite literally ambushed by a large group of large people

984
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,823
He never saw what hit him

985
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,103
He never had a chance

986
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,175
Stop to count how many attacks

987
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:32,735
But the number was easily in the neighborhood of a dozen

988
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,527
There they were both

989
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,319
They were big white Farm boys

990
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:39,135
All members of the FSA the Future Farmers of America

991
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:43,231
Immediately a crowd formed while they stopped the life right out of Sean

992
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:45,279
Who couldn't have weighed more than 100 lb

993
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,559
If at all

994
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,887
I remember not being able to get clothes certainly not closing

995
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,655
Interfere

996
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:54,751
The attackers that form to circle around the debacle and would not let anyone in

997
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,287
It stuck in my mind

998
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,335
Four years at the most disgusting thing I've ever

999
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,383
It couldn't have lasted long

1000
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,919
As soon as the chaos attract

1001
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,711
To the attention of two teachers it was over

1002
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,503
The attackers definitely disperse

1003
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,551
There was blood all over the floor

1004
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:10,879
I hung around and mute horror not believe in what I just seen

1005
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:14,719
I had a fairly sheltered upbringing it was my first brush with violin

1006
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,487
Fitted left

1007
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,255
Impression

1008
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,535
So now

1009
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:21,119
In 2015 various organizations on the internet have taken the stance

1010
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,655
That this incident never have

1011
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,447
This view seems to Stanford

1012
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:26,495
From one specific article making the observation

1013
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,543
Public records

1014
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,847
Do not coincide with Sean's ikaw

1015
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:34,943
For example the police report says there was only one attack or not a dozen

1016
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,503
It also states that Sean's injuries were very mine

1017
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,551
What the article does not discuss

1018
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,575
Is the political and social

1019
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,111
Climate of that place in time

1020
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,903
How these factors

1021
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,439
The Fallout from

1022
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,231
This is Versailles

1023
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,767
Pronounce Versailles

1024
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,559
Kentucky in 1995

1025
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,119
I believe the population around that time was about to

1026
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:53,887
6000

1027
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,679
What a minority gets almost

1028
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,983
The death of a small rural Town High School

1029
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,031
Is every Civic leaders nightmare

1030
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,335
The 1995 Inver sale

1031
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,103
It could happen

1032
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,639
Potentially made national headlines

1033
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,919
Had the story got now

1034
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,711
But unfortunately it did not

1035
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,503
And no residents of Versailles Kentucky

1036
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,527
He should be surprised

1037
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,111
By this point in the reading you should have survived that any investigating off

1038
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,391
Bizarre would have felt heavy

1039
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,927
Intense pressure from all sides

1040
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,975
The last name Woodford County

1041
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:22,815
High School wanted was for this story to be on the front page of the local paper

1042
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,095
You don't have to interview

1043
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,631
New school administrators to know that

1044
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,935
The city's elected leaders did not want this thing

1045
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:30,239
Been getting out because they wanted to keep their job

1046
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,799
And the local police needed to keep a tight lid on it

1047
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,335
So they would not look like jackass

1048
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,407
Sean's injuries were downplayed

1049
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,687
To just a scratch on the police

1050
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:41,247
Support the Future Farmers of America guys at

1051
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,015
Planned ahead

1052
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,039
For one of them to take

1053
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:43,807
The fall for all the

1054
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,599
The investigating officer

1055
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,647
Happy to put that detail in his report

1056
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,951
Interview Witnesses

1057
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:50,719
Having never asked

1058
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,743
Ask me a single question

1059
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:56,351
When you read about incidents like these it's very easy to imagine the details were left out

1060
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,375
Memories are hazy

1061
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,399
Things are made up

1062
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:02,495
If you're having such reservations about this story please understand that I have no agenda

1063
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,799
I was not close with Sean in high school

1064
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,335
And I've not spoken with him since

1065
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,127
I'm in no way related to his efforts to

1066
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,151
Combat racism

1067
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,431
Nor was I ever closer

1068
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,199
Who does the Packers

1069
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:14,783
Only so people will know what really

1070
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,343
I was one of the few people to talk with their own eyes

1071
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:20,927
So f*** you Paul Joseph Watson

1072
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,207
F****** Christ

1073
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:24,511
F*** you

1074
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:28,095
As if we need more evidence of his lazy f****** reporting

1075
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,887
You know it is

1076
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,679
It is one of those things where

1077
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,727
All of this s***

1078
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:34,495
Is happening

1079
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,055
All the

1080
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,335
The only

1081
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:41,663
Like I ate myself but the only way I can

1082
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,431
I can really get to

1083
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,199
For the day

1084
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:44,991
Most of us

1085
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,783
It's just kind of like

1086
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,087
Well it's not happening where I'm

1087
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,111
Right

1088
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,391
Like this

1089
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,415
This kind of s***

1090
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,487
How many

1091
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,255
How many times

1092
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,279
Police office

1093
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
Murderous

1094
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,143
Not going to

1095
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,423
To be put in jail

1096
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,959
For killing black people

1097
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:09,311
This should be something where we all as a

1098
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,335
The f****** country

1099
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,127
Watch over these

1100
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,175
Everybody

1101
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:14,943
Shows up

1102
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,223
But it's

1103
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,039
Paralysis

1104
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,319
This of well I have

1105
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,111
To do my job to go to work

1106
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,391
Lititz

1107
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,159
Repeal

1108
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,719
You like a f******.

1109
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:33,119
Like it really makes me feel like they're taking away well I still got f****** job

1110
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,703
A good citizen.

1111
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,799
Is infuriating

1112
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,103
Feel it like at vets that's the problem

1113
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,383
If I don't

1114
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,455
I like if I don't kind of filter that out

1115
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,527
I have to face the fact that every day I am

1116
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:53,343
Right like everyday

1117
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,367
I am at

1118
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,903
I mean it does

1119
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:56,927
It sucks

1120
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,999
I can't travel to various places and

1121
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,023
I'll protest

1122
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,935
Still walking

1123
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,215
After murder

1124
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:12,031
How many proteins

1125
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,847
There've been every single time there's been approached

1126
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,943
And all we've done is March incrementally towards them being charged

1127
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:25,343
There's not enough evidence

1128
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,135
To save that

1129
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,183
I don't know there's no real solution

1130
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:32,255
I can't afford

1131
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:34,047
To help other human beings

1132
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,839
Yeah like just monetarily

1133
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,655
Like I want whenever Ferguson happen

1134
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,799
Because that's what that's what I needed

1135
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,847
To do that's what I needed to do

1136
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,639
And if I had gone

1137
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,479
F****** wouldn't be able wouldn't have been able to make

1138
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:53,759
Yeah like that's

1139
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,527
The kind of thing

1140
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:56,575
I would I would love to

1141
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,343
You know

1142
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,623
Good enough

1143
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,159
I'm not good enough person

1144
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:03,743
No because it mattered as much as I think

1145
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,511
Think it does

1146
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,583
Why am I not for I don't know man

1147
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,375
I just there's just this paralysis

1148
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,167
Of what else

1149
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,983
In in miles

1150
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,799
Because otherwise I am complicit

1151
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:17,823
You know

1152
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,103
Like all of this s***

1153
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,127
It is

1154
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,407
It is heartbreak

1155
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,991
Anyways let's go back to the

1156
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,927
Play issue

1157
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,975
Better mean

1158
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,023
Larger level

1159
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,351
Get us off the hook at all

1160
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,631
But I think

1161
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:42,655
The fact that

1162
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,703
We wrestle with

1163
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,239
Memes

1164
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,263
We're trying

1165
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:51,359
I did eight will it will never be enough

1166
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,663
Single

1167
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,063
That was the first

1168
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,135
That was the whole reason

1169
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,159
Well

1170
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:07,487
Why are my taxes going up in Illinois

1171
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,559
Slater just overall Bruce Rauner

1172
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:12,607
Who should be f****** hit by a truck

1173
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,631
Water truck hit

1174
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,399
Oh man

1175
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:20,799
A lorry

1176
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,591
As many as you can

1177
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,663
I want to be a cartoon where there's a

1178
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,455
Just a ton boy running over

1179
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,247
Let's let's move along

1180
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,271
Get to greener pastures

1181
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,039
Perhaps

1182
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:34,111
Talk to much about Trump

1183
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,135
In this pan

1184
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,695
Couple of little nuggets

1185
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,487
That indicate awareness of things

1186
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,535
Are you aware of

1187
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,839
Alex Jones

1188
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:48,191
Is sacrificing

1189
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,215
Ufinancial

1190
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,775
In order to

1191
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,847
Bobby president make America great

1192
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,127
Yeah it's

1193
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,247
From 2015

1194
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,135
Money

1195
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,951
I think that resonates with people

1196
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,743
Resonates with people

1197
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:18,399
As if Donald Trump's interest won't become fabulously more

1198
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,983
Goddamnit Alex

1199
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:27,615
Becoming president of OB a financial victory

1200
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:31,967
Paid to

1201
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,735
Trump

1202
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:36,319
Trump golf courses for him to play golf

1203
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,343
Edit

1204
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,647
No it's something I've been thinking about like

1205
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:41,951
Golf this much before he was president

1206
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,231
That's a good

1207
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,767
Does

1208
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,863
Opening run big

1209
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:54,495
And the reason it's so expensive now is because of all the time

1210
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,287
He's a f****** moron nobody

1211
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:01,407
Let him run his own business has money

1212
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,199
6 *

1213
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:03,967
Revolve

1214
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,015
We're all pretty clear on it at this point

1215
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:10,111
He launders money for Bob's

1216
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:17,535
He puts his name on shittin laundry

1217
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:25,215
Perhaps doing a lot of that

1218
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,239
So

1219
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:28,031
This the rest of this episode

1220
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,055
The 2nd

1221
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,991
He has a really long

1222
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,527
Interview with dr. group

1223
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:41,343
Comes and wants to talk more about how his products are awesome

1224
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,159
Saving the world from

1225
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,719
Absolutely

1226
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:50,047
House they're not

1227
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:50,815
Fear monger

1228
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:51,839
A bunch

1229
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,119
While

1230
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:53,887
Fearmonger

1231
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:56,447
I'm going to play some fear-mongering clip

1232
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:59,519
Because Alex like we said when we started this adventure

1233
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:03,103
Summer was going to be like

1234
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,967
Harry dent

1235
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:13,343
Who is an economist who comes on the show said it's weeks away taking every

1236
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:17,439
Single movement in the Chinese stock market to be like this

1237
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,231
And

1238
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,255
Now Alex

1239
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,791
Because the summer is now in

1240
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,559
It's

1241
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:23,839
In August

1242
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,887
He's not moved up to

1243
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:31,519
Couple years ago

1244
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,943
And Jewish mysticism

1245
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,991
Disrespect

1246
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,927
The elites believe in this

1247
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:51,743
Like the Romans used to go to war when Mars was

1248
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:54,303
A certain aspect of Vengeance or whatever

1249
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,823
Weather

1250
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:07,871
It's going on

1251
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:14,015
And now it's just weird

1252
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:29,119
Eman now it's just looks really weird in in the last 6 months last year by a talk to

1253
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:32,959
This ominous or this

1254
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,567
There's a sport

1255
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,871
But also

1256
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:42,943
I'm not

1257
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:45,247
But everything is going to happen in September

1258
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,783
Search

1259
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,063
Great little trick

1260
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,111
The like

1261
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:51,391
Zabel

1262
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:56,511
Right like that kind of thing

1263
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,535
Course they do

1264
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,815
YouTube

1265
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:03,423
Behind

1266
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,471
This fake

1267
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:09,311
These these imaginary people believe in this imaginary thing

1268
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,591
So you have to

1269
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:16,991
To take it seriously and help me find that I believe in this stuff even though I'm the one I'm the only person

1270
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:22,623
This is real

1271
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,903
Like let's say a witch

1272
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:26,975
You don't believe in witchcraft

1273
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:30,047
How many Move Along

1274
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:36,447
Was there a good luck with that

1275
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,495
I don't believe in which

1276
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:43,359
And you believe it

1277
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:47,711
Basically

1278
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:54,111
That's fantastic

1279
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:59,487
Working with his not wanting to own up to what he actually believes it's the regenerative made beds

1280
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,023
The holographic Med beds

1281
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:03,583
From Randy Cramer all over again

1282
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,119
I hide behind

1283
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:10,495
Rhetorical devices so I don't actually have to expose what I believe cuz if I

1284
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,079
Yeah it's very dumb

1285
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,127
So there's more

1286
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,663
About Doom

1287
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:21,503
If it's a blood moon

1288
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,575
But Moon's Jewish mysticism blood moon

1289
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:30,975
So this next clip is a discussion of what would happen if

1290
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:31,999
EMP weather

1291
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,023
Which they're saying

1292
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,071
That sounds fun

1293
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:38,143
If you see cars all of a sudden dead on the road

1294
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:44,543
You better just start getting outside

1295
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,823
Food starts to spoil

1296
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:52,223
People still don't know what's going on but you have 72 hours after

1297
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:58,623
No food there's no water

1298
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:07,839
Universal cannibalism

1299
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:14,239
Also have the telephone

1300
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:20,639
Who's that meteors that are going to be Crossing in September

1301
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:27,039
What was supposedly a top-secret

1302
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:33,439
Organization

1303
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:37,023
To deter meteor meteor shower

1304
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:42,911
I'll tell you about what happened with that project

1305
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:49,311
He doesn't

1306
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:54,175
The first of all cannibalism

1307
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:57,503
Near Universal cannibalism

1308
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,783
Are only

1309
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:05,183
15 days away from eating other people power was out here

1310
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:10,303
You and I are going to eat each other

1311
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:18,239
It's 28 Days Later

1312
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,287
But

1313
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:28,223
Glitter in there he believes movies predictive programming

1314
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:30,783
Weeds cast

1315
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,367
In the past but in real-world scenarios

1316
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,183
Generally they work together

1317
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:41,023
Opposite directions, nature in

1318
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,559
Emergencies Austin is

1319
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:49,471
Usually brings out the best in people absolutely

1320
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:55,359
So what you go to Eva in the in the Ukraine whenever or in Crimea

1321
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,663
Whenever Putin was

1322
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:02,271
Going whole-hog turn down there

1323
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:04,575
You can read the stories about how

1324
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,343
People

1325
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:13,023
Develop their own Black Market to get food into people at a Jeep cause

1326
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:16,095
Are all these different systems in order to survive this

1327
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:17,119
And they f******

1328
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:23,775
Did it like real-world situation my dad when he was in Greece during the time when they cut off

1329
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:29,919
Because he was not a Greek citizen

1330
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:36,319
And they're a bunch of other people who did that in order to help people who had money trapped in the couch

1331
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,111
So numerous of people coming together

1332
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,135
Also Alex

1333
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:42,207
A lot of people have generators

1334
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,327
Would be

1335
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,351
Certainly

1336
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,143
You take down a lot of electricity

1337
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:53,727
Would you like that

1338
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,263
Who cares

1339
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,543
Backup

1340
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:59,871
Really Creative Solutions

1341
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,407
To helping each other that would

1342
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:03,455
Come out of that another one of those like

1343
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,735
Such as

1344
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:07,807
Subtle little

1345
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:10,879
The first to go.

1346
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,439
Country

1347
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,207
Where's Bells

1348
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:16,767
Fish people in the city or trap look like

1349
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:23,167
You don't want to go to court

1350
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:25,727
Take a break to really recognize the comedy

1351
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,007
Of a soup

1352
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:31,103
Supposedly secret organization run by the government

1353
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,663
Classified Britain

1354
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,479
There's nothing here

1355
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,271
Coming to dr. group

1356
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:41,087
In order to get advice about deflecting meteors

1357
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:43,903
Chiropractor

1358
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:48,255
A prophet

1359
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:57,983
How do you deflect against meteors obviously

1360
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,007
Brain Force

1361
01:08:59,263 --> 01:08:59,775
Selenium

1362
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:00,799
Obviously

1363
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:04,383
Oh my God what you doing for the iodine

1364
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:07,711
The sky had to put together a dirty dozen

1365
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:11,295
Type of situation

1366
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:19,231
You still don't need a chiropractor

1367
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:22,303
Not an essential skill

1368
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:25,119
We could use miners better than

1369
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:31,519
If we have a team that's 50 I still don't need a chiropractor

1370
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,543
Dad

1371
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:38,175
Subcontractor cut chiropractor you don't need to tell him about all the plants you can fire

1372
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:40,479
Freelance chiropractor

1373
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,575
And Alex knows

1374
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,855
Dino it's stupid

1375
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:52,255
And if you talk about it a little bit more at want to know it's stupid

1376
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:55,071
That's f****** self-defense

1377
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,095
That pathetic

1378
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:59,167
Alex Jones

1379
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,191
Kind of out

1380
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,215
That most of

1381
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:04,287
His ideas about the world are b*******

1382
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:10,175
This is all like a big chest

1383
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:18,623
Prison Planet

1384
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,207
Alex just basically

1385
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,279
Talked about his own philosophy and his wife

1386
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:30,399
In order to sort of reverse l.ron Hubbard

1387
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:35,775
How to take this worldview that is kind of a religion to me and make it into a Sci-Fi book

1388
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,567
What the f***

1389
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,847
There were no prints

1390
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,639
Planets

1391
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,711
What are you talkin about prime Baron harkonnens

1392
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:47,807
Cuz it wasn't a prison planet that was a great

1393
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:51,647
Adun talk put me to f******

1394
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:54,719
Sleep that long

1395
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:57,023
Fair enough

1396
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:01,119
Is done

1397
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:04,703
I'm going to put my foot down Hardline

1398
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:10,591
That's the end of our coverage is August 20th

1399
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:13,407
The other stuff that happened

1400
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,967
David Knight did a special report

1401
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:17,759
About how the wall isn't going to work

1402
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:21,599
So he's not even sold on Trump

1403
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,135
Porter now

1404
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,183
He also

1405
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:27,999
Basically says that Trump stance on immigrants

1406
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:29,279
Which is crazy

1407
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:33,119
I also

1408
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,423
America more than people who say they love them

1409
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,727
Absolutely

1410
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,775
Really hate

1411
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:44,127
They hate America as an ideal they love America as a place for white

1412
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:48,223
Yeah I also Alex's review

1413
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,319
New Mexico

1414
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:56,159
Plumlee

1415
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:58,207
Robert Plumlee

1416
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,487
Great names

1417
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:03,071
That's a great name because like a CIA whistleblower would have USA won

1418
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,351
Let's talk about

1419
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:07,167
These secured information areas

1420
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,727
Manam skier controlled information at

1421
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:14,847
But I have this question about Benghazi

1422
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,663
I don't know if this is ever been

1423
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,711
Really handled

1424
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,503
By the right-wing Folk

1425
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,295
Bush Benghazi narrative

1426
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,903
They believe the Benghazi was

1427
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,671
BabyCenter

1428
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:30,719
Done running operation

1429
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:31,743
To get

1430
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:32,511
Gone

1431
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:35,071
2 Syrian rebels to Libyan rebels

1432
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,607
Yeah they believe there was like

1433
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:39,679
Stinger missiles being transported through there too

1434
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:41,215
Terrorist organization

1435
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:46,079
That we are malt Ada and Isis

1436
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,919
And that this was an attack.

1437
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,943
The cover-up stuff

1438
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,527
About it

1439
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,599
The question that I have

1440
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:00,927
Is that okay they believe the Christian

1441
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,207
The guy who got killed

1442
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,231
Benghazi

1443
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,767
The

1444
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,839
They believe that

1445
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:08,863
Chucky

1446
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:11,679
Discovered he was going to come out with

1447
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:12,959
And that's why they let him die

1448
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,287
The question that I have is

1449
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:18,335
If this is a Mastiff

1450
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:20,895
Globalist gun-running operation

1451
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:23,455
It's going through

1452
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,039
Position

1453
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:29,855
An incredibly important position to have

1454
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,391
Cm

1455
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,207
These positions are

1456
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,231
Not like

1457
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,791
Accidentally given to somebody

1458
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:44,191
Ships that are granted by the president, put

1459
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,471
November

1460
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:48,031
Snopes look if you're blocked

1461
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,055
The conscious Dan

1462
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,615
The conscience

1463
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:55,199
That doesn't work if you are doing this

1464
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:57,247
Massive gun-running operation

1465
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,551
Why would you want to make that

1466
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,319
The most

1467
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,367
Famous thing in the world

1468
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,391
As a cover-up

1469
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,927
That's a very bad cover up

1470
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:08,511
Bombing their argument is simple for that is

1471
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:13,631
You could

1472
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,655
You just close it

1473
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:18,495
Doesn't make sense

1474
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:22,591
The person in charge of that area

1475
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:24,639
Thunder

1476
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:26,175
Pedophile blackmail

1477
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:32,575
Alex Jones's worldview pedophilia

1478
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,343
Accusations

1479
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:39,743
And breathe real or whoever wasn't his

1480
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,791
Would be someone who's blackmail

1481
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,375
If he came out with that stuff

1482
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,143
You just be like

1483
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:46,911
Yeah

1484
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:49,983
Instantly nobody would believe anything

1485
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,775
Right

1486
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:57,151
Yeah it's just so dumb and never deal with that like

1487
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,967
Narrative

1488
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,255
You're not awake Dan

1489
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:14,303
True

1490
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,911
Okay

1491
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,847
So he's not subjective

1492
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:29,919
These people are so

1493
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:31,711
They're not

1494
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,503
How did

1495
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:37,343
I don't know

1496
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:40,159
Are we really the dumbest people on the planet

1497
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,463
Know what it is is that

1498
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,999
Smart people

1499
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:47,327
Edema this sort of world this

1500
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,863
Wing

1501
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,935
Conspiracy theory world is beneath them

1502
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,727
I think it's so stupid that

1503
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,007
Why would anyone

1504
01:15:55,263 --> 01:16:01,407
Realizing all the while you don't pay attention

1505
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:04,223
Full stories reinforced other false stories

1506
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:06,527
And then eventually we're in the position we're in now

1507
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:09,343
Fret so

1508
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,111
Like

1509
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,391
We are absolutely

1510
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:13,695
Not even you and I

1511
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:16,767
Necessarily

1512
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:23,167
So in what respect and Alex Jones against

1513
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,007
He didn't say that

1514
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,031
We don't know that for

1515
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,055
For sure

1516
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:34,943
So Jordan in the summer of 2015 you might have noticed that Alex Jones

1517
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,503
Howard Kramer

1518
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:40,319
School of Life

1519
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:49,791
Shout out to having boys

1520
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:53,887
It seems he's been on other weird vacation

1521
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:58,239
And on the 21st through the 24th he's out of

1522
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:00,799
He went

1523
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:01,567
Canada

1524
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:04,895
To do some sort of a lecturer with George Noory

1525
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,175
Coasttocoastam

1526
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,967
Wow

1527
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:11,039
Solid double bill right there

1528
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:13,855
Different kinds of crazy

1529
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,391
Alex was

1530
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:17,183
Canada for that

1531
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,207
And then

1532
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:21,791
It is very own specific about what he did after that

1533
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:22,559
Cuz he doesn't

1534
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:23,327
Just come back

1535
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,607
That's over the weekend

1536
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,655
He doesn't come back until

1537
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,703
I believe Wednesday

1538
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,727
Of the next week

1539
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:30,751
April 25th

1540
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:34,335
He did do a report from the road that I heard that

1541
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,359
Said he was in Chicago

1542
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,895
I don't know what he was doing

1543
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:40,735
But it's very weird. A lot of weird trip

1544
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,783
Throughout Summer 2015

1545
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:45,343
I don't care to speculate about what he's up to

1546
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,367
But

1547
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,647
It's weird

1548
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:50,719
Probably

1549
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:52,255
Chicago and the taste

1550
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:56,863
28

1551
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:57,631
Third

1552
01:17:58,655 --> 01:17:59,167
Using

1553
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,703
Chicago. 24th

1554
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,239
15 days

1555
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:24,767
Colloidal

1556
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:25,535
Beef

1557
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:34,239
Goes on a long time

1558
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,519
On the 25th

1559
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,055
About how tired

1560
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:37,823
He gets

1561
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:38,591
From talking to

1562
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,895
It's a little ungracious

1563
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,455
That's

1564
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,223
The people is a

1565
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:44,991
Exhausting

1566
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,527
Fred

1567
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:47,807
He actually

1568
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:48,575
He talks to them

1569
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:51,135
Unlike these ding-dong celebrities

1570
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:53,695
Do the shake your hand and gladhand you remove your lawn

1571
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,487
He wants to get to know every

1572
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,255
Single person

1573
01:18:56,767 --> 01:19:00,095
Comes up I'm so burned by one liking me

1574
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,631
Or he realize

1575
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,399
This is all of his list

1576
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:11,615
Conspiracy theories for short. Of time

1577
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,639
My friend Marty

1578
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:17,759
People on me who start talk about conspiracies

1579
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:21,855
You just talked to that guy

1580
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:24,671
Exhaust

1581
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,743
He was coming up to me

1582
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:34,143
So

1583
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:36,191
This is sort of a

1584
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:38,751
Piece of that conversation but he gets into like the

1585
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,519
The good stuff

1586
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:42,079
Becomes also and

1587
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:45,151
Yet again another installment in our ongoing series

1588
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,431
Alex tell stories

1589
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:56,671
Because people don't say their listeners just at the end they go

1590
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:59,487
Bottles out of the

1591
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,255
Minibar

1592
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:02,047
Mr. Jones

1593
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:04,607
Attractive Chinese

1594
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:07,935

1595
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,727

I need for you to check out

1597
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,176
Both of them on the counter behind her smile

1598
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:23,552
Decoration

1599
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:32,256
Fight Club works

1600
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:36,864
Fellow Travelers used in Liberty and freedom

1601
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,472
Alex Jones gets beat up

1602
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:43,264
25%

1603
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:49,664
About the Flight Club aspect of like these people in this secret group

1604
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:56,576
In their private lives you work somewhere in another member of project chaos comes in

1605
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:00,160
I'll help you out

1606
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:02,720
Similarity

1607
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,000
Between his life

1608
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:04,768
And

1609
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:05,792
Flight Club

1610
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:08,352
Isn't it his followers are planning domestic

1611
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:12,960
You're right

1612
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,032
But doesn't

1613
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:19,104
That's it absolutely

1614
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:24,224
Immigrant lady

1615
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,784
Barely speaks English is like

1616
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:28,832
You know that Alex Jones

1617
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:29,856
I love his show

1618
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:32,160
Is it

1619
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:37,536
She's listening to learn English is not good

1620
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:40,864
That's just a nice little aside for us

1621
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,912
Nice little story that didn't happen

1622
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:43,680
Now Alex

1623
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:45,728
Alex

1624
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:48,544
English for immigrants class would not

1625
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,312
And enjoyable

1626
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:52,128
Just teach yourself

1627
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,712
Next clip

1628
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,504
This is delicious

1629
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,856
Be very weird

1630
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,136
This isn't part of that

1631
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:06,976
This isn't this is great

1632
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,256
But it's also

1633
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,280
I love it

1634
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,816
He's talking about derivative

1635
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:17,728
And where are you

1636
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:21,056
About I don't even remember the context of how he's talking about it

1637
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:25,152
If you thought about it or amazing

1638
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:29,504
Did this might be another Mike down because it's hilarious

1639
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:30,528
This is

1640
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:34,112
This is the future that liberals want

1641
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:37,440
This is the future that liberals want

1642
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:41,280
Truly

1643
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:43,328
Transparency Market systems

1644
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:46,912
Are so successful in generating

1645
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:49,984
Create unbelievable opulence

1646
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:53,568
And spoiled rotten

1647
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:58,176
But if you remove the swell rotten mist and bring back chivalry

1648
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:10,208
We have to return total free market but also chivalry

1649
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:16,864
Amor

1650
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,848
That's why people were very very polite

1651
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:36,576
50 years ago you smart

1652
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:39,904
Only place where

1653
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:45,280
That's what they come from

1654
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:48,096
That's where all of this originates from

1655
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:51,424
Father's Day

1656
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,312
Respectful

1657
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,176
Because if you were to shoot your mouth off you're going to have to

1658
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,736
Make good on that check

1659
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:11,136
And there wasn't welfare and there wasn't a society based on

1660
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:13,952
Obsessing over all this garbage

1661
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:19,840
Responsibility

1662
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:25,216
Anime replace it with political correctness

1663
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,240
All about

1664
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:32,640
Pulling down the strongholds

1665
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:36,992
But then you selectively can be shut down and persecuted by

1666
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:47,744
He wants you to get those two things go hand-in-hand

1667
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:57,216
Who owns and the rest of us I have to duel

1668
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:01,568
Yeah

1669
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:02,848
Yeah cuz we're all f***

1670
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:07,712
You idiot you are so how are you so stupid

1671
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:13,600
He wants duel

1672
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,648
He's talking about like

1673
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:17,952
Chivalry in the Don Quixote

1674
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,256
Even like like

1675
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,536
Slap somebody with a glove

1676
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:32,800
Which

1677
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:34,848
If we could keep welfare

1678
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:36,384
Falcon fire

1679
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,432
I'm not sure

1680
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:44,576
Alex Jones Street

1681
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,904
Which we're going to

1682
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,208
A fully socialist system

1683
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:52,000
Where Healthcare is paid for

1684
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:54,304
Everyone has a universal basic income

1685
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:59,680
Explain

1686
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:01,216
One of the problems with

1687
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,240
Dual

1688
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:06,592
Civilization really good pulling a gun

1689
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:07,872
You're always right

1690
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:15,296
I don't see how that's possible Dan are you saying that might makes right in these if it's not even might just like

1691
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:19,392
Trick you've learned if you're good at close-up magic you can be the

1692
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:22,976
The king of the world

1693
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,512
You could be one of the most

1694
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,304
Hateful awful people

1695
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,840
Who goes around and abuses

1696
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:28,608
People

1697
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,632
Like

1698
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:31,680
Use them

1699
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:35,520
Can take it to the street

1700
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:39,104
You shoot them does he not

1701
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:42,176
He doesn't realize that in all Western

1702
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:42,944
That is

1703
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:43,968
The system

1704
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:47,040
He will he does realize that he just wants to be the hero

1705
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:52,416
He wants to be quick draw gunman who goes

1706
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,440
From town to town

1707

This is the solution

1710
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:08,544
Society into place we're pulling out your gun really fast

1711
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,360
That is

1712
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:17,760
That is really what he wants

1713
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:18,528
Go to that

1714
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:20,320
There's like we'll never get back there

1715
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:25,184
IHOP

1716
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,744
I can see you how we ever get back to that

1717
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:28,512
So

1718
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,280

He's hilarious

1721
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:33,120
I love it

1722
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,384
They go to play Prison Planet

1723
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:50,272
Twin dad

1724
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:53,088
Don't ever really dead

1725
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:58,208
You're right he's in the talk to Matt everyone's Immortal and they're all here right now

1726
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:07,680
Remind me to skip that one

1727
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:09,728
Billiards

1728
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:10,752
Dude and Gloom

1729
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:11,776
You got doomed

1730
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,056
Write this next clip

1731
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:15,872
This is

1732
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:16,640
1

1733
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:18,176
Classic moves

1734
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:20,224
This is

1735
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,248
Where Alex

1736
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,296
Explains that he's not a bigot

1737
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,624
This is

1738
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,928
11

1739
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,232
This is serious

1740
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:39,168
Biggest leg gay lesbian

1741
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,008
The word mother father

1742
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:49,920
This is the Purple Penguin thing all over again that the

1743
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:51,456
LGBT organization

1744
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,736
It is just an adverb

1745
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:56,320
Any words

1746
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:58,368
They just want you to be more mindful

1747
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:00,928
Considering the who

1748
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,720
Think before you speak

1749
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,512
It's almost

1750
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,280
Like to me

1751
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:09,632
Alexace

1752
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:16,032
Yes I also think it's on par to me with if you have a daughter don't just

1753
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:17,568
By her pink bangs automatic

1754
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,616
Give us on Don't by Bluetooth

1755
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,640
Things automatically

1756
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,944
Try and consider

1757
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,224
The part of

1758
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,088
You know Jen during that comes from weird social Norm

1759
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:32,160
Yeah

1760
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:35,232
Develop asthma

1761
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:43,168
You subscribe to the idea that gender is

1762
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:43,936
Intrinsic

1763
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:45,728
But at the same time

1764
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:47,008
You're reinforcing

1765
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:49,056
Right

1766
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:53,408
Open trench

1767
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,968
Then the globalist

1768
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,040
You can't

1769
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,064
Like

1770
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:03,136
Is your born with

1771
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,160
Right

1772
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,184
But

1773
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,464
You have to act like

1774
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,232
Get to

1775
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,256
Like what

1776
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,536
Because there's stuff in the water

1777
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:11,840
Okay vaccine

1778
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:17,216
Wii controller

1779
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:22,336
O'Doyle rules

1780
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:24,384
It's just like anybody

1781
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:28,480
And tell me how to

1782
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:36,928
Every TV show on turn on now it's about transgender

1783
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:39,232
And it's just like it's a total agenda

1784
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,400
Hollywood actors

1785
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:48,960
Little experience required

1786
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:53,824
Transgender actors for Hollywood little experience required

1787
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:58,432
That's part of the

1788
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:01,248
Tiny minority

1789
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:05,088
Why

1790
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:08,416
Which which which the elite are totally into

1791
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:13,792
And Hannah am just totally controlled areas of new-york Mellon

1792
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:16,864
L.a. Noire not being persecuted let me tell you

1793
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:17,888
Milan

1794
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:21,984
Pushed

1795
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,288
As if it's the new national flag

1796
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:26,592
This is cultural domination

1797
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,408
Because if they can do this

1798
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:32,224
They can get away with anything

1799
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,016
Population

1800
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:37,856
I don't I don't know I mean

1801
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:39,136
Referring

1802
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:40,416
Two people being trans

1803
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:41,952
Part of an elite

1804
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:42,720
Fetishes

1805
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:43,744
It's probably really

1806
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:48,864
What's probably

1807
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,936
It's a low-class fetish

1808
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:54,496
Who has more validity than

1809
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:55,776
Yeah

1810
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:57,312
I love

1811
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,592
His replacement for

1812
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:02,432
It's not about

1813
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:03,968
It's about population

1814
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:05,248
Wrightwood

1815
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:08,832
F****** how do you go from 12 how do you make

1816
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:10,880
You make the whip its

1817
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,976
It's just hate look

1818
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,512
Positions

1819
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:17,792
I think people are weird

1820
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,096
But look

1821
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,144
More important things

1822
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:24,960
And we got

1823
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:30,080
Beat the idea

1824
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,408
Is very much

1825
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,224
School

1826
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:39,552
Yeah you don't

1827
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:41,856
Don't ever learn a goddamn thing

1828
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:45,184
Fused

1829
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,976
Any more things

1830
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:47,744
Ever

1831
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,536
Don't tell me how to talk

1832
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:52,864
Saddle me with your grammar

1833
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,912
Kramer saddle

1834
01:32:59,008 --> 01:32:59,520
Grunt

1835
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,544
Goddamn

1836
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:05,664
Ike

1837
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,944
Information into his brain

1838
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,736
No matter what

1839
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:12,320
For him

1840
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,088
Yeah I wish

1841
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:16,160
What is his four ways to learn is not

1842
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:17,440
Listen to others

1843
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:21,536
Soap

1844
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:24,608
That was based on Robert David

1845
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:26,912
He'll came on Alex Jones Show

1846
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:28,448
And said that the elites

1847
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:31,776
Have Mars bases that they're sending children to as slaves

1848
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:37,408
In the aftermath of that has gone on to suggest that Robert David Steele

1849
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:39,456
It was controlled opposition

1850
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,992
Coreg trying to set him up

1851
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:47,648
Because Alex is in the middle of exposing the Vatican for their cocaine-fueled that are also not happening

1852
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:54,304
Or at least at least

1853
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,840
Very much from Gotham

1854
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:57,376
But

1855
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:59,936
He's like I was breaking this

1856
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:01,216
I've been Robert David Steele

1857
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:05,824
Comes on and distract everybody with Mars colony talk

1858
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:08,640
Everyone saying that I believe is there Mars bases

1859
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:11,968
Yeah there's no clip of me saying Thermage basin

1860
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:12,992
Alex

1861
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:15,296
I have a question

1862
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:19,392
On August 25th 2015

1863
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:22,208
I have a clip where you say literally

1864
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:25,280
The elites are making Mars bases

1865
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:28,864
Listen to

1866
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:33,728
In the future loves me flying up there Elysium basis

1867
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:40,384
What what you think that movie with Matt Damon figured all that out

1868
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:43,200
That's real stuff they're talkin about

1869
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:48,320
Mars

1870
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:50,368
Bigger than major cruise liners

1871
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:54,720
Intercity

1872
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:56,256
Two ships offshore

1873
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:58,816
So the only argument that he can really make

1874
01:34:59,072 --> 01:34:59,840
Based on

1875
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,376
Things he has said

1876
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,424
Right

1877
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,192
Timing base

1878
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:06,240
The only thing you can say is I

1879
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:11,616
Billy's are doing that now they're planning on working on that bars base

1880
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,664
You know what's in development they're building it

1881
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,432
Still

1882
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:16,480
Uninvented

1883
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:20,064
Because don't they know if they get trapped

1884
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:21,856
Out on the sea bass

1885
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,904
And they lose food

1886
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:29,024
15 days away from eating each other

1887
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:35,424
You always forget how do I properly

1888
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:40,288
Dan is somebody at the door

1889
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,128

I Was preparing

1897
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:10,240
To play the role of Randy Cramer space super soldier

1898
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:12,800
We got to work

1899
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:14,592
Improv training

1900
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:18,688
Together because I have no idea where you were going with a level one class

1901
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:21,248
I'd rather die

1902
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,552
Next clip

1903
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:26,368
I'd like to make this argument that

1904
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:29,696
It's globalist

1905
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:35,072
Going to happen.

1906
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:37,632
Here is an example of that that is

1907
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:38,400
Wild

1908
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:40,960
They were thinking about pulling off Moore Oklahoma City

1909
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:42,496
And blaming the Liberty

1910
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:44,544
But we expose them we backed him off

1911
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:50,432
Now they're back and it's like 10 times worse than it was

1912
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:54,784
So they're going to be

1913
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:56,576
But they stopped

1914
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,368
And now they're back

1915
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:03,744
Well then back to their bowls

1916
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,792
Because

1917
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,608
For 15 years

1918
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,936
Something like that I don't know it's it's the way it's

1919
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:12,704
Integrates

1920
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:13,984
Coincidence

1921
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,384
And isolated incident were really crazy

1922
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:23,968
Right-wing taxation is war against

1923
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:27,808
People I don't want to have you goes off his rocker and blows up a government building

1924
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:29,856
You

1925
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:31,648
Kind of believe a lot of things

1926
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:34,464
He believes because you don't want that

1927
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,232
Deal with that

1928
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:38,304
And realize it's kind of a logical consequence

1929
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:44,704
Yeah you say all setup Elohim city was full of Southern Poverty Law Center people

1930
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:51,104
And the reality was just a crazy person

1931
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:54,944
What happened but because you yell about how there are more things that are going to happen

1932
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:55,968
When they don't happen

1933
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:56,736
Feel like

1934
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,016
But you're welcome

1935
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,808
Thank God I stopped you're welcome

1936
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:00,832
Liberty Movement

1937
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:03,136
Crazy

1938
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:04,160
His in

1939
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:04,928
Frenchman

1940
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,232
No

1941
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:08,256
Like before

1942
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:09,792
Okay

1943
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:11,584
Let's say he built a wall

1944
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:14,400
His belief system

1945
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,704
There is a wall made in

1946
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,984
Entirely out of

1947
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,336
No

1948
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,128
It amazed

1949
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:30,272
That's a great metaphor in as much as it's incomprehensible

1950
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,064
Made some good

1951
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:39,488
Episode on the 25th

1952
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:42,560
A couple of really interesting things that have

1953
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,328
1

1954
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:44,352
Is that

1955
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:45,376
Jeb Bush

1956
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:49,728
Has started complaining about Chinese women coming over and having Anchor Bay

1957
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:54,336
What the f***

1958
01:38:54,592 --> 01:39:00,480
Chinese companies that advertise being able to help you come over here

1959
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:01,760
I have a baby

1960
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:05,600
What is something that is kind of real but it's not nearly the numbers that Alex's talk

1961
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:09,184
Just the way that these businesses

1962
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:11,232
Charge exorbitant amounts of money

1963
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:14,048
The desperate people in China

1964
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,352
I don't think it's near me

1965
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:21,984
Does a 10,000 a month or coming and if that's the case

1966
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:24,032
I think it might even said ten thousand a week

1967
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:26,592
Whatever it is the number is absurd

1968
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:31,456
Give me same way that on one of these episodes he was talking about how the Isle of Lesbos

1969
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:35,296
Population of 150

1970
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:36,576
50000 immigrants on it

1971
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:39,648
The population of the Island of Lesbos was 80

1972
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,696
6000

1973
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,232
It's not

1974
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:46,304
There aren't that many

1975
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:48,608
Well let me say this

1976
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:49,376
I just

1977
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:50,656
That attack

1978
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:51,936
Actually 100

1979
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:52,960
20 million illegal

1980
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:56,544
120 thousand

1981
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,080
120

1982
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:59,104
Don't go crazy

1983
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:04,736
The stuff is really overly inflated

1984
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:07,552
I am making a bigger issue out of things that are really problem

1985
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:11,136
But it's fascinating because Jeb Bush started to save this

1986
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,744
Alex is screaming about this Chinese girl babies

1987
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,512
Situation

1988
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:18,560
Bushes mirroring his rhetoric

1989
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:19,584
I know it's still

1990
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:21,888
It's weird

1991
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:24,704
Donald Trump says a bunch of stuff that Alex Jones likes and he's like

1992
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,776
This guy is telling the truth

1993
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:31,360
Global Liberty

1994
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:33,920
Bush and Hillary Clinton

1995
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:34,688
I'm so much

1996
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,456
Good reason

1997
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,272
But Alex doesn't

1998
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:43,904
He doesn't get on the board and it just makes him more mad that Rand Paul isn't

1999
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:49,536
So you're starting to see you're starting to resent Rand Paul

2000
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:53,632
It's not over yet but I think that might be wary losses

2001
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:56,448
Flips on Rand Paul

2002
01:40:59,008 --> 01:40:59,776
I think the

2003
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:01,824
It is growing

2004
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,616
Rand Paul

2005
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:05,152
Biology

2006
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:07,712
Actually

2007
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:11,808
Alex Jones believes himself.

2008
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:14,368
And is actually just

2009
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:15,136
The lunatic

2010
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,160
Yes

2011
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:18,720
When what he sees as like this

2012
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,536
What would you call it

2013
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,608
Apotheosis of libertarianism

2014
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:25,632
Government

2015
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:26,912
Is not agree with

2016
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,448
Rather than

2017
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:29,216
Maybe thing

2018
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:31,264
I could be wrong

2019
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:32,800
That's simply not a

2020
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:36,384
Possibility you're onto part of it

2021
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:39,200
Because Grandpa even his libertarianism is

2022
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:40,992
Horsley cruel and it's awful

2023
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:43,808
Yeah it's pretty crazy

2024
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:45,600
Ria absolutely

2025
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:51,488
Stupid a lot of violence

2026
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:54,816
Anarcho-capitalist

2027
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:55,840
Beliefs.

2028
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:58,912
Actually truly free market requires

2029
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:03,008
Tiny bit a little down the road

2030
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:05,824
I think one of the other thing

2031
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,616
Is that Rand Paul note

2032
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:08,896
God damn well

2033
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:11,200
You start spouting stuff off

2034
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:13,504
Better just complete lies

2035
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,552
Like things that helps

2036
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:17,856
He's going to be taken to the Woodshed over it

2037
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:19,136
Because he is a public

2038
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:21,184
Figure that is an elected office

2039
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:23,488
And if you start spouting bullshits

2040
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:28,608
Statistics about false narrative and probably get voted out of office

2041
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:31,168
That's well cuz at the

2042
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:32,704
Time

2043
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:37,824
Right but that is not the case at all nothing to worry about

2044
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,360
Just adopting

2045
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:45,504
Have

2046
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,272
His

2047
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:52,672
Reputation

2048
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:54,208
With my action

2049
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:57,280
Right agree with Alex Jones.

2050
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,304
I have a public space

2051
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:01,888
I think I might be a little bit of that but that also might be giving

2052
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:06,496
Racist

2053
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,264
Impossible

2054
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:13,664
Alex Jones has Joe Biggs in studio interview with a guy named

2055
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,200
Representative

2056
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,552
They talked about how there's a sheriff in Spokane

2057
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:22,368
On the last episode

2058
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:24,416
He's afraid

2059
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:26,464
Southern Poverty Law Center

2060
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,792
All these people you know

2061
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:30,560
Globalist

2062
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:32,864
Arming our police to the teeth

2063
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:35,680
Because they're going to take out gun owners

2064
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:40,288
Even though most of his listeners are police

2065
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,360
What's a load of s*** but at the same time

2066
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:45,152
Dichotomy today

2067
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:47,200
Clippers

2068
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:48,480
But

2069
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:50,272
It's fascinating

2070
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:51,040
Tumi

2071
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:53,600
The way it is interview they talk

2072
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:54,368
About

2073
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,440
Abortion protesters and homeschool

2074
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:58,720
Protest movement

2075
01:43:59,232 --> 01:43:59,744
Stuff like that

2076
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:00,768
It's all very wifey

2077
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,048
They're talkin about

2078
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:04,352
I never liked the way they stood up to the police

2079
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:05,632
Stood their ground

2080
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:07,424
It's so admirable

2081
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:09,728
Wow

2082
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:12,032
Ya can't

2083
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,568
Just just

2084
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:18,176
Boredom

2085
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:22,272
If you're white it's

2086
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,552
Like if you're black

2087
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:28,416
Another level there's the right vs left

2088
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:29,440
Because of it

2089
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:31,232
And they argue that

2090
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:33,792
The right

2091
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:35,328
Reproach

2092
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:38,400
It's riot

2093
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:39,168
Course

2094
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:42,752
And what they don't take into account is all the incidences

2095
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,056
Left-wing protest being

2096
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:47,104
Pepper sprayed by cops

2097
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:52,992
Being infiltrated by right-wing agitator and even police

2098
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:54,272
There is

2099
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:55,808
Constant attack

2100
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:57,600
On left-wing protesters

2101
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:58,880
That turns them

2102
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:00,416
It turned them into

2103
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:02,208
Even the instance of the Free Speech

2104
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:04,768
Demonstrations at Berkeley

2105
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:07,072
That is even not a good example

2106
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,120
The antifa stuff

2107
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:11,168
Isn't even intrinsically violent

2108
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,192
So

2109
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:13,216
Well the thing is

2110
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:13,984
I mean

2111
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:16,288
My first thought is

2112
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:17,056
Why is

2113
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:17,824
Is it always

2114
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:18,592
The left

2115
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,128
And then it's obvious

2116
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:23,456
Because the left is always the opposition

2117
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:29,856
Why is it that protest

2118
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:32,160
Stairs are always the ones who are being

2119
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:33,440
Murder

2120
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:36,768
Destroyed

2121
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:37,792
Pepper spray

2122
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:40,864
Because they represent

2123
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:42,656
To the cyst

2124
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:45,728
Always

2125
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:46,752
They represent

2126
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:48,032
Movement

2127
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:48,800
Since that

2128
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,360
To get money

2129
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,384
Politics

2130
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:58,016
What's another very threatening to the existential nature

2131
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:59,808
And that's the very basis of

2132
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:01,856
Liberal vs conservative

2133
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:03,136
Conservative

2134
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:05,440
Don't change goddamn

2135
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:08,256
I'm saying I like it the way it is

2136
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:09,280
Especially the

2137
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:11,072
Conservative even libertarian

2138
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:16,960
To be working to prop up

2139
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:17,984
Send

2140
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:23,104
I certainly don't seem all that thrilled about

2141
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:23,872
They have no

2142
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:28,480
I don't really think

2143
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:31,808
We see a lot of that but again I don't want to tour everybody with that brush

2144
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:33,600
Ben audet

2145
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:36,672
Identifies as libertango

2146
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:39,488
Well apparently

2147
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:42,048
Jesse The Body Ventura

2148
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:43,840
Pretty much right on it and

2149
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:47,424
I think that there is a defensible position for

2150
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,960
A lot of libertarian ideas

2151
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:51,264
But

2152
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:55,616
And Patriots

2153
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:59,456
What is the greatest army that have ever been collected and you're stupid

2154
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:02,784
Do you wait

2155
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,320
Wait the the guys like

2156
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,088
The Bundys

2157
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,648
Greatest greatest

2158
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:13,280
Alex products

2159
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:18,400
That President Obama is setting up Hillary

2160
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:19,424
Department of Justice

2161
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,728
Go take her

2162
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:23,520
Right there

2163
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:26,080
Become president with a chair

2164
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:31,712
But he knows the storyline

2165
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:35,808
Psycho

2166
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,536
For a barber shop window

2167
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:47,584
Play Alex

2168
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:50,400
Is like Joe Biden is going to be switched

2169
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:52,448
Continue the Obama regime

2170
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:55,008
Very boring

2171
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:57,056
Bratz

2172
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,592
She comes in to do an interview

2173
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:00,128
You're a dick what it's about

2174
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:01,920
Buy gold

2175
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:04,224
But economic collapse

2176
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:07,040
Who are the guests

2177
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:07,808
Hair up

2178
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:09,856
You tell them that he's bullish on gold

2179
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:10,880
No s*** you are

2180
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:14,720
Never

2181
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:16,256
What is a

2182
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,840
Listen I'm telling you for the 10,000

2183
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:21,120
Consecutive time

2184
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:22,400
I'm very bullish

2185
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:24,960
He's that means a trans researcher is a

2186
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:26,240
The trend predictor

2187
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:29,824
In terms of how big you thought gold was going to be

2188
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:34,688
The 25th characters next

2189
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:37,248
Clip and you may recognize this

2190
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:38,528
Exact story from

2191
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:41,088
The Secret of 2017 video

2192
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:45,440
Here's a father-of-three and I should hear a somebody

2193
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:50,560
Ghost

2194
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:54,144
Oh yeah now I remember

2195
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:56,448
National chain

2196
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:02,336
Cafeterias regardless of about 2 years old

2197
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:04,128
Never in my life

2198
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:07,456
Restaurants

2199
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:11,296
And seen people talking about old ladies

2200
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:15,904
The order the food

2201
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,696
And watching old ladies

2202
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:27,680
It's the same fluffy

2203
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:44,064
Economy in most areas in the toilet as you know

2204
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:47,648
Give me some f****** money billion dollars plus Alex social

2205
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:48,416
The fuk up

2206
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,208
I Love This Bar

2207
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:55,584
Because we now see two versions of the exact same story 2 years displaced in time

2208
01:49:58,912 --> 01:49:59,936
It's the same story

2209
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:02,752
But in the 2017 version of it he's crying

2210
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:04,800
About it

2211
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:07,616
I've had time to reflect

2212
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:15,808
And also in the 2017 version of it

2213
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,624
He talked about how he bought all those old women

2214
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:20,416
Yeah he did

2215
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,232
Slightly

2216
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:27,840
I love being able to point that these instances of like

2217
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:29,376
Oh you're working on a bit

2218
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:30,912
Yeah it's like seeing us

2219
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:37,312
A comic in the early stage of crying and being the hero this version is

2220
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:40,896
The economy sucks old women can't get iced tea

2221
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:47,296
You need to polish a bit more open mic

2222
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:49,856
You're the hero

2223
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:57,792
We now are going to go to

2224
01:50:58,048 --> 01:50:58,816
To the last day of RX

2225
01:50:59,072 --> 01:50:59,584
Exploration

2226
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,352
August

2227
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,888
6 2015

2228
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:03,936
This is a bad day

2229
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:05,984
For Humanity

2230
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:06,752
Hellboy

2231
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:10,592
Is it was a very bad what is a very bad day for me

2232
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:13,408
Particularly I remember this

2233
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:14,944
Very well

2234
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:18,016
It's got to be bad

2235
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:19,552
Going over there

2236
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:21,856
But also there are a couple

2237
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:23,648
Really awesome things along the way

2238
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:27,232
I promise you as difficult as some of this may be

2239
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:31,072
Alex Jones reveal something from his

2240
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:34,144
You would never be able to predict

2241
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:36,192
You should not have said on air

2242
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:40,288
I'll survive I'll survive until then got you

2243
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:42,080
On August

2244
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:44,896
26 2015

2245
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:50,784
Alison Parker and Adam Ward

2246
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:53,088
Two local TV people

2247
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:54,880
In Virginia were shot on

2248
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:55,648
On live television

2249
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:57,440
We're not on live television

2250
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:02,560
Right Vester Flanagan live stream

2251
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:03,840
Are there murders

2252
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:04,864
Twitter

2253
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:06,400
And

2254
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:08,192
Alex's response

2255
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:08,960
To it

2256
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:09,984
Is not great

2257
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:13,824
Important

2258
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:14,848
Is

2259
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:15,616
That

2260
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:16,384
It happened

2261
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:19,968
6:45 in the morning

2262
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:24,064
Alex Jones gets on air 11

2263
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:26,624
So that would be rubbing sticks

2264
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:29,440
Eastern

2265
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:30,464
Is when it happen

2266
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:33,280
Central alright

2267
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:35,072
The Manhunt

2268
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:36,352
Happened

2269
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:38,144
Define Vesper

2270
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:39,168
Flanagan

2271
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:41,472
Wasn't really even resolved by the time out

2272
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:44,032
A lot of the information

2273
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:44,800
Isn't there

2274
01:52:45,056 --> 01:52:46,080
All that is there

2275
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:47,104
Is

2276
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:47,872
We know

2277
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:50,432
That two people were shot

2278
01:52:50,944 --> 01:52:51,456
And

2279
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:52,736
Lots of people have seen

2280
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:56,320
Particularly because

2281
01:52:58,624 --> 01:52:59,648
Know a lot of journals

2282
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:04,512
I have a lot of people who I've went to college with journalism students

2283
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:06,304
Some of them

2284
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,584
I hate it

2285
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:10,400
Summer good friends of mine I care about very much

2286
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:11,424
And

2287
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:13,984
The idea of

2288
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:16,032
Being able to sort of

2289
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:17,056
Place

2290
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:19,360
The work that a lot of people I know.

2291
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:20,640
Into

2292
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:21,920
These this horrifying

2293
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:22,688
Situation

2294
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:24,992
It hit me very hard and I remember

2295
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:27,296
This being very difficult

2296
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:28,320
Shocking

2297
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:29,856
Piece of

2298
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:30,624
Tragedy

2299
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:34,208
We listening to Alex Jones is coverage

2300
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,000
Bummed me the

2301
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:36,768
F*** out

2302
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:40,864
So let's just this is how I you Begins the show

2303
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:41,888
Candy starts

2304
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:42,912
Father narrative

2305
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:48,032
Nash on

2306
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:49,568
26 day

2307
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,408
Transmission

2308
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:59,296
We are going to be here for the next 3 hours broadcasting worldwide

2309
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:01,600
There's obviously been a dramatic

2310
01:54:02,112 --> 01:54:02,880
Horrifying

2311
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:08,512
Virginia on a live TV

2312
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:11,840
Of a reporter and a cameraman

2313
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:14,656
Buy a disc

2314
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:17,984
Or former employee

2315
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:23,616
Racism

2316
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:29,760
He is now reportedly just committed suicide the last 10 minutes

2317
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:31,552
He goes by the name

2318
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:33,856
Bryce Williams

2319
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:47,168
This is just like the Charleston shooting that killed 9 people

2320
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:49,216
Or a racist

2321
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:51,776
White person

2322
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:54,848
Race war

2323
01:54:56,896 --> 01:55:02,272
This

2324
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:03,808
He has been

2325
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:05,344
Tweeting that out

2326
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:09,696
There's a couple problems with even the beginning of how he sets up the narrative

2327
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:12,512
Similar at all

2328
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,840
Except for that someone killed people in Cold Blood

2329
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:19,424
Situation with Charleston

2330
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:21,984
Horrible race

2331
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:24,544
To slaughter black people

2332
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:25,312
How to start

2333
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:28,128
You said you wanted

2334
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:29,408
To do he was a suicide

2335
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:36,320
That's one of

2336
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:38,112
In this case

2337
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:39,392
There was a guy

2338
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:40,928
Had

2339
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:43,744
I don't know

2340
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:45,536
If we can say

2341
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:48,352
The instances that he's filed

2342
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:50,656
You know equal opportunity

2343
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:51,424
Lawsuit

2344
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:54,240
About I don't know if they were true or not

2345
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:55,520
Or if he was

2346
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:56,288
Projecting

2347
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:58,336
Racism on two other people I have no idea

2348
01:55:58,848 --> 01:56:00,384
But the reality is that he

2349
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,408
Felt

2350
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:02,944
Racially oppressed

2351
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:04,224
Former

2352
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:05,760
Stations that he worked at

2353
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:07,808
You believe that

2354
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:08,832
Thought Allison

2355
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:09,856
Parker it said

2356
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:11,136
Some racist thing

2357
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:12,928
And I don't know if she did or not

2358
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:13,952
I have no idea

2359
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:17,792
This was a raid

2360
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:18,816
Killing

2361
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:20,864
It was just a murder director

2362
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:22,144
Specifically

2363
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:23,168
Specific

2364
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:23,936
People

2365
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:25,216
Whereas

2366
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:27,008
The Charleston

2367
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:29,056
Racial Terror

2368
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:33,408
Just because there is a racial dynamic

2369
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:35,968
In both of them doesn't make them similar at all

2370
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:37,760
And it

2371
01:56:38,016 --> 01:56:38,528
Disgraceful

2372
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:39,296
Valic

2373
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:40,320
2

2374
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:41,600
To play it

2375
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:45,952
Play More Bounce

2376
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:48,512
I promise there's not too much

2377
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:55,680
What is Google ads bounces back really fast

2378
01:56:56,192 --> 01:56:56,960
He doesn't spend much

2379
01:56:57,472 --> 01:56:57,984
On the story

2380
01:56:58,496 --> 01:56:59,776
Charleston

2381
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:03,616
Which was fully wind on the Second Amendment

2382
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:10,016
Guilt was applied to white people in general

2383
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:16,160
Other

2384
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:19,488
Unstable

2385
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,048
Go out until 1

2386
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:35,104
Dead people all over the place

2387
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:41,504
Chief among them the police maybe you should get rid of guns

2388
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,528
Which is what

2389
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:44,832
Obama told his cousin odinga

2390
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:46,112
The Muslim leader

2391
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:48,928
Lost the presidency

2392
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:52,256
He said that people go out

2393
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:01,984
Basically co-president

2394
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:05,056
Ended the Muslim radical Islamic. Then

2395
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:12,480
Muslim takeover

2396
01:58:12,992 --> 01:58:17,088
George Soros

2397
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,624
To stir up

2398
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:21,696
A race war going

2399
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:26,560
MSNBC and CNN and others promote it like it's normal

2400
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:28,608
Plan on

2401
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:33,984
I didn't look into Obama telling odinga to start right

2402
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:35,520
Guess what I don't know

2403
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:37,312
That's bull

2404
01:58:39,104 --> 01:58:42,944
I really really hate this ideas at

2405
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:43,968
This is just

2406
01:58:44,224 --> 01:58:44,736
The ping pong

2407
01:58:45,248 --> 01:58:46,784
Of races killing each other

2408
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:49,856
Not really

2409
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:51,136
It's the way you get to it

2410
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:51,904
Excuse your back

2411
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:54,976
Yeah you're excused the fact

2412
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:55,744
Gun violence

2413
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:01,120
Being racist

2414
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:02,912
I don't

2415
01:59:03,168 --> 01:59:05,472
We're not responsible gun owners like us

2416
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:06,496
No

2417
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:09,568
They're just manipulated it a whole plan to

2418
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:12,896
Yeah

2419
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:13,664
Membership is being

2420
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,456
Destroy

2421
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:17,248
Yeah

2422
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:18,016
F*****'-a

2423
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:19,808
He's an a******

2424
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:20,832
I'm going

2425
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:21,856
Play this next

2426
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:22,624
Clip

2427
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:27,232
And there is audio that plays of the actual video

2428
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,536
But

2429
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:31,328
I can't do that no

2430
01:59:31,584 --> 01:59:32,608
No I can't do any of

2431
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:33,376
I watched

2432
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:37,984
Like the beginning of it because it just Auto played back then

2433
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:42,592
I never watched fully through it

2434
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:46,688
I'm sure that's what you're saying

2435
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:50,016
But Alex plays it

2436
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:50,784
3 *

2437
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:51,808
On his

2438
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:55,904
I hate the idea of playing this

2439
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:58,464
On our show even the audio

2440
01:59:58,976 --> 01:59:59,744
But it's important

2441
02:00:00,512 --> 02:00:02,304
Because I'd like you to take note

2442
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:04,352
This being

2443
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:06,144
Mere hours after

2444
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:08,960
It's horrifying

2445
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:10,496
And

2446
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,800
Alex Jones doesn't

2447
02:00:13,056 --> 02:00:13,568
Care about the

2448
02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:17,664
Examples of how

2449
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:19,968
He doesn't care at all

2450
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:21,248
At no point in time

2451
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:22,016
I'm in that did he

2452
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:22,784
You say

2453
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:24,064
I feel bad for

2454
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:25,088
I feel bad

2455
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:31,488
Yeah but no he doesn't mean

2456
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:34,304
Absolutely.

2457
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:36,096
For somebody who

2458
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:38,656
Constantly says I pray all the time

2459
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:40,448
He doesn't even bother with the b*******

2460
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:43,264
Fox Prairie

2461
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:45,056
Legitimate psychic

2462
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:50,176
And listen to how little concerned he has or care about

2463
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:50,944
These

2464
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:52,736
2 people who were murdered

2465
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:54,528
In public

2466
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:57,600
In Cold Blood

2467
02:00:58,112 --> 02:00:59,648
Easier care at all

2468
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:12,704
Work

2469
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:13,984
Not even close

2470
02:01:16,544 --> 02:01:17,056
F*** you

2471
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:20,384
This is the time

2472
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:22,176
Most of them

2473
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:24,224
Suicide

2474
02:01:25,248 --> 02:01:28,064
Aren't you know you're not

2475
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:31,904
How are they going to spend

2476
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:33,696
We're about to roll right now

2477
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:37,280
First person point of view

2478
02:01:37,536 --> 02:01:41,376
With the gun

2479
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:44,192
With the gun out front

2480
02:01:46,496 --> 02:01:48,288
As he goes in

2481
02:01:50,848 --> 02:01:53,152
A minute

2482
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:56,480
More walking around

2483
02:02:08,512 --> 02:02:12,608
Starbucks

2484
02:02:19,008 --> 02:02:22,336
And they are going to sit there and Hammer that and push that

2485
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:23,616
And promote that

2486
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:25,920
He doesn't give us

2487
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:30,016
He's talkin over them playing this footage

2488
02:02:30,784 --> 02:02:34,112
He's just sort of calling it like a Visa board baseball in

2489
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:36,416
That's terrifying

2490
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:37,184
Just here

2491
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:38,208
Tearing those guns

2492
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:42,816
I don't

2493
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:43,840
I do not feel

2494
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:50,496
Take some comfort in the fact that we don't have the coconut juice in front of us anymore

2495
02:02:50,752 --> 02:02:51,520
The worst is over

2496
02:02:58,432 --> 02:02:58,944
With no

2497
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:00,224
He doesn't even bother

2498
02:03:00,992 --> 02:03:01,504
End

2499
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:02,272
If your

2500
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:03,808
I guess I guess

2501
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:04,576
Because he knows

2502
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:08,672
No noses listeners are on the side of the gun

2503
02:03:08,928 --> 02:03:13,024
Credit where credit is due

2504
02:03:16,608 --> 02:03:17,120
Gun

2505
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:18,144
Is up

2506
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:19,424
Start shooting

2507
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:20,192
It's like a blur

2508
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:22,752
Easter not showing

2509
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:24,032
Unedited Raw

2510
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:25,056
Footage what-have-you

2511
02:03:25,568 --> 02:03:27,360
But deep the startling

2512
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:31,200
Lack of recognition of the humanity of these people

2513
02:03:31,456 --> 02:03:34,528
That are being murdered it and all he cares about is guns

2514
02:03:35,552 --> 02:03:36,320
It's not

2515
02:03:36,576 --> 02:03:38,112
Absolutely not

2516
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:42,208
It was a moment when I was listening to this episode I was like

2517
02:03:42,976 --> 02:03:44,512
I don't understand I don't understand this

2518
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:45,280
Position

2519
02:03:45,792 --> 02:03:47,584
Cuz you he'll make the argument that

2520
02:03:48,096 --> 02:03:52,192
The Liberals are you know immediately calling for gun control and stuff like that

2521
02:03:52,448 --> 02:03:55,264
You are immediately politicizing this yet

2522
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:57,312
What do you what do you what's your problem

2523
02:03:58,336 --> 02:03:59,360
It's it's terrifying to

2524
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:02,688
Know who statistics about gun violence

2525
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:03,968
There are completely lies

2526
02:04:06,784 --> 02:04:08,064
Interesting things that you can dig up is

2527
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:09,856
FBI didn't study

2528
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:10,880
And they found

2529
02:04:11,136 --> 02:04:12,416
That's 100

2530
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:13,440
60 incidents

2531
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:14,720
Active

2532
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:16,768
Mass shooting

2533
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:17,792
From 2000

2534
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:18,816
2013

2535
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:22,912
Defined as one or more individuals

2536
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:24,192
Actively engaged

2537
02:04:24,448 --> 02:04:24,960
Been killing or attempt

2538
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:26,752
Something to kill people in a populated area

2539
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:30,592
I found that there were 1,000

2540
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:31,616
T2 incident

2541
02:04:32,128 --> 02:04:33,408
From 2013

2542
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:34,432
To December 2nd

2543
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:35,456
2015

2544
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:37,760
We're at least four people were shot

2545
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:39,296
But not necessarily killed

2546
02:04:40,064 --> 02:04:40,832
So

2547
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:44,928
If Alex wants to try and make the argument that mass shootings are down

2548
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:47,744
Gun violence isn't a real issue

2549
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,536
The numbers really don't

2550
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:50,304
Support that

2551
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:51,584
If you want to

2552
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:52,608
Blame all of it on

2553
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:53,632
Gang banger

2554
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:55,168
Susan what-have-you

2555
02:04:55,424 --> 02:04:57,216
Ring out and resonate with your

2556
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:59,008
Incredibly busy

2557
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:03,104
They're the ones who are using guns

2558
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:03,872
Irresponsible

2559
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:05,152
People who aren't White

2560
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:08,736
People who are wider the only people who ever use guns they respond

2561
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:13,088
I am

2562
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:13,856
Still

2563
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:14,880
Consistently amazed

2564
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:16,928
How old

2565
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:19,488
Absolutely bigoted

2566
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:21,024
Crazy

2567
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:24,352
It is every episode 35

2568
02:05:28,448 --> 02:05:30,752
Unless you have no you have

2569
02:05:31,264 --> 02:05:31,776
Has no a

2570
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:32,800
For human

2571
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:36,896
Noah's mother through my journey at 6

2572
02:05:37,408 --> 02:05:38,432
It's been all downhill since

2573
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:39,968
God

2574
02:05:40,736 --> 02:05:46,880
He is another explanation that we just don't know yet

2575
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:47,648
If he

2576
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:49,440
If you didn't have a radio show

2577
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:50,464
Be a serial killer

2578
02:05:52,768 --> 02:05:53,536
No probably not

2579
02:05:53,792 --> 02:05:54,816
Because the identity

2580
02:05:55,072 --> 02:05:57,376
His dad would support any probably just be a crazy person

2581
02:05:57,632 --> 02:05:58,144
Down the street

2582
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:02,240
You be out there screaming about the exact

2583
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:04,800
Radio show but he

2584
02:06:05,056 --> 02:06:08,896
Jesus because he didn't have millions of dollars and a really nice Studio

2585
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:11,200
People would see through the things he says

2586
02:06:11,712 --> 02:06:12,224
Most likely

2587
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:13,248
If you had

2588
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:15,040
Make a YouTube channel

2589
02:06:15,296 --> 02:06:18,112
Show in front of

2590
02:06:18,368 --> 02:06:22,720
The wall behind me

2591
02:06:23,232 --> 02:06:26,816
Audio Only

2592
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:29,120
Maybe not for long

2593
02:06:29,376 --> 02:06:31,936
I need to buy a tripod for my iPhone

2594
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:33,984
Anyway I shouldn't reveal my plan

2595
02:06:34,496 --> 02:06:36,288
We have one more clip about guns

2596
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:38,080
Stuff a little bit

2597
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:39,872
And then we can get on to

2598
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:41,152
The reveal

2599
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:41,920
Alex Jones

2600
02:06:42,176 --> 02:06:43,712
It will blow your mind

2601
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:45,760
But this one

2602
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:48,832
He talks about how we don't need that we got to stop blaming guns

2603
02:06:49,344 --> 02:06:49,856
For everything

2604
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:50,880
I was just

2605
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:51,904
Distasteful

2606
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:53,440
Especially this

2607
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:56,256
Soon after people were murdered on live television

2608
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:57,280
A butt

2609
02:06:57,792 --> 02:07:00,096
The reason I'm keeping this clip-in is cuz a transition

2610
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:02,400
Into him composing tweets

2611
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:03,936
Did Hillary Clinton on air

2612
02:07:04,448 --> 02:07:04,960
But it's kind of

2613
02:07:07,008 --> 02:07:07,520
Google fi

2614
02:07:08,032 --> 02:07:08,544
It's not that funny

2615
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:12,384
Alright

2616
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:15,712
Was Antigone diatribes before bodies or cold

2617
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:17,760
Same leftist

2618
02:07:18,016 --> 02:07:19,808
American scum

2619
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:21,088
Army Strong

2620
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:27,488
Social engineering

2621
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,840
Liberal Thomas Jefferson

2622
02:07:32,352 --> 02:07:33,376
Crooked Hillary Clinton

2623
02:07:33,632 --> 02:07:37,216
No cuz we don't f****** roads play

2624
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:39,264
And we cannot wait any longer

2625
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:41,312
Friends of the victim

2626
02:07:41,824 --> 02:07:44,896
I want to send a tweet out

2627
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:54,624
Utah

2628
02:07:59,744 --> 02:08:01,024
Which

2629
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:04,864
It's your White House pushing race war

2630
02:08:07,168 --> 02:08:08,448
I want with all that

2631
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:14,848
On Twitter on Facebook all of you because they are up there

2632
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:23,296
Almost 200 million.

2633
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:28,672
Charleston shooting in Virginia shooting

2634
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:31,232
When statistically

2635
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:33,280
There's less mass shootings

2636
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:34,048
Nope

2637
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:36,608
And Hillary know that full well she's got bodyguards

2638
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:38,144
Hillary

2639
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:41,728
Are there guns

2640
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:44,032
I have a gun to protect myself

2641
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:51,712
Female dog

2642
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:53,760
Jordan

2643
02:08:54,016 --> 02:08:58,112
Or whatever

2644
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:01,440
A lot of friends that are bastards appointment

2645
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:10,144
A political

2646
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:16,544
He's still close to like a hacky bit there

2647
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:19,872
Yeah

2648
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:21,664
Jesus

2649
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:27,040
Let's not be able to be already talked about his he's wrong about gun statistics all that stuff

2650
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:30,368
This is now going to make it all worthwhile

2651
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:33,440
Listen to this next clip I'm not even going to set this up at all

2652
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:35,232
This is.

2653
02:09:35,744 --> 02:09:40,096
School

2654
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:47,776
And

2655
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:54,688
I'm at the beach

2656
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:08,512
Promotion

2657
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:12,352
I would never do that

2658
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:20,032
Bulshit

2659
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:23,104
Bulshit

2660
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:23,872
Well

2661
02:10:24,128 --> 02:10:26,176
July

2662
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:27,456
Cuz here's how I know

2663
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:30,016
He's saying he did it twice

2664
02:10:30,528 --> 02:10:31,040
Fire

2665
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:32,576
If you go

2666
02:10:32,832 --> 02:10:33,600
To the beach

2667
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:37,184
Add a later you're on the beach putting cigarettes out on your hand

2668
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:43,584
You've done a lot of the high does not last that long if you still on

2669
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:45,120
On a bender on this map

2670
02:10:45,376 --> 02:10:46,144
A day later

2671
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:49,216
You have done a bunch of math.

2672
02:10:50,496 --> 02:10:51,264
You've not done

2673
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:52,032
Twice

2674
02:10:52,544 --> 02:10:54,592
I would say you probably done a bunch

2675
02:10:54,848 --> 02:10:55,872
Infected you stressing

2676
02:10:56,896 --> 02:10:58,432
Realizes

2677
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:02,016
I got to make a hard line on this

2678
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:03,040
As his

2679
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:06,880
And that

2680
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:10,208
Like what

2681
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:15,840
More

2682
02:11:16,096 --> 02:11:17,120
2 is like

2683
02:11:17,632 --> 02:11:19,424
Sing

2684
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:20,960
Cigarettes

2685
02:11:21,472 --> 02:11:27,616
Yes. Bad about Alex

2686
02:11:28,128 --> 02:11:30,176
The first time I took mushrooms

2687
02:11:30,688 --> 02:11:31,968
I was laying around

2688
02:11:32,224 --> 02:11:32,992
Smoking cigarettes

2689
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:37,344
I can't smoke cigarettes in less like

2690
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:38,368
Repeat the cigarettes

2691
02:11:38,624 --> 02:11:44,000
That's the way my brain works

2692
02:11:44,256 --> 02:11:45,280
Only allow myself to

2693
02:11:45,536 --> 02:11:46,560
Smoke if I could take

2694
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:48,096
Cigarette in one drag

2695
02:11:50,912 --> 02:11:54,496
Conquering the cigarette cuz my body was stronger than the cigarettes

2696
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:00,128
Tried to smoke cigarettes

2697
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:06,528
This is never going to work the rules and if I can withstand putting out a cigarette on my

2698
02:12:06,784 --> 02:12:07,808
Concord

2699
02:12:08,064 --> 02:12:09,088
The cigarette through with the

2700
02:12:09,344 --> 02:12:12,672
Strength of my being right

2701
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:13,440
Well that was dumb

2702
02:12:15,232 --> 02:12:16,256
And then my break

2703
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:20,352
Velvet Underground is playing

2704
02:12:21,632 --> 02:12:22,400
Sounds good

2705
02:12:22,656 --> 02:12:24,704
That's not a terrible thing

2706
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:28,032
What you did was f****** awful whatever you did on meth on the beach

2707
02:12:28,288 --> 02:12:29,568
Did you kill that lady

2708
02:12:30,336 --> 02:12:33,152
Probably as I've already said

2709
02:12:33,664 --> 02:12:35,456
I think something really really dark half

2710
02:12:35,968 --> 02:12:36,480
And

2711
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:37,760
She actually

2712
02:12:38,272 --> 02:12:39,040
Gave her an abortion

2713
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:43,392
I've known

2714
02:12:50,304 --> 02:12:51,840
I grew up in Central Missouri

2715
02:12:52,096 --> 02:12:54,400
Experience of people who

2716
02:12:55,936 --> 02:12:58,752
One of the things that I think is a pretty good

2717
02:12:59,264 --> 02:13:01,312
Guiding line sort of rule of thumb

2718
02:13:01,568 --> 02:13:03,104
Yeah as if you do math once

2719
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:03,872
I believe

2720
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:06,688
If you die if you say you've done that twice

2721
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:07,968
I don't believe

2722
02:13:08,736 --> 02:13:12,064
Most people like meth and heroin or two drugs

2723
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:13,600
Most people don't.

2724
02:13:16,416 --> 02:13:17,696
Painkillers

2725
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:19,232
I'll believe that you're not home

2726
02:13:20,768 --> 02:13:23,072
That's a reasonable thing

2727
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:25,120
Weed hallucinogen

2728
02:13:25,376 --> 02:13:28,960
Those are drugs that people can f*** around with and be completely normal

2729
02:13:29,216 --> 02:13:29,728
If you

2730
02:13:29,984 --> 02:13:30,496
Take

2731
02:13:31,008 --> 02:13:31,520
Poke map

2732
02:13:31,776 --> 02:13:32,544
I mean at this point

2733
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:33,568
If you're not smoke

2734
02:13:33,824 --> 02:13:35,104
How are you getting

2735
02:13:35,616 --> 02:13:37,920
Wild

2736
02:13:38,176 --> 02:13:38,688
And you're like

2737
02:13:38,944 --> 02:13:39,712
I'll try that again

2738
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:41,504
Like that means something

2739
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:43,296
Yeah you did twice

2740
02:13:44,064 --> 02:13:45,344
Did a bunch

2741
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:47,136
Do you have an addictive personality

2742
02:13:47,392 --> 02:13:53,280
You're crazy or loot you're addicted to Super female Vitality of

2743
02:13:53,536 --> 02:13:58,400
Course you did Matthew Arlington Heights

2744
02:13:58,912 --> 02:14:00,448
It's it

2745
02:14:00,704 --> 02:14:06,848
Trustworthy narrative narrator

2746
02:14:10,944 --> 02:14:12,736
Alright well I did meth for about 6

2747
02:14:13,248 --> 02:14:17,600
Alright right now

2748
02:14:17,856 --> 02:14:18,624
That

2749
02:14:20,416 --> 02:14:24,256
Morton might as well be his reaction

2750
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:26,048
Intuit

2751
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:28,096
I'll be clear about the

2752
02:14:29,888 --> 02:14:32,704
Commercial ice

2753
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:33,472
When I was

2754
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:37,824
Really young to remember the commercial on TV

2755
02:14:38,336 --> 02:14:40,128
I don't know why that one

2756
02:14:41,152 --> 02:14:41,664
I can't

2757
02:14:42,176 --> 02:14:43,712
But I got the cleanest

2758
02:14:43,968 --> 02:14:46,784
House on the street

2759
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:48,064
This is

2760
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:52,672
15 years later and I still remember this song

2761
02:14:53,184 --> 02:14:53,952
Format

2762
02:14:54,208 --> 02:14:59,072
It was a commercial form

2763
02:14:59,328 --> 02:15:02,144
Admission that Alex makes on this show

2764
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:04,448
He also accidentally admits

2765
02:15:05,984 --> 02:15:08,800
That you really really should not have it it

2766
02:15:09,312 --> 02:15:10,848
In conversation with collars

2767
02:15:11,104 --> 02:15:11,872
Or just in passing

2768
02:15:12,384 --> 02:15:13,408
He said

2769
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:14,688
That I think

2770
02:15:14,944 --> 02:15:15,712
If his audience

2771
02:15:15,968 --> 02:15:16,992
Really realize what he

2772
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:19,040
He was saying would give them reason

2773
02:15:19,552 --> 02:15:20,832
Really doubt him

2774
02:15:21,856 --> 02:15:23,392
A legitimate businessman

2775
02:15:23,904 --> 02:15:24,928
And illegitimate truth

2776
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:28,000
This first one has to do

2777
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,560
No

2778
02:15:30,816 --> 02:15:31,328
The first

2779
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:32,352
Of the two

2780
02:15:32,608 --> 02:15:33,888
Has to do with

2781
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:35,680
Is sort of

2782
02:15:36,448 --> 02:15:40,032
His is willingness and desire to court chaos

2783
02:15:40,544 --> 02:15:46,176
This was going on there was a bunch of me and another a whole bunch of info Warriors in and an Infowars IRA

2784
02:15:47,456 --> 02:15:53,600
Which by the way I think you should get rid of the comments sections on the Articles and put a live chat or link oral

2785
02:15:53,856 --> 02:15:55,648
Login to Planet Infowars

2786
02:15:55,904 --> 02:15:57,440
Real-time conversations

2787
02:15:57,696 --> 02:16:02,048
The comments sections of just become chaos since the David Duke interview just

2788
02:16:15,616 --> 02:16:20,992
I mean I want to have that type of mental illness

2789
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:27,392
It's really helping the site so I'm actually quite thankful for

2790
02:16:27,648 --> 02:16:31,488
We are really trying

2791
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:33,024
Buckley is just

2792
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:34,816
Sliding lift potentiometer

2793
02:16:35,072 --> 02:16:39,936
He admits like it's really helped us out with our clicks and absolutely

2794
02:16:40,192 --> 02:16:41,472
You extrapolate that

2795
02:16:41,728 --> 02:16:43,776
If you take

2796
02:16:44,288 --> 02:16:50,432
Why wouldn't he actively do really f***** up things to get attention if he's like

2797
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:53,760
For 2 hours on my show

2798
02:16:54,016 --> 02:16:55,040
It brings me tons of traffic

2799
02:16:55,296 --> 02:16:59,904
Yeah that same philosophy would lead him to lie about tons of stuff to make it more

2800
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:04,000
Sensational in order to get more traffic website

2801
02:17:04,256 --> 02:17:07,072
Almost like

2802
02:17:07,328 --> 02:17:11,168
Pretty much every website now most clickbait stuff

2803
02:17:12,192 --> 02:17:16,800
There's no traffic

2804
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:17,568
Tickles like

2805
02:17:17,824 --> 02:17:22,944
The top 7 things you didn't know Alex Jones eats on the weekend

2806
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:23,712
You know what

2807
02:17:24,224 --> 02:17:24,736
I'm for it

2808
02:17:25,248 --> 02:17:27,552
Absolutely for it

2809
02:17:28,064 --> 02:17:32,160
Website don't know how to use SEO Alex makes another

2810
02:17:32,416 --> 02:17:33,952
Admission later in the show

2811
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:40,608
Kind of like admitting that you have a sensational

2812
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:48,544
Something's real or if it's productive kind of like alright

2813
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:52,128
Yeah

2814
02:17:52,384 --> 02:17:52,896
This is a little worse

2815
02:17:56,992 --> 02:17:59,040
Infowars life.com

2816
02:18:02,368 --> 02:18:05,440

2820

Did you get Jupiter

2821
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:21,824
Do you pick up what the problem is there

2822
02:18:23,104 --> 02:18:23,616
Let's

2823
02:18:24,896 --> 02:18:26,176
Set a remind me what it was he

2824
02:18:26,688 --> 02:18:27,712
Went through there

2825
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:33,856
Playing in the reviews

2826
02:18:34,112 --> 02:18:34,880
It's because of what their claim

2827
02:18:35,136 --> 02:18:36,160
Which means

2828
02:18:36,416 --> 02:18:38,976
Instead they can't do what it is those people say

2829
02:18:39,232 --> 02:18:41,792
Well that's part of it it's illegal for him

2830
02:18:42,304 --> 02:18:43,584
To advertise products

2831
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:46,400
Exactly

2832
02:18:46,912 --> 02:18:50,240
Answer whenever people write reviews

2833
02:18:50,496 --> 02:18:52,032

Legally

2835
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:56,640
Now if you extrapolate

2836
02:18:57,408 --> 02:19:00,736
He has the ability to block at block reviews

2837
02:19:02,016 --> 02:19:02,528
He is

2838
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:04,576
Businessman

2839
02:19:05,088 --> 02:19:05,600
I have

2840
02:19:05,856 --> 02:19:09,184
No doubt in my mind you blocked negative

2841
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:12,000
Give any reason if he has the ability to

2842
02:19:12,256 --> 02:19:14,816
It makes total sense

2843
02:19:15,072 --> 02:19:15,840
Honest man

2844
02:19:16,096 --> 02:19:21,472
It makes total sense now all these products

2845
02:19:21,728 --> 02:19:22,240
Make a fire star

2846
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:28,896
It's the same reason that Saddam Hussein would win with like 99%

2847
02:19:29,152 --> 02:19:32,480
Goodbye 4.9

2848
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:33,760
Nobody's 100

2849
02:19:34,528 --> 02:19:38,112
Guarantee that there is an employee

2850
02:19:38,368 --> 02:19:40,928
Who part of the responsibility is to go in and block

2851
02:19:44,256 --> 02:19:44,768
Degraded at the

2852
02:19:54,752 --> 02:19:56,288
He loves chaos

2853
02:19:56,544 --> 02:19:57,312
In order to get traffic

2854
02:19:57,568 --> 02:19:58,080
Who cares of s***

2855
02:20:00,896 --> 02:20:02,432
Alex your f****** up

2856
02:20:02,688 --> 02:20:03,968
I think you might be a liar

2857
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:05,760
I think he's really close to like

2858
02:20:06,784 --> 02:20:07,808
Stress is getting to Mi

2859
02:20:08,064 --> 02:20:09,088
I think a little bit

2860
02:20:09,856 --> 02:20:11,136
I think it's going to lead

2861
02:20:11,392 --> 02:20:11,904
More towards

2862
02:20:12,672 --> 02:20:13,440
Supporting Trump

2863
02:20:13,696 --> 02:20:15,232
But I think that there is just

2864
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:16,768
Climate of his position

2865
02:20:17,536 --> 02:20:18,304
Better making it

2866
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:19,328
Very difficult

2867
02:20:19,584 --> 02:20:20,096
Like

2868
02:20:20,352 --> 02:20:23,168
The idea that you selling this Virginia shooting

2869
02:20:27,264 --> 02:20:29,312
It's a sign that he's not engaging with

2870
02:20:29,568 --> 02:20:30,080
The stuff

2871
02:20:30,336 --> 02:20:31,616
That's outside

2872
02:20:31,872 --> 02:20:32,640
What is narrative is becoming

2873
02:20:32,896 --> 02:20:33,920
Veteran Center

2874
02:20:34,176 --> 02:20:35,712
Do you like

2875
02:20:35,968 --> 02:20:38,016
Hillary isn't being kicked out of the race

2876
02:20:38,528 --> 02:20:42,880
Rand Paul isn't coming through for him the way you needs I think all that

2877
02:20:43,136 --> 02:20:43,648
Just going to leave him

2878
02:20:46,976 --> 02:20:48,000
Going to be supported

2879
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:49,792
And it's going to be

2880
02:20:54,656 --> 02:20:58,496
Likes to say now that he never said that Sandy Hook

2881
02:21:00,288 --> 02:21:01,824
We like to

2882
02:21:02,592 --> 02:21:03,360
Just get rid of it

2883
02:21:03,616 --> 02:21:08,224
That's how bad he isn't this he has even gotten rid of this

2884
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:11,296
Turn

2885
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:16,160
Here's another

2886
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:20,000
In my opinion something really stinks about this entire situation

2887
02:21:21,536 --> 02:21:22,816
I can't even really

2888
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:27,680
Think of a mass shooting quote-unquote or a high-profile shooting like this

2889
02:21:28,192 --> 02:21:28,704
That didn't

2890
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:31,520
Seemed like there was something more going on

2891
02:21:36,896 --> 02:21:43,040
The situation

2892
02:21:43,552 --> 02:21:44,320
We caught them

2893
02:21:49,696 --> 02:21:50,976
It just isn't real

2894
02:21:51,488 --> 02:21:54,048
I don't know what specifically happened

2895
02:21:54,304 --> 02:21:56,352
But the official story is a fairy tale

2896
02:21:56,864 --> 02:22:00,448
Stock isn't real

2897
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:02,240
Is a giant

2898
02:22:02,496 --> 02:22:05,568
Operation complete

2899
02:22:06,336 --> 02:22:09,664
Uncle

2900
02:22:15,296 --> 02:22:18,880
We robbed

2901
02:22:31,168 --> 02:22:36,544
Yeah it's real Twilight Zone that you're lying about what Rob dues uncle said on your show

2902
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:40,640
Play an interview with Dan

2903
02:22:40,896 --> 02:22:43,456
Who finds Rob dues uncle in

2904
02:22:43,712 --> 02:22:44,992
In Newtown

2905
02:22:46,272 --> 02:22:46,784
That's weird

2906
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:51,648
Publix

2907
02:22:51,904 --> 02:22:52,416
Anyting

2908
02:22:55,232 --> 02:22:57,280
Even more like aggressively

2909
02:22:57,536 --> 02:22:58,048
Sandy Hook

2910
02:23:01,888 --> 02:23:02,400
So

2911
02:23:05,472 --> 02:23:11,616
Yeah you did not form of though I have started

2912
02:23:11,872 --> 02:23:13,920
Sun weather in out Santa Claus is real in the past

2913
02:23:14,176 --> 02:23:15,712
Asher

2914
02:23:15,968 --> 02:23:16,992
No f*** you

2915
02:23:19,808 --> 02:23:21,088
He was saying

2916
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:24,416
And using bulshit lies about lies

2917
02:23:24,672 --> 02:23:26,208
In order to reinforce it

2918
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:27,488
He's so slow

2919
02:23:30,048 --> 02:23:31,328
I want to talk to Alex

2920
02:23:32,864 --> 02:23:34,144
To be like what what

2921
02:23:34,656 --> 02:23:36,448
Why do you not

2922
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:37,728
Your position from the

2923
02:23:38,752 --> 02:23:43,872
I want to call in his show and hey Alex you have any comments on the Center for Medical progress videos

2924
02:23:44,128 --> 02:23:45,920
Couple months

2925
02:23:46,176 --> 02:23:46,944
2015 price

2926
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:49,504
Do you have any comment on how they are going

2927
02:23:50,272 --> 02:23:51,808
Dirty comment on the

2928
02:23:52,064 --> 02:23:56,672
Senate investigations to South Planned Parenthood

2929
02:23:56,928 --> 02:23:58,464
You can't do that on his show

2930
02:23:58,976 --> 02:24:05,120
No he'll hang up on you

2931
02:24:05,376 --> 02:24:10,752
With a collar trying to do what I want to do conversation for

2932
02:24:11,008 --> 02:24:14,592
Okay this next clip you have some weird thoughts about the idea of

2933
02:24:15,104 --> 02:24:16,384
Individual actions

2934
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:17,920
It's being blamed on a group

2935
02:24:18,432 --> 02:24:19,968
And I don't think you understand

2936
02:24:20,224 --> 02:24:21,760
How to universalize

2937
02:24:22,272 --> 02:24:23,296
Is that his beliefs

2938
02:24:23,808 --> 02:24:24,576
Really pics

2939
02:24:24,832 --> 02:24:25,856
Confuses eyewear

2940
02:24:26,624 --> 02:24:29,696
Survival

2941
02:24:30,208 --> 02:24:34,048
If we don't expose the fact that this was racially motivated

2942
02:24:38,144 --> 02:24:39,936
Will be collectively Wayne

2943
02:24:41,216 --> 02:24:41,728
Who

2944
02:24:43,776 --> 02:24:46,848
With somebody else.

2945
02:24:52,224 --> 02:24:54,784
And if

2946
02:24:58,368 --> 02:24:59,392
But the Folk Center

2947
02:24:59,648 --> 02:25:04,768
Person person kills

2948
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:07,840
Vice versa

2949
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:15,008
Goes around killing people you share responsibility but

2950
02:25:21,152 --> 02:25:25,760
They're their own person and I know our audience gets

2951
02:25:32,928 --> 02:25:34,464
Done something wrong

2952
02:25:40,352 --> 02:25:42,400
And their whole world is through those

2953
02:25:42,656 --> 02:25:43,168
Goggle

2954
02:25:43,424 --> 02:25:44,448
Distortion

2955
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:49,824
You don't work somewhere

2956
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:54,688
If you just optimistic have a good attitude

2957
02:25:55,712 --> 02:25:56,736
You'll end up being successful

2958
02:25:58,272 --> 02:25:59,552
And that's what it comes down to

2959
02:26:01,088 --> 02:26:04,416
Directions to my wife

2960
02:26:04,672 --> 02:26:08,000
I don't believe that for a second also

2961
02:26:08,256 --> 02:26:09,280
A job as an adult

2962
02:26:09,792 --> 02:26:12,096
So I don't know what he's talking about

2963
02:26:12,352 --> 02:26:18,496
I don't know how he would have had time to have a job suck 150 women 46

2964
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:20,288
I don't know how we'd ever job

2965
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:23,616
The only times you talked about jobs it went

2966
02:26:23,872 --> 02:26:28,480
Is cousins doing odd jobs being forced to inhale a house

2967
02:26:28,736 --> 02:26:33,344
And then also when he was kicked out of school for a year and went to work on an animal farm

2968
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:34,624
The only answer

2969
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:35,904
Listen to the

2970
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:36,672
Yeah

2971
02:26:36,928 --> 02:26:38,976
Norwell Orwell

2972
02:26:41,024 --> 02:26:41,792
Punishments

2973
02:26:42,048 --> 02:26:44,352
Go f*** around with your cousin

2974
02:26:44,608 --> 02:26:45,376
Right I don't

2975
02:26:45,632 --> 02:26:48,448
Maybe he had a job when he was in junior college

2976
02:26:48,704 --> 02:26:49,728
Before he got his public Acts

2977
02:26:49,984 --> 02:26:50,496
The show

2978
02:26:50,752 --> 02:26:54,336
I don't see any evidence that he actually knows what the real world is like

2979
02:26:54,592 --> 02:26:55,616
Here's the thing

2980
02:26:56,896 --> 02:26:57,664
Through there

2981
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:00,992
Mo's Pizza

2982
02:27:01,248 --> 02:27:03,552
I apologize

2983
02:27:04,064 --> 02:27:04,576
Added value

2984
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:10,464
Like whatever you said if an F

2985
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:11,232
Group does it

2986
02:27:15,072 --> 02:27:16,608
Responsible for the Charleston

2987
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:20,192
All black people are responsible for

2988
02:27:20,448 --> 02:27:20,960
Even though those two

2989
02:27:21,728 --> 02:27:22,496
Unrelated

2990
02:27:22,752 --> 02:27:23,264
Not the same

2991
02:27:26,592 --> 02:27:29,920
The Acura is not the fault of the group

2992
02:27:30,176 --> 02:27:30,944
At least

2993
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:32,224
The group

2994
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:35,296
The pieces of the group individually Arctic

2995
02:27:36,832 --> 02:27:38,368
If you're a member

2996
02:27:39,136 --> 02:27:39,904
Then

2997
02:27:40,416 --> 02:27:42,208
Does responsible mean

2998
02:27:42,464 --> 02:27:44,512
Kind of get what he's trying to

2999
02:27:44,768 --> 02:27:46,560
Say it

3000
02:27:46,816 --> 02:27:47,328
Smooth

3001
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:49,376
But the idea

3002
02:27:50,912 --> 02:27:52,192
Being a part of Isis

3003
02:27:52,448 --> 02:27:52,960
This is a choice

3004
02:27:53,216 --> 02:27:55,008
And therefore if you choose to be a part of Isis

3005
02:27:55,264 --> 02:27:56,800
You are taking on responsibilities

3006
02:27:57,056 --> 02:27:57,824
The actions of the group

3007
02:27:58,080 --> 02:27:59,872
Right where is being a part of an ethnic group

3008
02:28:00,128 --> 02:28:00,640
It's not a choice

3009
02:28:01,152 --> 02:28:02,176
That's something you're born into

3010
02:28:02,432 --> 02:28:03,456
And therefore you

3011
02:28:03,968 --> 02:28:04,480
Withdrawal

3012
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:07,552
You're not responsible for

3013
02:28:07,808 --> 02:28:08,320
The things

3014
02:28:08,576 --> 02:28:09,600
So then

3015
02:28:10,624 --> 02:28:12,416
Obvious parallel there's this

3016
02:28:13,184 --> 02:28:14,464
If you are an Infowars

3017
02:28:15,744 --> 02:28:17,024
And you commit an act of violence

3018
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:18,048
Alex is to blame

3019
02:28:18,304 --> 02:28:22,144
Exactly well that is a problematic as logic

3020
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:24,960
Orbitz

3021
02:28:25,216 --> 02:28:25,728
True but

3022
02:28:25,984 --> 02:28:27,776
Even it sure seems like that's what he say

3023
02:28:28,032 --> 02:28:29,056
Right I mean

3024
02:28:30,848 --> 02:28:31,872
It just say

3025
02:28:32,128 --> 02:28:38,272
Institutionalized white nationalist

3026
02:28:38,784 --> 02:28:39,808
Mercedes part of that but

3027
02:28:41,088 --> 02:28:41,856
Proof of the pudding is in

3028
02:28:49,024 --> 02:28:53,120
He sets himself up negatively because we aren't making that

3029
02:28:53,888 --> 02:28:55,168
We're just saying if that's what the logic

3030
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:56,448
Leads to

3031
02:28:56,704 --> 02:28:58,496
But the other thing I think

3032
02:28:58,752 --> 02:29:02,080
It is really deeply problematic about what do you think

3033
02:29:02,336 --> 02:29:04,384
Is he is very frequently

3034
02:29:04,896 --> 02:29:07,200
Demanded that Muslims apologize

3035
02:29:07,456 --> 02:29:08,480
Or

3036
02:29:09,504 --> 02:29:11,296
Yeah yeah

3037
02:29:11,552 --> 02:29:16,160
Yeah it's so basically what he saying in this clip is you know you aren't part of the

3038
02:29:16,416 --> 02:29:20,256
White people individually aren't responsible for the acts of an individual white person

3039
02:29:20,768 --> 02:29:22,048
Isis

3040
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:25,888
Then you are responsible for the actions of Isis

3041
02:29:26,144 --> 02:29:27,936
Also I think almost ones are nice

3042
02:29:28,192 --> 02:29:29,472
Right

3043
02:29:29,728 --> 02:29:30,752
Then his argument

3044
02:29:31,008 --> 02:29:31,520
2

3045
02:29:31,776 --> 02:29:33,312
Combat that would be

3046
02:29:33,568 --> 02:29:34,592
Well you don't have to

3047
02:29:35,616 --> 02:29:36,640
It's not an ethnic

3048
02:29:37,152 --> 02:29:39,712
Well I guess that's true

3049
02:29:40,224 --> 02:29:41,504
It's still a choice it's a religion

3050
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:43,040
Is

3051
02:29:43,808 --> 02:29:45,344
That's true in the real world

3052
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:46,624
I don't think

3053
02:29:47,904 --> 02:29:48,928
The Arabs is not Muslim

3054
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:50,208
Different

3055
02:29:50,464 --> 02:29:54,048
Christians

3056
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:59,936
Christians are being murdered more than anybody else around the world Dan most persecuted group in the world

3057
02:30:01,472 --> 02:30:01,984
Christians

3058
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:03,264
Yeah alright whatever

3059
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:04,544
So

3060
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:06,336
Something really fun happens

3061
02:30:06,592 --> 02:30:08,384
Towards the middle of this show

3062
02:30:09,152 --> 02:30:10,944
The caller calls in

3063
02:30:12,224 --> 02:30:12,992
2

3064
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:14,272
Example lyrics

3065
02:30:14,528 --> 02:30:16,576
All right now

3066
02:30:16,832 --> 02:30:19,136
Alex Jones

3067
02:30:19,392 --> 02:30:19,904
Request

3068
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:26,304
Zappa like it's dropped like it's drive time

3069
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:28,096
Audubon and then Alex Jones gets

3070
02:30:28,352 --> 02:30:29,888
It's really weird

3071
02:30:30,144 --> 02:30:30,912
About

3072
02:30:31,936 --> 02:30:32,960
Scaccia

3073
02:30:35,264 --> 02:30:35,776
We don't need you

3074
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:39,360
Your mind is totally

3075
02:30:44,224 --> 02:30:45,760
Until the right

3076
02:30:47,296 --> 02:30:48,064
Don't touch that.

3077
02:30:48,832 --> 02:30:51,392
William Diehl

3078
02:30:51,648 --> 02:30:53,952
Dial

3079
02:30:54,208 --> 02:30:58,304
I love that song and Emma

3080
02:31:00,608 --> 02:31:04,704
Songs I want to play

3081
02:31:08,288 --> 02:31:08,800
Assign

3082
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:14,176
I want to play that then

3083
02:31:15,968 --> 02:31:20,832
Slime album 1973

3084
02:31:27,488 --> 02:31:30,304
Super smart

3085
02:31:33,888 --> 02:31:36,192
And Young

3086
02:31:36,448 --> 02:31:42,592
They said the Good Die Young

3087
02:31:42,848 --> 02:31:48,992
It's just a real bummer you got to wonder I believe Bob Marley would have love you Alex

3088
02:31:49,248 --> 02:31:50,016
If I was cold

3089
02:31:57,696 --> 02:32:03,840
John Lennon

3090
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:05,376
Trish really scary stuff

3091
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:08,704
Wait and then you're not allowed to talk about it

3092
02:32:14,592 --> 02:32:15,616
You know when the government

3093
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:17,920
Living room

3094
02:32:18,944 --> 02:32:22,016
And tells you if you talk about it they're going to kill you and I've already killed

3095
02:32:22,272 --> 02:32:25,344
People close to you

3096
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:27,904
The entire government

3097
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:29,696
And they kill people that Alex

3098
02:32:34,048 --> 02:32:40,192
Alex released the names of those people killed by the government

3099
02:32:40,448 --> 02:32:46,592
He knows about that Paul McCartney has been dead since 1962

3100
02:32:46,848 --> 02:32:52,992
You can't reveal that information

3101
02:32:53,248 --> 02:32:55,040
Facts about something and he's acting weird

3102
02:32:57,088 --> 02:32:57,600
When was

3103
02:32:59,392 --> 02:33:03,744
Probably

3104
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,560
He could just throw out there like it's not like you

3105
02:33:07,072 --> 02:33:08,864
He's already playing fast and loose

3106
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:10,144
With reality anyways

3107
02:33:10,400 --> 02:33:12,960
What is he going to get stood by

3108
02:33:13,216 --> 02:33:15,264
Quite frankly that theory is in his wheel

3109
02:33:15,776 --> 02:33:17,312
Play where you live

3110
02:33:17,568 --> 02:33:19,360
He started saying that

3111
02:33:19,616 --> 02:33:22,432
No one would be like oh this one's real

3112
02:33:22,688 --> 02:33:23,200
If you been

3113
02:33:23,456 --> 02:33:24,736
He started to it maybe he's

3114
02:33:24,992 --> 02:33:31,136
About the fact that John Lennon was a wife

3115
02:33:31,392 --> 02:33:33,440
Fascinated I doubt we would remember him quite as fondue

3116
02:33:35,232 --> 02:33:37,536
Maybe that's what he's trying to avoid

3117
02:33:37,792 --> 02:33:38,816
You're going to get killed

3118
02:33:39,328 --> 02:33:40,608
You just revealed

3119
02:33:40,864 --> 02:33:41,632
The secret information

3120
02:33:41,888 --> 02:33:46,752
The government has to come to my house first

3121
02:33:47,008 --> 02:33:48,288
You know what I never go to my living room

3122
02:33:48,544 --> 02:33:54,432
All in my bedroom

3123
02:33:54,688 --> 02:33:55,968
They have to be invited

3124
02:33:56,224 --> 02:33:56,736
Into your living room

3125
02:33:56,992 --> 02:33:58,528
True true

3126
02:33:58,784 --> 02:34:00,576
Actually recorded out

3127
02:34:02,112 --> 02:34:04,160
Dracula's

3128
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:07,232
So

3129
02:34:08,256 --> 02:34:08,768
Jordan

3130
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:10,560
We're coming to the end

3131
02:34:10,816 --> 02:34:12,608
We are coming to

3132
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:13,888
To the walking away

3133
02:34:14,144 --> 02:34:17,216
Interview

3134
02:34:17,728 --> 02:34:19,264
At the end of his show

3135
02:34:20,544 --> 02:34:21,056
August

3136
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:22,592
2050

3137
02:34:23,616 --> 02:34:24,384
It is the first time

3138
02:34:25,408 --> 02:34:26,944
A lady named

3139
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:28,224
Julia Torre amps

3140
02:34:28,992 --> 02:34:29,760
I don't know if you've ever heard of

3141
02:34:30,272 --> 02:34:31,808
Is she the lady that we heard laughing

3142
02:34:33,088 --> 02:34:33,600
Great

3143
02:34:33,856 --> 02:34:34,368
I already hate

3144
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:35,392
She

3145
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:37,952
As far as I can tell

3146
02:34:38,976 --> 02:34:41,024
Pencil walking into her little bit there's not a ton of it

3147
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:42,304
Information out there in the world

3148
02:34:43,328 --> 02:34:44,352
She has her own website

3149
02:34:46,144 --> 02:34:46,912
She is

3150
02:34:47,168 --> 02:34:48,448
Anarcho-capitalist

3151
02:34:49,472 --> 02:34:52,032
She is a firm supporter in Bitcoins

3152
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:55,104
She is an anti-feminism woman

3153
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:57,920
Why doesn't she invest in that one

3154
02:34:58,432 --> 02:35:02,528
I don't know I think you should buy low

3155
02:35:02,784 --> 02:35:04,064
Absolutely

3156
02:35:08,416 --> 02:35:09,440
Obviously we're going to

3157
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:12,768
Yeah she is

3158
02:35:13,536 --> 02:35:14,816
Incredibly

3159
02:35:15,072 --> 02:35:16,608
I don't want to say dumb

3160
02:35:16,864 --> 02:35:17,632
Because she she

3161
02:35:17,888 --> 02:35:19,168
Clearly has read a few things

3162
02:35:20,448 --> 02:35:22,752
Seems mean to call everyone dumb

3163
02:35:23,008 --> 02:35:23,520
But you can

3164
02:35:24,288 --> 02:35:27,616
Very strongly disagree with almost everything

3165
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:29,920
She's terrible

3166
02:35:30,432 --> 02:35:32,992
Alex

3167
02:35:33,248 --> 02:35:34,016
Hit it off famously

3168
02:35:34,528 --> 02:35:36,320
They are flirting

3169
02:35:36,832 --> 02:35:37,344
Zohar

3170
02:35:39,392 --> 02:35:44,256
Millions of viewers

3171
02:35:44,512 --> 02:35:45,792
And I found

3172
02:35:48,608 --> 02:35:50,144
I found a patreon page

3173
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:50,912
Of hers

3174
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:54,752
I would like to take a moment to Pat RC

3175
02:35:56,032 --> 02:35:56,800
Because

3176
02:35:57,056 --> 02:35:57,824
We've never been on in

3177
02:35:58,080 --> 02:35:58,592
Infowars

3178
02:35:58,848 --> 02:35:59,360
We have a

3179
02:35:59,872 --> 02:36:01,152
Much smaller audience

3180
02:36:01,664 --> 02:36:04,224
Then Alex Jones

3181
02:36:04,736 --> 02:36:06,016
YouTube channel

3182
02:36:06,272 --> 02:36:06,784
Way more

3183
02:36:07,296 --> 02:36:08,832
We have more don't

3184
02:36:11,392 --> 02:36:13,184
Now granted she makes more money

3185
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:16,768
Because it's like $100 a month

3186
02:36:17,024 --> 02:36:19,584
Gotcha but be that as it may we both

3187
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:20,864
As more people

3188
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:27,264
We have more of the public are like the Bernie Sanders man it's all about Grassroots donations

3189
02:36:27,520 --> 02:36:29,568
Absolutely

3190
02:36:29,824 --> 02:36:32,384
And when I went to her patreon page I was like

3191
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:33,152
We started Apple

3192
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:39,552
I was going to start a political party when I was in college this s*** party

3193
02:36:39,808 --> 02:36:42,368
That's not a bad thing that's not a bad name

3194
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:48,768
Ask me about my positions on stuff about the new healthcare bill

3195
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:51,584
Alright that's a good position

3196
02:36:51,840 --> 02:36:56,960
I'm going to need one more example

3197
02:36:57,216 --> 02:36:57,984
F*** that s***

3198
02:36:58,496 --> 02:37:04,128
You know what I am joined to this party

3199
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:09,248
We have the

3200
02:37:09,504 --> 02:37:10,016
Joel

3201
02:37:10,272 --> 02:37:11,040
Tubi

3202
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:14,880
Alex Jones

3203
02:37:16,416 --> 02:37:18,208
But then I realized that guy

3204
02:37:18,464 --> 02:37:19,488
Selling the info wagon

3205
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:24,864
Is making substantial maybe we're just

3206
02:37:26,144 --> 02:37:26,656
If the issue

3207
02:37:27,424 --> 02:37:27,936
We had Millions

3208
02:37:29,472 --> 02:37:30,240
Then

3209
02:37:30,496 --> 02:37:32,032
You think those people would get more of a

3210
02:37:32,288 --> 02:37:35,616
Well the people

3211
02:37:35,872 --> 02:37:37,152
Newly-engaged

3212
02:37:37,408 --> 02:37:38,432
Just in the way Alex

3213
02:37:42,528 --> 02:37:43,296
And

3214
02:37:44,832 --> 02:37:47,392
She's not really advocating those things

3215
02:37:47,904 --> 02:37:49,184
It doesn't drive traffic

3216
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:50,208
Pietersite is much

3217
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:53,536
Because her positions are largely

3218
02:37:54,048 --> 02:37:54,560
Like just

3219
02:37:54,816 --> 02:37:55,584
Problematic

3220
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:58,656
Extreme libertarian position

3221
02:38:00,704 --> 02:38:02,240
Sealand stuff you here coming out Alexa

3222
02:38:02,496 --> 02:38:03,008
Stefan molyneux

3223
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:04,544
Nose

3224
02:38:06,592 --> 02:38:09,920
Asian is a crime

3225
02:38:12,224 --> 02:38:12,736
They hate

3226
02:38:12,992 --> 02:38:13,504
I hate

3227
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:15,040
Preposition

3228
02:38:15,552 --> 02:38:17,344
No roads no school

3229
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:19,648
House lights on fire

3230
02:38:19,904 --> 02:38:21,696
You either pay the fireman or you

3231
02:38:21,952 --> 02:38:27,584
Burn that house with ground Libertarians generally get around the roads are

3232
02:38:28,608 --> 02:38:30,656
That businesses

3233
02:38:30,912 --> 02:38:36,544
Where to get people to go to them and I am so you just know it's in their bed

3234
02:38:37,056 --> 02:38:38,336
Translated to you the consumer

3235
02:38:38,592 --> 02:38:40,896
Well but the business would make those

3236
02:38:41,152 --> 02:38:45,760
And the argument that I would say it back

3237
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:48,320
Then we'll go

3238
02:38:48,576 --> 02:38:54,720
Only places you can talk to our stores because there was

3239
02:38:54,976 --> 02:38:56,768
No incentive for them to create

3240
02:38:57,024 --> 02:39:00,352
Rottier home or the hospital or anything like that

3241
02:39:01,632 --> 02:39:02,656
Deeply problematic

3242
02:39:02,912 --> 02:39:03,680
All of the beliefs

3243
02:39:03,936 --> 02:39:05,728
Libertarian

3244
02:39:09,056 --> 02:39:11,104
It's dumb couchton really smart

3245
02:39:11,360 --> 02:39:12,640
Language

3246
02:39:12,896 --> 02:39:16,992
Well yeah but that's how that works trick by really easily

3247
02:39:18,784 --> 02:39:20,064
I have a couple clips

3248
02:39:20,320 --> 02:39:21,344
Julia Torres

3249
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:22,880
Steve and Alex Jones

3250
02:39:23,136 --> 02:39:25,440
And a number of them they think they're riffing

3251
02:39:26,208 --> 02:39:26,976
They're not

3252
02:39:27,232 --> 02:39:28,512
But this first one

3253
02:39:28,768 --> 02:39:30,560
Advocate

3254
02:39:31,072 --> 02:39:33,120
This works clip play advocate for child

3255
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:40,800
It's the sacrificial God and we're in the people for being sacrificed to it

3256
02:39:41,056 --> 02:39:41,568
Because

3257
02:39:41,824 --> 02:39:46,944
If you call a higher authority which is the seasonal hire power to most people

3258
02:39:47,200 --> 02:39:51,296
Somebody else

3259
02:39:51,552 --> 02:39:53,856
Forty-year-old man you still call your mommy

3260
02:39:54,112 --> 02:39:55,136
14

3261
02:39:55,392 --> 02:40:00,512
I mean it's just

3262
02:40:01,024 --> 02:40:07,168
Manor woman

3263
02:40:07,424 --> 02:40:13,568
Point of making children

3264
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:20,224
It was to keep them children until they were like 25

3265
02:40:20,480 --> 02:40:26,624
A bird in the jungle for kids

3266
02:40:26,880 --> 02:40:33,024
That is so they're a bunch of babbling

3267
02:40:33,280 --> 02:40:39,424
As well

3268
02:40:52,736 --> 02:40:58,880
Have to call somebody for anything

3269
02:40:59,136 --> 02:41:04,256
My father comes from the same generation

3270
02:41:04,512 --> 02:41:08,864
System link that you have to use Black Market

3271
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:10,144
And now it's like

3272
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:14,752
Brakes I have to pay someone cuz I don't have a license to do this

3273
02:41:19,104 --> 02:41:22,944
You can Netflix

3274
02:41:27,552 --> 02:41:29,600
Capitalism isn't that what you want

3275
02:41:29,856 --> 02:41:35,488
Isn't that what you want everybody to have a job maybe we have

3276
02:41:35,744 --> 02:41:36,256
Specialist

3277
02:41:38,048 --> 02:41:41,888
This is this s*** because you are capable of fixing something else

3278
02:41:42,144 --> 02:41:43,424
Sure you are.

3279
02:41:47,264 --> 02:41:49,056
There are so many problems

3280
02:41:49,312 --> 02:41:52,896
There's so many problems with that clip

3281
02:41:53,408 --> 02:41:54,432
They're worse

3282
02:41:54,688 --> 02:41:55,200
Song

3283
02:41:55,456 --> 02:41:57,248
Someday I will admit

3284
02:41:57,504 --> 02:41:59,552
Child labor was not a perv

3285
02:42:01,344 --> 02:42:03,648
Yeah I had to get workshops

3286
02:42:03,904 --> 02:42:05,184
Like their advocations

3287
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:07,232
You should be an adult

3288
02:42:10,304 --> 02:42:14,144
Did any of the rights of an adult

3289
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:15,168
Should be able to work

3290
02:42:17,472 --> 02:42:20,800
And the drugs or smoke

3291
02:42:21,056 --> 02:42:25,920
Well maybe that maybe that is

3292
02:42:26,176 --> 02:42:31,808
Book the idea of child labor being an illegal was in order to keep people children longer

3293
02:42:32,064 --> 02:42:32,832
Crazy

3294
02:42:33,088 --> 02:42:34,624
There's so many reasons

3295
02:42:35,136 --> 02:42:36,672
To not have children doing

3296
02:42:36,928 --> 02:42:40,000
Especially dangerous jobs which was what was going on

3297
02:42:40,256 --> 02:42:46,400
Working in the mines

3298
02:42:46,656 --> 02:42:52,800
All that Machinery when you lost those

3299
02:42:53,056 --> 02:42:57,920
His hands you definitely wouldn't get workman's comp because that didn't exist

3300
02:42:58,176 --> 02:43:04,320
You are just a person without hands from there on out

3301
02:43:04,832 --> 02:43:10,976
Yeah man you know what really keeps you from taking out the garbage

3302
02:43:11,232 --> 02:43:12,256
No hands

3303
02:43:12,512 --> 02:43:14,048
Except

3304
02:43:14,304 --> 02:43:19,680
We've discussed this in the past where that belief

3305
02:43:19,936 --> 02:43:20,704
Comes from

3306
02:43:22,752 --> 02:43:24,800
Union

3307
02:43:25,056 --> 02:43:26,336
S***

3308
02:43:26,592 --> 02:43:29,408
That's what they were

3309
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:30,944
Oh you don't have a

3310
02:43:31,456 --> 02:43:31,968
That is

3311
02:43:32,224 --> 02:43:34,016
Anti-hero toilet

3312
02:43:34,272 --> 02:43:35,296
Get your cousin

3313
02:43:35,552 --> 02:43:36,320
Toilet tissue

3314
02:43:36,576 --> 02:43:38,880
You should really be able to know how to fix

3315
02:43:39,136 --> 02:43:39,648
It's your home

3316
02:43:39,904 --> 02:43:41,440
In order to make sure you can

3317
02:43:41,696 --> 02:43:42,720
Can't do anything more

3318
02:43:42,976 --> 02:43:49,120
Homeowner it's imagine it's probably pretty fun to be a weekend warrior

3319
02:43:49,376 --> 02:43:53,728
Or something like that for it

3320
02:43:53,984 --> 02:43:58,080
Yeah there's there's

3321
02:43:58,336 --> 02:43:58,848
Sears

3322
02:43:59,104 --> 02:44:02,944
Tons of YouTube channels that just explained how to do these

3323
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:07,296
Do they explain how to take your garbage you don't have a license

3324
02:44:07,552 --> 02:44:08,576
Computer got the garbage

3325
02:44:09,856 --> 02:44:11,392
You got to go to the DMV

3326
02:44:11,904 --> 02:44:13,184
Seattle wait for an hour

3327
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:15,232
It's terrible

3328
02:44:16,256 --> 02:44:18,560
Is a anti-state

3329
02:44:18,816 --> 02:44:19,328
She believes that

3330
02:44:19,584 --> 02:44:21,632
Intrinsically oppressive

3331
02:44:22,144 --> 02:44:23,424
I don't even want to deal with that

3332
02:44:23,936 --> 02:44:29,056
But I do want to talk about sacrificial God whenever they

3333
02:44:29,824 --> 02:44:31,360
And I got that Samantha

3334
02:44:32,384 --> 02:44:33,408
Also like

3335
02:44:34,432 --> 02:44:35,200
She is Russian

3336
02:44:36,992 --> 02:44:37,760
She moved to Canada

3337
02:44:38,784 --> 02:44:39,296
So

3338
02:44:40,064 --> 02:44:40,576
There we go

3339
02:44:41,344 --> 02:44:43,904
You know what I mean yeah well that's why she hates me

3340
02:44:44,672 --> 02:44:45,696
Superlit provider health

3341
02:44:45,952 --> 02:44:46,976
Different

3342
02:44:47,232 --> 02:44:53,376
That's indicative of that philosophy being flawed like different states are run

3343
02:44:54,144 --> 02:44:55,936
I can't print countries are different

3344
02:44:56,192 --> 02:44:57,472
No they all become communist

3345
02:44:57,984 --> 02:44:58,752
Also here's the f***

3346
02:44:59,008 --> 02:44:59,520
F*****-up thing

3347
02:45:00,032 --> 02:45:02,080
Alex Jones's super International

3348
02:45:02,592 --> 02:45:03,360
He's having an

3349
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:05,152
Person

3350
02:45:05,664 --> 02:45:09,504
Because of their shared

3351
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:10,784
Taxation

3352
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:11,808
Is a crime

3353
02:45:12,320 --> 02:45:14,368
And we definitely don't want to stay

3354
02:45:15,904 --> 02:45:20,256
We do need a state to keep immigrants away from our country

3355
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:23,072
White

3356
02:45:23,584 --> 02:45:25,376
Like I have

3357
02:45:25,632 --> 02:45:27,168
I have ideological in

3358
02:45:27,424 --> 02:45:27,936
Inconsistency

3359
02:45:28,704 --> 02:45:29,984
But when I find

3360
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:30,752
I go

3361
02:45:33,312 --> 02:45:34,592
I don't know

3362
02:45:34,848 --> 02:45:39,712
Yeah I'm always I'm always trying to build it but there's a central Audiology around it

3363
02:45:39,968 --> 02:45:40,736
And if there is

3364
02:45:40,992 --> 02:45:42,016
Contradiction

3365
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:43,808
At least

3366
02:45:44,064 --> 02:45:45,088
People

3367
02:45:45,856 --> 02:45:47,904
Their ideology is whatever they

3368
02:45:48,160 --> 02:45:48,672
Feel like that

3369
02:45:48,928 --> 02:45:49,440
That's why

3370
02:45:49,952 --> 02:45:50,464
The problem with

3371
02:45:50,976 --> 02:45:51,744
These are like

3372
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:52,768
Anarcho-capitalist

3373
02:45:53,536 --> 02:45:55,072
Is

3374
02:45:55,328 --> 02:45:56,352
They will

3375
02:45:58,400 --> 02:46:00,192
Scenario

3376
02:46:00,448 --> 02:46:01,216
Yeah

3377
02:46:02,752 --> 02:46:03,264
It's

3378
02:46:04,543 --> 02:46:05,311
Is House of Cards

3379
02:46:05,567 --> 02:46:06,079
Yeah

3380
02:46:09,663 --> 02:46:10,687
Like

3381
02:46:11,199 --> 02:46:11,967
In their world

3382
02:46:12,223 --> 02:46:13,759
The only problem is

3383
02:46:14,271 --> 02:46:16,063
Then it's it's the luxury

3384
02:46:16,575 --> 02:46:18,879
Of everybody else knowing they're wrong

3385
02:46:19,391 --> 02:46:21,439
That allows them to believe their dumpster

3386
02:46:22,719 --> 02:46:24,511
Any of what they really wanted

3387
02:46:25,023 --> 02:46:25,791
Came into play

3388
02:46:26,303 --> 02:46:27,583
They would immediately be like

3389
02:46:31,679 --> 02:46:37,823
Okay now I guess you're right you're right we should put children to work

3390
02:46:38,847 --> 02:46:40,383
Like the other Terror of

3391
02:46:40,639 --> 02:46:43,967
The reality rolling back all of the liberal progress

3392
02:46:46,015 --> 02:46:46,783
Play 57

3393
02:46:47,039 --> 02:46:50,111
If it were all to go away we would live

3394
02:46:50,367 --> 02:46:53,439
Terrifying hellscape

3395
02:46:53,695 --> 02:46:56,511
But that's that's again

3396
02:46:56,767 --> 02:46:58,047
Trick of nostalgia

3397
02:46:58,559 --> 02:47:02,399
It wasn't the good old days

3398
02:47:02,655 --> 02:47:05,727
Remember when I was a kid everything was

3399
02:47:06,239 --> 02:47:07,007
Because I didn't have to

3400
02:47:07,263 --> 02:47:09,311
Come to grips with the fact that all my friends

3401
02:47:09,567 --> 02:47:10,335
You were dying around

3402
02:47:13,151 --> 02:47:14,687
Alex and Julia get along

3403
02:47:15,199 --> 02:47:17,247
If they have these foundational differ

3404
02:47:17,759 --> 02:47:18,527
1

3405
02:47:18,783 --> 02:47:19,295
About talking

3406
02:47:19,551 --> 02:47:20,319
She is pretty track

3407
02:47:20,575 --> 02:47:26,719
The second call it Alex Jones will believe anything on the way

3408
02:47:32,095 --> 02:47:35,423
No more gun as a woman I own a gun because

3409
02:47:41,823 --> 02:47:47,967
Because transgender

3410
02:47:52,831 --> 02:47:58,975
And I think all women should own guns and I think there's

3411
02:47:59,231 --> 02:48:03,327
Quite well

3412
02:48:03,839 --> 02:48:06,911
What channel is purple

3413
02:48:07,167 --> 02:48:10,239
Women's rights

3414
02:48:10,495 --> 02:48:13,823
Most females

3415
02:48:14,079 --> 02:48:16,383
6 plus women at a great disadvantage

3416
02:48:16,639 --> 02:48:20,735
Against a man isn't equalizer

3417
02:48:29,439 --> 02:48:35,583
And as part of the hierarchy of male oppression

3418
02:48:35,839 --> 02:48:41,983
Grimes

3419
02:48:45,055 --> 02:48:47,615
I'm a purple pickle eggs

3420
02:48:47,871 --> 02:48:49,663
I legitimately think they think that's comedy

3421
02:48:50,431 --> 02:48:52,735
Like I think I think he thinks

3422
02:48:55,039 --> 02:48:59,391
Everywhere

3423
02:49:00,415 --> 02:49:01,439
Gender roles

3424
02:49:01,695 --> 02:49:02,975
I think he thinks

3425
02:49:03,231 --> 02:49:05,535
It's funny you know what I think I agree with

3426
02:49:06,047 --> 02:49:07,839
I think every woman should own a gun

3427
02:49:08,351 --> 02:49:08,863
But

3428
02:49:09,375 --> 02:49:10,655
I think men should not be allowed to

3429
02:49:11,167 --> 02:49:11,679
Okay

3430
02:49:16,799 --> 02:49:22,687
Equalizer well man I already have the physical Advantage so we got to have women equalizer

3431
02:49:22,943 --> 02:49:26,015
What's up man have a gun it's back to being a

3432
02:49:26,527 --> 02:49:29,343
No I think it's how I look at it

3433
02:49:29,855 --> 02:49:32,927
I look at it as a gameshow the barrel of a gun that's how you look

3434
02:49:33,183 --> 02:49:37,023
Future No Doubt where the first

3435
02:49:37,279 --> 02:49:37,791
3 round

3436
02:49:38,047 --> 02:49:39,583
Are worth one point

3437
02:49:39,839 --> 02:49:43,167
Whoever wins gets 1.34 frown

3438
02:49:43,423 --> 02:49:44,959
Thousand points

3439
02:49:45,215 --> 02:49:49,567
Workarounds don't matter at 3000-4000

3440
02:49:50,079 --> 02:49:51,615
It doesn't even matter

3441
02:49:51,871 --> 02:49:52,639
321

3442
02:49:52,895 --> 02:49:53,919
3201

3443
02:49:54,687 --> 02:49:58,271
This next one they're trying to rest a little bit about privilege

3444
02:49:59,039 --> 02:50:05,183
I'm just discriminatory

3445
02:50:05,439 --> 02:50:07,487
I died in communist Russia but I have privilege

3446
02:50:08,255 --> 02:50:10,303
Yeah well you're responsible for slavery

3447
02:50:11,583 --> 02:50:12,863
So that's that

3448
02:50:13,119 --> 02:50:14,399
Shameful

3449
02:50:14,655 --> 02:50:19,775
I'm sad that your family died in communist Russia that's interesting

3450
02:50:20,287 --> 02:50:24,383
I meant. I don't know anything about the black market

3451
02:50:24,639 --> 02:50:26,943
Fix a toilet that's true

3452
02:50:30,015 --> 02:50:32,575
Against her fam I am sad that our family trident

3453
02:50:33,087 --> 02:50:34,623
A little sad

3454
02:50:36,927 --> 02:50:40,255
The issue the issue that like

3455
02:50:40,511 --> 02:50:44,351
When you're talking about privilege never take into account

3456
02:50:44,863 --> 02:50:45,631
Is that

3457
02:50:45,887 --> 02:50:47,679
There is a societal bias

3458
02:50:47,935 --> 02:50:48,703
Against blacks

3459
02:50:49,471 --> 02:50:50,239
That is just

3460
02:50:51,263 --> 02:50:54,079
Studies have shown this over and over and over

3461
02:50:55,359 --> 02:50:56,383
When Julia

3462
02:50:56,639 --> 02:50:59,199
Oransky walks down the street

3463
02:50:59,711 --> 02:51:00,479
No one knows

3464
02:51:01,247 --> 02:51:02,527
Just by looking at her

3465
02:51:02,783 --> 02:51:03,551
Better family

3466
02:51:03,807 --> 02:51:04,319
Died

3467
02:51:04,575 --> 02:51:05,343
In Soviet Russia

3468
02:51:05,855 --> 02:51:06,367
No one knows

3469
02:51:08,927 --> 02:51:09,951
Reveal that information

3470
02:51:10,463 --> 02:51:11,487
Except by

3471
02:51:11,743 --> 02:51:12,511
Pahrump

3472
02:51:13,023 --> 02:51:15,839
She can give that information up and people can judge her

3473
02:51:16,095 --> 02:51:17,119
However they choose

3474
02:51:18,143 --> 02:51:18,911
A black person

3475
02:51:19,167 --> 02:51:20,959
Is immediately seen as a black pearl

3476
02:51:21,727 --> 02:51:22,751
They don't have a choice

3477
02:51:23,263 --> 02:51:24,287
About how the world looks

3478
02:51:25,823 --> 02:51:26,335
Is why half

3479
02:51:26,591 --> 02:51:27,871
White

3480
02:51:28,127 --> 02:51:28,639
Is not

3481
02:51:28,895 --> 02:51:29,663
What you would call

3482
02:51:29,919 --> 02:51:33,759
Is that is the part of privilege that Alex Jones

3483
02:51:34,015 --> 02:51:34,527
Refuses

3484
02:51:34,783 --> 02:51:36,063
To all look at

3485
02:51:38,367 --> 02:51:39,135
One of the

3486
02:51:39,647 --> 02:51:41,439
Foundational pieces of that conversation

3487
02:51:41,951 --> 02:51:45,023
Here's another part of that privilege

3488
02:51:45,279 --> 02:51:47,327
Is Bart

3489
02:51:47,583 --> 02:51:49,887
Well then there's the fact she is a gun

3490
02:51:53,727 --> 02:51:55,775
Did or if she were in the process of being arrested

3491
02:51:56,543 --> 02:51:57,311
They would respect

3492
02:52:00,383 --> 02:52:01,407
She would be dead

3493
02:52:01,663 --> 02:52:05,247
With her child in the car

3494
02:52:05,503 --> 02:52:07,551
There is no old lady

3495
02:52:07,807 --> 02:52:09,343
Oh there's so much of a white privilege

3496
02:52:11,647 --> 02:52:12,927
Does hypothetical

3497
02:52:13,183 --> 02:52:13,695
Situation

3498
02:52:15,999 --> 02:52:18,815
How many times

3499
02:52:19,071 --> 02:52:21,887
How many times have you seen a white man with a gun

3500
02:52:24,703 --> 02:52:25,983
Calm down

3501
02:52:27,519 --> 02:52:28,799
Deescalate

3502
02:52:29,823 --> 02:52:31,103
How many times have you

3503
02:52:31,359 --> 02:52:32,639
You seen a black man with a gun

3504
02:52:32,895 --> 02:52:33,663
Who is trying to

3505
02:52:33,919 --> 02:52:34,431
To talk to people

3506
02:52:34,943 --> 02:52:36,223
Trying to DF

3507
02:52:36,991 --> 02:52:39,039
Getting f****** shot then murder

3508
02:52:40,575 --> 02:52:41,855
That's what white privilege is

3509
02:52:42,111 --> 02:52:46,975
White lady interesting conversation

3510
02:52:47,231 --> 02:52:47,743
To be had

3511
02:52:48,255 --> 02:52:49,023
If she wanted to

3512
02:52:49,279 --> 02:52:51,071
Discuss like the male gaze

3513
02:52:51,583 --> 02:52:52,607
Or something like that

3514
02:52:52,863 --> 02:52:56,703
Because she is an attractive lady and it was same way that

3515
02:52:56,959 --> 02:53:01,055
She doesn't really get to choose how men objectify her

3516
02:53:01,311 --> 02:53:03,103
Or sexualize Herbie

3517
02:53:03,615 --> 02:53:07,711
You can see that if you look at, it's certainly about how

3518
02:53:08,991 --> 02:53:12,063
Libertarian ladies

3519
02:53:12,319 --> 02:53:12,831
Websites

3520
02:53:14,111 --> 02:53:15,391
If she wants to

3521
02:53:15,647 --> 02:53:16,415
Disgust you know like

3522
02:53:17,951 --> 02:53:18,975
Like Infowars

3523
02:53:21,791 --> 02:53:27,935
I didn't look at the comments on this video but I'm sure a lot of my life website

3524
02:53:31,007 --> 02:53:34,079
That's what celebrity

3525
02:53:36,895 --> 02:53:38,687
Come on Dan you're the one who's supposed to do the research

3526
02:53:41,759 --> 02:53:43,039
How how them

3527
02:53:45,087 --> 02:53:51,231
I feel like I was not germane to our investigation

3528
02:53:51,487 --> 02:53:51,999
Jones to Trump

3529
02:53:52,255 --> 02:53:53,535
No but actually

3530
02:53:53,791 --> 02:53:55,071
The next clip is about tree

3531
02:53:55,583 --> 02:53:59,167
Okay I have some interesting thoughts

3532
02:53:59,423 --> 02:54:00,447
I don't know let's find out

3533
02:54:01,727 --> 02:54:07,359
Controlled by the same Powers doesn't matter

3534
02:54:13,759 --> 02:54:19,903
Something else

3535
02:54:20,159 --> 02:54:26,303
Efficiencies seen the favorites

3536
02:54:28,351 --> 02:54:29,631
So that's wild

3537
02:54:30,143 --> 02:54:35,007
She doesn't care globalists

3538
02:54:35,263 --> 02:54:37,567
I guess I'm not sure if that's

3539
02:54:37,823 --> 02:54:41,151
You know cuz she's anti-state so it doesn't matter whoever's the

3540
02:54:41,407 --> 02:54:42,687
President

3541
02:54:42,943 --> 02:54:43,967
Yeah it's

3542
02:54:45,247 --> 02:54:45,759
But

3543
02:54:46,271 --> 02:54:47,039
She still

3544
02:54:47,295 --> 02:54:48,063
Alex

3545
02:54:50,367 --> 02:54:51,647
And when they're talking about him

3546
02:54:52,159 --> 02:54:54,463
Shutting down a Univision reporter was

3547
02:54:54,719 --> 02:54:57,535
By Hispanic reporter if you recall that was

3548
02:54:57,791 --> 02:54:58,815
Not a dignified Exchange

3549
02:54:59,071 --> 02:54:59,583
No

3550
02:54:59,839 --> 02:55:02,399
So I like very sad

3551
02:55:02,911 --> 02:55:03,679
It was a very

3552
02:55:03,935 --> 02:55:04,703
Weak man

3553
02:55:05,983 --> 02:55:06,495
Doing

3554
02:55:06,751 --> 02:55:08,799
I like those

3555
02:55:09,055 --> 02:55:09,823
Even her

3556
02:55:10,079 --> 02:55:11,871
Even this anti-state

3557
02:55:12,127 --> 02:55:12,895
Anarcho-capitalist

3558
02:55:19,551 --> 02:55:21,087
People lying

3559
02:55:21,343 --> 02:55:22,623
At the end there like

3560
02:55:23,391 --> 02:55:24,671
He's bribing politicians

3561
02:55:24,927 --> 02:55:27,743
Do you know is what you know he knows this this inside and out

3562
02:55:27,999 --> 02:55:34,143
Yeah you're just saying you like him cuz he's committed crimes

3563
02:55:34,655 --> 02:55:36,703
He tells it like it is Dan

3564
02:55:39,007 --> 02:55:41,055
Is close to a position on Trump

3565
02:55:41,311 --> 02:55:41,823
As we get

3566
02:55:42,079 --> 02:55:43,103
At the end hear the

3567
02:55:43,615 --> 02:55:45,663
Ivy stretch we got two more clips left

3568
02:55:46,687 --> 02:55:47,967
First one is problematic

3569
02:55:48,223 --> 02:55:54,367
In America

3570
02:55:54,623 --> 02:56:00,767
Legitimate

3571
02:56:02,815 --> 02:56:08,959
Schools are all Flats

3572
02:56:09,215 --> 02:56:15,359
Man who lost his entire career and Aspen

3573
02:56:15,615 --> 02:56:16,127
Discredit

3574
02:56:16,383 --> 02:56:17,407
Slander

3575
02:56:17,663 --> 02:56:20,735
Because he used the term house negro

3576
02:56:20,991 --> 02:56:26,367
Describe a situation where it actually happened and you had Cynthia McKinney the first

3577
02:56:26,623 --> 02:56:29,183
Black female congresswoman from Georgia

3578
02:56:29,439 --> 02:56:30,719
Support this man

3579
02:56:30,975 --> 02:56:32,255
So I looked into this

3580
02:56:32,511 --> 02:56:37,119
Because the way she presented as he used the term house negro in a situation where it was

3581
02:56:37,375 --> 02:56:39,167
What was right eye

3582
02:56:44,287 --> 02:56:46,591
This is from the Ottawa Citizen

3583
02:56:46,847 --> 02:56:52,991
Publication information because of a,

3584
02:56:56,063 --> 02:56:59,647
Rancourt fired by the university worked at

3585
02:56:59,903 --> 02:57:00,415
I used

3586
02:57:00,671 --> 02:57:02,975
A racially-charged

3587
02:57:03,231 --> 02:57:05,023
Two articles you posted on his blog

3588
02:57:05,279 --> 02:57:06,303
About the universities

3589
02:57:06,559 --> 02:57:07,071
Internal policy

3590
02:57:07,839 --> 02:57:08,351
St.Louis

3591
02:57:08,607 --> 02:57:11,423
Who was the director of the University's human-rights research and

3592
02:57:11,679 --> 02:57:12,191
Education Center

3593
02:57:12,447 --> 02:57:17,055
He criticized the methodology of a student-produced report alleging systemic racism

3594
02:57:17,311 --> 02:57:18,591
In the University's academic

3595
02:57:18,847 --> 02:57:19,359
Fraud process

3596
02:57:20,127 --> 02:57:20,639
Sheila

3597
02:57:21,151 --> 02:57:23,711
Evaluation to academic

3598
02:57:23,967 --> 02:57:28,319
Fraud implying that you supported racism and acted in a servile manner

3599
02:57:28,831 --> 02:57:30,367
Rancourt denies these allegations

3600
02:57:30,623 --> 02:57:31,647
Louis's

3601
02:57:31,903 --> 02:57:32,415
Interpretation

3602
02:57:32,671 --> 02:57:33,695
The meaning of insult

3603
02:57:33,951 --> 02:57:36,255
Is quote extrapolated and misguided

3604
02:57:39,327 --> 02:57:39,839
And

3605
02:57:43,935 --> 02:57:44,447
Is it defense

3606
02:57:45,215 --> 02:57:48,287
Rancourt called the phrase house negro a comment

3607
02:57:49,311 --> 02:57:52,383
Describe privileged minority members who act to minimize the concern

3608
02:57:53,919 --> 02:58:00,063
St Louis was the first female law student at the University of British Columbia and the only black woman ever elected as a bench

3609
02:58:00,575 --> 02:58:02,111
Happy Law Society of Upper Canada

3610
02:58:04,671 --> 02:58:05,439
Common term

3611
02:58:06,975 --> 02:58:07,999
You can't walk down

3612
02:58:09,023 --> 02:58:13,631
Look every time I go to the store

3613
02:58:13,887 --> 02:58:14,399
It's just

3614
02:58:14,655 --> 02:58:15,423
Thrown around

3615
02:58:15,679 --> 02:58:17,215
Like some p

3616
02:58:17,471 --> 02:58:17,983
People say

3617
02:58:18,239 --> 02:58:18,751
What up

3618
02:58:19,263 --> 02:58:19,775
Sure

3619
02:58:20,031 --> 02:58:21,055
And I say houses

3620
02:58:24,383 --> 02:58:29,759
But her presentation of her presentation of it is so appealing to people who agree with it already

3621
02:58:30,527 --> 02:58:34,111
Cuz you don't not like I don't know how you defend the idea of actually

3622
02:58:34,367 --> 02:58:34,879
We calling

3623
02:58:37,439 --> 02:58:37,951
Presenting it is

3624
02:58:38,207 --> 02:58:40,767
He's talking about it it in Scituate

3625
02:58:41,023 --> 02:58:44,095
You're thinking he's talking about old-time slavery days

3626
02:58:44,607 --> 02:58:46,399
It's like in a historical context

3627
02:58:46,655 --> 02:58:50,239
Use the word the PC sensors come in

3628
02:58:50,495 --> 02:58:53,055
It's like you're trying to take the N word out of Huck Finn

3629
02:58:53,311 --> 02:58:54,079
You don't like that sort of

3630
02:58:54,335 --> 02:58:54,847
Eventbrite

3631
02:58:55,103 --> 02:58:55,615
It's not

3632
02:58:56,383 --> 02:58:58,687
He did not like what someone said

3633
02:58:58,943 --> 02:59:00,479
He disagreed with them

3634
02:59:00,735 --> 02:59:02,783
Call them house Negroes twice

3635
02:59:03,039 --> 02:59:03,551
Yeah

3636
02:59:04,063 --> 02:59:05,087
That's not okay

3637
02:59:05,343 --> 02:59:06,111
No it's

3638
02:59:06,367 --> 02:59:12,511
Can't hear it all the time time

3639
02:59:12,767 --> 02:59:13,279
Discounts

3640
02:59:13,535 --> 02:59:14,047
You know what

3641
02:59:14,303 --> 02:59:14,815
Frankly

3642
02:59:15,839 --> 02:59:17,631
In his world it is a comment

3643
02:59:18,143 --> 02:59:20,959
That argument probably makes sense

3644
02:59:21,471 --> 02:59:23,775
Yeah probably is the world within which he lives

3645
02:59:25,055 --> 02:59:30,431
Hey maybe Julia tyranski

3646
02:59:32,223 --> 02:59:34,783
Reviews remarkable restraint in not breaking up

3647
02:59:35,039 --> 02:59:36,831
The fact that Julia transki is Russian

3648
02:59:39,135 --> 02:59:40,671
Richard Cheese

3649
02:59:42,975 --> 02:59:49,119
I just want to take this opportunity to point out that

3650
02:59:49,631 --> 02:59:52,447
Just because someone is Russian does not mean that there is something

3651
02:59:52,959 --> 02:59:53,983
Nefarious involving

3652
02:59:55,775 --> 02:59:57,055
And I definitely don't

3653
02:59:57,311 --> 02:59:58,335
Make that somebody

3654
02:59:59,615 --> 03:00:00,383
Was murdered in Russia

3655
03:00:00,895 --> 03:00:01,919
Communist Russia

3656
03:00:02,687 --> 03:00:03,199
It's different now

3657
03:00:04,223 --> 03:00:04,991
Putin strong now

3658
03:00:06,527 --> 03:00:07,039
But

3659
03:00:09,343 --> 03:00:10,623
Nevermind

3660
03:00:11,903 --> 03:00:12,415
We need King

3661
03:00:15,487 --> 03:00:16,511
I want to fight duels

3662
03:00:17,023 --> 03:00:18,303
Kiefer Sutherland

3663
03:00:21,631 --> 03:00:22,655
But I want to give you some setup

3664
03:00:24,447 --> 03:00:24,959
Is

3665
03:00:25,983 --> 03:00:26,751
Julian Alex

3666
03:00:27,519 --> 03:00:28,287
Having some nice rap

3667
03:00:28,799 --> 03:00:29,823
Alright

3668
03:00:30,079 --> 03:00:30,847
Thinking there

3669
03:00:31,103 --> 03:00:31,615
Shaking their butt

3670
03:00:31,871 --> 03:00:33,407
Yes

3671
03:00:33,919 --> 03:00:34,687
They get a call

3672
03:00:35,455 --> 03:00:36,735
I'm someone who's trying

3673
03:00:36,991 --> 03:00:37,503
To tell Alex

3674
03:00:37,759 --> 03:00:38,527
But he's wrong about that

3675
03:00:39,295 --> 03:00:41,855
You know what before we go

3676
03:00:43,135 --> 03:00:43,903
Like as a comic

3677
03:00:44,671 --> 03:00:46,207
Listening to these people

3678
03:00:46,975 --> 03:00:47,743
Riff about this

3679
03:00:47,999 --> 03:00:48,767
Horrible s***

3680
03:00:49,535 --> 03:00:50,303
Thinking it's funny

3681
03:00:50,815 --> 03:00:53,631
These are the same people who would go to a comedy show

3682
03:00:53,887 --> 03:00:54,911
And immediately get a

3683
03:00:55,167 --> 03:01:01,311
Imagine

3684
03:01:02,847 --> 03:01:06,943
F*** you

3685
03:01:07,199 --> 03:01:08,991
People who insist on

3686
03:01:09,247 --> 03:01:10,783
Having a clean show

3687
03:01:11,039 --> 03:01:12,575
Are the same people

3688
03:01:12,831 --> 03:01:13,599
Fight against

3689
03:01:13,855 --> 03:01:15,135
Political correctness all the time

3690
03:01:16,927 --> 03:01:18,719
Look I can't say

3691
03:01:18,975 --> 03:01:20,255
But yeah sure go ahead

3692
03:01:20,511 --> 03:01:22,303
Defensible using the term house

3693
03:01:23,839 --> 03:01:24,607
I'm the f******

3694
03:01:24,863 --> 03:01:27,935
Meanwhile Flash Forward two years and Alex's Lake

3695
03:01:28,191 --> 03:01:29,983
Screaming about that Shakespeare play

3696
03:01:32,543 --> 03:01:34,335
Performative bulshit on

3697
03:01:34,591 --> 03:01:35,103
But

3698
03:01:35,615 --> 03:01:36,383
He get this call

3699
03:01:36,895 --> 03:01:39,199
If the guy has been allowed to speak

3700
03:01:39,967 --> 03:01:43,295
I legitimately think you would be making some of the similar points that I would make

3701
03:01:44,831 --> 03:01:46,879
You get to hear with Alex's response to it is

3702
03:01:47,391 --> 03:01:49,695
And it's not great

3703
03:01:50,207 --> 03:01:50,719
Especially

3704
03:01:50,975 --> 03:01:57,119
This is you living through vicariously

3705
03:01:58,911 --> 03:01:59,935
Disposal more information

3706
03:02:00,447 --> 03:02:00,959
Sky perhaps

3707
03:02:01,215 --> 03:02:01,727
Because I've been

3708
03:02:01,983 --> 03:02:02,751
Studying

3709
03:02:03,007 --> 03:02:04,287
But he still doesn't poop

3710
03:02:05,311 --> 03:02:06,079
Anybody would have

3711
03:02:06,335 --> 03:02:06,847
More

3712
03:02:07,359 --> 03:02:09,919
Their disposal than you with this

3713
03:02:10,175 --> 03:02:12,479
He's better than that one caller we had

3714
03:02:15,551 --> 03:02:16,575
So fun based on how

3715
03:02:16,831 --> 03:02:17,855
Like they're living in this

3716
03:02:18,111 --> 03:02:20,159
Fancy Free World at the beginning of the clip

3717
03:02:20,415 --> 03:02:21,183
Eminem f****** turn

3718
03:02:26,047 --> 03:02:32,191
And if they attack

3719
03:02:32,447 --> 03:02:37,567
Anticipated

3720
03:02:41,407 --> 03:02:44,223
I think he's good-looking stud she has nice

3721
03:02:48,063 --> 03:02:49,087
She's good-looking guy

3722
03:02:49,599 --> 03:02:50,111
I admit it

3723
03:02:50,879 --> 03:02:57,023
How old is it

3724
03:02:57,279 --> 03:03:00,607
If you watch the video of this

3725
03:03:00,863 --> 03:03:01,375
Do Alex

3726
03:03:01,631 --> 03:03:07,775
Leaning closer to her body language

3727
03:03:11,359 --> 03:03:13,919
At this point she has just said

3728
03:03:14,175 --> 03:03:15,711
That you can't watch Rachel Maddow cuz she

3729
03:03:15,967 --> 03:03:16,479
She gets all hot

3730
03:03:16,735 --> 03:03:18,527
Watching it

3731
03:03:18,783 --> 03:03:21,343
In any other environment would be sexual harass

3732
03:03:23,647 --> 03:03:27,487
You're attracted to mess around though.

3733
03:03:30,559 --> 03:03:31,839
She's taking me out for steaks later

3734
03:03:42,079 --> 03:03:42,847
Bill

3735
03:03:43,359 --> 03:03:46,175
Is calling from Tennessee Alex Jones predictions

3736
03:03:50,015 --> 03:03:52,063
How much do a couple years now and

3737
03:03:52,831 --> 03:03:53,855
So far I mean

3738
03:03:55,647 --> 03:03:56,927
FEMA camps Alex

3739
03:03:57,183 --> 03:03:58,719
Your guns Alex

3740
03:03:59,231 --> 03:03:59,999
Faith Hill

3741
03:04:00,255 --> 03:04:00,767
I bet

3742
03:04:01,023 --> 03:04:01,791
Nothing happened

3743
03:04:02,559 --> 03:04:05,375
I'm sorry I mean you just completely fear-mongering

3744
03:04:07,935 --> 03:04:08,959
Bilderberg nothing happened

3745
03:04:13,311 --> 03:04:14,335
Easy way out

3746
03:04:17,407 --> 03:04:20,735
Are you a joke all or trying to make me look good are you serious

3747
03:04:22,271 --> 03:04:22,783
I'm serious

3748
03:04:24,063 --> 03:04:26,879
Well we never shed

3749
03:04:27,391 --> 03:04:29,183
For a moment

3750
03:04:29,439 --> 03:04:31,743
He actually asked

3751
03:04:31,999 --> 03:04:33,023
You said

3752
03:04:34,815 --> 03:04:36,863
Jade helm

3753
03:04:37,119 --> 03:04:39,935
I never said that.

3754
03:04:40,447 --> 03:04:41,983
My boyfriend mr. Matthau

3755
03:04:42,495 --> 03:04:44,543
How do you spell bottom

3756
03:04:44,799 --> 03:04:47,359
With a bunch of other statements about where's the FEMA camp

3757
03:04:47,615 --> 03:04:50,175
Emergency

3758
03:04:50,431 --> 03:04:51,967
In the mid-90s

3759
03:04:52,223 --> 03:04:58,111
When we were classified

3760
03:04:58,367 --> 03:05:02,463
A different program classified

3761
03:05:08,095 --> 03:05:11,423
For the Emergency Center

3762
03:05:11,679 --> 03:05:13,215
We're headed Mitch the plans

3763
03:05:27,551 --> 03:05:33,695
Social Security recipients

3764
03:05:35,487 --> 03:05:41,631
Other borders are wide open outside of shutting off power plant

3765
03:05:43,423 --> 03:05:47,775

Confiscation confiscation of guns and Canada

You're a joke bill you for real

3769
03:06:19,519 --> 03:06:22,591
Are you sure we're descending into

3770
03:06:24,127 --> 03:06:28,735
Tyranny

3771
03:06:29,247 --> 03:06:29,759
Again

3772
03:06:30,015 --> 03:06:30,527
FEMA camp

3773
03:06:30,783 --> 03:06:34,879
Where are they

3774
03:06:36,159 --> 03:06:42,303
You say you been listening for years you can type in the education camp

3775
03:06:48,959 --> 03:06:50,239
Confirming

3776
03:06:51,007 --> 03:06:55,103
We broke the secret documents from the FBI State Police

3777
03:06:55,359 --> 03:06:58,175
Federal Marshals 7 years ago

3778
03:06:58,943 --> 03:07:04,831
National Tires

3779
03:07:05,343 --> 03:07:07,903
The truth is we're not lying here

3780
03:07:08,159 --> 03:07:10,975
You're hoping people don't go look up he's army manual

3781
03:07:11,231 --> 03:07:13,279
You're just targeting people you think you're stupid

3782
03:07:14,559 --> 03:07:17,631
Let me give me the field will let me just give you one of the field

3783
03:07:18,143 --> 03:07:20,703
40

3784
03:07:24,543 --> 03:07:27,103
Questions

3785
03:07:31,967 --> 03:07:33,247
Put back on screen

3786
03:07:33,759 --> 03:07:36,063
3-3 9.40

3787
03:07:36,319 --> 03:07:38,111
Resettlement operation

3788
03:07:38,367 --> 03:07:44,511
February 2010-2012 the Army first

3789
03:07:46,047 --> 03:07:50,655
So that is a 10 if you may have read

3790
03:07:51,167 --> 03:07:55,007
I don't read the whole thing cuz it's 372 pages long

3791
03:07:55,263 --> 03:07:58,847
A bunch of relevant

3792
03:07:59,103 --> 03:08:00,383
I've also read

3793
03:08:00,895 --> 03:08:05,759
The things about it found the car

3794
03:08:06,271 --> 03:08:06,783
Really

3795
03:08:10,367 --> 03:08:10,879
Where are the

3796
03:08:11,647 --> 03:08:12,159
There are

3797
03:08:12,671 --> 03:08:15,487
But this

3798
03:08:15,743 --> 03:08:18,303
3-3 9.40

3799
03:08:18,559 --> 03:08:19,839
I love their more

3800
03:08:20,095 --> 03:08:21,119
Morning shows they have a great

3801
03:08:21,887 --> 03:08:24,959
Call 888 Emmanuel for operations over

3802
03:08:25,983 --> 03:08:30,591
The reason that they were pissed off that it got leaked is that now it's public information

3803
03:08:30,847 --> 03:08:32,895
People in other countries know what

3804
03:08:33,151 --> 03:08:34,943
The Army's operating

3805
03:08:35,199 --> 03:08:35,967
Procedures are

3806
03:08:36,223 --> 03:08:36,735
And there's a bunch

3807
03:08:36,991 --> 03:08:38,015
Stuff in it about

3808
03:08:38,783 --> 03:08:40,063
Essentially what it is

3809
03:08:40,575 --> 03:08:41,855
Document about best

3810
03:08:42,879 --> 03:08:43,903
Is the way I would put it

3811
03:08:44,415 --> 03:08:44,927
Ant bait

3812
03:08:45,183 --> 03:08:45,695
Describe

3813
03:08:45,951 --> 03:08:46,719
Steps

3814
03:08:47,231 --> 03:08:48,511
Native command vets

3815
03:08:48,767 --> 03:08:50,047
What's involved with taking

3816
03:08:50,815 --> 03:08:51,839
Hostile populations

3817
03:08:52,095 --> 03:08:53,119
In foreign countries

3818
03:08:54,399 --> 03:08:56,191
Cooperation from the host governments

3819
03:08:56,703 --> 03:08:58,239
522

3820
03:08:58,751 --> 03:09:00,031
Sort out

3821
03:09:00,543 --> 03:09:01,567
Huge group of people

3822
03:09:02,591 --> 03:09:03,103
Cancel

3823
03:09:03,615 --> 03:09:04,639
They're also

3824
03:09:05,151 --> 03:09:05,663
Unfortunately

3825
03:09:06,175 --> 03:09:06,687
This is why Alex

3826
03:09:06,943 --> 03:09:07,455
Freaked out

3827
03:09:08,735 --> 03:09:09,759
Couple paragraphs

3828
03:09:10,271 --> 03:09:11,551
Throughout the entire thing

3829
03:09:12,063 --> 03:09:13,599
372

3830
03:09:14,111 --> 03:09:15,391
There's a couple paragraph

3831
03:09:15,903 --> 03:09:16,671
About

3832
03:09:17,951 --> 03:09:18,719
Do you need

3833
03:09:18,975 --> 03:09:19,999
The possible need

3834
03:09:20,511 --> 03:09:22,047
For using internment

3835
03:09:22,303 --> 03:09:23,327
In the United States

3836
03:09:23,583 --> 03:09:24,095
Oh that's

3837
03:09:24,351 --> 03:09:25,119
In the event

3838
03:09:25,375 --> 03:09:26,399
Of a massive terrorist

3839
03:09:26,655 --> 03:09:27,935
Attack or

3840
03:09:29,983 --> 03:09:30,751
They're not

3841
03:09:31,263 --> 03:09:33,055
Laying the groundwork for

3842
03:09:33,311 --> 03:09:35,871
The the government coming in and interning disappear

3843
03:09:36,383 --> 03:09:37,151
Or anything like that

3844
03:09:38,431 --> 03:09:39,455
Just talkin about

3845
03:09:39,711 --> 03:09:40,991
Applications of when

3846
03:09:41,247 --> 03:09:44,319
Military operation would be appropriate Within

3847
03:09:44,575 --> 03:09:45,599
The boundaries of the United

3848
03:09:46,623 --> 03:09:48,159
Cases of mass

3849
03:09:48,415 --> 03:09:49,183
Terrorist attack

3850
03:09:50,975 --> 03:09:51,487
Like

3851
03:09:51,743 --> 03:09:52,767
The aftermath of hurricane

3852
03:09:53,023 --> 03:09:56,095
There were the need of people who are trained

3853
03:09:57,631 --> 03:09:59,167
Just say what you want about the Superdome

3854
03:09:59,423 --> 03:10:00,703
It was run very poorly

3855
03:10:00,959 --> 03:10:02,495
But that is essentially internment

3856
03:10:03,263 --> 03:10:05,823
That is managing masses of population

3857
03:10:06,335 --> 03:10:08,127
In a way they can be

3858
03:10:08,639 --> 03:10:09,407
Yume organized

3859
03:10:09,663 --> 03:10:10,431
We can be

3860
03:10:10,943 --> 03:10:11,711
Decently run

3861
03:10:11,967 --> 03:10:12,735
So it's not f******

3862
03:10:13,503 --> 03:10:15,039
Yeah absolutely cuz it would have been otherwise

3863
03:10:15,295 --> 03:10:16,575
It would have been absolute

3864
03:10:19,647 --> 03:10:20,159
Because they

3865
03:10:20,415 --> 03:10:21,695
They didn't have

3866
03:10:23,743 --> 03:10:27,071
In place wasn't there

3867
03:10:27,839 --> 03:10:29,119
The point of Hurricane Katrina

3868
03:10:33,215 --> 03:10:34,239
This is this is from

3869
03:10:35,775 --> 03:10:36,799
Pittsfield Maine

3870
03:10:37,567 --> 03:10:41,407
Bradley discusses a variety of psychological operations

3871
03:10:41,919 --> 03:10:43,199
Peruse

3872
03:10:43,711 --> 03:10:45,247
Including identifying malcontent

3873
03:10:45,503 --> 03:10:46,271
Agitators

3874
03:10:46,527 --> 03:10:47,551
And political leaders

3875
03:10:48,575 --> 03:10:49,855
Communities in order to

3876
03:10:50,111 --> 03:10:51,135
Remove or reduce

3877
03:10:51,647 --> 03:10:52,671
Antagonistic attitude

3878
03:10:53,439 --> 03:10:57,023
Passages like these reflect Lessons Learned From the operation of internment facility

3879
03:10:57,279 --> 03:10:57,791
Anorak

3880
03:10:58,047 --> 03:10:59,583
Recycle logical operations office

3881
03:11:00,095 --> 03:11:00,863
Performed in

3882
03:11:01,631 --> 03:11:02,655
Imagine caps

3883
03:11:02,911 --> 03:11:03,423
That held as many as

3884
03:11:04,447 --> 03:11:05,215
Tens of thousands of

3885
03:11:05,471 --> 03:11:06,239
Detainees at their Peak

3886
03:11:06,751 --> 03:11:10,079
At the beginning of the Iraq War even through the 2008

3887
03:11:10,335 --> 03:11:11,871
There were few guidelines and regulations

3888
03:11:12,127 --> 03:11:12,639
Help soldiers

3889
03:11:12,895 --> 03:11:13,407
Conductive mask

3890
03:11:13,919 --> 03:11:14,431
Tension operation

3891
03:11:15,199 --> 03:11:17,503
According to a former military officer who conducted

3892
03:11:17,759 --> 03:11:18,527
Detainee operations

3893
03:11:18,783 --> 03:11:19,807
Internment facility

3894
03:11:20,063 --> 03:11:20,575
Anorak

3895
03:11:20,831 --> 03:11:24,159
Quote I would have loved to have this field manual 5 years ago East

3896
03:11:24,927 --> 03:11:26,719
The vast majority of guidance in the manual is

3897
03:11:26,975 --> 03:11:27,487
Was intended for you

3898
03:11:27,743 --> 03:11:28,255
Foreign theater

3899
03:11:28,511 --> 03:11:29,023
He said

3900
03:11:29,279 --> 03:11:31,071
Noting that only a handful of paragraphs from

3901
03:11:31,327 --> 03:11:32,095
320

3902
03:11:32,351 --> 03:11:33,119
Six-speed manual

3903
03:11:33,375 --> 03:11:34,655
Address domestic operations

3904
03:11:34,911 --> 03:11:35,423
Any kind

3905
03:11:36,191 --> 03:11:36,703
An army spokesman

3906
03:11:36,959 --> 03:11:37,983
When speaking on background

3907
03:11:38,239 --> 03:11:40,287
Said that the current state of online postings

3908
03:11:40,799 --> 03:11:41,823
Passages from the manual

3909
03:11:42,079 --> 03:11:43,359
Significantly out of

3910
03:11:44,127 --> 03:11:45,919
Conflating wartime operational guide

3911
03:11:46,431 --> 03:11:47,711
Such as a psychological

3912
03:11:48,223 --> 03:11:49,503
With peacetime operation

3913
03:11:50,015 --> 03:11:53,855
In which a limited number of the manual principles would be applied in US soil

3914
03:11:54,111 --> 03:11:55,135
In exceptional cases

3915
03:11:55,647 --> 03:11:56,415
What is the relief effort

3916
03:11:57,183 --> 03:11:57,695
Such as

3917
03:11:57,951 --> 03:11:58,975
After Hurricane Katrina

3918
03:12:00,511 --> 03:12:01,279
The problem is

3919
03:12:01,535 --> 03:12:02,815
If you if you really take

3920
03:12:03,071 --> 03:12:04,607
What's that in this manual

3921
03:12:05,119 --> 03:12:05,631
It's not

3922
03:12:06,655 --> 03:12:07,935
It's not really it's

3923
03:12:08,191 --> 03:12:09,215
Certainly not a blueprint

3924
03:12:09,471 --> 03:12:10,495
For eternity

3925
03:12:11,007 --> 03:12:15,871
Right but if you are there's just enough there is of the

3926
03:12:16,127 --> 03:12:17,151
The opinion that

3927
03:12:17,919 --> 03:12:18,943
All of these

3928
03:12:19,199 --> 03:12:20,735
Disasters would be

3929
03:12:21,247 --> 03:12:24,575
Like what

3930
03:12:25,087 --> 03:12:27,391
Or and that the government would then

3931
03:12:28,671 --> 03:12:29,695
Use those as Annex

3932
03:12:31,743 --> 03:12:33,535
Yes that does sound scary

3933
03:12:33,791 --> 03:12:35,583
Problem reaction everything

3934
03:12:35,839 --> 03:12:37,375
Everything reinforce

3935
03:12:37,631 --> 03:12:38,399
This is the last

3936
03:12:38,655 --> 03:12:43,007
Yeah and I get why because we know that Alex doesn't know how to read

3937
03:12:43,263 --> 03:12:44,031
We know that

3938
03:12:44,543 --> 03:12:45,055
He

3939
03:12:45,311 --> 03:12:46,847
Doesn't know how to integrate knowledge

3940
03:12:47,103 --> 03:12:48,895
New new information into his brain

3941
03:12:49,151 --> 03:12:52,991
I definitely get why he would read something like this would be like

3942
03:12:53,247 --> 03:12:55,295
Here's the Smoking Gun we knew it all along

3943
03:12:55,807 --> 03:12:56,831
And it's not accurate

3944
03:12:57,087 --> 03:12:58,111
It's not it's not real

3945
03:12:58,623 --> 03:12:59,135
It's not true

3946
03:12:59,647 --> 03:13:01,183
I mean the thing at the document is

3947
03:13:01,439 --> 03:13:02,975
True but his interpretation

3948
03:13:05,535 --> 03:13:07,839
Really f***** up things

3949
03:13:08,095 --> 03:13:09,119
If you go through it

3950
03:13:09,375 --> 03:13:10,655
Because they're talking about

3951
03:13:10,911 --> 03:13:11,935
Wartime internment

3952
03:13:12,191 --> 03:13:13,471
Write about life

3953
03:13:13,983 --> 03:13:15,263
Binding people

3954
03:13:15,775 --> 03:13:19,615
Gagging them and stuff like that

3955
03:13:19,871 --> 03:13:22,175
But that's talking about

3956
03:13:22,943 --> 03:13:23,455
I think we're bad

3957
03:13:28,319 --> 03:13:29,087
I did not

3958
03:13:29,343 --> 03:13:30,111
Support

3959
03:13:31,647 --> 03:13:32,671
How you have to run things

3960
03:13:34,207 --> 03:13:35,487
Anyway Alex is wrong

3961
03:13:36,511 --> 03:13:37,791
And this guy is about to pee

3962
03:13:38,047 --> 03:13:38,559
Point out

3963
03:13:39,071 --> 03:13:40,095
Like what Alex does

3964
03:13:40,863 --> 03:13:41,631
And that is

3965
03:13:41,887 --> 03:13:42,399
The Cradle of something

3966
03:13:42,655 --> 03:13:43,167
True

3967
03:13:43,423 --> 03:13:43,935
And then lies about

3968
03:13:44,447 --> 03:13:45,727
Alex's response

3969
03:13:45,983 --> 03:13:46,751
Is f******

3970
03:13:47,007 --> 03:13:47,519
Perfect

3971
03:13:49,567 --> 03:13:52,127
That there's no way to get through

3972
03:13:52,895 --> 03:13:53,663
It's that Satin

3973
03:13:59,039 --> 03:13:59,807
Every time

3974
03:14:00,063 --> 03:14:02,879
You have something like that small bit of Truth

3975
03:14:07,743 --> 03:14:09,279
Is total bull

3976
03:14:09,535 --> 03:14:15,167
Just like Planned Parenthood videos were real then they were added

3977
03:14:26,431 --> 03:14:27,455
Because that make money

3978
03:14:29,759 --> 03:14:34,367
No they don't do body parts

3979
03:14:35,647 --> 03:14:37,183
Social worker

3980
03:14:38,975 --> 03:14:41,279
So Bill are you

3981
03:14:41,535 --> 03:14:42,047
Is

3982
03:14:42,559 --> 03:14:43,071
Razee

3983
03:14:43,583 --> 03:14:44,095
This next

3984
03:14:44,351 --> 03:14:45,631
Little chunk here is

3985
03:14:45,887 --> 03:14:46,399
Crazy

3986
03:14:46,911 --> 03:14:48,447
She's a social worker

3987
03:14:50,751 --> 03:14:52,799
I don't know what Alex is getting at

3988
03:14:53,055 --> 03:14:55,615
But he's really fixated as that being away

3989
03:14:56,127 --> 03:14:56,639
Discredit him

3990
03:14:57,151 --> 03:15:00,479
The Democratic Escala

3991
03:15:00,991 --> 03:15:02,527
Gotcha

3992
03:15:02,783 --> 03:15:04,831
This is what

3993
03:15:05,087 --> 03:15:07,135
People out is the quickest way

3994
03:15:07,391 --> 03:15:13,535
Describe it's about you know he has like this distrust of Psychiatry and psychology

3995
03:15:13,791 --> 03:15:15,071
Trumpet man this is weird

3996
03:15:15,327 --> 03:15:20,447
Social worker

3997
03:15:21,471 --> 03:15:23,263
That's irrelevant

3998
03:15:23,775 --> 03:15:25,055
What is your profession

3999
03:15:25,311 --> 03:15:30,687
Paradigm ruling over everything

4000
03:15:30,943 --> 03:15:37,087
Reality

4001
03:15:39,647 --> 03:15:42,975
Are you eating

4002
03:15:49,887 --> 03:15:51,935
Tell me mr. big

4003
03:15:52,191 --> 03:15:53,215
Are you

4004
03:15:53,471 --> 03:15:55,007
Have you ever been a social worker

4005
03:15:57,567 --> 03:16:00,127
So that's great

4006
03:16:03,199 --> 03:16:04,223
But you big dummy

4007
03:16:04,479 --> 03:16:09,087
Betsy validate this guy's very real

4008
03:16:09,343 --> 03:16:10,111
Argument

4009
03:16:10,367 --> 03:16:12,415
You take a kernel of Truth and then lie about it

4010
03:16:12,671 --> 03:16:13,951
Evike

4011
03:16:14,207 --> 03:16:15,743
What you're doing is you're trying to

4012
03:16:15,999 --> 03:16:16,511
To sound really

4013
03:16:16,767 --> 03:16:22,911
Smart and you're a social worker you're living in your own parallel reality

4014
03:16:23,167 --> 03:16:24,703
You're trying to Gaslight

4015
03:16:24,959 --> 03:16:25,471
Me

4016
03:16:25,727 --> 03:16:27,519
Coming from Alex Jones

4017
03:16:27,775 --> 03:16:32,895
Is the craziest things I've ever

4018
03:16:33,151 --> 03:16:34,687
Is making a very valid

4019
03:16:36,479 --> 03:16:36,991
That point

4020
03:16:37,247 --> 03:16:38,271
Is the most dangerous

4021
03:16:38,527 --> 03:16:40,063
Point for any of his listeners

4022
03:16:42,111 --> 03:16:43,391
Make them want to actually look into the

4023
03:16:43,647 --> 03:16:44,159
Thinks he's talking about

4024
03:16:44,671 --> 03:16:45,183
If

4025
03:16:45,439 --> 03:16:48,767
The argument that Alex Jones lies about the sources that he uses

4026
03:16:49,279 --> 03:16:51,839
It is introduced into the conversation

4027
03:16:52,351 --> 03:16:56,191
Then that whole you can look it up argument doesn't work right cuz then someone B

4028
03:16:56,447 --> 03:16:58,495
And that's the only thing that

4029
03:17:02,335 --> 03:17:03,615
That's going to crack it

4030
03:17:03,871 --> 03:17:04,895
So you have to fight back

4031
03:17:05,151 --> 03:17:05,663
Aggressively

4032
03:17:05,919 --> 03:17:10,527
Subject entirely social worker ring after the

4033
03:17:10,783 --> 03:17:12,319
Person as opposed to responding

4034
03:17:12,575 --> 03:17:14,879
Into the argument absolutely

4035
03:17:15,135 --> 03:17:16,159
Classic

4036
03:17:16,415 --> 03:17:22,559
Straight out of fm30 9-4 43

4037
03:17:22,815 --> 03:17:23,839
And that was

4038
03:17:24,095 --> 03:17:24,607
Declassified

4039
03:17:24,863 --> 03:17:26,655
Where in the government says

4040
03:17:28,191 --> 03:17:34,335
What are you do that was that secret

4041
03:17:35,359 --> 03:17:35,871
I'm sure what

4042
03:17:36,127 --> 03:17:38,943
He spells it out as much

4043
03:17:40,479 --> 03:17:41,503
In the end of its life

4044
03:17:41,759 --> 03:17:43,551
Augie's says basically

4045
03:17:43,807 --> 03:17:44,831
Where You Are

4046
03:17:45,087 --> 03:17:46,367
Just trying to

4047
03:17:46,623 --> 03:17:48,927
Make my audio you're trying to lie to my audience

4048
03:17:49,183 --> 03:17:51,487
And it is just a knee-jerk

4049
03:17:51,743 --> 03:17:53,023
Reactionary defense

4050
03:17:53,279 --> 03:17:54,559
Mechanism

4051
03:17:57,119 --> 03:17:57,887
Why doesn't

4052
03:17:59,167 --> 03:18:00,703
Where does he feel like

4053
03:18:00,959 --> 03:18:01,471
By saying money

4054
03:18:01,727 --> 03:18:02,239
That was it

4055
03:18:03,007 --> 03:18:04,543
Give me the plant

4056
03:18:04,799 --> 03:18:05,311
Cuz he's dumb

4057
03:18:06,079 --> 03:18:11,967
Like he says I mean of course he says that he wants to debate

4058
03:18:12,735 --> 03:18:13,503
But you just

4059
03:18:13,759 --> 03:18:14,271
Cannot be

4060
03:18:15,039 --> 03:18:16,063
No but I actually think

4061
03:18:16,319 --> 03:18:16,831
Take that

4062
03:18:17,087 --> 03:18:17,599
He think

4063
03:18:18,367 --> 03:18:19,903
That Planned Parenthood

4064
03:18:20,159 --> 03:18:21,183
Killing also

4065
03:18:21,695 --> 03:18:23,487
Okay I think that is a piece of it

4066
03:18:25,791 --> 03:18:26,559
Any sense

4067
03:18:27,071 --> 03:18:27,839
No

4068
03:18:28,095 --> 03:18:31,167
No is making a killing

4069
03:18:37,311 --> 03:18:38,847
The scam they're going to make up that

4070
03:18:39,103 --> 03:18:42,431
They're going to make up that slack to his argument would be that the globalist

4071
03:18:42,687 --> 03:18:44,223
Spiritual power based on the

4072
03:18:44,479 --> 03:18:45,503
The killing of all these

4073
03:18:45,759 --> 03:18:51,903
And the Satanist that magically appeared any anti-abortion

4074
03:18:54,719 --> 03:18:55,999
Planned Parenthood

4075
03:18:56,255 --> 03:18:57,023
Is just making money

4076
03:19:01,631 --> 03:19:02,655
Anyway

4077
03:19:03,167 --> 03:19:04,447
So you're not a government worker

4078
03:19:07,007 --> 03:19:08,543
I'm interested what is your profession

4079
03:19:09,823 --> 03:19:10,847
Weather

4080
03:19:11,871 --> 03:19:13,919
Because I just wonder how stupid you can be

4081
03:19:15,967 --> 03:19:22,111
And usually it's ends up being one

4082
03:19:27,743 --> 03:19:32,863
Social security number

4083
03:19:33,119 --> 03:19:33,887
And family

4084
03:19:34,143 --> 03:19:35,167
Footage

4085
03:19:35,423 --> 03:19:36,447
Myself shot

4086
03:19:36,959 --> 03:19:43,103
People screaming I'm an American don't put me in the camp

4087
03:19:43,359 --> 03:19:45,151
And the police

4088
03:19:45,663 --> 03:19:48,223
Those videos that he has or not

4089
03:19:48,735 --> 03:19:51,039
They're people who believe is narrative

4090
03:19:51,551 --> 03:19:57,695
That's not that's just people

4091
03:19:57,951 --> 03:20:00,767
And then also the next thing he's going to say

4092
03:20:01,023 --> 03:20:02,303
Is about this Sheriff

4093
03:20:03,327 --> 03:20:05,375
From Spokane

4094
03:20:07,423 --> 03:20:08,447
A lot of armor

4095
03:20:08,959 --> 03:20:09,727
Vehicles

4096
03:20:09,983 --> 03:20:10,495
What have you

4097
03:20:12,543 --> 03:20:13,823
Concerned about is Constitution

4098
03:20:14,335 --> 03:20:16,127
Yeah

4099
03:20:18,687 --> 03:20:19,711
To mean they're coming

4100
03:20:22,271 --> 03:20:23,551
When he's arguing

4101
03:20:23,807 --> 03:20:26,879
With this guy who's accusing him of taking Turtles

4102
03:20:27,135 --> 03:20:28,415
He's doing exactly that

4103
03:20:28,927 --> 03:20:29,439
It's fascinating

4104
03:20:29,951 --> 03:20:30,463
But also

4105
03:20:30,719 --> 03:20:31,999
It's just turn off new list

4106
03:20:35,071 --> 03:20:36,095
What do lifters

4107
03:20:36,351 --> 03:20:39,935
I don't know but if you are a new listener

4108
03:20:40,447 --> 03:20:44,031
This happens all the amount of course the globalist want

4109
03:20:44,287 --> 03:20:50,431
These people called in these these social workers who won't admit that their social workers

4110
03:20:54,783 --> 03:20:56,319
And get some more of them here in a minute

4111
03:20:56,575 --> 03:20:59,903
Are for the American people

4112
03:21:06,815 --> 03:21:09,375
Vehicles are farosh

4113
03:21:09,631 --> 03:21:11,423
What does that mean jackass

4114
03:21:14,495 --> 03:21:17,311
You are a stubborn

4115
03:21:17,567 --> 03:21:23,711
In the Bible

4116
03:21:30,111 --> 03:21:31,391
I don't have time for you

4117
03:21:31,903 --> 03:21:33,439
Grapes

4118
03:21:39,839 --> 03:21:44,703
It's a defense mechanism and

4119
03:21:45,727 --> 03:21:51,871
Things to tell me

4120
03:21:53,663 --> 03:21:55,967
Was it the former producer of Nightline

4121
03:21:56,223 --> 03:21:58,527
Wasn't the former NSA officer

4122
03:21:58,783 --> 03:22:01,855
And you don't have to believe everything

4123
03:22:04,159 --> 03:22:08,767
He is real mad

4124
03:22:09,023 --> 03:22:14,143
If you don't understand that there's something deeply wrong with most things that we are told

4125
03:22:14,399 --> 03:22:20,543
Senior Living in a fog of your own illusion okay

4126
03:22:23,871 --> 03:22:26,175
Just puts out this

4127
03:22:26,431 --> 03:22:29,247
I still think she's a social worker just from the way he was speaking

4128
03:22:29,503 --> 03:22:35,647
Answer the question cuz you don't want to say yes he rather stay.

4129
03:22:37,695 --> 03:22:41,279
August Wireless self-satisfied

4130
03:22:47,935 --> 03:22:54,079
Father mother

4131
03:22:57,663 --> 03:23:03,807
Drake

4132
03:23:04,063 --> 03:23:05,599
A giant crab

4133
03:23:06,111 --> 03:23:07,391
You people produce

4134
03:23:07,903 --> 03:23:10,975
You know what and we're sick of you we want to be led by you

4135
03:23:11,231 --> 03:23:14,303
We don't like you

4136
03:23:17,631 --> 03:23:23,007
America's throwing people like Ross ulbricht in jail for starting a Westside Wild

4137
03:23:23,263 --> 03:23:27,615
And and giving him a harsher sentence than people who have killed multiple people

4138
03:23:27,871 --> 03:23:31,455
That's the guy that the Silk Road

4139
03:23:36,063 --> 03:23:42,207
When you're the largest history

4140
03:23:44,255 --> 03:23:45,791
I don't agree with drug laws

4141
03:23:47,583 --> 03:23:51,423
He also tried to get

4142
03:23:51,679 --> 03:23:56,543
Silk Road was

4143
03:23:57,823 --> 03:23:58,591
Paperboy

4144
03:23:59,359 --> 03:24:03,967
Raped multiple people of Oppression and control in America

4145
03:24:04,223 --> 03:24:10,367
Scared of Independence

4146
03:24:19,583 --> 03:24:22,143
Because someone said something political

4147
