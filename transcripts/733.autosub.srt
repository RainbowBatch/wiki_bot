1
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:21,248
Damned important

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
We are the bad guy

4
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Need

5
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

6
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,536
The altar of saline and talk a little bit about

7
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,936
Alex Jones

8
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:15,264
My Brightspot Jordan spoiler alert

9
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,896
Extreme Rules WWE pay-per-view

10
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,432
It was fine

11
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,224
Fine

12
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,760
And then at the end

13
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
I got it

14
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,576
Lights went out okay

15
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:32,672
He's got the whole world

16
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:38,048
Everywhere

17
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,072
Very exciting

18
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
Scott is Lantern

19
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,376
He's doing the whole thing

20
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:49,312
I don't know I wouldn't say it didn't look exactly like he was back to swamp hillbilly Hawaiian shirt Brea

21
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
Gotcha okay

22
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,872
And I think today would be

23
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:52,896
Take to go back to

24
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,688
I think the Hawaiian shirt is always at

25
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
Personally I think that

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,112
He has grown past that stage that character is coming to gone and evolved into the fiend

27
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,184
Right + Erick Rowan

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,048
One of his guys isn't there anymore and Luke Harper the other guy who was in his

29
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,072
Wyatt Family

30
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,912
His now passed away yeah and so it would be

31
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,936
Kind of tough

32
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,216
To recapture

33
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,032
Some of what the Wyatt family was

34
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,312
I think it wouldn't be worth to

35
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,152
We going back to that but I also think going back to the fiend thing

36
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,736
Might be a mistake at this point too so I'm glad that he had his mask

37
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
Right

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,528
I am so like

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,808
It's not

40
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,392
I don't think it's going to be horror supervillain anything but

41
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
I'm so excited

42
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
Did you see your back

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,768
I don't even watch wrestling that much and I'm very excited for him

44
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,304
He's a he's a

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,424
There's something about that Bray Wyatt fella it is it is really interesting because we've talked about him

46
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,728
Extensively despite the fact that I never watch

47
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:55,104
Wrestling interested in the character was interesting is that it seems like

48
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,408
That's a character that is great

49
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
For wrestling that they really don't know how to make

50
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,760
Work you know they're like

51
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,040
This character is great

52
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:09,440
Let's try putting him places and then I got all know that's not where it goes like the Undertaker

53
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,720
This guy who's

54
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
Supernatural powers

55
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:18,912
Right kind of busy come back from the dead repeatedly kind of

56
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:23,008
It's fine don't worry about it

57
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,776
Far

58
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,848
With some of the Bray Wyatt stuff

59
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,152
That's true that's okay

60
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:35,808
Immoral sister powers

61
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:39,136
Like Firefly fun house thing I think it's

62
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
Fine because

63
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,696
If you really think about

64
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,976
Bray Wyatt

65
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:48,864
He had a superpower when he was a swamp hillbilly called later and that was largely manipulation

66
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,192
You was really good at manipulating people which is

67
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,240
Is the human superpower that people can have

68
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:58,080
You cannot see the the purerb

69
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,384
Bug eyes of delight that huh

70
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,456
You can see

71
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,856
Going into people's heads extension of that already.

72
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,928
Power

73
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,976
They're like the battle within their mind

74
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,047
Is kind of an artistic expression of what

75
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,887
The person is going through wow they're being manipulated or whatever

76
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,471
You could see that being okay sure

77
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,751
Once you've got like

78
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,335
Indestructibility

79
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,199
Your presence in a fighting League

80
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,623
The cruel The crucial part of a fighting league is the possibility of lost right so I hope I hope

81
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
Interesting will happen

82
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
Some face

83
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
And fingers crossed

84
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
What's a yurt

85
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,839
My bright spot is dead

86
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,447
I know it is that

87
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,727
Rcap

88
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
Garbage

89
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:04,383
Garbage couch we've had it's been torn up it's time to get rid of the couch

90
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711

91
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
Little bit

92
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,783

00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:31,775

Long beam man it's the size of your couch Tire bean bag

Multiple people can sleep on in the whole thing

103
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
Incredible

104
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,575

107
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975

108
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999

Okay.

That sounds really cool I mean like I don't think I have any negative memories of your couch

115
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,687
That sounds like a

116
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
Still an upgrade

117
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,735
Call man

118
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,551

119
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,087
Evangelize for bean bag

120
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,695
I'm not talking about any brand I don't want anybody to go buy a bean bag I mean

121
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,023
If you got 8 ft of something that you can fit bean bags in

122
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
And you get a couch

123
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
Mandy

124
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,983
Do your ears angeleyes in for the idea of it like like those commercials you'd see for milk

125
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:41,151
It's not a brand of milk

126
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,527
So Jordan today we got an episode to go over

127
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
About

128
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
October 6th

129
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,463
2022 that is Thursday of last week that closing arguments were happening and the jury began

130
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
Right

131
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
Deliberation I guess

132
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,071
Although I got most of that was

133
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
What's Friday

134
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
They will be back

135
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,471
In session on Tuesday and I would be surprised

136
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
Like we didn't have a verdict

137
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,799
Damages

138
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
Claim

139
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,343
I said it and it didn't feel right in a criminal trial

140
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,463
Resume that comes down on Friday

141
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,511
The end of the day on Friday

142
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:33,119
They were asking the jury had a question for the judge was

143
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,703
Is there a reason that Lafferty's name is first

144
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,567
Among the plaintiff it's Lafferty at all Verizon

145
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,639
That to me the reason you would ask that

146
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
Is

147
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,015
To figure out if some people should get more than

148
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,087
Spreading It Out Among the people or if it's equal

149
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,415
And to be that kind of has the indication of like pretty

150
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:03,071
Yeah if they're if they're like wait so if Lafferty's the first name does that mean that we should get Lafferty

151
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:11,007
You know like should laugh pretty good little bit of an extra jump that's how I read it yeah that seems about right that's the truth another

152
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,055
Other way to interpret it there might be but

153
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
It feels like

154
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,103
Tuesday's probably

155
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,175
Yeah I would be I mean I would I would say that

156
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,479

158
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:29,439
We'll see about that but it's interesting to see how I was doing on the day

159
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
Day of the closing

160
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487

Jordan before we get into this episode here is a little out of context drop

186
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
Sahbabii

187
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,759
Liberal

188
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,831
That's that's you know what word has turned into something

189
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:39,231
Without meeting whatever you're just saying it like that

190
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:45,631
In that context yeah it's it's Alex it's a sort of like get her done

191
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,447
Meaningless phrase

192
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:53,823
Start off here and Alex is really big into the nuclear war

193
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,407
Discussion and so that kind of kind of

194
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
The beginning

195
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,223
The US government is coming out here

196
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,759
I've been secretly buying

197
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
Potassium iodide pills

198
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
We're not just people in Europe

199
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,671
Not just the troops in Europe. Just the CIA

200
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,231
Boys

201
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,559
And it's also come out last week to federal employees

202
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,119
Emergency evacuation plan

203
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,167
Too deep underground bases

204
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,983
Happy wow

205
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,287
Everywhere that billionaires

206
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
Are already moving into their bunkers

207
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
In the southern hemisphere

208
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
Can I that in depth

209
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,735
Discussions with not one not

210
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
Well-known billionaire

211
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,343
About when do they sing

212
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
They should relocate

213
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,647
Hemisphere

214
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
Is that a good idea

215
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,303
They said well are you going to relocate

216
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
Shmoney

217
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
I have a

218
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
A trailer

219
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
4

220
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
On their Ranch

221
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
Has been our

222
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
Beautiful Turtle Lake everything else

223
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
I will just go there and probably die

224
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
During all this

225
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:09,087
Parents buy a trailer in 1820

226
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:15,487
No it's it's from like a land-grant not the trailer no no no

227
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:20,351
Antique trailer

228
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:27,007
So the idea the Billionaire's is ridiculous on its face

229
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,055
Even the little complaint about of course

230
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
Stinky has more money than he does

231
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:36,223
There's a kernel of Truth to the story that Alex is telling about the US government buying a bunch of pills

232
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
The treat radiation poison

233
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,551
But he's just way off of

234
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,575
He's telling the story wrong

235
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,439
This is about a recent 290 million-dollar purchase of a drug called nplate

236
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,791
Text Will Go On to say

237
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327
And such but Alex is really a

238
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,375
Details guys up

239
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:59,007
This is not the first time that the government to Administration for strategic preparedness and response is purchase

240
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
Just such medication

241
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:05,151
But it is the first time with nplate mostly because he was only approved for this purpose

242
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,431
In 2021

243
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:13,087
This is the end result of financing the HHS began in 2019 on this drug and it serves a purpose in this

244
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
Strategic National stockpile

245
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,719
But it apparently isn't that great of a drug to respond to nuclear attack

246
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,767
Predominantly because it needs to be used

247
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,815
Fairly quickly after exposure

248
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
To be effective

249
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,143
So it's like a city was new to this wouldn't really

250
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,543
Useful to difficult situation

251
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,359
Jason Whittaker then you could do that and then on

252
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Upon the completion

253
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
Alicia newadvent ache

254
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,479
The drug I would assume that that would be a very helpful Eureka

255
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:47,647
This is not a strong indicator that we are more or less likely to be involved in a nuclear confrontation

256
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,951
This is Alex's big Naruto

257
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:56,863
Kuva diseased onto the backburner where patli Millions people are being killed by the vaccine all the time and there's a new bombshell

258
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
Everyday but

259
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,447
This isn't really Varsity storyline but

260
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,471
Material anymore

261
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,799
The audience's kind of burned out on this I think I mean

262
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
The first

263
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,943
Few weeks of the millions and billions of people dying everyday you're like this is big news

264
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,271
Then after you've seen suppose mathematically

265
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:19,647
2.3 billion people died in the past two months you know you're like Wyatt Alex continue to talk about the story

266
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
Bora Bora

267
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,743
For Alex's audience to believe that any of the stuff that he saying

268
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:30,143
Is true there have to be bodies piled up everywhere everywhere we would have to be

269
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,727
Bring out your dead level like yeah

270
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:39,359
He can only lie about his trial so much before it turns into Lenny Bruce and the prospect of nuclear war is

271
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,663
It's exactly the kind of thing that will keep the audience

272
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,199
Just the right kind of scared

273
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:47,039
This weekend expected any headline that even halfway sounds like a good

274
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,087
Possibly point to Russian nuke in the US

275
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,159
Is going to be covered as proof that that's just around the corner

276
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,743
It's a pretty sweet deal to because when Alex makes mistakes

277
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
That severe

278
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
It's really easy for him to

279
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,607
Skewer his obvious support for Putin

280
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
Yeah

281
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:09,055
Call Blake

282
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,383
All over the place just win win win

283
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,663
I do appreciate

284
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,199
I do appreciate that

285
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,527
Where were talking about a guy who's who's like

286
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,903
A an inveterate Kahneman and salesman and and liar and all the stuff and it's like

287
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:29,791
When you're talking about nuclear war and billionaires and yet you're still adding that like

288
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
Old-timer

289
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351
I talked to not one

290
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
Not too

291
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,399
That's right

292
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:40,799
3 billionaires about evacuating from their home you know any like okay Jesus Christ This is

293
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:46,687
Going to also

294
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,455
It's

295
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
Snake oil

296
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
Who are they

297
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,319
I think he wants us to think one

298
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Elon Musk

299
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Right

300
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
Right I think.

301
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,719
Well yeah that makes sense cuz he's a piece of s***

302
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,511
Yeah and slogans

303
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
No

304
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
I mean

305
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
Not yet

306
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
I guess

307
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,887
Probably Michael Jordan

308
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,215
Okay Jordan is huge evacuation sure

309
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,663
No Bezos doesn't talk to any but I think Bezos is a robot

310
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,479
You going to be safest place he knows

311
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:27,135
All them go to space I go to South America

312
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
Testosterone

313
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,719
You need it Manliness

314
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,887
Record low testosterone

315
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
22

316
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,007
A twenty-year-old man

317
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,591
Has the testosterone of a sixty-year-old man in the 19th

318
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,943
A 40-year old man old man

319
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,759
They are putting chemicals in the food

320
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
Everywhere else

321
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
Totally

322
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
Destroy

323
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,111
Masculinity ladies

324
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
And that's just

325
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
How it works

326
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
Testosterone turns on yourself

327
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,743
Everything on

328
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,583
They're doing everything they can to try to block natural

329
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
Testosterone

330
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
Replacement

331
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,167
Systems that are out

332
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,447
So many great

333
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,311
We have super male vitality

334
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
Volkswagen stock

335
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,455
Smooth like there was a problem

336
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,015
Write that incidents nationally-known

337
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,575
And then for some reason he just hasn't solution

338
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,135
It's so nice

339
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,975
Tucker is being made fun of other reasons

340
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
Chat for talking

341
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,047
King about testosterone levels

342
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
Decrease

343
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,095
It's more like a

344
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,143
The ridiculous

345
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,167
Mannfolk

346
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,983
Is promoting

347
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,519
So that that's one thing

348
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,359
Testosterone levels

349
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
Have decreased

350
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,199
Somewhat According to some studies

351
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,479
Although there is

352
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:00,319
Also some arguments that can be made that these studies are a little bit like

353
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:05,695
Not not as precise as you would want them

354
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,719
Highly

355
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,023
Let me let me throw this out at you

356
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:15,167
Here's my here's my explanation for it doesn't require any kind of like

357
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
Chemicals in the water and

358
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,823
If we're going to say that men in that time. I had more

359
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,359
Testosterone than we do now

360
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,895
Is it not also pops

361
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,711
Seeing as how we know that I had an overabundance

362
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759
The testosterone leads to aggressive behavior

363
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,831
That all those Wars we had for a good long while

364
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:39,231
Got all those testosteroni men like the most testosterone

365
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
F******

366
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Species

367
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:44,095
We have lost testosterone because of their dumb War

368
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:51,007
How about that some of that's possible other things people point to our increased levels of obesity

369
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:57,407
More sense than mine but I think I think mine's still pretty good yeah you have an interesting bottleneck kind of Arc

370
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
I don't know

371
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
Anyway

372
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,063
That was as smooth as a sales pictures I've ever seen out

373
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
I was just with nailed it

374
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,927
So we got a story about

375
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,231
Person who died

376
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,767
Of course

377
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,559
It's got to be covid related

378
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,863
What is this lady CDs everyday

379
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,519
Player has family says beloved daughter

380
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
Will be sadly missed

381
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
Gene

382
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,895
The log on the plate at Shane's

383
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
Ladies game

384
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,735
Football club passed away from a massive heart attack

385
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,271
But I won't even talk

386
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
About

387
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,063
The fact that she was asked

388
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
Beautiful

389
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
Healthy

390
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,183
Have a great time

391
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,839
That's the evil will

392
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:53,215
The New World Order Waterford GAA morning and timely passing of young

393
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,775
She's dead now

394
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,103
Beautiful young lady

395
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
I'm so much fun out there

396
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
Daughter Charlotte

397
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,199
Block Charles

398
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,599
Leash is a little disrespectful

399
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,671
So this is an article from the Sun that Alex's reading

400
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:18,559
Nowhere in the story does it say what This Woman's cause of death was nor even how she died

401
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
All it says is it was quote

402
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,375
Due to illness

403
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,935
Is a pretty broad category that's a big one

404
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:28,543
The article quotes a Facebook post as saying that she had a brief illness 08

405
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,591
Probably not something that was chronic

406
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:36,479
Memorial page there's a link where you can donate to a meningitis research organization

407
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:42,623
This doesn't mean that you contracted a severe case of meningitis but that is a distinct possibility given these

408
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,903
Cedar Point

409
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,951
Anyway there's no indication that the

410
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:52,351
This woman was vaccinated North at her passing it anything to do with a vaccination or a massive heart attack

411
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
Doesn't matter

412
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
Alex

413
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:59,519
For him every dead young person is a perfect prop to use as proof of his conspiracy

414
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:04,639
And this has the effect of encouraging harassment of people who knew these tragically deceased youths

415
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:09,247
The entire narrative is dumb baseless and has the potential to hurt people so it's

416
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,039
Write up Alex's

417
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,599
Because it's easy and it allows him to make s*** up

418
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
Instead of doing any work

419
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,391
Right

420
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:19,488
Especially considering if you stop and think about what he's trying to argue

421
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,120
So let's say it's over this is Gaelic football clubs in the sun I assume this is an Ireland

422
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
Okay

423
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,960
So in Ireland the vaccination rates are like

424
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
98 /

425
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,288
So that means that

426
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
If you go through this

427
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,080
Statistics

428
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:38,432
There are more than one young person dying in a year

429
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:43,040
So there's like let's say there's a thousand young people who die in a year in Ireland

430
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,088
98% of them

431
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
You have to then say well

432
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,648
It's covid

433
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:53,024
All right the vaccine or anything because they're all vaccinated yeah yeah that is

434
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,072
Yeah

435
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:01,728
I think is really interesting that you can note there is that the article doesn't say anything about heart

436
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,264
That is not

437
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
Navigation

438
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,080
But she is a football

439
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:10,176
Soccer player and this is the go-to for Alex

440
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:14,528
Brian the right-wing media their talking points are all about like these soccer players having heart attacks

441
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,600
Use that almost

442
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,160
Instinctually

443
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,952
Need York say was a heart attack

444
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,536
He's just he's making s*** up about a tragically

445
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,328
Past young woman

446
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,632
I'm making making her a prophet

447
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,216
And it's unfortunate how is it's like

448
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,800
It's both so easy and so transparent why they're doing it

449
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,592
You know like obviously

450
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,152
Look this young person athlete

451
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,456
Above-average shape

452
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:49,856
In the prime of her her growth like all of those things it's so if even that can happen

453
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,904
You know that it must be that

454
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
Kind of

455
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,768
To see those details like young person athlete

456
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:00,096
And think like it's not right that their dad totally

457
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,240
Excuse and an explanation for why

458
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,776
This thing happened but

459
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,848
It's just your own made-up explanation to see if you're on purpose

460
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,152
Even though it and even that it's like

461
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,944
UE you know this is

462
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,504
So clearly chosen for the narrator

463
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:18,784
Yes

464
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
So clear

465
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,880
So this next clip Alex gets into some dumb s***

466
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:29,792
I titled this clip the blood of the jab because Alex says that and I thought it was very poetic

467
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,096
Here's a big

468
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
Enchilada

469
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,424
Infowars.com heading

470
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,216
Nevada live show feed

471
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
Broadcast

472
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,080
What does a peer-reviewed study

473
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,384
1060

474
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,832
100% of these showed alterations

475
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,136
To their blood post-injection

476
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,184
This is not normal

477
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,584
And not have us being like a video game where like

478
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
You don't know him

479
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,192
A lot of the jabber that.

480
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:13,824
Deep within Skyrim

481
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
This isn't new

482
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:22,528
I found a blog post about this narrative from September around last

483
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,904
There's a blog post about this on Sgt report

484
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,488
Use that to see where the underlying information on this was coming

485
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
Coming from

486
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,280
This blog claim

487
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,840
Quote three surgeons from Italy conducted

488
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,144
The study which found that nearly everyone who gets

489
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,216
Quote of vaccinated for the Wuhan Coronavirus

490
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:44,544
Parentheses covid-19

491
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,640
With mRNA injections ends up developing tainted blood

492
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,480
So far we're a little off from Alex's initial statement

493
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
They are

494
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,296
Claiming that this is peer-reviewed but

495
00:24:55,552 --> 00:25:01,696
It's definitely the same thing Alex's talking about because it includes the 1006 people in the study right and the 94%

496
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,720
Number is there too

497
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,768
In the first paragraph

498
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:09,632
About the Italian surgeons alleged study there's a hyperlink on the words found that

499
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,960
Which takes you to an article on a Blog called 100%

500
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,008
Set up with the headliner

501
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Quote

502
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,872
Teacher arrested and jailed for refusing to use students preferred pronoun

503
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,664
Okay

504
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,784
Like if they just copy and pasted the wrong link but this has nothing to do with the covid vaccine story

505
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:33,184
You know you got multiple tabs open you think you got one on your clipboard and you accidentally

506
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,584
I kind of suspect that it's just like to have a hyperlink

507
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:47,008
The blog post itself is a reposting of an article on DC clothesline so I followed that linked to

508
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,288
Do an article titled quote

509
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,944
Study 94% of mRNA job recipients found to have metal like objects in their blood

510
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,296
We've laundered from

511
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:03,136
Metal like definitely not computer chip devices in their blood

512
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:06,464
To now it's just tainted blood

513
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,864
Wild but Alex didn't lead with that metal like objects

514
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,496
DC clothesline article is just a repost of an article from natural news

515
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:22,336
The site run by Mike Adams the health Ranger one of Alex's good buddy

516
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,640
And now we've essentially come full circle

517
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:28,992
Receive the lifecycle of this b*******

518
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:29,760
That is

519
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,320
Oh my God that's that's like

520
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:35,648
Sacred geometry like movement in minutes

521
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,184
F******

522
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
Honey bee

523
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:45,120
Bulshit shape of life

524
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:50,752
Travel all the way around back

525
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,776
Natural news

526
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:58,432
The DC clothesline article actually has the same words hyperlinked in the first paragraph and these also

527
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:02,272
Go to vapor and phobic article about a teacher not liking thrown out so they just got paid

528
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:08,672
Mistake happened early on no one caught it and it was just copy all these websites

529
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,512
No quality assurance or even a second thought given

530
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,608
It took a while but I traced down the study and question

531
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:21,216
Published in the international Journal of vaccine theory practice and research

532
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:27,616
The journal claims they only published peer-reviewed stuff but if you consult their page on what it means to them

533
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:31,712
That just means that their editors get submission to once-over before they popped

534
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,504
What's that right there your peers

535
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,904
Review don't mean the same thing to them is because of your

536
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,024
Appears that they are your pecker review and therefore if they review it

537
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,816
Beyond that it's just a Luna

538
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,096
Take anti-vax fraud

539
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:54,752
They're tender Jeep is a man named John Oliver a linguist who's been a big proponent of the discredited vaccines cause

540
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,776
Is autism.

541
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:00,128
In fact Andrew Wakefield himself wrote the forward for all ours book

542
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:04,224
Their board also includes multiple members of the Children's Health

543
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,784
Defense which is just another anti-vax fraud

544
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:13,440
This includes that group's general counsel Mary as Holland and their Chief scientific officer Brian as hooker

545
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,744
A guy named Daniel Brody

546
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,768
Is also on the board

547
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,352
His most recent published paper is titled quote

548
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:25,472
The covid-19 concoction a recipe for successful psychological operation

549
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:29,056
Interesting that's that pure review. I'm sure

550
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,592
He's also apparently a linguist

551
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:35,968
A closer look reveals that pretty much all of the board members are anti-vax actor

552
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,832
And almost all of them have a history of pushing the fraudulent connection between vaccines and autism

553
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,744
The journal is only existed since July 2020 and their second issue was dedicated wholly to covid-19

554
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:52,096
With it includes an article by the editor-in-chief titled quote

555
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,400
Buying and selling with the mark of the beast

556
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,704
This is not a journal to be taken

557
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
Seriously

558
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,288
It's a frock propped up by anti-vax activist

559
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,848
Looking to create a legitimate looking

560
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,944
Facade to capitalize on covid fears and Rising anti-vax sentiment

561
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
Among the right way

562
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:12,320
Anyway that's the source or Alex that that's what he's laundering but

563
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,368
He's not even on time with this one

564
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:20,768
Hi besties reporting a bombshell story about an alleged study in a bulshit anti-vax journal Atlas

565
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
A month late

566
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,584
So

567
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,864
That's the big enchilada

568
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,656
You know here's a here's my pitch

569
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
Alright

570
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,240
When I become god-king and like

571
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008
Few weeks

572
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
Right Nacho

573
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:44,576
Happening again

574
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:51,744
For what I was referencing is he said in a Tucker Carlson interview like

575
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,536
He is going to be bred

576
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:02,752
If I become present I'm going to become president

577
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:09,152
That's the type of Psychopathic Comfort if you need to become president in a certain way

578
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
So

579
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,248
Country

580
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,296
Countrywide rule National rule

581
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,088
When you name things

582
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,392
It has to sound kind of like what it is

583
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:25,536
So you know like so we've got like the APA American Psychological Association

584
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,560
You know what that is

585
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,096
Is you get it you understand that

586
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,376
Association of

587
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,936
Psychologists in America

588
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,752
But if you're like the American vaccine Association

589
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,800
And you're one of these dudes

590
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,080
You can't name your shift

591
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,616
You don't get to name it that

592
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:44,224
Like that's my my head that just makes so much sense of his likeness

593
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:50,880
Yeah crisis center where that the anti-abortion pregnancy

594
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,160
Dissenters were the Lego

595
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:57,792
Will teach you what to do when they spray you know what it's like no you shouldn't be able to name yourself anything that sounds

596
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:05,216
Right right like that's your name

597
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:11,616
Like a Greenland Iceland you don't want it like some City in the middle of Illinois to be able to advertise

598
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:18,784
Paradise Prado Illinois

599
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,856
Trying to incorporate a town called Paris

600
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:25,440
Blackhawk helicopters dropped down from the sky

601
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:30,048
That's what we're talkin about look forward to that under Jordan's rule

602
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,864
So Alex plays

603
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,168
Clip of John McAfee

604
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,520
Talking about power

605
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,800
Haha

606
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,824

607
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,152

Power

609
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:50,528
The negative parts inside you they're the ones that need power to be expressed love just

610
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,576
Close

611
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
Right

612
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,416
Yes sir Alex

613
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,464
Gets up in his head about how like

614
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,560
The audience has given him power he loves them and respect yourself

615
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,608
I'm very respectful

616
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,656
The incredible power

617
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,960
But you have given me and I

618
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,240
Thank you for the bottom

00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,264

A lot about who I am

626
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,016
Because they know

Cruises contagious

628
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,856

Affiliate

631

Videos

635
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,192
The human it's very

636
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,520
All right ladies and Gentlemen let's look at the main threat

637
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,848
World War 3

638
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,896
And a proxy war

639
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
Control

640
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,760
Are some of the headlines

641
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,832
Polling suggests one Guardian

642
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,160
U.s. hosting nuclear weapons amid growing fears

643
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,976
They suggest

644
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,864
I'm sorry what

645
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,216
Of course that's going on

646
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,056
I know all this for my contacts

647
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,104
I also just know us

648
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,992
List of all the Soviet Union

649
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,552
But now they're ready they're poised

650
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,320
There ain't

651
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,136
The triggers are lies

652
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,464
What is a nice collection

653
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,352
I was just making all this up what an insane series of words he's also pretending that this headline

654
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:45,472
It means that Poland is suggesting that they have nuclear weapons there

655
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:49,824
Where is the actual story is that they requested nuclear weapons be moved there

656
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,432
Conveniently didn't read the sub-headline of this story from the guardian

657
00:33:55,456 --> 00:34:01,600
Request is widely seen as symbolic as moving nuclear warheads closer to Russia would make them less militarily

658
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,368
Useful

659
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,976
Also this article is about to Poland's president making this request

660
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,024
Of the United States but includes this sentence

661
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:12,864
The White House has said it had not received such a request

662
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,680
Maybe

663
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,240
Like the article says symbolic

664
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:21,568
So the Poland guys like hey

665
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,432
You know it be nice cuz this guy is a f****** crazy dude over here at me maybe if we had some nuke

666
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,504
We be fine and everybody's like we're not actually going to put them there but

667
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,784
We get what you're trying to say man

668
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,808
That guy's going to shoot

669
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,904
Like Alex's sort of

670
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:40,768
Do you know his where his bread is buttered right now with the nuclear war fears right

671
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:47,168
It becomes like everything is not only a misrepresentation of the headline

672
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,960
A hat on top of it

673
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,520
Yeah I know the situation that Poland is

674
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,056
Boras like

675
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,360
I gas station robbery where

676
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,432
It's just it's just the United States and Poland in the guys like

677
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,736
With his eyes are kind of pointing back

678
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,600
And I like that kind of think that's where we're at

679
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,392
That seems about right

680
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,976
So who's going to be a nuke probably maybe

681
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:17,376
Maybe a false flag maybe it'll be dirty

682
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,144
Drugs

683
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,984
For using nuclear emergency and they're running nuclear emergency ad

684
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,032
In New York and Denver

685
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,616
And high-level federal employees is in the news

686
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,176
I got to stop here

687
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,736
What is a nuclear emergency ad

688
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:36,832
It's an ad for nuclear emergency

689
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,880
I don't know what he's talking about

690
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,672
Bug-out directions

691
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,952
Bug out backpack

692
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,000
Where do Escape 2

693
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,304
In the event of War

694
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:50,912
90 million + Aunty radiation drug for using nuclear

695
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,960
Emergency

696
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,008
Nuclear war

697
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:59,616
Think the levels might release a dirty mom or maybe a low-yield nuclear weapon claim Russian

698
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,456
We're in the age of War the angel false flag

699
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,504
Yeah so now let's just imagine

700
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,528
Scenario

701
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,832
But I think is unlikely but let's imagine

702
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:12,416
A nuclear a small nuke goes off and you had City

703
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:16,512
Flagman

704
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,792
I mean

705
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,096
I'm going to go out and I'm going to say

706
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:25,472
Alex is like this is a situation where I feel like it's fine if Alex kind of

707
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,288
Is like scary because

708
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,104
Honestly if a nuke does go off in a city

709
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:37,760
No one's going to give a s*** what Alex has to say anymore I don't know if that's true

710
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,856
Real busy with everything else that's going on you're not wrong

711
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:46,464
I think I think I still have a problem with it if only because of

712
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,816
I think I

713
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,400
Nuclear warfare

714
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,240
Not to be taken lightly

715
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,288
Exaggerating

716
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,568
Threat of it right

717
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,592
For the sake

718
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,152
Of us not ending up there not good

719
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:10,016
Well no actually I read that wrong

720
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,808
You know if that is what it takes

721
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:15,904
To take things seriously like hey let's never get to that point

722
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:21,792
I got I can kind of get into that if people that acted like that about climate change in the 70s

723
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
You know

724
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:28,960
Who is Alex the problem that I have is that he's not doing anything to avert

725
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,520
Nuclear war or make it less likely

726
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
Hugh

727
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,848
Manipulating the audience's emotions

728
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,384
In order to

729
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,200
Sell them bigotry and

730
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,480
Yes there is that

731
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,272
So I find that to be just a

732
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,600
Seriously in like

733
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,624
Now being like

734
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,440
Pretty gung-ho against it

735
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
Great

736
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
But this is bad

737
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:54,560
I'm of the opinion that nuclear war is my

738
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,352
My preferred Armageddon

739
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,120
Just because

740
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,912
As if everybody goes at the same

741
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,960
Time then there's no like

742
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,752
Bad feeling about the blip

743
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,312
Well the blip would be great

744
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,360
But you have to take everybody again

745
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,920
If everybody goes to the same time there's no heart

746
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,992
And nobody's going to miss you

747
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,272
Cuz everybody's dead

748
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,856
You won't miss anybody took like half people are the problem

749
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:24,256
Can you got to put everyday you build your life mapped out of people

750
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:27,840
They came back another day got to put their lives together it's just a whole mess

751
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:31,168
I don't know man I think

752
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,496
I disagree I think there's got it like it's it's a great

753
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:38,080
There's a mystery

754
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:44,480
Many of the whole new life for nothing about the blip

755
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:48,064
I bet if you did get blipped I mean what you're just going to avoid right

756
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,464
I don't know what happened you can have that

757
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,792
Are you trying to live without me

758
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:04,704
The last five years

759
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,984
That's fair

760
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,752
That's fair

761
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:10,592
And the workload tried to bring me back would be the same for both of us

762
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,712
It's a natural extension

763
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,784
Like I said Alex

764
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,344
Alex has a very much support

765
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:28,000
Is very awesome office in some ways but this is pretty pretty

766
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:28,768
Sad

767
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,048
Rush's

768
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:33,376
Voice growing anger as losses Mountain Ukraine

769
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,656
Agency

770
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,704
Namor

771
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,984
Who's the moderate

772
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,800
If Putin gets assassinated like

773
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,872
West has been pushing for Lindsey Graham's been calling for

774
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,688
Somebody

775
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,504
More aggressive

776
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,856
Ethos is not being invaded

777
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,136
By the Mongol

778
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,160
And the Hun

779
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,184
And the Muslims

780
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,208
And Napoleon

781
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,840
I sure didn't start

782
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,144
Engine of evil

783
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,216
Just like America is now an engine

784
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,240
A warm-up

785
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:15,872
Globalist even weirder captured instrument of evil

786
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,920
No naive spoiled dumb down

787
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,456
Lost

788
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,736
But not evil

789
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,272
And the Russians are not evil

790
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,880
This is such b******* it's so hard to even take this seriously

791
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:30,208
The first glaring problem is they from the early 1700s

792
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,768
Through the early 1900's Russia was an Empire

793
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:39,680
Empires in case Alex doesn't understand this are generally based on expansion and Russia was definitely into that in.

794
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:45,568
Peter the Great's the guy who St Petersburg is named after

795
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,152
Russia had a long Rich history of expansionism

796
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,176
And invasion

797
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,944
Long

798
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,552
I'm well before Lennon ever came around the most

799
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,576
Beard

800
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,928
Engines of colonialism in history

801
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,000
Another important point is that is not a moderate

802
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:09,120
He's faced some criticism from the Russian to leave but they're not saying that the nuke should start flying

803
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:14,496
It's more like Dave the generals mishandled operations kind of critical criticism

804
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,056
It's pretty wild for people to be doing that since

805
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:22,944
Government passed a law back in March where they could imprison people for up to 15 years for criticizing the military

806
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:29,856
The only person in that article that Alex's citing who is calling for nuclear weapons to be used is

807
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,136
Amazon kadyrova

808
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:31,904
Who's there

809
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,440
Hardline Putin loyal

810
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:38,048
He's such a poodle loyalist that he's trying to scapegoat the other

811
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,864
Some other people in the Kremlin to defend Putin from criticism

812
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,400
How about how things are going at

813
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,800
Another small point the headline of the article that Alex is using his quote Russian Elites voice

814
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:51,104
Growing anger as losses mount

815
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
In Ukraine

816
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:55,967
Alex added demanding Putin do more from his own imagination

817
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,503
That is not in the text

818
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,271
Nor the article

819
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:05,439
I don't know who would end up in power if bun were removed mostly because almost all relevant political opposition in the

820
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,231
The country has been crushed or imprisoned

821
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,791
And Putin has essentially been in power for

822
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,815
22 years

823
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,863
So it's hard to predict who would ascend

824
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,655
No matter who it would be

825
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,935
It does not matter

826
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,751
It does not mean that Putin is not

827
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,775
Immoderate

828
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:29,247
Ridiculous to say Punta moderate

829
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,527
Obvious aporta Putin

830
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:34,111
Despite a bunch of stuff happening in the world that makes that support look really

831
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:41,023
Yeah yeah it is this is got that historical bent of like it's really smart

832
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:44,095
If you are a despotic tyrant

833
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:47,167
To surround yourself with people who have

834
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:51,007
Billions of dollars all dependent on you

835
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,031
Existing

836
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
Because

837
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:57,663
The only way to stop this honestly is for one of those people to assassinate Putin

838
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,943
And that shouldn't happen

839
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,223
So here we are

840
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:06,623
You know I thought you were going to say the good way to be a despot is to like surround yourself with people even worse than

841
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,927
Ono know that's how you get murdered

842
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,207
As a desk

843
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:15,327
Right now I've been there cuz like if someone worse than you was going to send that sort of like body armor

844
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:21,727
Well for other people but for them they're in a badge

845
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:28,127
With knives that stabbed body armor

846
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,223
So the Russian Elites are saying hey Putin

847
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,015
You got a new people

848
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:34,783
Or something

849
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,575
US elites on the other hand

850
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:40,415
Auto some complaints about the olive course there's a problem with her door

851
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,047
They got rid of the actual Warriors and smart people

852
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:51,679
He wanted power and all the rest of it

853
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:54,239
Bunch of Harvard lawyer

854
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,543
To a man

855
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,663
Physically killed somebody

856
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,735
Never physically seen a war

857
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,759
Never

858
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:06,783
Physically

859
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,831
Their head doctor the ground

860
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,903
And so they have this

861
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:15,487
Lawyers

862
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,279
But they can just Bravada

863
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,095
And bully people around because they control American power

864
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,119
And that's not the case

865
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,399
Real people

866
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:26,751
That have launched operations and killed lots of people

867
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,823
Are very concerned

868
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:36,223
Henry Kissinger 99 years old still articular

869
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,319
Stop

870
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,903
Omni budsman

871
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,207
Sorry what now

872
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,999
I don't know what they're doing

873
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:52,351
Nuclear war these people should all be arrested

874
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:58,495
It's the Return of the Omni budsman Tire comic book about

875
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,031
Editor paper

876
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:04,127
Suddenly gaining powers to be able to edit all newspapers

877
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:10,783
Let's call Alan or release information to come back

878
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:16,159
Flip really makes no sense if you believe any of Alex's narratives at all

879
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:20,255
All the stuff that he's talking about shouldn't matter in the least

880
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:23,071
If you kill someone physically or not doesn't make a difference

881
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:28,191
Prince because either way you're acting the way you are because you're possessed by a literal demon

882
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,007
Or at least your knowingly working for Satan

883
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:37,407
The kind of insubordination that Alex's describing is just not possible in the context of how he described the globalist

884
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,455
Who are the u.s. Elite

885
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,783
There's no question about following Kissinger's advice because

886
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,599
You and Kissinger both work for the devil

887
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,951
Tim Kissinger is about as high-level as it gets for humans on the demon scale

888
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:56,607
Earned it doesn't just give his opinion about the best way to solve a problem he's basically like the Emissary of say

889
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,143
For Alex's

890
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,167
It doesn't make sense

891
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,703
The globalist

892
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,983
Italy act the way Alex

893
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,519
Rfr

894
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:10,175
There is no discipline in the ranks which seemed super unlikely if the people knew that there was the literal devil who

895
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,199
They were disobeying

896
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,503
Seeing this there's probably consequence

897
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,527
Those were that kind of thing

898
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,807
Yeah it's the f****** devil

899
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,087
Yeah

900
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:23,231
Devil's operations in Alex's mind have more of a have more of a

901
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:28,095
Like fictional hell kind of like the Devils really not paying attention that much

902
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,119
The Dukes are all

903
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,935
Just telling people to do stuff and without the ultimate authority of the

904
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
The devil you know

905
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:34,495
I'm kind of say hey Duke

906
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:39,615
F*** you you know the devil's not going to mind because he's the devil what is he going to be like

907
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:43,711
Superior officer

908
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,247
So you have

909
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,271
Like dork

910
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:50,623
Physically killed people who are working across purposes of the warrior types

911
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,487
This disorganization feels like

912
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:59,071
How Infowars rocks

913
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:02,911
Ever notice how is the devil is exactly as smart as Alex

914
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:09,311
Did you ever notice that

915
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:12,383
The devil's drunk quite a bit

916
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,687
Honestly I think we're going bankrupt right now

917
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,479
I don't know where my money is in

918
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:20,831
The devil's dad is suspiciously involved in his business

919
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:23,903
In a way the devil's dad also bought him a place to live to

920
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,975
You know there's there's something to be said for that

921
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,999
That's interesting

922
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:32,095
So this guy isn't this next Clipper really got my ears up

923
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:38,751
The last year I received top secret information

924
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:43,103
Are the start of the next hour 6 after I will release

925
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:57,695
Hope you take this information to our

926
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,487
Hope you shave

927
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,279
Because any day

928
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,119
Everyday Above Ground is a good day

929
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,423
Okay so we got secret tell

930
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,215
Secret stuff

931
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,239
I just

932
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,775
I just wish

933
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,055
One time in my life

934
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,335
Like I'd been watching

935
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,639
CNN it like 12 years old

936
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,431
And Wolf Blitzer been like

937
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,223
We've got some brand-new ragazza

938
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,527
Some scary news out of the White House I'm afraid to tell you

939
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:28,927
I'm going to commit myself to God right now I'd like to commit my spirit

940
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,719
We have breaking news

941
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:34,047
God help me

942
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,375
That would be fun

943
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,959
That's a tow.

944
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:47,359
The other problem is that the elites have replaced all the murderers with dork

945
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,455
There is that

946
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,223
Before we get

947
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,503
To this top-secret news

948
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,271
I think

949
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,831
Alex has a little bit of an announcer

950
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,879
Quite frankly I'm thinking about

951
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,535
4 year

952
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,559
I watched him

953
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,327
Repast

954
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:12,191
Probably already

955
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:12,959
Ashok

956
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,495
Commercial free

957
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,527
Total setup

958
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:32,159
This is probably never going to happen much like the show that's just collars that Alex is

959
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,207
Just a big bottle on for like a

960
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,999
Around the corner

961
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,023
About to happen

962
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:40,607
I would advise Alex strongly not to follow through with this idea

963
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:46,239
But one thing he doesn't have enough content to justify the amount of time he's on air as is and there's

964
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:49,311
No reason to add like 6 hours a week

965
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,079
To that pile

966
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,663
Second he claims he's just going to take calls but that's bulshit

967
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,199
Alex can't stay on task

968
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:59,039
To save his life so this is going to end up being more ramps and begging people for money

969
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:03,135
At the beginning of this show he said the first and second hours open phones

970
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,671
You get to call Zan

971
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,231
Hour and 20 minutes away still closed

972
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,255
Sell clothes

973
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,839
There's a third point to this and that

974
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,375
This seems desperate

975
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:17,215
There's no reason to do this show other than to try to make more money

976
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:22,079
There's no great demand for it there's no way Alex needs more time to cover the news

977
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:26,175
What does boils down to is that no one else in Infowars can sell for s***

978
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:32,831
I want and Harrison shows clearly aren't bringing in the sale so Alex feels like he needs to be on are essentially all the time to keep the Inn

979
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,599
Infomercial

980
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:38,207
Is that 12 major factor in this idea he could easily have someone else

981
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,999
Supposed to show this mostly collars

982
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:46,655
Oh wait that was the premise of Harrison Smith show before he started getting a bunch of callers there were like a why won't Alex just say it

983
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,215
The Jews

984
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,263
Another issue was that Alex is at

985
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,847
And these shows if he does them are going to be a mess

986
00:50:55,615 --> 00:51:01,759
I guess I'll netfront I kind of hope he does follow through with predictable content

987
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:04,575
Throwing but as a whole that seems like a really bad idea

988
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,623
Yeah I would be interested

989
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,903
If instead of

990
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,439
His current idea

991
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,999
He set it up so that all of his house

992
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,535
Bad we get together

993
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:19,935
And Daria would be the social media manager and they would create the evil Chris gethard show

994
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,703
Like

995
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:24,031
Could you imagine an evil Chris gethard show

996
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:30,175
What would that be like a literal human face

997
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:37,343
I know that much right

998
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:43,999
Alex would be Chris guess he be Chris and birth he would have to be

999
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:52,959
The would-be the LLC Owen Owen could be a

1000
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,983
Good vacation Jason

1001
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,519
I think I always got vacation

1002
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,055
Brett.

1003
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:00,383
If we're filling those roles that that's definitely

1004
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:09,087
I just want him to be I've got to talk more then I would need to be

1005
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:09,855
Like

1006
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:15,487
You and I could be the Paul Scheer and Jason Vance

1007
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,767
Alright

1008
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:19,839
We're having a good time

1009
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,399
So we got top secret until

1010
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,935
Course

1011
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,215
Good bad

1012
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,543
I don't think he says it

1013
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,591
That sounds about right

1014
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:35,711
I was listening to Mike tops

1015
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,479
This is

1016
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,247
It's okay

1017
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,551
But I don't know cuz it's not topsy

1018
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,831
Secret it's not in town

1019
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,135
Breaking news

1020
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,975
That three and a half years ago.

1021
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,255
House armed services committee

1022
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,983

1023
00:52:59,263 --> 00:52:59,775
Choosy

1024
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,103
Majortech,

1025
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,407
Who explained

1026
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,199
Will you go on Siri

1027
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,735
Are you going

1028
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,527
Sounds dumb AI sounds dumb

1029
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,319
Some purpose they don't want you to know

1030
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,135
3.0 is already in control

1031
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,207
But let me give you a big chic

1032
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,767
And I was meeting a year ago

1033
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,047
Over a year ago

1034
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,095
With the chief science

1035
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:28,959
Of the number one University in America

1036
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,287
Now they can debater that is

1037
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,567
I'm not going to say the name

1038
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,591
What

1039
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,807
A discussion about the posthuman and the end

1040
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:45,855
All of it

1041
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,879
And what their main

1042
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:47,647
Gauloises

1043
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,695
I said let me guess your man going

1045
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
Elon Musk

1046
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,119
What are we doing

1047
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:58,655
I'm sitting there

1048
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:00,703
I said

1049
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:01,727
I know the secret

1050
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,383
Powerful

1051
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,431
Guy is only a

1052
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,199
Powerful

1053
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,759
We give it if we don't interface weather

1054
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,319
Fails

1055
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:22,975
Ashley Wright

1056
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,999
Oh my God

1057
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,327
I mean I feel like he looked at you and said

1058
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,607
What do you mean it

1059
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,887
Text fails what's failure

1060
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,935
Does it just Exist by its

1061
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:35,007
Self is it just it doesn't become friends with adults

1062
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:37,823
We're teaching at how to play chess by playing chess against itself

1063
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,359
It's probably fine

1064
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,383
Yeah

1065
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:47,039
Form of AI that Alex is thinking of that I think

1066
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:47,807
Bank is

1067
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,087
Not

1068
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,367
Hawaii what

1069
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,391
Maybe this

1070
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:56,767
Fake MIT Professor would be working on

1071
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:59,071
I'll be I blew his mind I guess that

1072
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,863
This is the secret Intel

1073
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:04,447
They said he went to dinner with three sounds dumb

1074
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,471
Because they're trying to

1075
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,495
Cover up that

1076
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:09,823
AI 3.0 arise launched

1077
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,359
Very smart

1078
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,383
That makes perfect

1079
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,431
Yeah caught me

1080
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:19,807
I and Alex blue guys mind at dinner

1081
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,343
I know all the secret II

AAA MIT graduate

00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:29,791
Who is

00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,559
Elon Musk

1087
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,839
Top AI guy

1088
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:34,911
Was having dinner with Alex and Joe Rogan

1089
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:41,311
I do believe Alex blew his mind many times that night however I do not believe it was for any good reason no no

1090
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:47,711
I also want to know who the aide-de-camp saraveza

1091
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,527
Here's the AI that Alex's thing

1092
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,439
I said what is the most powerful

1093
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,463
Flatterers right now

1094
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,743
God

1095
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,559
John by sheer human movement

1096
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,583
By Chirac

1097
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,351
Activity on the face

1098
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,143
Ants

1099
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,191
I said it's stoplight

1100
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:14,591
Programmed in most areas

1101
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,615
The flow

1102
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,151
Summer is is not

1103
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,199
But I said

1104
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,735
It's primitive technology but

1105
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,015
Human submit

1106
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:22,783
To it

1107
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:26,111
And humans go along with the stoplight

1108
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:28,415
The red light CLR lives

1109
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,183
The green line

1110
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,487
The turn signals a yield sign

1111
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,791
Because they know it makes your life better

1112
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:36,607
Humans interfacing

1113
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:39,935
Would that primitive technology that is the most dominant

1114
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:42,495
AI program on Earth

1115
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:43,775
Sounds right

1116
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:45,823
Hi guy

1117
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,847
Arguably

1118
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,615
On the planet

1119
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:54,271
Pushback is Cherry what oh my God I never saw it like that

1120
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:57,343
Steve Wozniak

1121
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,463
MapleStory

1122
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,487
Axis1

1123
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,023
Look up story

1124
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,047
Good story

1125
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,887
All the stop lights are timer

1126
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:15,263
And some like have pressure I'm going to I'm going to go even further

1127
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,543
He's wrong

1128
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,079
He's wrong

1129
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:18,847
Because

1130
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,895
What's even more power

1131
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,431
Is the button

1132
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,223
That turns the crosswalk sign

1133
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,759
But let me tell you something

1134
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,295
A lot of the times

1135
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,575
That button doesn't do it

1136
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:31,135
Right so that's not the operation

1137
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:34,207
That's a i it doesn't

1138
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,743
So

1139
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:37,791
Okay

1140
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:40,095
Problems with this line of thinking

1141
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:42,911
Because here's the deal like

1142
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,935
Stop light

1143
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,239
Fully

1144
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:48,287
Need our input

1145
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,847
Like-for-like with the drivers and stuff

1146
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:53,407
In order to operate or whatever

1147
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:55,711
Many of them are just on timers

1148
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,295
You got 5 minutes and then

1149
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,111
To Alex my argument

1150
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:05,439
Might be that when you are not interfacing with the stop

1151
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,231
They're still doing what they're

1152
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,279
That is true you are doing different

1153
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,583
Yes

1154
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,655
Is true and then secondarily

1155
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,959
Interfacing with stop lights

1156
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:18,751
Save so many lies

1157
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:19,519
So many

1158
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:23,871
Society would not be able to operate in the way that we do with

1159
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:29,247
Cities and the layouts are of the people needing to get to work and all right

1160
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:32,831
It would not function the way we have it set up if we did not

1161
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,135
So the argument

1162
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:38,975
Actually would be submitted to the AI

1163
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,511
Work with

1164
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,607
Vai well because otherwise this s*** doesn't work well I mean

1165
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:47,167
But that is that's kind of the azimuth

1166
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:49,471
Point of view on AI is that like

1167
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,519
If we do develop an AI

1168
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,543
Chance

1169
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:57,663
It's going to be infinitely better at running our society than we are in the same way that you know

1170
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,199
An AI

1171
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:03,039
Program has like a 3800 Reiki low rating in chess

1172
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:06,367
Which is like and the human one is like 2800

1173
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,671
Talking about

1174
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,463
Alex Jones

1175
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:15,327
I think that he was trying to make an argument that

1176
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,119
We don't need to

1177
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,143
Interface

1178
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:18,911
Swift

1179
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:19,679
IAAI

1180
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,471
That's what's up

1181
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,239
Well yeah

1182
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:26,591
Obviously he doesn't want a i fiddling around and all this s***

1183
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:27,615
But

1184
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,639
The examples that he

1185
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:29,407
He uses

1186
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,943
Of his alleged

1187
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,711
Most

1188
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,735
Spell prevalent

1189
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,551
Hey I we do need to

1190
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,343
Interface with right

1191
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:40,159
I mean but at the same time like

1192
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:42,719
What is he talking about that it's intelligent okay

1193
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:45,791
If I set my coffee makers timer

1194
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:48,863
You make coffee for me the next morning

1195
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:49,887
Right

1196
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:54,751
I think that there is I don't fully understand exactly how all Civic planning works

1197
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,031
Unstoppable

1198
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:57,311
There are some

1199
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,103
I like traffic lights

1200
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,407
Things with adjust based on traffic

1201
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:03,967
I think some cities do have that

1202
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,015
You could make an argument that's like

1203
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,295
Somewhat rudimentary

1204
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,391
When you're talking about the lake

1205
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:17,023
Machines that play chess against themselves a little different from what exit

1206
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,815
It's a little different

1207
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,095
I would guess

1208
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,143
If this a mighty person doesn't

1209
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:22,911
Right

1210
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,471
They were being very polite

1211
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,495
Beyond polite

1212
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:30,591
Well I mean because again now I would argue that Alex

1213
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:34,175
My Definition of artificial intelligence

1214
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:36,991
Begins when artificial intelligence

1215
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,527
Learns on its own

1216
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:42,623
You know what I'm saying sure you learn something without our help

1217
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:43,647
Now

1218
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:45,183
I'm going to throw this out at you

1219
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,719
The traffic lights

1220
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,999
Cannot do that

1221
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:51,839
That's not true the traffic lights cannot suddenly be like you know what

1222
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:56,447
I haven't tried orange before let's give it a go

1223
01:00:56,703 --> 01:01:00,287
I was at the intersection of Western and Madison

1224
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:05,919
I was yelling at the French

1225
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:12,319
I guess that isn't it learning on its own tonight

1226
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:20,255
So are we got some bigger updates about about the trial

1227
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,303
Closing arguments being made

1228
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,887
And Alex has a big piece of news

1229
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:32,799
We know they claim were all Russian agent we know they say men get

1230
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:39,199
Fifteen minutes ago by accident

1231
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:42,783
Cuz my lawyer great lawyer or baddest up in Connecticut

1232
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:43,807
Trial

1233
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:46,623
Attacked by the judge nylon defend ourselves

1234
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,671
He sent me a text me said their ass

1235
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,463
Searching for 300 million dollars

1236
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:56,095
All they want $3000000 Texas as400

1237
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:56,863
50 million

1238
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,399
50 million but

1239
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,167
Context of cat

1240
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:02,751
If it doesn't matter

1241
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,383
Calling

1242
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,919
Like 45 seconds ago

1243
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:14,783
Hung up on or pass

1244
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,439
Proportion

1245
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,487
He says it's 7

1246
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,255
Point

1247
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,303
8 billion dollars

1248
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:31,935
Me too

1249
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,983
SAS 47

1250
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:39,103
Billion dollars

1251
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:41,151
Show me questioning a mass shooting

1252
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,967
And weeks of them crying

1253
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,247
And no evidence

1254
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,575
I never said these people

1255
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,879
? Jesse smaller

1256
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,415
What a joke

1257
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:57,023
That's all bulshit but that's funny you really enjoys this

1258
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:03,423
Yeah this pizza in a good mood if I got to hang up on Norm to though

1259
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:10,079
Probably invigorating about that it was on a landline

1260
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,127
Now that would be nice

1261
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,967
But yeah so this puts a minute and in a certain mood

1262
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:18,271
And this will play out

1263
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,343
And we'll see about that

1264
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,391
Okay I got the call from a lady

1265
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,927
Who used to be

1266
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,951
A dumb liberal

1267
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:32,351
When those dumb liberals in that time that she was a dumb liberal

1268
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,119
She got back

1269
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,727
I know she's very worried about it

1270
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,007
But I wanted to ask

1271
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,287
What your score because

1272
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:51,295
And I took it back scene and so now I'm nervous of my

1273
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,063
Decision

1274
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,927
I just want to see what you still at like

1275
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,951
Is it really

1276
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:01,535
Like you think I'm going to drop something

1277
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,839
No statistically has killed Millions

1278
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,887
Problem you say no

1279
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,167
Dancers no

1280
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:10,239
It was 87°

1281
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,055
Thank God they didn't store it right

1282
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,591
And so

1283
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:17,407
Two-thirds of folks are having a

1284
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,527
Kaiser Madrona you name it it's got to be chapped

1285
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:28,415
Didn't happen so you probably got a dose it was dead

1286
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,207
Alive

1287
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,535
Goodcents

1288
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:38,655
Call now we have a built-in excuse for why all of the people that listen to Alex

1289
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,935
2 don't have

1290
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:41,983
Terrible side effect or die

1291
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:45,567
From

1292
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:50,431
That's great I'll try I'll throw this scenario attitude okay so I'm out having dinner with Alex

1293
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,199
Text Joe Rogan

1294
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,991
And Alex says that to me

1295
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,527
It does not blow my mind

1296
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:58,367
I had an incident like a moment he said that I had a vision of me throwing

1297
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:02,719
Bread in his face

1298
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:05,023
If I was holding bread out it throw it in space

1299
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,303
No

1300
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:09,631
Refuse f*** out of here

1301
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,655
Done

1302
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,471
So

1303
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,775
The rest of the show is weird

1304
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:16,799
Yeah

1305
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:21,151
Cuz he wasn't exactly wasn't really excited about hearing that they were asked

1306
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,687
A seven billion dollars was

1307
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,991
Well he was in a fashion

1308
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:31,135
Sure the third hour is in interviewing guy from the epoch times

1309
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,671
About some Alexa

1310
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:33,695
Contemptuous

1311
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:36,255
So I don't care we're not going to do that

1312
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:38,559
So we're coming towards the like

1313
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,863
End of the second hour

1314
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,143
And Alex is f***** up

1315
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,447
Not literally talked out

1316
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,727
Do drugs or anything

1317
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,287
I don't even know how to how to

1318
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:51,103
Here

1319
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:11,327
The final curtain

1320
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:30,527
I traveled

1321
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:43,327
Much more than this

1322
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,703
But I can't stress this enough

1323
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:53,823
Alex plays the whole song he played the whole

1324
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,103
This

1325
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,127
Was

1326
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,407
Tough

1327
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:04,063
Just listening to this song it seems like there's nothing else going on watch this

1328
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:08,159
Entirely different experience

1329
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:14,047
Watch every episode of

1330
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:14,815
AutoCheck

1331
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:21,215
The video sent me this video and was like you got to see this

1332
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:25,311
Headed to me too and I could not click on it and I've been kind of interested in now I know

1333
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,079
It's

1334
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:29,151
I think it's one of the rare things that like

1335
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:32,991
I can do my best to explain it maybe I'll do it just

1336
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,783
But I don't know

1337
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,551
Maybe people

1338
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:41,951
It's so weird

1339
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:49,119
To already a strange thing for a human being in they start smoking to the camera

1340
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:49,887
Weird looks

1341
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:55,775
These smug like smiles to the camera so he's trying to do this ironic like haha

1342
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,055
It's not actually

1343
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:00,895
The end for me he's doing like thumbs up

1344
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,175
Oh my God

1345
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:04,223
Does like sort of

1346
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:05,759
Waving

1347
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:09,599
Gesticulating putting his arms out right

1348
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,135
He doesn't have enough moves

1349
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:17,535
She kind of gets stuck with his arms outstretched like wingspan

1350
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:21,887
There until he can bring his okay

1351
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:24,191
It's really strange but there's

1352
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,983
There's another element to it too

1353
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:28,031
And that is that edited

1354
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:28,799
Intuit

1355
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:31,359
Like to someone who's working the board

1356
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,639
Has

1357
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,919
Like a

1358
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,455
But video of

1359
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,015
Sing like highlights from Alex's career

1360
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:44,671
What is a like four sections on the screen you know like splits

1361
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:51,071
Yes we're getting silent video of his greatest hits

1362
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:57,471
Open for Hollywood Squares ass like a shot from Scanner Darkly and Waking Life

1363
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:01,567
Him yelling at Marco Rubio on Piers Morgan

1364
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:07,199
Stuff from his early career like when he was alive

1365
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:09,759
Canfield it feels like that

1366
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:10,783
It feels like

1367
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:11,807
Is

1368
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:12,575
This is

1369
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,111
The kind of tribute

1370
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,391
Bit someone else

1371
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,671
Give it to you later

1372
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:20,767
Like when your career is over or you're retiring or something like that

1373
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:26,911
Pizzas have someone else honors you host your own episode of this is your life

1374
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:33,311
Feels really sad because Alex is sitting there alone in his Studio

1375
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:38,175
Can you rent it out

1376
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:44,575
The theater that the Oscars is held in to give himself a Lifetime Achievement Award

1377
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:56,607
Sigmund is him doing it his way that is weird

1378
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,935
Uncomfortable self-indulgent disrespect

1379
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,567
Oh God I had to watch it a couple times actually yours

1380
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,103
The truth you had to turn it off a cup

1381
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:09,663
Pebble time

1382
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:12,223
I turned it off within a couple seconds

1383
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,527
The first time I can't

1384
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:32,447
I Did It My Way

1385
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:43,711
7.8 billion

1386
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:49,599
Everybody will never get $1000000

1387
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:02,911
Oh boy

1388
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:09,311
He kind of thought when he started talking maybe that was going to be like the afram

1389
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,079
Nope

1390
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,615
I would say this

1391
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:12,639
Right

1392
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,175
This is just the wrong

1393
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,711
This is just the wrong Kant

1394
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:18,015
Because if we were watching like a

1395
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,295
A classic

1396
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,855
Like 1800sprint circus

1397
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,135
You know and this is

1398
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:25,695
The sad clown section that where they came out

1399
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:28,255
He's playing Sinatra's doing this whole thing

1400
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,047
Flowers

1401
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:34,399
Is coming raining from the sky Standing Ovation he's bowing

1402
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,679
And then it goes away

1403
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:40,799
That's a perfect sad clown routine right that this was his Farewell to public life

1404
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:47,199
I'd forgive whatever weirdness is going on problem solved

1405
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:48,991
I also think

1406
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,015
Here's a here's how I think

1407
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,039
This goes better

1408
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:55,647
Song Choices that I think would work better than my wife

1409
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,951
Cuz my way is really f****** sad

1410
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:00,767
Yeah it's the end of the night

1411
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,303
You know what I mean

1412
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,351
I think you go with

1413
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,631
Right now

1414
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:12,287
Okay okay I think there's some

1415
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:14,335
Open upbeat about that

1416
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,615
Dad rockish

1417
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,663
Bright enough for Alex chair

1418
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:20,223
The other one is Bon Jovi's It's My Life

1419
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:24,575
And it's now or never

1420
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:28,159
Oh man

1421
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,439
Cuz that has kind of

1422
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,975
Same thing but it's not like

1423
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:31,743
I'm bad

1424
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:37,887
I think if I were going to go out I would have like an IRA song playing like it was

1425
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:39,167
Straight up like

1426
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:44,031
The British murdered my family and then I'm gone that's the way I do it

1427
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:46,335
Just I mean by this song is

1428
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,639
I Did It My Way

1429
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:51,967
It's all. I'm doing it my way you know

1430
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:54,527
It is it is not as much of a karaoke

1431
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:56,319
Song in that context as you might think

1432
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:58,623
But

1433
01:12:59,391 --> 01:12:59,903
Bon Jovi

1434
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:03,231
Garbage so I'm still a fan of this over that

1435
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:06,047
I would probably choose like something by Carly Rae Jepsen

1436
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:10,911
Or maybe something from Avril Lavigne Let Go album

1437
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:17,311
I'm picturing you as like a let's call it 75-78 year-old-man your you're

1438
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:20,127
Giving your final lecture at a university

1439
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:21,919
And everybody is like

1440
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:25,247
Shaking your hand as your waving goodbye

1441
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:26,783
Call Me Maybe

1442
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:33,183
No. That's what I hear that's what I hear things all never say North

1443
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:39,583
My world by Avril Lavigne or I like it with me

1444
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:50,591
So beautiful

1445
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:51,871
We're going to feed them

1446
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,503
God we are the best there is

1447
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:58,783
I don't care

1448
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,575
But he got beautiful black skin

1449
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,599
What

1450
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:03,903
Can't Stop

1451
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:06,463
Credible red skin or yellow skin

1452
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:08,767
Thanks again what is going on

1453
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:09,535
Ivory White

1454
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,303
Skin

1455
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,351
What are you doing

1456
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,399
Stop all of that

1457
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:15,679
Stop it

1458
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,447
Our blood is

1459
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,799
I got to go to your phone calls

1460
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,127
I'm just so

1461
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,943
Love it oh my God

1462
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,759
Point eight billion

1463
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,575
There's a lot going on there

1464
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:37,183
That is

1465
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,207
REI

1466
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,999
I will say that I have

1467
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,023
No rush

1468
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,047
Fear of reference

1469
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:45,631
For staring down the barrel of what it's going to be

1470
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,703
A Millions upon Millions upon millions of

1471
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:50,239
Millions of dollars of debt

1472
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:53,311
Acting weird makes sense to me

1473
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:58,175
Based on his positioning in the like his

1474
01:14:58,943 --> 01:14:59,967
Just at the Griff

1475
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:00,991
Yeah

1476
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:01,759
He can't do anything

1477
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,295
But be confident

1478
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:09,695
Showing weakness to the audience than they like why would I throw my money away at you when you're just going to have to

1479
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,719
To give it to the court

1480
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:17,119
Yeah or whatever you know you not knowing that it's already what they're doing is that publicly

1481
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:19,167
Then take while the audience will bail on you

1482
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:21,727
Yeah you're not showing like some kind of a

1483
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,799
Being above it or laughing about it

1484
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,847
Yeah you can't be like I'm f***

1485
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:28,383
Guys

1486
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:31,455
Hose make that really screwed on this one

1487
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:37,855
Nothing to do with making a sequel to 25th hour right now that's how bad it's going

1488
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,647
It's not going well

1489
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,207
So Alex

1490
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:45,023
Adjust the rambling keeps going

1491
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,583
And I don't really think that this clip is all that into

1492
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:49,119
Everything except for one thing

1493
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:52,191
These criminals are so over-the-top

1494
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,983
Number like

1495
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,007
Scares us

1496
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:58,335
Control the judges

1497
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,871
Do all of this

1498
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,175
You can try to shut me down

1499
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,967
Is what I expect

1500
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:09,343
I expect you'll be killed a long time ago I had

1501
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,367
Family killed

1502
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,159
Who wouldn't go along with

1503
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,255
Did you kill him

1504
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,191
Because of

1505
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,471
Family put in the tank

1506
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,031
Hundreds of years of war

1507
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,079
Because of the

1508
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,359
Because of you

1509
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,127
We're having

1510
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,151
Massive victory

1511
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,455
I am so blessed and humble

1512
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:37,247
To be at the very epicenter

1513
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,015
The human race

1514
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:42,879
What's going on with you man no clue what is happening it's bizarre wow

1515
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:45,439
Yeah so I guess he had a family member killed

1516
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,975
That's strange

1517
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:53,375
I know he was trying to say but he phrased that poorly who was killed is

1518
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:59,007
Yeah but he wasn't

1519
01:16:59,263 --> 01:16:59,775
Murdered

1520
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:02,847
Sure if Alex wants to clarify onomatopoeia

1521
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,639
Interested as well

1522
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:08,735
Interesting piece of that

1523
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:09,503
Is

1524
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:11,807
This is so funny to me

1525
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:13,087
B like Alex

1526
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:15,135
Can't get to the second step of

1527
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:17,439
I expected to be dead a long time ago

1528
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:19,231
Why haven't you why aren't you

1529
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,255
Cuz you're full of

1530
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,535
Cuz you're lying

1531
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:25,119
You expected to be dead because if what you believed were real

1532
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,655
You probably would be

1533
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,679
Yeah but

1534
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,703
It's all fake

1535
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:34,079
Call Protect living in a bizarre spy novel in your head that's why you're not dead yet

1536
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:40,479
Is that by the grace of your audience not haven't killed you yet hopefully probably more realistic

1537
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:42,527
More like you're not dead because

1538
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,087
For some reason you're weird

1539
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,623
Mental illness

1540
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,183
Trauma response

1541
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,719
Turned into a business

1542
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:55,839
Yeah piano or you and also I think probably had the cautionary tale of Bill Cooper

1543
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:59,423
You're not going to get yourself in a situation like that

1544
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,959
Hey White

1545
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:03,007
Alex didn't do it his way it turns out

1546
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:05,311
And I am so blessed and humble

1547
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,847
To be at the very Epic

1548
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,127
Center of the human resist

1549
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:11,967
I Didn't Do It My Way

1550
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:13,247
I did it God

1551
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:17,343
That's where we are right now

1552
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,695
Biggest number

1553
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,743
To scare you into submission

1554
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:27,071
But if you submit to them you get

1555
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,607
Death penalty

1556
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,655
Billion years in hell

1557
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:33,727
Control your children signed over to them

1558
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:39,871
We are exposing a poison shot

1559
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,039
Sounds right

1560
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,111
Ouchie

1561
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,391
Bill Gates

1562
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:54,207
Schwab

1563
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:58,303
Henry Kissinger

1564
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,775
Humanity will pop

1565
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,055
Like the solar system

1566
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,335
Will expand their

1567
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,895
Then we'll go next level

1568
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:19,039
I I find it difficult to imagine being somebody listening to this and being like

1569
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:23,391
Yep this is

1570
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,159
Killing it

1571
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,695
You know just worried

1572
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:27,999
This seems worrying yeah

1573
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:30,303
Yeah

1574
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,839
If this is sincere at work

1575
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:35,167
If it's not then it's a childish perform

1576
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,215
It lacks nuance

1577
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:40,031
I mean if it's not it's worrying as well

1578
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,079
I are very different

1579
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:48,479
For what I feel I feel a little bit jealous of sick Shakespeare now on innocence that like

1580
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:50,783
It in his

1581
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:51,551
Time

1582
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:53,599
A thing like me Fink's

1583
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,391
She does protest too much

1584
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,415
You know you're like

1585
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,951
That's inappropriate

1586
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,487
Contextual way of the

1587
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,255
Describing that

1588
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:02,815
If he said that about Alex I be like

1589
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:03,583
You should have said

1590
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:10,239
Yeah you know the Lacs

1591
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:16,640
It's the kind of poetic language that'll live for decoration

1592
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:22,784
Call if you will describe

1593
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:26,624
Love you tough I wonder who Alex would be in Titus andronicus

1594
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,440
What's recast that 12

1595
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:31,488
He's the person who

1596
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,584
So

1597
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,120
Alex waiting to go to the Stars

1598
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,400
You know

1599
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,704
And I talked about beam me up Scotty

1600
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,080
Indescribable

1601
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,688
Grandchildren

1602
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:53,504
Magical Interstellar

1603
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,112
Intergalactic

1604
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,184
Mobile.

1605
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:02,464
Interdimensional

1606
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,560
Can pour out my

1607
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,864
Do genetic wealth

1608
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:15,520
A genetic don't describe it like at Everest

1609
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,824
No amount of torture

1610
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:22,944
And we are at

1611
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:23,968
Going together

1612
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:30,112
Lawn chair

1613
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:33,440
I am just I am so bored

1614
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,488
Love this

1615
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,536
The biggest defamation case

1616
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:38,560
U.s. history

1617
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,608
Is 240

1618
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,376
1 million.

1619
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:47,264
They're so scared of us

1620
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,568
Nash 47-point

1621
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:51,104
8 billion

1622
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,896
With their rig trial

1623
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,992
This is awesome

1624
01:21:57,504 --> 01:22:00,832
So I guess I was just been on the USS Enterprise before we

1625
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:01,856
Fun

1626
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:07,232
That was fun out of negative attention

1627
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:13,888
That's just such a powerful fuel for him because he's internalize the fallacious idea of the consequences and negativity

1628
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:15,936
Mention all the signs of a virtuous person

1629
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:22,336
He's up against this Cosmic overpowered evil so the fact that Alex is facing a giant defamation judgment

1630
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:24,384
Can only be evidence of how good

1631
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:28,736
If you were an evil person the cosmic overpowered evil forces would

1632
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,016
Check them from such a thing

1633
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:33,344
But because he's a threat to the Devil he's subjected

1634
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,624
Slings and arrows

1635
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:35,904
Nice

1636
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:44,608
This is a really dangerous and stupid mindset to have because if you think this way and your bladder no let's say orange

1637
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:46,656
Narcissists you'll never be able to

1638
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:47,680
Accept any credit

1639
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:50,752
Every time someone tells you that you f***** up

1640
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,800
Every time you get in trouble for something

1641
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:54,336
Really bad that you did

1642
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:58,432
You'll find a way to convince yourself that the consequences or criticism is just

1643
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,968
Motivated by evil drink

1644
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:00,992
Get you off course

1645
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:01,760
From your holy

1646
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:02,528
We mission

1647
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,296
Your ability

1648
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,576
Self assess is

1649
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:06,880
Wheatley erased by this mindset

1650
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:09,952
Find ability to rationalize any really hurtful or

1651
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:11,232
Destructive things you do

1652
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,352
Alex is afraid to wrestle with the actual impact that he has in the world because on some level

1653
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:19,168
Probably or possibly subconscious

1654
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:21,728
He knows that that would be the end of his career

1655
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:25,312
His ideology in world you don't hold up to any actual screwed

1656
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:30,432
Nazo his ability to hide behind being a champion for that ideology and worldview would likewise

1657
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,968
Crumble is examined critic

1658
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:39,136
If all consequences or just proof that you're on the right track then whoever may have been hurt along the way

1659
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:41,440
The collateral damage of the war against the globalist

1660
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:42,720
But

1661
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:47,584
If he's consequences aren't proof that you're on the right track and they're just people you've heard there's no

1662
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,352
Excuse for it

1663
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:51,936
You just don't care how many people's lives you ruin in order to make sure

1664
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:53,984
But you're rich and sound interesting on your radio

1665
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,520
That's really

1666
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:56,800
The

1667
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,080
Assertive

1668
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:00,128
Real world version of

1669
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,152
Yeah I mean

1670
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:03,968
It is it is more fun to

1671
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:09,088
To be like oh seaweeds bombastic and needs on the radio and it's entertaining and stuff

1672
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,184
But at the same time I feel like his psychopathy and need for money is

1673
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:13,952
Is the same as like

1674
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:17,024
Howard Schultz or or whatever you want like

1675
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:19,072
What kind of psychopath

1676
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:22,400
To bust Union that a f****** Starbucks

1677
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:26,240
For his extra 100 million dollars you know like it's insane

1678
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:28,800
Yeah it's the same thing as what Alex's doing these

1679
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:29,824
It's just because it's

1680
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:30,592
Not

1681
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:31,616
Public because he

1682
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:34,944
Torturing people in Silence with their tacit

1683
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,760
Permission you know because Society forces on them

1684
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:44,160
Ebony f***** up man and it's not union-busting it's doing a Superfluous to h x

1685
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:47,232
Exactly

1686
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:50,304
Somehow it is less distasteful then

1687
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:52,608
There is that

1688
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,912
Do it talks a little bit about the trial

1689
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:56,704
Can make you sick

1690
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,080

And on fraternity

And that's why they hate us

1707
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,504
Because they don't have

1708
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:42,528

You may be a scientist it doesn't matter how much money you have or how much money you don't have

1715
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:02,752
All the connections again for letting God

1716
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,288
That is the real value

1717
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:06,848
And these soulless Servants of evil

1718
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:08,384

01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,344
The listeners not to listen to that right
