1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,408
What up

3
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,176
What's your favorite

4
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:22,272
My favorite drink is probably cranberry splash Sierra Mist

5
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,040
The seasonal

6
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:25,856
Variety that's only available during the winter months

7
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,392
It's delicious

8
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,928
Just crisp enough

9
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,976
Enough cranberry flavor to get you

10
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,304
You threw those ponies Chicago Winters

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,072
That is

12
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,376
Infuriated

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,424
Furious

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,032
Oh no

15
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:50,176
For some reason

16
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
Your favorite drink

17
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:01,440
See I'm a simple man with self

18
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,720
We Are Who We Are

19
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,024
Comedians in Chicago

20
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:10,656
Very popular open mics in shows

21
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:15,520
Chicago can take ownership of Jameson and Ginger

22
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544
Take ownership

23
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:22,688
Cinderella

24
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,552
I know only what you tell me

25
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
That seems fair

26
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,208
Like to give a shout out to a New Daughter

27
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,632
Appreciate it though so very much so Jeff

28
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,896
And tell her you're brilliant

29
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:57,760
Bank of

30
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:03,136
So you can do so by going to our website

31
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
I am going

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
Victor homepage

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,864
But

34
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
Check your shoes

35
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,824
Show me to handle as

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,104
Is an engineer

37
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:29,248
Now that the transition

38
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:34,624
2002 r2009 investigation

39
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
Last we left off

40
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
We found

41
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
Alex Jones

42
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:43,584
Going through a Cavalcade of stories about asserting their sovereign

43
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,400
There were a number of states

44
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,704
Tried to push through Houston

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
Concurrent resolution

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,544
Allowed

47
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:03,040
The number of those bills and saw that they died in committee or never got voted on

48
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:03,808
Just worried

49
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
Working at whatever just left alone

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,208
So we don't need to go over a lot of that if you're interested in that please go back to our last 2009

51
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,232
Episode where we cover it

52
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,280
I only bring it up because it's very rare

53
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,584
Where we pick back up

54
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,400
February 12th through 16th is we're going to cover here

55
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,960
Alex is in what I can only describe as a

56
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
Terrible holding

57
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,544
He cannot get off this story

58
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,640
Really this story is the biggest f****** deal in the world

59
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
Right cuz he's hoping it's

60
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
Secession 2.0

61
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:37,856
Exactly during the course of this time. They were going to go over has one of the house

62
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,160
Represents about how

63
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:46,560
This is

64
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,400
So even there's a little bit of a miscommunication

65
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
Him and that

66
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
House representative

67
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
Starting to believe

68
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,824
That investigation

69
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,104
All cards on the

70
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,456
Table to find out what Alex was at the beginning

71
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,528
Of the publicized nation of the Tea Party

72
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,576
And I'm secondary to figure out when

73
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
He starts talking about George.

74
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:13,440
He's looking into in 2009

75
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,000
And I believe that this story

76
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,071
We discussed Isaiah August is one of Alex's

77
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
2009 episode

78
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655
Might be a

79
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,679
Shoot Steel

80
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,263
Okay might be very very big piece

81
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
Of his transition

82
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,079
Turn towards the Tea Party

83
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
Reserving judgment

84
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,431
I think we're going to talk about the story again

85
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,759
But we want on this episode because

86
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,295
All of it

87
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,855
So I'm sitting here listening to these episodes

88
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
Something out of this

89
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,719
He's just it's like he's in syndication

90
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,583
10th Amendment

91
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,399
He's like great Seinfeld on at 9 every night

92
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
Fine

93
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
It's it's

94
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,495
Along those lines

95
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
I can't

96
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
We had to do a show

97
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:07,455
The 12th is mostly that many is Mark Dice on to talk about the Illuminati in

98
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
Enchanting

99
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
I don't even want

100
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
Illuminati

101
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,111
Because I

102
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
Not interesting at this

103
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,415
He will become enter

104
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
A little bit later

105
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,023
Down the road

106
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,327
Five star

107
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:34,335
Early on whatever books

108
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,895
Not trying to trick people

109
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
Wearing flip-flops

110
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:45,599
It is current

111
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
State

112
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
Evolve

113
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
What state

114
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
Let me consult my notes here to talk about

115
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Stuff we're not going

116
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
So he does

117
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,031
Is Big everyone stopped traffic

118
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,079
Because I got a big thing coming up

119
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:15,039
That's a fun time. I wish you could bring that back

120
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,623
Is that is no fun now screaming like everybody

121
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,207
Tell the person in the car next to you

122
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:27,327
I agree with whatever the president does cuz he's too worried about self-driving cars hitting advanced

123
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:36,031
Narrative trying to build up his this idea that

124
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:41,663
FEMA is going to find places to dig up Mass Graves cuz they're going to turn on America and all the

125
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Search

126
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,271
Find places this is all about

127
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,063
Who's the guy who wrote

128
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,135
Something on a Blog I'm not sure exactly the website

129
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
Whatever

130
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,207
Just a guy with a Blog

131
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
Conservative journalist

132
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,375
I don't I don't know

133
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
I'm not sure

134
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,495
He is a guy who interviewed a whistleblower

135
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,031
Audio is

136
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,359
Come out

137
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
Quality is terrible and it's

138
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Just like I can

139
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
Going to tell you what he says

140
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,759
No because

141
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,111
Like 12

142
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,439
Rex's already contributor

143
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,815
FEMA organization

144
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,399
And that they got us some like local

145
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
Local organization

146
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Noxzema

147
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:42,335
FEMA called them and wanted to know where power plants are where police stations are

148
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:48,735
Where you could make a mass grave that sort of thing

149
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,879
Aggressive way to start

150
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:59,743
I'm not sure I 100% believe this guy's story

151
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
All this stuff

152
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
Sounds like

153
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,071
Exactly what the

154
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:07,679
Emergency Management agency might be into

155
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
You consider the possibility

156
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
Outbreak

157
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,287
Disasters natural disasters

158
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,103
There's all sorts of benign explanations

159
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,895
To know where power plants are

160
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,967
Wanting to know where resources are where is hospitals

161
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,295
Where where are your like triage centers that

162
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
On the off-chance

163
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,391
Fix bad breath

164
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
So we don't run into situation

165
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,207
Seems like we had

166
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,487
In Las Vegas

167
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,535
Other

168
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
Mismanaged

169
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
Situation

170
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,935
It could just be somebody who's actually a white terrorist

171
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,239
Because that seems like something they would want to know is

172
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,287
Prank call

173
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
I don't know

174
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,591
My point is this

175
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
Is this whistleblower does not blow my mind

176
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:55,039
It's not worth stopping Alex spends a lot of the show talk about that

177
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
Is important

178
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,879
Forgetting.

179
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
Superman

180
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
The man

181
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,511
Who made a lot of money off golden South Africa

182
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
The only reason

183
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
I even

184
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,399
Only reason I want to include this clip

185
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,263
Because Bob makes very weird offers Alex

186
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,031
Extended clip

187
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,943
Instant my survival Instinct

188
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:35,231
There's nowhere to nowhere

189
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:44,447
Operation

190
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
Because

191
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,943
Interested the nightmare could all in

192
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
It's so horrible

193
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,903
It's my 50th year in this

194
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,231
Believe me like believe you I've been there

195
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,791
And incidentally if you want to hide your kids

196
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
I'll hide them

197
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:17,471
So it's not even that

198
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,591
Very weird Bob

199
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,407
You want me to send me a kid's Alex

200
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
Couldn't get up kids

201
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
Alex you want to hide you

202
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,063
I will make sure they are never found it

203
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,599
Maybe that's just

204
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:38,975
I know it's probably in their world a nice offer

205
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:45,375
Yeah it's one of the nicest things

206
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,959
I love you so much I would hide your kids

207
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:53,567
Make your kids the most

208
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,151
Appearance

209
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,687
Used to this sort of Alex

210
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
In present day

211
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:06,367
Because of the times where Steve pieczenik is come on and Alex's had to get therapy from him or Jon rappoport

212
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,415
Times have to talk Alex back to life

213
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
Half an hour

214
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
Just complaining to Bob

215
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,279
Just like

216
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Shipyard

217
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
Lip lift

218
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:24,287
There is a slight difference in why they left a y Alex needs to leave America

219
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
NY Bob actually left a mare

220
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
Bob left America

221
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
Well no.

222
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,759
Fake running away from 2009

223
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
You. That was in his past

224
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,135
Pre apartheid South Africa

225
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,463
I thought you was I thought you was originally the states

226
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
And then

227
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
No he was in those African countries

228
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,119
Then he moved to United States and Canada

229
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,215
Where he lives but I don't think you went back to spell pepper

230
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,031
I don't I think of his life

231
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
M27

232
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
Oh yeah because it would be burned alive

233
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,895
A tablespoon

234
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,711
Not wanted

235
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,039
Either way dead or alive

236
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,135
Realizes

237
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,927
S*** there's a reason I have bobcat

238
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
Chapman on

239
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,399
I think you're right but we've got together to

240
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,423
Enough people

241
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
Publix

242
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,263
But also is you say Lauren Foresman

243

244
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:39,039
Forecast for.com

245
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Kiss you

246
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:13,343
You better I would think that was intentional like Alex's better joke

247
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
What is a joke

248
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:20,511
In the middle

249
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,303
Toto Toilets

250
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,119

Please

253
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,263
There's a middle of that conversation

254
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,127
What the f***

255
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,967
Complaining to you for half an hour time is valuable obviously

256
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,295
You need to sell gold so are we get

257
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,647
I assume it is I don't know

258
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
Tokyo

259
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
Think they get back from break

260
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
And Alex

261
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,071

262
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,887
And I know they talk about how great

263
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
The Ozark

264
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,983
Number so great

265
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:07,871

It's a great

272
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,287
Why is Ted Gunn

273
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311

274
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,639
No cuz he won't know how

275
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,455
Does any goes into a long thing about

276
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,343
Fire-sale prices on gold

277
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,647
Because I care about you

278
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
Still don't understand this

279
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
This whole gold business

280
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
We've been doing this show

281
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,815
Anderson has been Hawking

282
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
For the entire show

283
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:05,215
Understand how deep

284
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:10,847
F****** s*** works

285
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,151
At a lower cost

286
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,687
What it is now

287
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,527
And then he sells you gold at the cost that it is

288
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,111
Because then it's going to get more

289
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:28,767
So how does this f****** business

290
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,071
Haha

291
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,119
If you get getting this from

292
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,727
Is this what is this is this flotsam

293
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,263
I don't understand

294
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,335
Do you want to know the truth or the stand

295
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,199
I bought this gold when it was $50

296
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,759
Yeah always 85

297
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,063
I'm going to sell it to you for 75

298
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,255
Even more profit margin exactly

299
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,303
How is that not already like

300
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:08,703
Wait so you're telling me a business is telling me something so I can make more money than that business

301
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,495
Capitalism

302
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,543
Emirates in reality

303
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,847
He might have the Specter price

304
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,895
75 dollars an ounce

305
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,199
But there's all kinds of like brokerage

306
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,479
These hidden cost

307
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,807
Those sorts of things that bump it up

308
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,879
Some people who've done business with you end up with

309
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,183
$95 an hour to post

310
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,463
Do the 85 but it's worth

311
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:35,071
How to get all the hidden behind the stand

312
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,631
No matter what the price is your paying more for it

313
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,935
And then also the people who work for

314
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
You actually

315
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,775
Individually

316
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,591
From all the reviews that I've read they also do like

317
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:52,991
A lot of like well if you want to if you want to sell it back or probably only going to be able to get 65

318
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:59,391
Score

319
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,207
Old people's gold hostage

320
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
Tow lot of these

321
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,095
And precious metal operations that are very

322
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
Reputable Opera

323
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,543
And the people who helped get you in the door

324
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,335
Stirrup mouth

325
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,919
Salesman

326
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:26,015
Is there like a real gold business

327
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,855
I assume so I don't know what it is

328
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,951
Let me know I think they're like reputable collect

329
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,255
I don't know

330
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:42,911
I would assume that most of the if you want to make a profit off precious metals most of those people probably ski

331
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,703
But if you're already rich

332
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
Here's one

333
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,799
Collectible coins

334
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,127
I think there's probably a lot of reputable in that world

335
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,223
I cannot get past the idea of gold bars to this is what

336
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:02,623
Really frustrated over those mostly coin bullion and all this

337
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,255
I want to have a stamp

338
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:14,655
You look into gold bars

339
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,983
Right

340
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,567
Call Bob

341
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,015

Is it Southern to f****** dog with

383
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,863
Down home country food no

384
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
You don't

385
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
Especially

386
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
So weird

387
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:06,687
Here's the other here's the reason I think we don't hear about

388
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
That

389
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,015
Like we don't hear about Trump's vacations

390
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,295
Except from

391
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,575
People who are like

392
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:18,720
This is his 7000000 weekend consecutively playing golf at one of his properties

393
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,768
They are paying for

394
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,328
He is committing a violation of the emoluments

395
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,608
Emoluments clause

396
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,144
On a regular paper

397
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:33,312
Restaurant

398
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,104
Whenever he takes a vacation

399
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,384
Because that

400
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
You won't do anything

401
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,968
Sing f****** to he's going to do some stupid

402
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:49,696
Do you know Trump just announced that he was going to sell Florida to Russia so

403
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,232
Thank God we got a couple of days off

404
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:52,768
I think I

405
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,472
Tweet and we'll all just

406
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
Pretend

407
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:06,848
The president Ray Ray

408
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:11,200
To go

409
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:17,600
Get a Putin look-alike

410
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,208
Just like looking go at this

411
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
Benign

412
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,304
Example of a presidential

413
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,352
They went to an upscale restaurant

414
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:36,800
Obama also it's Presidents Day weekend anytime a president

415
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:42,176
Should be able to like go home this weekend

416
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,456
Literally

417
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:49,856
One person even allowed to stay it's Presidents Day it's classy

418
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,904
This is just forever

419
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,184
Super crazy

420
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,000
You get weird about on

421
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,280
Episode

422
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
So

423
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:02,656
Weird to live in that way it's so weird to live be back in 2009 where

424
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
President

425
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
Took his wife out

426
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,032
For a very sweet

427
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,848
Valentine's Day

428
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:15,968
140 thousand dollars through a fake lawyer to

429
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,248
Pornstar that

430
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,296
Cuz he didn't want the story to get out

431
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,088
Stop

432
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,136
Almost during his wife

433
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:31,328
When everybody's we're just we're just living in a world where it's like

434
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,352
Sure

435
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,656
This is just how we live now

436
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:40,032
Back then it was so amazing all he wore a brown suit

437
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,568
Hot dog

438
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,712
So also

439
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
Plane

440
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,856
At least according to Alex is very serious

441
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,672
So a 9-11 truther

442
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,536
Was in a plane to crash

443
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,072
These things have

444
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,352
Yes

445
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
Alex

446
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,144
Would have you know

447
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,680
If it was no coincidence

448
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:13,568
Obama remarks on plane crash stimulants you can pull up the video that's on YouTube

449
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,592
Real quick

450
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,152
To he's talking about this situation with

451
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,016
These are dark bomber

452
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:22,784
Statements

453
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,368
Here's the tax present Obama this for the washer

454
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
Tupac

455
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:38,656
What terrible tragedy took place outside of Buffalo last night

456
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,704
The families and friends who lost loved ones

457
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,544
And as always our Thanks goes out the brave First Responders who arrived immediately

458
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,128
Legos on tragic events

459
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,712
Other fragility of our life the value of the end of every single day

460
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,248
One person has stood

461
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,296
That will

462
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
This is Jim babbling

463
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:05,280
No perfect

464
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,096
One person who stood that well

465
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,376
Was Beverly a card

466
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,448
Who was on that flight to do I met

467
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,984
With just days ago

468
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,032
Is she Beverly lost her husband on 9/11

469
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
Tireless advocate

470
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,640
Forever changed

471
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,432
On September 11th day

472
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,016
Of course she knows Hillary Clinton is a high-powered Democrat she was

473
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
She dead now

474
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,344
Shell there is that report

475
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,392
Right there very very suspicious

476
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,232
Someone who lost

477
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
Husband

478
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,792
Call 911

479
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
Yep

480
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:43,168
I win someone who I just met with the president with someone who just died in the plane crash in

481
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:48,544
She was a 9-11 truther and it is billions 212

482
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,592
I want to go I want to go to Pat's

483
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,664
Trips it's billions

484
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,736
Conceivably true but it mean if you just

485
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
Takeout

486
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,040
A bunch of variables

487
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
Bodies life

488
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:03,392
Like you and me doing this episode of the podcast

489
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,672
Extrapolate out like

490
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,744
Someone who lived in Hawaii versus someone who

491
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,816
Podcast with someone who was born in a cult

492
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:17,216
And neither of them died on 9/11

493
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,152
Unlikely thing

494
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,456
But it does happen like that.

495
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,272
Because there are certain

496
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Aspect

497
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
That are like

498
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,136
But don't mean it that doesn't mean it's official

499
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:41,536
Also I imagine

500
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,840
Who fly places

501
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,680
Physically sooner or later one of them was going to go down

502
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:51,520
This one just happened to be somewhere in the proximity that

503
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:56,128
Was close to the president met with Obama

504
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,920
Days before

505
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,200
Which doesn't

506
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,272
A 9-11 truther was allowed to me

507
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:05,088
Who was the president

508
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,696
But

509
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,232
She's not as much of a 911

510
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
Truther is Alex

511
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,304
And Morrison

512
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,584
For the family

513
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:19,424
Yeah

514
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,216
I think that's probably more

515
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:25,824
And I think that you probably more of an investigation

516
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,968
As a member of his kind of 911

517
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,504
Organization

518
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,784
Maybe an actor

519
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:39,136
Yeah I don't know enough to say but that's what we got

520
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,416
But who cares

521
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
Alex

522
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
Cannot make Obama

523
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,024
He wants

524
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,632
Trying so hard

525
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,912
And it talked

526
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,216
Pikliz trying to like do all these different things

527
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,520
But if you just listen to the words you like

528
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,312
Oh yeah that's a bit

529
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:02,432
Sentence he's a good writer he's got speechwriters he's

530
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,736
Yeah he's doing a good job.

531
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,576
Taking time out of a press conference at the start to

532
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:12,160
Spell comment on something really sad that happened in pay respect

533
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,232
I don't know

534
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
Most of the rest of the show

535
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,096
Is just a lot of that

536
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,448
Lot of lot of talk about that

537
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,496
Alex

538
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,288
Good to reinforce

539
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
Alex Jones

540
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
Opinions

541
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,616
Or not

542
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,920
Consistent with what you would believe in

543
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,528
Pro-gun control group

544
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,048
They're there to neutralize and control gun owners

545
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:56,704
Control group

546
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
So he's

547
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,264
He's pretty anti-nra

548
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,568
What's going to end up happening

549
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,104
He's going to say that the NRA

550
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,408
At some point it became more lunatic

551
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,320
They got wild

552
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,344
Controller that was

553
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,160
That's that's

554
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,768
That's just because he's super in with Larry Pratt and gunownersofamerica

555
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,816
As we pointed out on our route

556
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:27,168
Sacha Baron Cohen

557
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,448
And I knew.

558
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
By being

559
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,776
Wonderful

560
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
Absolutely

561
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
The show

562
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,016
Tristan it

563
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,808
But you know what

564
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:50,208
It's therefore

565
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,072
In front of my position

566
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,864
Like

567
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,632
I don't like it

568
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,168
What why do you

569
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,800
I guess I get the outlandish things like

570
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:09,152
We're going to arm children

571
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,992
I don't wear outlandish because

572
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,296
What they're saying now seems like it

573
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,600
It should have been enough

574
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,416
You know what is what they say

575
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,232
Getting one entrance for schools

576
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:28,352
So why do you need to go further

577
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,936
Well yeah window is gone so far that you have to

578
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:35,008
Isn't it you might as well have to be

579
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:38,336
I always ridiculous a better way to do this as a parody is

580
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:42,432
Like put it out as a serious show and never say that it's a

581
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,712
Something like that

582
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,736
Just like

583
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,784
Is they would probably promote it

584
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,880
Oh yeah if it was put out as a serious he never realized it was

585
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,952
Because they didn't realize it was a prank while it was happening

586
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,232
Yeah that would be

587
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,560
Great

588
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,328
Is he dead

589
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,120
I don't know

590
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,848
We do a pure we do the exact same show

591
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,384
But with Ted Koppel

592
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
You're right

593
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,432
It would crush in the

594
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,480
It wouldn't

595
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,272
They wouldn't

596
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,552
Be ashamed

597
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,368
They wouldn't say they were tricked they would promote it

598
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,184
That idea

599
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,000
The conservative Wrightwood tucking love it

600
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,280
Most likely

601
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:33,120
But just like those just like those politicians we're like

602
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:37,728
Yeah let's on your arm kids if we put it out as a serious show conservative be like

603
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,776
Why haven't we already armed

604
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:46,176
Possible

605
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:50,528
Oliver North could do a commercial for that right now even after

606
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
The

607
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:56,672
Joke played by Sacha Baron Cohen and most of the conservative right if not all would be like

608
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,208
That's actually a good idea

609
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,608
I know it was a prank show with the tummy does not good ideas

610
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,984
We're going to cover on the 15th

611
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,288
Who cares we gotta move along

612
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,968
He's really just talkin about that state sovereignty

613
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,272
Most of what he's doing in this time

614
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,576
And I need to get out of this like

615
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,600
Stretch of a couple days

616
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,392
So

617
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,952
Through and I look forward to

618
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,488
Further episodes that

619
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
Don't

620
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
Have as much

621
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,352
To do with this goddamn

622
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:39,424
But I think I'm going to hear a lot more about it

623
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,448
Yes

624
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,240
When we get to the 16th here

625
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,544
February 16th 2009

626
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,080
Alex pivot

627
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
It's the narrative a little bit

628
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
To start the show

629
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,432
Not talking about the states

630
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,456
The are declaring their

631
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,016
Their sovereignty

632
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,344
How many days it take him to get there a while but at least

633
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,136
Appreciate it's a difference

634
00:32:59,392 --> 00:32:59,904
You know

635
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,184
But at the same time

636
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
Kind of scary

637
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:14,240
No no

638
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:19,104
Extension

639
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,368
Long pause here

640
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:38,304
They are actually selling out

641
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:42,656
International organizations

642
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:55,200
Reports that out what he's getting at is that

643
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,480
Doing these at

644
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,760
How's compare resolutions

645
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,552
We know from living in the

646
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,576
Which is

647
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,856
The future 2009

648
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,392
A lot of those didn't pass

649
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,208
So they are failures in defending the Republic

650
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,488
In what way

651
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
Could have state declaring

652
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,048
Sovereignty

653
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,608
Be considered defending the Republic

654
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,192
Wow it's big

655
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,824
Find me any explanation

656
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,128
Besan Alex's

657
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:28,480
Alright he believes that the federal government doesn't really exist because it's

658
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,760
Been taken over by the global

659
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:30,784
Right

660
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,184
Any point in history if he's not happy with who's in charge of the federal government

661
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,720
Exist to what he wants

662
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,768
Yes at this point 2009

663
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,072
Is very specifically secession

664
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
But

665
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:49,728
It's the suspension where state to start their sovereignty dissolve the federal government

666
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,520
I'm in Bring It Back Together

667
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:55,360
He's weird paper version of a federal government

668
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:00,224
Necessarily involve some level of

669
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,344
Global involvement it would still involve some some level of

670
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,648
You know supremacy clause has

671
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,184
In terms of the piano

672
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,976
Murders illegal everywhere

673
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,864
America

674
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,912
On paper

675
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,216
So like that

676
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,752
Is his idea is

677
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,288
Who's awesome thing where

678
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:28,896
Are you break up the union then bring it back together and its original better form or whatever

679
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,224
It's the same problem that a lot of these

680
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,784
These idealists

681
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,856
That have idealistic utopian vision

682
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,392
That are really regressive

683
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:45,280
They're really point back to a bygone time they don't realize that in order to get

684
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,840
To the starting point of their Utopia you have to

685
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
To create hell

686
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,888
And also

687
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,168
The odds of you getting

688
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,728
Through that hell to reach your ideal place

689
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,008
Is almost 9

690
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,568
And along the way the people who are going to

691
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,360
To be hurt or the people

692
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,640
You don't have any

693
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,432
No it makes perfect sense

694
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,480
That's right

695
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,016
We have

696
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,088
What would you say

697
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,880
2030 decades

698
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,672
Complete and utter chaos

699
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
As the world Burns

700
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,720
Right

701
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
But that

702
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,608
Fix it

703
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,632
Sure

704
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,424
I don't I don't like

705
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,704
I understand

706
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,544
This is what he thinks is going to help everything and get rid of these

707
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,568
Demon globalist

708
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
Littering charge of everything

709
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,176
I look at it from

710
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,200
Just a little mystical

711
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,736
Ghost

712
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,760
Dia of

713
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:41,600
Like we talked about this before I don't understand why you

714
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,392
You think you don't understand this

715
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,184
Don't forget to go

716
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,792
I forgot know we talked about this it is like

717
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:56,192
You can make this sort of rhetorical argument about I want

718
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,496
To dissolve the federal government in order to

719
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:02,336
To have us all come back together under a better federal government

720
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:05,152
What you're really advocating for is

721
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,432
You don't want

722
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
Like

723
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,992
You don't want the

724
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,784
You want a different

725
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,832
You want a thing where

726
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,368
You know

727
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,160
Say they want

728
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,976
It's not

729
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,768
It's not that simple but

730
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,304
You know that is a part of

731
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,168
You know it it is a part of it

732
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:32,288
We don't want everyone

733
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,080
For people that sort of thing is

734
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:40,480
Dumb federal regulations that are ruining the free market

735
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,504
End up with is a bunch

736
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,808
States that are going to be able to agree on anything

737
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,856
Investigation are you end up creating

738
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,880
Two different countries

739
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,440
That you couldn't possibly create because we

740
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,976
Contiguous states that would be on the same

741
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,304
So what you'd end up with is probably

742
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,584
Four different countries

743
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,144
With two different ideologies

744
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,472
Yes and all you would do is

745
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:06,080
Complete power imbalance in the world you created

746
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,872
Zester is foreign policy state

747
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:11,968
Hilarious

748
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,736
Randomest

749
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:17,344
Even forget about where we are in the present

750
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,136
2009

751
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,160
The worst

752
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:24,512
Worst possible

753
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:34,496
Policy level

754
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,264
Going to happen next

755
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,288
Italics

756
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,104
I know that he's not that stupid

757
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,688
I don't think he is that's why I think there's a

758
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:48,576
Right you have to act like he doesn't have those thoughts and realize that you had asked us going to become

759
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,112
Stand-alone

760
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,648
Country theocracy

761
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,672
Where we can

762
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
Kickoff

763
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:59,328
You know what he doesn't realize this is most likely what's going to happen

764
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,120
You can go back to gay bashing

765
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:07,520
I don't know these damn wheelchair ramps that I have to build it in for no reason

766
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,592
Don't have any minorities working for me

767
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:16,736
I don't have to feel bad ever again ever again for being myself for being

768
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,808
Why do people not like the

769
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,344
That's the real issue

770
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,136
I just want to be white

771
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,160
And I

772
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,952
Never want to see anybody else

773
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
Well

774
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,120
Are we move along and we get to

775
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,168
Too familiar to us

776
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,192
It's been a little while

777
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
Through taking a road

778
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,080
And there's going to be long

779
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,872
But I think it's necessary

780
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,896
Because let's have a

781
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,664
Positive

782
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,712
Moment with Alex before

783
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,272
Horrible s*** on this episode

784
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:23,808
The way

785
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:48,640
Out of kind

786
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:55,040
Freebirds

787
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:19,360
Breadtube

788
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,440
X

789
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:41,120
Macabre on the song is done

790
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:51,104
Merle Haggard

791
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:57,503
That's fair

792
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:03,903
Merle Haggard

793
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:10,303
It's so hard

794
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,959
Atlanta

795
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,751
Cheap hotels

796
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,847
Cleveland pool

797
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:30,527
Merle Haggard

798
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:59,199
Live

799
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,039
After

800
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,671
Out of

801
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:18,399
So we're back live

802
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
Love it

803
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:29,151
Personalized love that song like mxon World Haggard sounds like if they made a muppet of

804
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,711
Skaggs

805
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
Dreads

806
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,903
I would love the way you lie

807
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,487
Like that hole that's good stuff

808
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,863
When you go to karaoke

809
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,887
Do you could not

810
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,679
Go through the night without

811
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:57,055
At least three people singing God damn if you don't call me by my name

812
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,359
While they were saying you did anybody

813
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:03,967
And by the way they have weaponized dogs we'll talk about that after the end of this song

814
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,783
Vietnam flashback level

815
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,623
Visceral reactions whenever

816
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:17,023
Since I left Missouri

817
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,303
Alcoholic

818
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,935
No I couldn't do that

819
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,751
Karaoke bars on The Fringe of town

820
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,335
Hillbillies

821
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,639
Can't do call and response I'm not talking about

822
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,175
I'm not talking down on the good folks

823
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,223
The Roadhouse karaoke bars

824
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,783
What a great country Folk

825
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,063
LA tonight stricken

826
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831

Scuba Steve

829
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,559
I beated to do that

830
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,351
Because first of all I love the song

831
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,911
Because I

832
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,471
Alex doing his

833
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
DJ

834
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,263
A couple times

835
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:02,847
But give us a story like

836
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:06,943
They're going to kill the internet

837
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,063
I also we need that

838
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,879
Because we are about to get into like

839
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,415
Alex being a mom

840
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:19,487
Absolute monster

841
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,767
How to patent

842
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,863
Soy

843
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,143
He takes calls

844
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:26,911
Hermosa

845
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,703
Sure

846
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,007
Is telling him to

847
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,031
He woke up

848
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,055
Thanks to some

849
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,615
Infowars and Luke rudowski

850
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,639
Dvideos

851
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,687
Conspiracy type

852
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,455
Videos

853
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,503
Then

854
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,599
Something to this guy

855
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,367
No one should

856
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,135
Ever

857
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:47,903
Ever

858
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
Say to some

859
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,207
Like

860
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,743
Termite down

861
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,767
You're going to scream but the

862
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:53,791
But

863
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,327
On the other end explained

864
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,607
More in-depth what I mean

865
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,823
Real quick just because I was a little muddy that I try and tell

866
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,847
The closest people to me

867
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,127
I'm crazy

868
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
Talking about

869
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:11,967
About what

870
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,015
What's going on and stuff like that

871
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,575
Occult

872
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:21,439
I lost a girlfriend over this question

873
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,719
Trust them

874
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:35,263
If you

875
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,735
Yeah it's like the Matrix when they tell you try to wake somebody up

876
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,855
All the evidence

877
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,135
And everything and

878
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,183
Do the double stick

879
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:05,471
Yeah a lot of times I don't have no respect you sir they don't respect you

880
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,591
The next

881
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,359
Devil

882
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,919
Credibly irresponsible

883
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,199
As a thing to say

884
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:18,527
Is like

885
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,831
You know he's saying that

886
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,623
My family says I'm in a call

887
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,159
And then

888
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:29,279
He goes to the leader of said called who says

889
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,095
At least I'm not

890
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,143
I'm still check it out

891
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,679
The most out of life

892
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:38,239
But at least he is still saying like

893
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,031
Not like ice

894
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:43,871
Too late yourself from them

895
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,431
Use your craziness on Strangers

896
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,223
Like maybe they'll listen to you

897
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:53,087
There's a way to say that without saying your family and friends don't respect you

898
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:54,879
On the other

899
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:56,927
If

900
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:59,231
I had a family member

901
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,047
Who started telling me about

902
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,607
I would respect

903
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,423
I think it's possible to respect them and not respect

904
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,191
That part of

905
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,727
I think there's a

906
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,751
There's still

907
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,775
Familial love

908
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,055
They probably exist

909
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,591
What Alex is doing

910
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,127
Trying to shut that down

911
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,199
Trying to make it like your family's actually

912
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,735
Well if you don't if you

913
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,271
What you don't realize

914
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,087
We don't realize they already don't like you

915
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:27,903
You know who does

916
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,695
Infowars

917
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:36,095
This is a family

918
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:42,495
And then you got a new family

919
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:46,335
Old family what is it what it what do they want

920
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,103
What do they want

921
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,919
Healthcare

922
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,783
That's what the guy is talking about

923
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,599
Do you know I just told them I don't trust

924
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,879
The government

925
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,647
You're mad at

926
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:05,791
Because that's what Alex has to present as like that's what I'm responding

927
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,119
If anybody

928
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,911
Remember sound of my voice

929
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:15,775
A liking it hurt you in anyway

930
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:19,103
You know you became so into it it ruin the relationship

931
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,127
Stop listening

932
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:26,015
If anybody ever came to me with like hey I like your show too much

933
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,319
People think I'm crazy I would say

934
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,391
I appreciate that I'm glad you like the show but

935
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,439
It's not worth it you have a life

936
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,975
Repair your relationship

937
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:38,047
Try and get her back tell her that you're sorry

938
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,583
Tell her that you know what

939
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,887
Even though she is an infowarrior yuca

940
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:47,519
Concealed lover it's about what's inside

941
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:53,919
You know they used to say what did that one Republican

942
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,687
Wife

943
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:57,503
And how did they make it work a Democrat and a Republican

944
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:03,391
Imagine if we had a policy walk ended info Warrior relations

945
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,695
Ridiculous if it does exist out there

946
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:11,327
Cyril

947
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:15,679
You be very clear which side was the bride and which was the guru you know

948
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,215
You just look at the clothing

949
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:21,567
How many Hillary for Clinton Clinton for prison shirts

950
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,103
We would still play The Highwaymen

951
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:31,551
Doesn't matter what side you're on everybody loves the Highway by

952
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,415
So that was really terrible I heard that nosey

953
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,439
Alex

954
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,975
You need to know what your

955
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,511
You can't

956
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,047
You said it twice to him

957
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,071
They don't respect

958
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,351
That's f***** up

959
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,031
But if you want to be like really generous

960
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,567
That's at least

961
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,359
Stoves

962
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,407
Lake

963
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,175
Not intense

964
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,455
How to drive a wedge

965
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,247
Between his listeners and their family

966
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,039
It's so irresponsible

967
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,855
Reliable the like you shouldn't be you should be on it

968
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:11,999
What is borderline you're listening to call into a radio show

969
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:14,815
Activate your really really depressed

970
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:18,655
You're talking to this radio host and the radio says is all the sudden like

971
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,679
Well you know what

972
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,447
Maybe p

973
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,007
People don't like you

974
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,479
Who has been apart of

975
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,759
Stefan molyneux

976
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:34,527
Colt

977
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:37,087
You know he doesn't like to call it back but

978
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:43,487
Cult leaders rarely do

979
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:49,119
Abusive people out of your life and then defining of those who don't agree with my philosophy

980
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:53,983
Exactly you see that sort of thing coming out here now it's and it doesn't happen all the time

981
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,263
But there was enough instant

982
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,055
Pictures of things like that but you like

983
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,359
Alex

984
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,127
Stop it

985
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:00,895
Stop

986
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:07,295
Look at that.

987
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,319
Let's get that out of our mouths

988
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:09,855
Willis

989
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:54,655
Food

990
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:57,727
In school lunch program

991
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:03,103
The children crash

992
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:10,015
Didn't last long

993
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,575
Listen to the entire Eastbound & Down

994
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,135
Baby episode

995
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,415
It's f****** full

996
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,743
I didn't include the last one but he does also sing along with that

997
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,279
The unknown stuntman

998
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,607
Ridiculous

999
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,423
At the end there

1000
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,519
He's getting into what's going to take out the next couple of clips

1001
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,311
And that is

1002
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,847
His idea that they're putting

1003
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,175
Coke and Candy into the school food programs

1004
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,967
To get your kids

1005
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:44,063
All jittery and hopped up on the standard that they get them on pills

1006
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,087
Which

1007
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:47,903
Flies counter to most of Michelle Obama's initiative

1008
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:50,207
2 / 4

1009
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,743
What's healthier than

1010
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,511
Coke

1011
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,303
Who you going to trust

1012
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:03,775
A little too much English.

1013
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:08,127
So that is like alright Alex if you want to start down that path

1014
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,175
You're getting into what

1015
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:10,943
Call

1016
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,991
Slightly dangerous territory

1017
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,271
Because

1018
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,039
You're not a joke

1019
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:15,807
Doctor

1020
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:18,879
But you know I understand there's a lot of conspiracies out there

1021
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,415
This is where you wanted it

1022
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,207
Spend a little bit of time on your show

1023
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:22,975
Heaven

1024
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:23,999
Let's see where he's at

1025
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,303
What happened

1026
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:30,911
Sugar

1027
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,711
Is there not playing sports few hours a day

1028
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,647
Girl your class

00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,183
Meet you at the movies

1030
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:03,167
You're walking home

1031
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,703
That is your power

1032
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,799
Does your soul that's your mind

1033
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,407
Your glands giving you the real drugs

1034
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:25,695
So he's starting off his self his first Salvo that is that

1035
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,975
Mystique

1036
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:30,815
Normal human stresses with people who have chemical imbalances in

1037
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:31,839
You know cycle

1038
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,119
Logical

1039
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,935
I don't want to call it problems or anything

1040
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:38,239
Do people who have

1041
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,031
Siri

1042
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,311
Okay

1043
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,335
He is a syphilis

1044
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,127
Alright

1045
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,663
Because as We Know

1046
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,247
Brightly

1047
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:57,183
Is how you go to the dark side

1048
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:03,327
Is JoJo f****** get past that in the liver Beyond

1049
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:07,679
That is exactly what it said Lord would say

1050
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:10,495
I have opened

1051
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,519
Jordans

1052
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,287
SLK

1053
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:23,295
I would say is it all he is like you just goes on today like

1054
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:27,391
I don't know if you want to be like

1055
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,671
That's a good.

1056
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,255
Go to be with your young kids are trying to give to Bob Chapman

1057
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,303
Obviously,

1058
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,375
Although I think he does believe in

1059
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,423
I think this part he does believe

1060
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,447
Like the

1061
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,727
They give you is like

1062
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,543
Ritalin is evil like all of these

1063
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,639
And all that stuff I think he believes that

1064
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,431
He's not conning people on the

1065
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,479
I'm willing to believe most of it

1066
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,759
He's a

1067
00:56:54,015 --> 00:57:00,159
He's working with con people don't let General stubblebine

1068
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,695
He's genuinely again

1069
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,719
Any kind of

1070
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,487
Prescription

1071
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,023
Right

1072
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,071
Well I mean

1073
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:12,959
Know his Christian Scientist

1074
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,799
He probably wouldn't say this about like it

1075
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:17,823
He threw out his back

1076
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:18,591
Copious

1077
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,991
They

1078
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:27,807
Concern

1079
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,087
Like psychiatric Medical

1080
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,367
Because

1081
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,647
I think rightfully

1082
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,927
They've recognized

1083
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,951
Is that a lot of

1084
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,719
The people who

1085
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:36,511
Salt Lake fall for their con

1086
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:40,607
Happened to be people who have psychological condition

1087
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,375
A good way

1088
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:43,167
To keep people in your tent

1089
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:48,031
Keep them on Medicaid because when they're on medicated they're more likely to have

1090
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:55,455
Parents more likely to isolate themselves from their family like he advocated that other

1091
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:59,295
There's all sorts of ways that you can get them to be more in your camp

1092
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:04,671
And I don't think that is a coincidence

1093
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:07,231
It is 8

1094
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:10,559
Front of the brain active process where he's like

1095
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,095
I need my audience

1096
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,911
Do not get healthier because if they get healthier that leave me

1097
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,679
Or is it

1098
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,215
It's just something that he subconsciously

1099
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:17,983
They understand

1100
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,775
And so he's made that

1101
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,311
Apart of his

1102
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:24,383
Worldview possibility

1103
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,151
It's just

1104
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:27,199
A really easy way for him

1105
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,223
2

1106
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:32,831
Come up with a white scale thing that use blame the club

1107
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:38,207
Now there's another aspect to it where you just consequences better really give a s***

1108
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,255
Well he's not Hawking

1109
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:45,375
So he's not right now he's not replacing

1110
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:50,751
Okay cuz the end of in the presence of course he's going to say don't take

1111
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:51,775
Medication B

1112
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,335
Because Superman

1113
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,871
In the future

1114
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:59,711
I don't I don't think I

1115
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,991
I don't associate

1116
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,551
This level of it with the present

1117
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,087
I'm hesitant

1118
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,879
To put it up on our board as a

1119
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:07,647
Major

1120
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:08,671
Put me in the past

1121
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,695
Present

1122
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:12,255
So it would serve as a giant

1123
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,023
Different

1124
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,607
Can being alright with pharmacology

1125
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:17,887
Like that in the present

1126
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,935
Crazy it would be strange

1127
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:23,263
I think that he would never go as far as he ends up going

1128
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,799
On this episode and oppressor

1129
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,383
Strap it in Jordan

1130
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,943
Because you're only alive

1131
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:38,111
Put your foot down on the pedal brakes

1132
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:56,799
Research

1133
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:59,359
Titrate the dose

1134
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:05,759
You need to bring it down.

1135
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:09,599
Watching too much TV video games

1136
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,647
Getting healthy

1137
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:15,231
Exercising

1138
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:23,679
Volunteer at local soup kitchen

1139
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:31,615
You are star starving

1140
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,663
Is your soul

1141
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:41,087
And then you won't be depressed because by helping others

1142
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:42,367
You are fulfill

1143
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:48,511
So

1144
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:50,815
We need to

1145
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:51,583
Prop up

1146
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,607
The capitalist

1147
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,375
System

1148
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,143
Their bike

1149
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:54,911
Creating

1150
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,191
A lower class

1151
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,287
And people with diarrhea

1152
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:04,639
Help

1153
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:08,991
And feel better better better because you have gone

1154
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:09,759
Can you ding dong

1155
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:10,783
Also

1156
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:18,207
Fully get off their meds

1157
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:21,791
Okay

1158
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:28,191
Like they we hippy-dippy wishy-washy stuff about eat better exercise look at the stars

1159
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,215
I don't hate that

1160
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:33,055
Of Alex Jones

1161
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:35,103
You know if if a doctor was telling you

1162
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,639
Don't stop taking

1163
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,175
You have to lessen the dose

1164
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,991
If you're in the care of a doctor and they're saying that

1165
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,271
Cool

1166
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,807
Alex Jones saying that

1167
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,087
Very different thing

1168
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,135
You know anything about who's listening

1169
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,927
You don't know anything about

1170
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,463
The caller that he's talking to

1171
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:54,815
He doesn't know anything about the caller who he just told their family doesn't respect them

1172
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,863
You know anything about these people

1173
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,911
He's not like

1174
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:01,727
He's not flippantly saying that he's saying the doctors

1175
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:09,151
You got to do is it I'm not saying this but we've got to do is you got to take less and look and if you go in and tell

1176
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,943
You want to take less and less

1177
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:11,967
Nuggets

1178
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:15,551
Cuz they're going to get all that computer to do that

1179
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,855
Jump and then when you say Alex Jones

1180
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:20,159
They're going to be like mobile

1181
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:24,255
Paranoia about the people who are the only people in the position

1182
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,327
Only people who are in a position

1183
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,351
Understand

1184
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,143
Exactly what they're going

1185
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:32,703
Through it all psychiatrists

1186
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:34,239
Start good cuz Lord knows I

1187
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,519
Not a lot in the past

1188
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:40,639
Real Ding Dongs real takes a while

1189
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:45,759
There's a lot of people who were just like get out of here

1190
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,319
You can find somebody and I know that not everybody

1191
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,111
I feel f****** terrible

1192
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,671
Receive everybody

1193
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:57,279
You can find some but Reagan

1194
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:00,351
Somebody who will treat you

1195
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:04,191
I didn't go through find the medication

1196
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,215
That works for you

1197
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:05,983
The Listener

1198
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,263
Thank you about your side effects

1199
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,543
The listen to that stuff

1200
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:10,335
To be able to find what you need

1201
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,383
Live

1202
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,175
Lit cuz that's

1203
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,199
The goal it's not

1204
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:16,735
Create

1205
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,271
Zombie horde

1206
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,039
Alex

1207
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,831
Creating this fear of doctors

1208
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,623
In people in medication

1209
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,439
F*** you up and all this stuff is

1210
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,375
Sync all meds are healthy

1211
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:35,423
I don't necessarily

1212
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,191
Think that I think

1213
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:38,495
There's a lot of over-prescription we talked about that and

1214
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,823
So essential

1215
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:44,383
Alex knows nothing about what

1216
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,711
Take the pharmacology out of it

1217
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,759
Take that inexperience out of it

1218
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:50,783
I mostly

1219
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,063
Interested I've already said

1220
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:53,855
You said again

1221
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,647
He has no idea what these people are going

1222
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,439
He has no idea

1223
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,975
He's being so irresponsible

1224
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,511
This is dangerous

1225
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,047
This could get people killed

1226
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:06,143
I don't know it would be very

1227
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:12,543
Capricious of us if he has a large enough

1228
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,335
Four of them follow this advice

1229
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,895
Stands to reason that at least some of them have died because

1230
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,455
Right or have killed

1231
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:23,295
He said Vista

1232
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,319
Without

1233
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,367
Extensive research

1234
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,695
Getting lucky enough to find some local news story

1235
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:33,279
We can't say with any certainty

1236
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:37,375
We can't necessarily say that actually do cause damage

1237
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:42,239
It's so much potential.

1238
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,055
Some of his listeners f****** showing up a pizza

1239
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:49,151
You know like there's this is this is not

1240
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:53,247
Like

1241
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,855
This is something that has absolute

1242
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,135
F***** up

1243
01:04:59,391 --> 01:04:59,903
Somebody's life

1244
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:02,975
I mean because of his irresponsible if you take

1245
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,767
Alex

1246
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,047
People

1247
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:09,375
Outside of the care of a doctor going off medication

1248
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,167
What is a very large

1249
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:11,935
Cause of

1250
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,495
Very large causes

1251
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,311
Destructive Behavior

1252
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,591
Pacific Pride

1253
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:22,687
All we can say with absolute certainty

1254
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:23,711
Alex

1255
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,247
Advocating something

1256
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,527
That you had no business

1257
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,551
Waiting for

1258
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:30,111
You have no idea who he's giving this advice to

1259
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,647
And what they might

1260
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:33,439
If they get this badass

1261
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,231
This is Joel.

1262
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,511
Scary to me

1263
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:37,535
Are you this

1264
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,375
I understand

1265
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,911
Conspiracies about the medical

1266
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,191
World go for it

1267
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:49,567
Companies that make drugs are

1268
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,919
Prices is pushed upon people

1269
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,687
Bye

1270
01:05:54,943 --> 01:06:00,575
To make those drops

1271
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:04,671
Run with that help

1272
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:11,327
What do look Julie the enemy of my enemy is my friend

1273
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,351
You hate

1274
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,887
Doctors in all that

1275
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,679
Let's go for the source

1276
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:20,799
They can't because they are the right-wing is propped up by a lot of

1277
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:21,823
Pharmacology

1278
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,895
But you can't trust the doctors

1279
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:29,759
Prescribed it you can absolutely trust the kind and benevolent corporations that make

1280
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:36,159
Absolutely he wasn't in prison I'm sure Alex would have Martins

1281
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,183
Crowley on right now

1282
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:39,743
Yeah

1283
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,767
There's no

1284
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,327
Get worse before it gets better

1285
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,887
Alex

1286
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,447
Even further

1287
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:50,751
Yeah I just want to thank you for

1288
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:56,383
Two weeks I didn't hear you say one comment in passing to one of your guests

1289
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,663
It was that

1290
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,735
Holes in the brain actually

1291
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:01,759
Actual home

1292
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:06,367
Well what do you think it is when brain cells die

1293
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:10,463
What do you think it is when toxins go in

1294
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:14,303
Sharks dying

1295
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,319
Is not going to go

1296
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,623
Can't prescribe drugs

1297
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,671
Giving you the garage

1298
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:41,951
Yes

1299
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:47,327
Okay a little bit about the New World Order with him

1300
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:54,239
Yes yes and that's how I knew that basically I do not listen to these people anymore

1301
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:02,175
Call psychologist

1302
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,967
Their power trip over

1303
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:06,015
Can you bring up the Wall Street Journal

1304
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:08,319
Associated Press writers

1305
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:14,463
You can bring on the wall

1306
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:17,279
He will then probably try to have you committed

1307
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:21,631
Because that that that is a threat how dare you say I'm wrong

1308
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:23,167
It doesn't exist

1309
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:40,319
And find out

1310
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,343
So

1311
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:47,231
There's no words for how irresponsible that is

1312
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:48,255
You know

1313
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:53,887
Should be illegal

1314
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,679
How many other f****** Peddlers

01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,703
This b******* are there

01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:59,775
This is a Tale As Old As Time

1317
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:04,383
Paltrow does this

1318
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:08,735
Bulshit like all of these people I will have their alternative metal

1319
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,783
Can go right the f*** off

1320
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:11,807
Like that

1321
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,343
Every

1322
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:19,743
What you need is ginkgo biloba it's natural it's all of that b*******

1323
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,327
Broadcast

1324
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,679
Really really giant

1325
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,215
Especially when he's talking

1326
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:29,983
To somebody

1327
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,287
Who like clearly

1328
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,335
So I mean if

1329
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,639
He's talking to his therapist

1330
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:39,967
If it's a psychologist prescribe

1331
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:42,783
So you saying stuff about the New World Order and stuff like that

1332
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:46,623
In the psychiatrist respond poorly then yeah you should see a new psychiatrist

1333
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,391
Stats

1334
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,415
What do you want because

1335
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:52,255
Mental Health Services are at your direction

1336
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:54,815
You know that

1337
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:58,911
Don't like what's going on or you feel bullied by your doctor

1338
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:03,775
You should talk to them about that if they respond poorly they're a bad doctor

1339
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,567
There are other doctors

1340
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:12,223
It's not a good cause for Alex to be like glass

1341
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:15,039
On the truth

1342
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,343
Like that's everything all all it does

1343
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,135
Is feed into the paranoia

1344
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:25,535
Whatever negative impulses other listeners have other listeners who have fun

1345
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,303
Treated

1346
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:32,703
Conditions that they might need help with the ear this order thinking alike thank God I don't need to go all these doctors are just going

1347
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:37,567
In a f****** manipulate me and if I tell them what I really feel they're going to put me in a box how could you trust

1348
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,335
Any doctor

1349
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:41,407
If part of your part of your

1350
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:45,503
You say something like

1351
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:48,063
There's the New World Order he's going

1352
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:51,647
Illegal

1353
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,927
Unless

1354
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:59,327
Unless you were in imminent danger of army or going to other one

1355
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:02,911
You're danger to yourself and others

1356
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:06,751
Even then

1357
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:09,567
Actually committing somebody without

1358
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,359
A family member present

1359
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,503
A committed without their like

1360
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:20,063
Involvement you need more than one.

1361
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,343
I believe

1362
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:23,647
I shouldn't say that cuz I don't really know but I

1363
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:26,463
Military Tribunal

1364
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,023
I think this is a story I read about Brittany's

1365
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:33,119
Baby I'm not the expert

1366
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,679
No

1367
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,471
I'm saying it would Alex's saying

1368
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,239
Is

1369
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,519
Like we

1370
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:41,567
Dangerous

1371
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:42,591
From him

1372
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:43,871
And I'm not just talking

1373
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:45,663
When Milo came onto promoted

1374
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:51,039
We've heard dangerous and there's definitely other things that he says that

1375
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:53,599
Incredibly dangerous

1376
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:54,879
Very dangerous

1377
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,927
The the world

1378
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,255
This specifically

1379
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:04,095
And I don't know I feel like we haven't encountered something

1380
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:05,631
Flavor

1381
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,679
In our in our time doing the show

1382
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:12,543
I feel bad if we have an responding this aggressively to it

1383
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,079
Because I feel like

1384
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,639
I feel like this is almost a new low

1385
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:17,663
I don't know

1386
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,711
I'm trying to think about I know

1387
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:20,735
I know he's

1388
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:23,807
Old people in the I know will I know we've heard

1389
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:24,575
In the past

1390
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,367
Don't trust

1391
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:31,231
I don't know if we've heard him say actually get off your get off your meds and don't

1392
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:36,607
You're just just take it smaller doses over time and never tell anybody

1393
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:37,631
Cuz they'll have you

1394
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,655
We out

1395
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:40,959
So then he goes on he has another caller

1396
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:41,727
Who calls

1397
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,591
You get back to the topic of

1398
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:47,359
Psychologist

1399
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,383
Again

1400
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,175
Who he's talking about

1401
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:53,247
Amanda

1402
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:56,831
I've been on

1403
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,391
Sertraline

1404
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:03,231
Or well quite a few years and I finally want to come off of it at Justino

1405
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:07,327
Doctors day and they did say exactly what you described

1406
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:10,655
Like why you want to listen your dosage and then you can take the pills in half

1407
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:14,495
And how do I do it

1408
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:16,543
You got to wean yourself off you got up

1409
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:21,407
You know take a half pill for 2 weeks it takes about 4 weeks both ways you know to go on a bill or guapa

1410
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:26,015
Colleges

1411
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:30,111
Medical

1412
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:33,439
Doctors took it up the step higher

1413
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:41,631
This is what the experts yourself

1414
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,775
Such a coward

1415
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:53,663
Cowardly after spouting a sort of face to be like

1416
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,599
Terrible

1417
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:03,391
Unbelievably awful

1418
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,951
And so

1419
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:06,719
Bummer

1420
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,999
That's such a bummer

1421
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:15,935
There's no Lo there's no bottom

1422
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:16,703
That there's nobody

1423
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:19,007
It's just it's just so

1424
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,543
It's the person

1425
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:23,103
Likes to think of how

1426
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,127
I would

1427
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,407
Probably be

1428
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,175
Dead

1429
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,967
If I took his advice

1430
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:31,039
Like I would I would almost certainly

1431
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,319
Yeah

1432
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,855
Like to see how it's changed

1433
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:37,695
Change my life and it took a lot of I went to a bunch of different

1434
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,743
I tried a bunch of different

1435
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,023
And if I had

1436
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:43,583
Done that or if I had just

1437
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:44,351
Ben likes

1438
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:46,911
Because I'm God

1439
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:51,007
Perfect creature

1440
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,311
Set stats so f******

1441
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,335
Disheartening

1442
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:56,383
All the

1443
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,943
All the f****** people who are

1444
01:14:59,455 --> 01:14:59,967
Not help

1445
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:03,551
Because

1446
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:05,087
Of assholes like this

1447
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,879
Because of people who distrust

1448
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,511
Justice League

1449
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,791
Fetishization

1450
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,607
If you don't

1451
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:20,191
It's almost like what he really rather say is

1452
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:22,495
I wish you would never heard of.

1453
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:23,519
That way you

1454
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,799
Proud and

1455
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,079
And confident

1456
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:28,895
A confident in your f****** stupid Behavior

1457
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:30,175
Right

1458
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,223
18

1459
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:32,991
Because

1460
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:36,575
Regardless of what you think about

1461
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,879
At at heart

1462
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:41,951
Part of our our beliefs

1463
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,487
Has to be built around

1464
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:45,535
If you spend your entire life

1465
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,071
Learning about the

1466
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:49,631
If you do this if you

1467
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,167
Continue to learn about

1468
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,239
If you keep doing this as a doctor

1469
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:56,287
You should be trustworthy

1470
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:59,359
Dude hope that's the whole point

1471
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:01,919
That's a whole point having doctors in the first

1472
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,503
Popham sucker whatever I don't I don't give a s***

1473
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:12,159
Are our commitment to actually getting better as a society

1474
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:17,279
But it looked a doctors used to bleed people but we still believe them at

1475
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,559
At the time because they were

1476
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,839
F****** trying

1477
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:20,863
To move the

1478
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:23,167
Society

1479
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:26,239
You know why is that

1480
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:28,287
But maybe took longer than it needed

1481
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:33,151
It took too long for assholes

1482
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:36,735
Realize that you needed to wash your hands when going from an autopsy

1483
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,087
Because

1484
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,367
People don't wash their hands

1485
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:50,047
Yeah I don't know I don't know what else to say about it that I haven't already said I think

1486
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,071
Thing things I've heard from him

1487
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:54,399
Note that the tough list

1488
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:56,447
Real

1489
01:16:57,215 --> 01:17:00,031
So bababababa

1490
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,823
Eclipse

1491
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:02,591
Where we just

1492
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,127
Skip sort of the rest of

1493
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:05,919
What I want to talk about

1494
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,479
Episode

1495
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:10,783
No

1496
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:13,599
Taking the clip of the unknown stuntman

1497
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:20,255
We get a caller who calls in

1498
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,583
Because you know

1499
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:26,655
Beautiful Warriors out there

1500
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:30,239
They don't know how to recognize each other in public

1501
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,031
Whose kids got an idea

1502
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:35,103
Colorado go ahead

1503
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:39,455
Alex I salute you and everything you stand for

1504
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:43,039
I want you to know that I'm one of the legions out here that has your back

1505
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:45,087
Pre-registration

Thank you

1507
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,927
Originally I was going to talk about

1508
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:50,463
Spirituality in general

1509
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:53,279
Specifically fear but I had an idea that I thought was a

1510
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,047
Important

1511
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:59,679
People are wondering how they

1512
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,215
You can talk about with spirituality

1513
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,591
They're going to recognize

1514
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:08,127
The fellow awakened Patriots

1515
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:10,431
Both now and in the coming weeks

1516
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,711
Are likely to get

1517
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,479
Little crazy

1518
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:14,527
I realize we need a sign or

1519
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,295
Symbol

1520
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,063
Call Aram

1521
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,087
So here it is

1522
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:18,879
Picture in your mind the peace

1523
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,439
Flip it upside down

1524
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,463
What do you see

1525
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:28,607
Okay

1526
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:30,911
Alright a victory sign

1527
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:33,727
I see a human with their arms raised in Victory

1528
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:37,055
That's why it's a life sign

1529
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:46,527
Okay well I didn't know that

1530
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:53,695
The tragic irony of this call

1531
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:01,119
Lowest of lows

1532
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:03,679
Planet Fitness

1533
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:06,751
I've got the idea and all ideas

1534
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:09,823
Upside down pizza

1535
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:11,615
Alex is like

1536
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:15,455
I already have a bunch of those t-shirts

1537
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,527
Hello

1538
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:20,831
Most likely

1539
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,879
Gleams like he ozmosis

1540
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:24,159
The idea from

1541
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,439
Like this guy is

1542
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:27,999
Probably well aware of the whites

1543
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:29,535
I don't think so

1544
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:31,583
Scholars reaction

1545
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,911
I thought it look good

1546
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:40,543
And Alex

1547
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,079
F****** love to use attitude

1548
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,383
Obvious

1549
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,687
Go back to the drawing board

1550
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:52,831
Give me a couple of lightning bolts or something

1551
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:56,927
Goddamnit how about

1552
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,463
How about 8

1553
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:01,279
Black star on a redback

1554
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:02,559
Been adopted

1555
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:08,703
The next half hour of the show

1556
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:10,495
Integrative

1557
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,031
Describe the Star of David

1558
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,552
Oh that's a tupana crew

1559
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:32,000
Longer than the other

1560
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,048
And the other bisecting the other but

1561
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:36,864
Literally in a little bit

1562
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:48,128
Little bit later in the show Alex has an interview with a guy named

1563
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:48,896
Alright

1564
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,176
Big fat heads

1565
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:53,248
Where are you at

1566
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,528
Because it's just

1567
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:59,136
It's kind of rambling and halfway through the interview I realize that he's be moderator for Prison Planet

1568
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,160
Message boards

1569
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:04,000
What is like that but they kind of are burying the lead on that a little bit yeah

1570
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,352
He's a new character I think we'll hear from

1571
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:11,168
Listening to him

1572
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:13,984
Is one of the reasons that I believe that this

1573
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:14,752
States

1574
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:16,544
Asserting their sovereignty

1575
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:21,920
I'm a much bigger deal much bigger narratives as we go

1576
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:24,736
And they only mention this in passing a little bit that's why I didn't

1577
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:25,504
Can get a clip of it

1578
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:26,528
But

1579
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,064
The reason

1580
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:30,368
The GT coyote is on the

1581
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,136
Michelle

1582
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,416
Is because

1583
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:34,464
He was an aide to someone in the

1584
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,512
Colorado legislature

1585
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:37,792
Wayback

1586
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:41,120
In the 90s

1587
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:45,216
That they were doing the same thing to try and assert their sovereignty

1588
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:46,496
And then

1589
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,776
You know what happened

1590
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:48,544
Columbine

1591
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,104
False flag

1592
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,176
Columbine in order to get Federal control back in

1593
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,736
This is

1594
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,344
Is this isn't new new stuff

1595
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:07,744
I've heard him say that before I didn't know it was so the federal government could supersede

1596
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,048
Sovereignty plans that Colorado

1597
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,352
He said that for the past absolutely

1598
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:15,680
He gets into like Ruby Ridge

1599
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:17,216
Gets into Waco

1600
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,496
Are those were attempt

1601
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:20,800
Have the federal government usurp movement

1602
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,592
Corrine order to

1603
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:24,384
A certain States asserting sovereignty

1604
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,176
At this folds into a belief

1605
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:28,736
That Oklahoma was asserting their sovereignty

1606
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:32,320
And then wouldn't you know it the feds blew up the Murrah building

1607
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,368
So it's this idea

1608
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,672
Alex is trying to implant the sea

1609
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:39,488
That all of these states that are asserting their sovereignty

1610
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,512
Get ready

1611
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:41,280
There's about

1612
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,560
To be false Flags in

1613
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,608
So that is why

1614
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:46,400
He's been spending a week in half

1615
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:48,192
Okay Southeast A-OK

1616
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,984
It's because he thinks of these

1617
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:56,384
Concurrent house resolutions are going to mean a damn thing because it was hoping to work for

1618
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,408
Expect will be

1619
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:59,200
False flag terrorism attack

1620
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:06,880
And just because he needs to really cancel widenet he's basically saying half the country is are these

1621
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:09,440
17

1622
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:13,792
Sooner or later

1623
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:15,072
21

1624
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:17,376
Sooner or later one of them going to have a match

1625
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,400
Grab something

1626
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:24,544
Cuz we're America flag I got another two weeks worth of material

1627
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,336
And then I got a Year's worth of

1628
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:28,384
Going back and using this as a waypoint

1629
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:36,064
Coyote interview

1630
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:40,672
Yeah it's really not great

1631
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,464
F****** moderator Prison Planet

1632
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:45,024
The interview

1633
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,048
I don't feel like that

1634
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,072
Worthwhile

1635
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:53,984
Quite frankly I have no idea she actually was in the Colorado legislature to anybody

1636
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:55,776
Content

1637
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,056
I mean

1638
01:23:57,312 --> 01:24:00,128
I hereby call it out at some point

1639
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:02,432
I don't give a s*** it's just to me it's more like alright

1640
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,200
Your work Buddy

1641
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:04,736
Gives a s***

1642
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,040
He does spend about

1643
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,112
Super pissed off

1644
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,904
Because someone post

1645
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:12,928
Did a video critical

1646
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:15,232
So we're going to get

1647
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:17,280
It's looking to Alex that get into the house

1648
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:28,032
I had to print out here in my stack I was just got mine started a bunch

1649
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:34,688
What's the name of the Christian God

1650
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,576
That's a little vague around

1651
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,624
Spider goats

1652
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:45,696
Well

1653
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:55,168
Ellenton ice

1654
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:00,032
This isn't about me I'm doing this because

1655
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,056
Is entirely

1656
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,104
This is an example

1657
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,920
Distractions

1658
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:13,344
When we have serious issues in front of us

1659
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,560
The spiritual nature of the New World Order

1660
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:24,864
Mark Dice

1661
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:41,504
Love talking about end times

1662
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:47,904
Never always a good looking

1663
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,952
Donna guy

1664
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,000
This video

1665
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:53,536
Is a guy

1666
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,608
Posting on MySpace

1667
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:01,728
Well I only know that because

1668
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:02,752
The audio is

1669
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:05,568
So bad it sounds like this guy's recording

1670
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,360
He also says

1671
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:10,944
Myspace will only let me record for 10 minutes so I'm going to make this brief

1672
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,136
I want to be like

1673
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,696
Just being put all my cards

1674
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:24,768
On the table this guy in this place video

1675
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:29,120
Alex talked about the spiritual nature of the New World Order

1676
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:29,888
Detox

1677
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:33,728
Really talk about snakes

1678
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:36,032
It's like that

1679
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,568
Company doesn't talk

1680
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:44,736
Like his criticism of Alex is invalid and Alex's response to it is also invalid

1681
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,528
Because he's only doing this

1682
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,576
He doesn't have to deal with valid criticism

1683
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:51,648
Does this sort of thing to create like this

1684
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:58,048
Strawman of people the people who are attacking me spiritual Indiana

1685
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:59,584
Behind it

1686
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,120
Oh that's not

1687
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,400
A religious

1688
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,936
Show

1689
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:06,496
All the time and talk about God

1690
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:08,544
Flash Forward to now and yes you do

1691
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,312
But

1692
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:11,360
But I get I get his respond

1693
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,640
But at the same time

1694
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:16,224
I think back then there probably were some people who were pointing but hey

1695
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:22,624
Every time Bob Chapman comes on your show you seem to bring Ted Anderson and you guys are doing the real clear Vaudeville sales

1696
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,928
Trying to pimp

1697
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,000
I imagine there's plenty of people who have valid criticism

1698
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:34,400
About the content of his show will never want to talk about that

1699
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,424
Guy who sang

1700
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:39,520
He's stupid for saying spider on that later

1701
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:42,848
He's talked about her

1702
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:50,016
No I mean the YouTube video whenever he's

1703
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,832
Not the one about the spider goats

1704
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:55,648
He's right but I'm sure that even that is like so

1705
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:57,184
Some dumb dumb talking about

1706
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,208
Is wrong about spiders

1707
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,256
Look like look

1708
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:02,304
Even even the dumbest of the dumb

1709
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,072
Able to be

1710
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:10,496
You can makeup you can be right that Alex is wrong and still make a bad argument and therefore be wrong

1711
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,264
In the bigger

1712
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,080
Pictures

1713
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:17,152
I'd like to know how

1714
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:19,968
Spider goats

1715
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,528
Oh s***

1716
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,808
Alex band

1717
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:30,464
Non-stop battle

1718
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,512
The purist

1719
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,096
Very racist or the goat

1720
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:37,888
Typewriter ghost

1721
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:42,240
Spider-Girl leadership actually Fighters that have attributes of God

1722
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:48,640
It's not like it's not like the spider still

1723
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,432
Infusion

1724
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,200
There

1725
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,992
Eat spiders.

1726
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:56,832
Because the goats

1727
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:58,880
Spiders hatem

1728
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:00,160
All they got is each other

1729
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:01,184
Climb up Mountain

1730
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:01,952
Crags

1731
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,232
Eat garbage

1732
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:06,048
That's all I know goats do I have no idea

1733
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,120
The grease I ran into a pack of goats

1734
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,704
Rio type

1735
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,496
I get that hashtag not all goats

1736
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,032
But yes I'll go

1737
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,104
All goats rule of eating garbage

1738
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:23,968
Yeah but they have to they have to wrap it in

1739
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:28,064
Kakuna at the drink the blood of the

1740
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:28,832
That's the Spider Guy

1741
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:31,392
A really long self

1742
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:33,952
Defense about this guy

1743
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:36,512
Goodnight fair play Alex

1744
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:38,560
You know whatever you're just not

1745
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:40,608
You're not dealing with real cream

1746
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:41,888
But then

1747
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,936
He's going out to break

1748
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:45,472
Listen to this

1749
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:48,800
We're going to have to deconstruct this 45-second clip

1750
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:49,824
Maybe

1751
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,104
10 minutes

1752
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:51,872
This

1753
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:53,152
He's one of the most

1754
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:54,432
Convoluted

1755
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:56,992
Self-contradicting narcissistic

1756
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,552
I've ever heard in my life

1757
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:00,320
Alex

1758
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:01,856
You can't figure out where to land

1759
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:02,624
Okay

1760
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:06,976
Start this over

1761
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:10,304
Talking about before this is about how

1762
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,352
Should be on the same page

1763
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,656
We all should be fighting the

1764
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:20,544
Specifically

1765
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,080
All of these

1766
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:26,432
Disparate communities that are all Patriot in nature and Christian

1767
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:30,016
Should all be on that we should all be unified as opposed to

1768
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:30,784
Two bickering with each

1769
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:39,488
They just sit around

1770
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,728
When meanwhile

1771
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:53,568
So

1772
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:54,336
Real

1773
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:55,872
He's getting played on

1774
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:59,200
The reason that he pause there was because

1775
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:00,224
He realized

1776
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,248
Oh that's all I do

1777
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:09,184
Focused on one group

1778
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:13,024
How do I how do I

1779
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:13,792
Cookies

1780
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,840
The reality is that

1781
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:27,872
Finished

1782
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:30,432
You can't do it it's crazy

1783
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,200
I love it

1784
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:33,760
Blah blah blah

1785
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:35,040
Meanwhile

1786
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:59,872
Can I just feel sorry for him because

1787
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:04,480
Outbreak

1788
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:13,952
Focus on an exaggerated one group

1789
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:20,352
Does everybody

1790
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:26,752
Jealous

1791
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,552
50% of all these right-wing website

1792
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:40,320
I just

1793
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:43,648
Criticizing each other and upsetting overall this

1794
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:50,048
And they're trying to exaggerate the problem and blow it out of proportion cuz I do it better than you

1795
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:54,400
And that's why I have the biggest website that's why I have the most followers

1796
01:32:54,656 --> 01:33:00,288
That's why you're just jealous cuz I have created a bigger better enemy than you

1797
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:03,360
You created King Kong motherfuker I created God

1798
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:04,128
Villa

1799
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:10,016
Like to me is

1800
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:12,832
That's the kind of Alex Jones I relished

1801
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:15,904
Cuz you're a lunatic

1802
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,672
Clear

1803
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:21,024
The narcissism is coming through the like sort of laughable elements of your character

1804
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,304
Group

1805
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:23,584
So disappointing

1806
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:24,608
Update

1807
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:25,376
Like he is

1808
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:30,240
Still the same person who tells people who he has no idea about the they got to get off their meds

1809
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:31,520
Gone

1810
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:33,312
He wasn't that kind of an a******

1811
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:34,592
He could just be a large

1812
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:36,896
Yeah and blowhards are kind of fun

1813
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:39,200
Especially when they sing Highwaymen

1814
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:40,480
Yeah but unfortunately

1815
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:46,368
You know like

1816
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,136
To talk about

1817
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:48,672
Like the

1818
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:50,976
Prince between modern-day and passed out Jones

1819
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:54,048
Really matter he's a s*** head all the time

1820
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:54,816
Still there

1821
01:33:58,656 --> 01:33:59,168
Who cares

1822
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:03,776
Knock knock who cares about like his rhetoric

1823
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:05,056
It's like who cares

1824
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:07,616
About creating a positive version

1825
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:08,384
Yeah

1826
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:13,248
If we got the chance

1827
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:16,064
Like if we got if we got to do over on Alex

1828
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:19,392
Like I say that there is a God

1829
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:20,928
An X happen

1830
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,488
Right before enzymes happen

1831
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:24,512
We get raptured

1832
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,560
Taken up God's like hey

1833
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,608
You guys got any way to fix her shirt

1834
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:29,632
Ouija

1835
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:31,168
Explain how to make Alex

1836
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:34,752
Go back in time and that he would put it back for the

1837
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:35,776
Eddie Bravo

1838
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:48,832
Supposed to be all-knowing

1839
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:52,928
Woodstock IL

1840
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:56,256
I love the Project Camelot episodes

1841
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:57,792
Thank you

1842
01:34:58,048 --> 01:35:00,352
That's

1843
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,472
It's not. You don't have the money

1844
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,288
Lego

1845
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:11,104
So that brings us together this Patrick

1846
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,128
2009

1847
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:15,200
To move forward cuz I have not had a great time

1848
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:16,224
Listening to

1849
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:18,016
Like five episodes

1850
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,064
I was stuck

1851
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:21,856
For a long time like

1852
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,136
Can finish this

1853
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:23,904
Episode

1854
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:24,928
So boring

1855
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:31,328
I imagine he expected there to be a mass shooting or something like that already

1856
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:34,912
Alright

1857
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:37,216
Alright

1858
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:42,592
I described it as a holding pattern

1859
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:43,872
That's why I think he's

1860
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,152
I think he

1861
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:47,712
Is a man without a third-act

1862
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:54,368
So he's just doing the second acts over and over and over and over again having a boring State rap song

1863
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:57,440
To talk about their states identical bill

1864
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:59,488
If they're trying to push through in the

1865
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,792
The house resolution

1866
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:03,840
The sky and saying rain

1867
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,608
And then

1868
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:06,144
When it finally does happen

1869
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,424
He's going to be like

1870
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:10,240
Isaac so I think that's what we're seeing

1871
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:14,592
I don't remember history

1872
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,872
As some people do

1873
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:16,896
But I don't

1874
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:17,664
Know if there's a

1875
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:19,968
Large-scale attacks coming up

1876
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:24,576
So he might be stuck in this holding pattern for quite a while

1877
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:28,160
But on the plus side we are now only 11 days away

1878
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:29,952
In 2009 from the

1879
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,232
Big break out of it

1880
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:32,768
So

1881
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:35,072
Closer to that and that might distract him

1882
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:41,216
They might

1883
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:43,264
Somehow dovetail into each other

1884
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:45,056
Which is what I'm more suspicious

1885
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:48,128
Okay

1886
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:54,016
10 days of this show

1887
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,552
What I'm thinking is

1888
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,344
There isn't progress with a

1889
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,672
The Narrative these house resolution

1890
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:02,208
Committee

1891
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:05,280
Intuit

1892
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,048
Energy

1893
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,328
He has for this

1894
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,376
Gets folded into the Tea Party

1895
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,168
He starts bringing

1896
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,192
All of that too

1897
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,472
Yeah that might be

1898
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:15,776
I don't know I hate to predicting cuz I'm almost

1899
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:23,200
We'll see

1900
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:28,064
Where are you can go to our Facebook group

1901
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:30,880
Go to iTunes

1902
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:34,208
You can do the other stuff

1903
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:37,280
If you ever listen to podcast you know how they tell you to

1904
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:39,328
Just do that stuff before us

1905
