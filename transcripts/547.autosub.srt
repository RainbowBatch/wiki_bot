I've been already

113
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
To go back to 2000

114
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,191
I'm 34 today's episode having fun

115
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:36,543
Learning about the past and what-have-you last-minute all my plans

116
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,335
You got thrown into whack

117
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:44,991
Alex went down the borders looking for a soul to steal

118
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
Costing somebody

119
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:50,879
I was transporting some children possibly recklessly in the back of a station wagon

120
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,951
Alex and maybe it was more of a van I don't know I don't know car

121
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Types

122
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,815
Anyway Alison is associated with the guy driving the car about how he's been

123
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,119
Smuggling people sure and it is

124
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
A huge mass

125
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:09,055
I don't know what all the details of the situation are at this point but I do know that I don't believe for a second that Alexandra's dumb Posse found someone

126
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
Smuggling children casually

127
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,151
I'm going to wait to dig into this

128
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,943
Until there's a little bit more public information

129
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,503
Can because I can see this going to couple different direction

130
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
And honestly Alex better keep his

131
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,879
Fingers crossed because it looks like a couple things in that video that he released

132
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,927
Could be crimes

133
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:30,559
He's sitting there banging that like on the roof of a car trying to physically stop it from leaving

134
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,839
Which could be a problem

135
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
He is

136
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,191
Acting in ways that some might interpret as defamatory

137
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,983
Irene

138
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:44,383
Does a little bit sound like Alex Jones just started attacking Clark Griswold on the way

139
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,687
Theme park

140
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,967
I'm not illegal

141
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:52,063
Expert but it really looks like his videos an open-and-shut case of defamation against

142
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
What's the charity that is allege

143
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
Be involved

144
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
In this muggle

145
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
This is

146
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:00,767
Catholic Charities RGV address and signs

147
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,583
Clearly shown in the video that's on the accusation is

148
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
Very clear from Alex's actions

149
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
Is essentially a front

150
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,215
For smuggling

151
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,007
This organization is he Catholic

152
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:15,615
Charities of the Rio Grande Valley and the specific building that Alex was staking out was

153
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,663
The humanitarian crisis Relief Center

154
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,711
They began operating Last Summer

155
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:24,063
According to their website this is the at the Sacred Heart Catholic Church

156
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
To McAllen Texas

157
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
And quote

158
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:30,719
The center provides a place for the countless men women and children and intron refugees to rest

159
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Have a 1

160
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,047
Mila shower and change it to clean clothing

161
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,095
As well as receive medicine and other supplies

162
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
Continuing on their Journey

163
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
So Alex was like

164
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,239
Quick someone's acting christ-like destroy them

165
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,127
If you look into the specific charity becomes a little interesting that Alex would do this one

166
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
Want to focus on

167
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,735
The organization was started by a nun named sister Norma pimento

168
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,759
Who was a very

169
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,551
Pearson critic public critic

170
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
Of Trump's border policy

171
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,951
She was also a vocal opponent of Obama's policies but that probably doesn't matter to Alex

172
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,255
She wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post

173
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,303
In February 2020 titled cook

174
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
President Trump don't

175
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,143
Ignore the suffering at the border caused by your polish

176
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,007
In 2019 she was invited to participate in what was called a Roundtable

177
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
Conversation about issues at the border

178
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
Withdrawn himself

179
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
Called

180
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,895
Back in the habit I believe

181
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,223
Sister pimental was disappointed by what she experienced

182
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,783
As she discussed in an interview with Texas monthly

183
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,111
Ask every single person at the table

184
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
To say something

185
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,927
And I realize that when they were speaking

186
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
They were just reaffirming

187
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,535
What it was that he had talked about in congratulating

188
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,375
I realize that the Roundtable was about listening to and reaffirming his

189
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
Plant

190
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,959
He didn't really give local people an opportunity to say any

191
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
Anything that isn't surprise

192
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:51,615
Very recently in March 2021 she was featured in an article in the Rio Grande

193
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,639
Guardian

194
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
It begins like this

195
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,527
The executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley

196
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
Thanks

197
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,087
God for President Biden

198
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
Decision to reverse the Trump

199
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,927
Administration's migrant protection protocols policy

200
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,975
Sister Norma Pimentel

201
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
It's God's plan

202
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,095
Do you have a request of unaccompanied minors

203
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
From Central America

204
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,655
Carefully processed in the United

205
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Sure

206
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,727
Mere days ago on April 4th

207
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:22,591
Sister pimento was interviewed on Face the Nation where she discussed how Biden's changes

208
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
The Trump's policies

209
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
I've trained

210
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
Games for work

211
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,943
Okay so you're saying that a

212
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
Few days ago

213
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,783
Just a few days perhaps even

214
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,855
One or two days before this incident occurred

215
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,135
Play around

216
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
The person who

217
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,487
Began or or started the very charity

218
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
That Alex

219
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
Accosted

220
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
And defamed

221
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:48,959
Who is a longtime public critic of Trumps policies

222
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
For the sake of

223
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,263
They are giving it up

224
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
For morale

225
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
Clarity

226
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,615
Obama's policies

227
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:59,199
It is a Critic of these new policies not going far enough

228
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,783
But inasmuch as they are representative of progress

229
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Areas

230
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
Right if she works in

231
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
OMG it's congratulatory

232
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,439
You are just told me is that this was a

233
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,767
Completely extemporaneous event

234
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,839
Alex was wandering around

235
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
End

236
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
Purge The Cult

237
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
The action

238
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:25,055
No but you're actively ran to stop this human trafficking from a Keurig

239
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,127
Totally believe he doesn't know any of this

240
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:33,759
I actually cared only believe that two could totally be a coincidence

241
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:39,903
I was looking into this charity and like trying to understand a little bit more about it like all the

242
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,695
These things like this is a person who

243
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,999
Someone who Alex absolutely would.

244
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
Despise

245
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,583
But at the same time I can

246
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,399
Totally see this just being a situation where

247
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
He went

248
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,983
To McAllen Texas

249
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,799
Was hanging out outside waiting for the Optics

250
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,871
X2b rice Penny created

251
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,431
Here we go

252
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,967
Yeah that sounds about right

253
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
Federal doesn't go to court

254
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,087
Because I think you can make a pretty compelling case

255
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
That's a Alex

256
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
Has a reason

257
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,183
To have animus

258
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,951
Storage

259
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,719
This organ

260
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,999
Innovation based on

261
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
Are political

262
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:23,679
I'm struggling to live in a world where a judge might disagree with me on what is

263
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:30,079
Is very clearly an open and shut case I don't like living in a world where a judge is like

264
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,687
So I don't really care to deconstruct

265
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,223
This video of Aiden of it

266
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
Just Alex yelling at a guy in a car

267
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,087
On April 8th

268
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
The Catholic Charities release

269
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,183
Statement hoping to clarify the various defamatory claims

270
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
It's made by Alex

271
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
There's box makes total sense

272
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,535
The only thing that guy

273
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,351
The only thing that I think is missing is a threat of legal action

274
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,447
Yeah but again this is up to everybody

275
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,519
To deal with on their own terms and decide whether they want to go

276
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,567
Through that rigmarole and that

277
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,871
Public embarrassment

278
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,151
Oh yeah I would

279
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,943
I wouldn't wish that on my worst

280
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,991
Mom

281
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:14,879
Nevermind I do I would wish that on my worst enemy I wouldn't wish whatever the person suing

282
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,415
He would have to go through all the

283
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,023
I understand why some people are

284
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,303
Reluctantly

285
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,351
Totally but boy this seems like a

286
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:29,215
A pretty easy cake shouldn't shouldn't take shouldn't take too long.

287
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,823
I can't imagine Alex giving a

288
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,223
Blustery speech about how he'll fight this or die and then a week later issuing a public apology to him

289
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,087
Nuns doing all their business

290
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,623
The nuns are good people

291
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:52,255
Did you see Sister Act 2 back to the habit

292
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,583
Video In-N-Out

293
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,655
Itself might be interesting to see what happens on the 8th

294
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,959
This is you know this

295
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
Thursday the

296
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,007
This is after he's

297
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,543
Had the

298
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,431
Social media flare-up for this video

299
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
Punjab

300
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:19,391
Yeah I wanted to see where you was at on that the short let's see what happens or contacts drop from this year

301
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
And if anybody

302
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
The good guy in Ukraine

303
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,047
They've been killing each other for so long Eastern or Western

304
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
Ukraine

305
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,375
It's a it's like the Badcock & McCoys

306
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
What

307
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,471
Is anybody the bad guy in Ukraine

308
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
Is a

309
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Dark

310
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:41,919
What you're focusing on a different heart than Ibuprofen

311
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,967
What to do with the half dachshund The McCoys

312
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,527
I just heard that and stroked out

313
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:52,927
I know the people misspeak and whatever I'm at a contact drop first of all

314
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
And second of all

315
00:14:54,207 --> 00:15:00,351
Anything that Alex is Persona should know a lot about

316
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,423
Fascism

317
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
Yes

318
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,567
Man I want to start a game called to have Cox

319
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
And just never explain the name

320
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,431
I'm sure people are just like what it what is it called in the half

321
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
Cocci

322
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,503
To get windbreakers

323
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:24,927
Related to this conversation entirely

324
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
Steph

325
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
We're going to start here on April 8th

326
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,095
It seems like Alex is leaving

327
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,703
About the Border this video

328
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
The alarm Belzer

329
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,543
China has now with air

330
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,591
Scriptures over 100 shift

331
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,383
Lordship thousand total

332
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,687
Encircle Taiwan

333
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,503
Heavy bombers flying over it

334
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,551
Taiwan East say they may start

335
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,343
Firing missiles any minute

336
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
That was this morning

337
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
Last night there

338
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,975
All hell is breaking loose

339
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:04,607
Russians are massing troops on the edge of Ukraine because Biden sending and heavy weapons

340
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,935
And there are major artillery battles going on

341
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
We are not the

342
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,799
SMS

343
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,591
So we got we got to World War

344
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,175
Together here

345
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,455
Marion

346
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,247
Nicole mind seems to be the lion

347
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
But Alex

348
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,063
Taking that which I find interesting because

349
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
Couple days prior he was

350
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
Really going hard on the

351
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,927
Sparse documentary

352
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
Right right right

353
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,815
And now it's World War

354
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
This is it this is

355
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
Music

356
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:44,031
What I am hearing while he speaks is the advice of a lawyer in his are going

357
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,055
Don't explain

358
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
Anything about that

359
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
Talk about you talk about it

360
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:53,503
You remember what happened with the million-dollar Bounty do you remember I mean you're wrong about that but it isn't

361
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,783
It's weird that he start

362
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,599
What's the show like that

363
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
Corsage

364
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
So if there's a lawyer in a zrt

365
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:05,279
Forget about it very quickly. They're at all times of the reasons that Alex

366
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:10,399
Is going on and starting his shows or the leading with this idea of that world war and all the

367
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,495
Is because that day a bike was giving

368
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
Speech

369
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
About

370
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Skunk

371
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,383
Controlled regulation ideas sure and

372
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
Borin

373
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
Those

374
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,527
Sex

375
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:30,111
I'll make more clear what I mean a little bit later as we go through

376
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,159
But the beginning of their show in a large

377
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,439
Portion of

378
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
At the top of it is

379
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,511
Alex playing Biden speech

380
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,559
And then just a Ramblin over it

381
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
Thanksgiving the courage

382
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:50,335
Fast and Furious killed

383
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:03,391
Done running

384
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:11,583
It sat for awhile it's pretty annoying

385
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
Eight sides

386
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,703
It's a little annoying

387
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,823
He keeps insisting that fast and furious as the Silver Bullet that will take down the

388
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,407
Obiden Administration how long do

389
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,223
To take to get there I seems like that should have happened way early

390
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,039
He kept calling by nobama

391
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,319
Batman

392
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,903
Together for a while he's in calling itself restaurant

393
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,767
I keep calling about Obama's cuz it's AB to run it was right there

394
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,815
It was right there

395
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,607
To get there

396
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,143
This is Alex doing his

397
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,935
His level best

398
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,983
Stop being Rush

399
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,031
Is terrible company they can't even

400
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
Pickup

401
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
Found joke

402
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,407
I would say that if Alec

403
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
Six-word to get sued

404
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,967
Over this video where

405
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,991
He has been

406
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,039
But in my opinion probably

407
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,575
Defaming this charity

408
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
One of his best

409
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,159
Defenses might be that like

410
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,975
Not many people saw it you know it's no big

411
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,255
Big deal

412
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,047
Unfortunately here he is bragging

413
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,887
What happened yesterday

414
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
We put out the video

415
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,663
Look up Leafly

416
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,759
At the login repeal off

417
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,439
Great job they've done and then there's

418
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,487
Catholic Charities

419
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,815
McAllen Texas

420
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,143
And they are loading little kids Han

421
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
Luggage

422
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,263
We stopped them illegal take them out

423
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,967
I don't think you will

424
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,991
Forthcoming

425
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:10,623
I will see though how many people saw this which works against ooze

426
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,207
Eventual probable argument that he's going to need to make

427
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,511
Yeah he's he's

428
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
But then again if he doesn't get sued

429
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,375
There's no legal trouble then I guess

430
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
Yep

431
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,727
Anyway Alex has this

432
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:30,591
Bee in his Bonnet about the idea that people are saying that he staged this whole thing

433
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,919
You went down to the border and he staged

434
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,711
It seems like he didn't like

435
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,247
Capture a coyote

436
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,063
Has found people who

437
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,111
Doing exactly what they said they were going

438
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,391
To be doing

439
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,951
And then how does

440
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:49,279
Literally dozens of national newspaper said

441
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,095
I'm probably stage this there are no crises

442
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,143
McAllen Police

443
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
The trunk

444
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
Xan

445
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,127
Joe Rogan going to pay for it

446
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,943
Top directors out there

447
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,759
Alex couldn't think of One Direction

448
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:16,928
Spielberg now he's a globalist Scorsese now he's a global intern Tina I hate it

449
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,280
Rian Johnson

450
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:27,168
The fan of The Last Jedi what else do we still bitter that I wasn't in Guardians of the Galaxy

451
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,592
Clint Eastwood probably

452
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,640
The media didn't say that

453
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,688
About Alex April 7th

454
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
I couldn't

455
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,528
Find like any media Outlet even really covering this

456
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
Publicity stunt

457
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:47,136
The actual video of Gateway pundit

458
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,184
What the word bunch of random people tweeting

459
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,744
About it I think that Alex was just pretending

460
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,560
Tweet saying that he probably stage the videos the same thing is

461
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,864
Dozens of media Outlets

462
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,424
The national newspapers covering it

463
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,984
What is New Media other than

464
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,800
It's going National man

465
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
I think I've come up with

466
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,128
Situation and that is

467
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,408
Random tweet

468
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,200
Plus narcissism equals

469
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:15,296
Literally doesn't professional newspaper

470
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
What's going on

471
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,928
So Alex is saying that everybody saying that he's just made this up and he

472
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
Staged

473
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
1009 radio

474
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
Albertville to Birdman

475
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
And everybody said that he was make

476
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
Get it up

477
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,376
And the New York Times said

478
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,960
Did not exist

479
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,776
Schizophrenic breakdown

480
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
In the parking lot

481
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,200
Bilderberg

482
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
Was all over the news

483
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,392
Bought it two years ago I didn't believe it it's just

484
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
Looks like a stroke

485
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,440
But

486
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,048
Exposed all that

487
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,072
So f******

488
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
Can stupid

489
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:03,936
A quick search will disprove the idea that the media claimed the Bilderberg didn't

490
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:08,288
Exist until 2008/2009 earlier when Alexandra

491
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
Disposal

492
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:13,408
Princeton's Thursday September 2005 article in the BBC titled quote

493
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,456
Inside the secretive Bilderberg Group

494
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
Or you could look at

495
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,552
Did John Ronson's 2001 book them adventures with a

496
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
Extremists

497
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
Excerpts of which

498
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,112
Were published

499
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
In the guardian

500
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:29,280
And it was accompanied by the release of his TV show secret rulers of the world featured in episode where he at

501
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,072
Alex Jones go to Bohemian Grove

502
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:35,168
No the other episode of it was about the Bohemian the Bilderberg Group

503
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,192
No tweet

504
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,984
There's also a reference

505
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,360
To the Bilderberg meetings in a 1999 wired article you can easily find alright alright

506
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:48,736
What Alex said that the media said that he was imagining the whole thing what do you mean is that no one

507
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,552
Accepted his imaginary framing of real life event

508
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,856
People didn't say that the meeting or the group

509
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,880
Itself didn't exist

510
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,952
Just at the stories that Alex was selling his audience about them didn't

511
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,232
Stand up to scrutiny

512
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,512
That's the accusation

513
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,560
Nothing made up of the Bilderberg

514
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
Excuse me Alex

515
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,424
You're full of s*** can mean many different things

516
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,264
Also I'd like to learn more about how the Drudge Report was secretly sold

517
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,288
The CNN 2 years

518
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:18,176
Sounds like another thing that Alex is pulling out a fitting f****** are about that did you

519
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
Did you look

520
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,480
Deep into that

521
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,040
You didn't did you reach out to Drudge

522
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,832
For comment I looked for

523
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,624
Tax filing

524
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,928
Nonsense

525
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,976
What is overlap.

526
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,024
Between this idea of like

527
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,816
When people are accusing Alex

528
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,608
Taking stuff out there not talking about like

529
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,656
Like the actual event

530
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,728
Video that he shot down

531
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
Same thing

532
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,776
You didn't make up

533
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,312
That someone got in a car

534
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,104
You're just lying about the surrounding

535
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,456
9/11 was an inside job you're full of s*** you don't think 9/11 happened

536
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,504
Obviously

537
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,576
You may have actually said it didn't happen at some

538
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:00,416
I got to review all the tape

539
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,000
So when Alex is making these accusations obviously

540
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,840
But there are certainly ways that he could make the situation worse

541
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,120
Decides

542
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:14,752
To do in this next billion-dollar

543
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
Irwin

544
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
And

545
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,856
If I had the money cuz we're maxed out right now

546
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:35,744
McCowan and in Brownsville

547
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,048
Idiot Wild Wild West

548
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,888
Insane illegals everywhere you go buses everywhere you go

549
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:52,896
We send a drone in there they had a geofence stops we couldn't show them in the dirt but probably croissants that folks in there we have

550
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,504
Children being rape inside the facility we broke that on Monday

551
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,808
About it I mean

552
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,112
Helicopter

553
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,928
Flowers flowers flowers display

554
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,256
And that's why you need to go to infowarsstore.com

555
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,280
We can stay on here

556
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,632
Wow

557
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,680
Has

558
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,240
Infowars

559
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,520
R6S

560
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,056
So you understand why you

561
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
Radio station

562
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
Better like

563
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,944
Missionary

564
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:36,160
There's something a little bit disgraceful about using this as a like directly as a fundraising

565
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:40,000
Holding your audience hostage yeah it also will be difficult

566
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,560
Look for Alex were somebody to sue them for that

567
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:46,400
28mm to argue that he's not using it in order to make money

568
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,704
Because I did literally what he's doing here

569
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,800
And as far as the criminal malicious intent towards the Border

570
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Saying

571
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:59,968
I'm not going to tell the system how or when I'm going to get their names like admitting to a certain amount of suspicious activity

572
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,576
Know if you want to escalate this evening

573
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
Further

574
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,392
Alex has a great idea for you

575
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,184
And that is one of his old

576
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,256
I have to tell you ladies and gentlemen

577
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
Anybody

578
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,816
I don't care about the school

579
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,144
It Ben Shapiro wanted to go down to but

580
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,008
Tucker Carlson

581
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,368
You'll sit there

582
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,440
You can't swing a stick

583
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,744
Check in the dark and not it Smugglers down there

584
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
There is a sense

585
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,608
Alex is giving off that is like you should go

586
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,008
We're all going is going to be a great big fat goes down there will immediately find proof

587
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
Illegal

588
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,104
Human trafficking ring

589
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,920
And you need to know how all these people say white in French

590
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,944
Spearhead the

591
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,224
The nerve to do it

592
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,272
You could get the scoop I don't care about getting the scoop

593
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,808
Everyone to go YouTube

594
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,368
That's a bad thing

595
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:16,768
To do when your when your escalating people's suspicions and believe that they're fighting the literal.

596
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
Pulmonology

597
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,560
To such a height

598
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:21,376
Points and I'll be like all are you all should go down there you'll find

599
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,400
Direct evidence

600
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,704
Pensive all this.

601
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,728
For trouble

602
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,312
He has every single time of the past

603
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:34,176
Like here's the thing about you know you don't want to get into like slippery slope argument with restrict

604
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,200
Acting speech of course

605
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,480
So what I think we should do

606
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,552
Is Right a very very narrow law

607
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,576
That puts out

608
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,880
Step-by-step what Alex did

609
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:46,208
For pizzagate and that is like you just can't do that

610
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,864
All of that stuff you can't do it and then Alex wouldn't be able to do this s***

611
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,496
Always gets a little bit muddy is it like every time

612
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,032
Horrible outcome like a shooting

613
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,056
But

614
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:04,640
We have proof

615
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:10,016
Yeah. Doing the things that live there

616
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
You

617
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,088
Going to or have bun

618
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,136
Inspiring people to go

619
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,160
Terrifying app

620
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,208
Have you really

621
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,488
Any consequences

622
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
Exactly

623
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,048
I would say you've been in

624
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,072
Rewarded

625
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
Exactly

626
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
Anyway

627
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,888
Choked

628
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,728
I don't spend a lot of time on this episode talking about

629
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,008
Trying to take the guns

630
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:35,104
Guys fighting has some ideas about it is a little bit

631
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
Terrifying the prospect

632
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
Acts of

633
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,456
Well you know being able to get kit

634
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,480
Where you can make a gun

635
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:45,088
None of the parts have any kind of serial number how do they back boobie on

636
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:48,416
Untraceable guns it's blade something

637
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,440
In the wrong hands

638
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:53,536
Could lead to a lot of trouble also the ability to adjust

639
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
You know

640
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,328
Buy gun

641
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,656
Guns on the internet I mean they traced f****** cold medicine

642
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,520
I'm not the biggest

643
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,288
Sport in the world

644
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,568
When I was listening to the idea that

645
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,848
Didn't sound like anything that we

646
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,640
2 terrifying

647
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,664
Find

648
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
But anyway Alex

649
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,992
Try not to strangle

650
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
Use bident

651
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:15,808
4A

652
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,088
Provide specific reason

653
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,672
Civil War

654
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,720
This will trigger Civil War

655
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:30,400
There you go that's what's up

656
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,728
Everybody else

657
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,264
This doesn't make any sense

658
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,360
Now the global is plan is to start a civil war

659
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,896
At the behest of

660
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,944
China for some reason and that's going to

661
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,480
I guess kill a lot of people

662
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:51,136
I thought the plan was sucked killing everyone with vaccines and then having an orderly extermination and if that doesn't work then their plan B was

663
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,416
Broly Super bio weapons

664
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,440
Just to kill everyone off

665
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,464
Yeah but that was last week

666
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,536
How did the Civil War or World War fit into that planning

667
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,304
Exactly like

668
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,120
How is gun regulation apart of the bio-weapon

669
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:04,960
Can plan it would be a really dumb Civil War to have it

670
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,520
Like while you're fighting it half

671
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,592
Of your army is just going to drop dead from the vaccine at any moment

672
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,616
It seems like

673
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,920
The plan was these bio weapons of the globalist

674
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,200
Didn't care if you have guns

675
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,736
Eschewed a virus

676
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,576
I kept this clip in to illustrate have none of Alex's narratives mean anything

677
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:25,952
Everything is self-serving and meant to escalate whatever he's decided to make his audience afraid of that

678
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
Day

679
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,744
In this case Biden

680
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,048
Giving a speech on gun reform ideas and dust

681
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,352
The thing the prophet up making the listener scared of

682
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,632
His gun confiscation

683
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:38,496
That narrative doesn't really match up with the whole thing out has been doing the vaccine fear-mongering

684
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,568
You can't really say that the gun regulation is part of the whole biome

685
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:48,736
Darcy pretends that this isn't the entire thing he's been ranting about forever

686
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,832
War that we need to be scared about it's the summer rain dance

687
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:57,952
Also if all Alex's enemies were working for the literal devil it seems like they wouldn't be all on such

688
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,976
Different ages

689
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:04,608
Like if the devil had this plan that they were supposed to be trying to carry out why would China mess around with Taiwan

690
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:08,192
When I could only really get in the way of following through on the larger plan

691
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,264
That seems really weird and I would love Alex takes

692
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,056
Explain what it is so it's

693
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,592
What it is it's a Japanese

694
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:20,992
Please management strategy that the that the devil is using here alright you have many different divisions and you don't share

695
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,040
All the information because they're all working

696
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,832
For the same end goal but

697
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,648
They've got their own strategies it's how you create

698
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,952
New solutions to problems Dan

699
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:34,304
I feel like the devil this devil to be

700
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,584
Singularly folks

701
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,120
Just on one objective

702
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,656
I don't know if

703
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:43,520
There would be a need for teams to be working across purpose at you haven't been reading Japanese van

704
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,568
Benjamin model you do make a fair point

705
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,360
Sunnyway b 14 gun

706
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
Sure

707
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,200
He said that he wanted red flag laws

708
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,248
But that didn't happen so weird

709
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,552
I was being sneaky and it was

710
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,880
Porsche

711
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:04,256
About the red flag laws

712
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,224
We got Biden saying

713
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,808
Anybody about you your guns are gone

714
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
How's the time

715
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,952
Civil War civil war Civil War

716
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:39,840
So this is how Alex wants to remember Trump's comments on red flag laws but that's not what Trump said

717
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,936
This was in 2019 after the mass shootings in Dayton and El Paso

718
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
Trump

719
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:49,568
First we must do a better job of identifying an accident on early warning sign

720
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,176
I'm directing the Department of Justice to work in partnership with local state and federal

721
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
Media companies

722
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,504
To develop tools looking

723
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,552
Can detect Mass Shooters before they strike

724
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,648
That doesn't sound like a judicata someone is mentally ill that seems like

725
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:06,464
Talkin to like social media taking the post

726
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:11,072
Social media to identify people who may be on well and then getting their guns taken away

727
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,608
Almost like Alex thinks

728
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,888
Reality is whatever

729
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,704
Fits his narrative in it

730
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,752
Honestly would Trump was talking about

731
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,288
Way more invasive than

732
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
Draconian anything that

733
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,384
Trump lied on

734
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:30,272
We must reform our mental health laws to better identify mentally Disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence

735
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:34,880
And make sure those people not only get treatment but when necessary involuntary

736
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
Confinement

737
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,208
Seems like Alex should be against that pretty

738
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:38,976
Strongly

739
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,256
These people have not committed any

740
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:45,376
Any crimes but because some globalist doctor is saying that they might commit one we should have laws that they get locked up

741
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:51,776
Pre-crime a truck wants to bring in the guys in the cat Tom Cruise movie cogs in the mission

742
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:56,128
Visionworks

743
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
Boris

744
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,224
Trump continue quote

745
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,016
We must make sure that those judged

746
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,040
Suppose a grave risk

747
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:07,136
The public safety do not have access to firearms and if they do those Firearms could be take

748
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,416
Come to Rapid due process

749
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,488
That is why I have called for red flag laws also known as

750
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,768
Extreme risk protection order

751
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,120
Today I'm also directing the Department of Justice to propose legislation

752
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:21,216
Ensuring that Those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the death penalty

753
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,008
And it has capital punishment be delivered

754
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,592
Decisively in without years of needless delay

755
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
Yeah

756
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,640
I have a Libertarian type

757
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,688
Open someone who's insanely anti-government

758
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,736
Alex should be really afraid of a president calling

759
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,016
Expedited Desitin

760
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,808
Especially since Alex thinks

761
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,624
Most people who commit mass shootings are secretly Patsy

762
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,696
Also that was the speech where Trump said quote

763
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,744
May God bless the memory of those who perished

764
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:44,768
Toledo

765
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,536
And may God protect

766
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,584
Because you misread a teleprompter

767
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,352
Shooting was a

768
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:53,984
Hey way the point of this is that Alex has created an ageist oracle version of Trump's response

769
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,776
The mass shootings in his public support

770
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,800
Red flag laws

771
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:00,128
Because what tribe advocated is directly counter to a lot of what

772
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:01,920
Make sense as Alex

773
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,456
It's kind of messy

774
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,736
I think it's

775
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:08,832
Easier to hand wave it away and say the past is the past

776
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:12,160
So let's move on and think about the future Trump as a president anymore

777
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,464
We don't need to think about all the stuff he's

778
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,232
He said it

779
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:22,144
Even sputtered through that in that's what we don't learn from history here

780
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,960
That's not deal with what was said realistically about

781
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,496
Have fun

782
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
Who do you think

783
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
The world's most

784
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,616
Powerful.

785
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,176
The world's most powerful doctor

786
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,480
Doom

787
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,248
Sure

788
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,272
He has his own country

789
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:44,672
Exactly he's pretty powerful I don't think he's very

790
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:51,072
Rich's house I think you really cheated the game there

791
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:57,472
Has lightning powers right

792
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:03,872
Super stretch man to the doctor to he's more powerful

793
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:18,208
This is why people think that I don't get I'm not amused by think you said I was just laughing really hard but silently

794
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:21,536
Naturally

795
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:28,448
Superwoman was a doctor to write

796
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,776
I'm not doing well today

797
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,848
I'm not even a dork and I know these names

798
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:38,944
Honestly I was going to call her mrs. invisible

799
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,784
She married to him

800
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:49,184
I think so

801
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,464
Military guy

802
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:54,304
I think the Thing and Human Torch word like

803
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,888
This is like this card is beyond.

804
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:02,752
Military guys and then Invisible Woman and Reed Richards

805
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,520
Where doctors

806
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:09,664
Still dr. do more powerful away

807
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,432
You know it

808
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,760
My point is that if you Google it you'll get a different

809
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,064
Who runs the UN

810
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,424
Who is the most powerful doctor in the world

811
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,984
Who is the most powerful it says Bill Gates

812
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,056
Powerful.

813
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,128
He is in charge and he will do what

814
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,408
He will to you

815
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,944
So this is actually true

816
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,480
If you Google the words

817
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,552
Who is the world's most powerful doctor the results

818
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,576
D'usse Bill Gates

819
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:54,976
This is because the Search terms identically reflect the title of a 2017 Politico article titled quote

820
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,280
Meet the world's most powerful dr. Phil

821
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,048
It's okay

822
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:02,400
The article itself is highly critical of gators outsized influence on the World Health

823
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,936
Organization

824
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,216
Has a major donor

825
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,520
But it's not critical in the same way that Alex might be

826
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,080
For instance the article points out that quote

827
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:14,688
Rather than focusing on strengthening Healthcare in poor countries that would help in their View

828
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,968
To contain future outbreaks

829
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,504
Ebola epidemic

830
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,040
The agency spends at this

831
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:22,624
Proportionate amount of its resources on project with a measurable outcome

832
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
The gates

833
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,160
Prefers

834
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,208
Such as the effort to eradicate polio

835
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:30,048
I don't like the fact that this Google search result comes up

836
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,072
It's a web

837
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,608
Flight Enviro recently

838
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,400
As it has in the past a couple times

839
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,704
I was probably just about on social media now he's

840
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
Complaining about

841
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,240
Michele watches

842
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
Really sad

843
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:43,872
Read the Politico article has he would recognize that

844
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,920
Actually would be like

845
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:46,944
This is

846
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,736
Kind of critical is gay

847
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,528
That that kind of doesn't work

848
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
Yeah

849
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,088
It really seems

850
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,880
Far too obvious

851
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,184
To say that a billionaire shouldn't have anything

852
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
To do with

853
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,232
Just about any decision

854
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
Regarding

855
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
Well

856
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,072
Especially

857
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,352
Health in the modern world

858
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,680
Yeah I think it's a complicated question and I think that

859
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:13,312
Based on the fact that there are political articles like this there are people in the appropriate places ask

860
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,336
Can go sort of quest

861
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,872
And wrestling with it

862
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,152
Anyway

863
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,712
Because Alex has found this Google search result that he thinks

864
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,992
The real cool

865
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,272
You let himself off

866
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,040
The chain in a little bit

867
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,464
Powerful doctor in the world

868
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,768
I'm going to kill your ass Bill Gates

869
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,168
Meet the world's most powerful doctor

870
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:39,936
And for

871
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,848
Search results Italia

872
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,992
Call Laura

873
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Family Shelter

874
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,320
Family Show

875
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,624
I'm going to put it in yet

876
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,672
Not something that I want

877
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,768
Repeated anywhere Nas and it's not fun

878
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,352
So title

879
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,632
Is ironic

880
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,936
Or sarcastic at least

881
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:16,032
With the world's most powerful doctor Bill Gates yes he's not a doctor that's the point of

882
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,592
The title you said this is not

883
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,616
Exactly

884
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,432
He's picking at you

885
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,224
Sarcastic headline literally

886
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,784
I just wanted to be sure about

887
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,112
You good

888
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,904
Reading comprehension is he

889
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,696
Jam

890
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,976
Someone else is good at

891
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,280
Like guitar

892
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,608
And being a real creep I don't know if he

893
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,400
Google is it though

894
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,960
Things

895
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,752
Looks collar I don't know anything about this

896
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,568
Nugent on the show

897
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,360
I got to say

898
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,407
Uncle Ted sounds like a

899
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,943
A bit more of a lunatic

900
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,223
Then usual

901
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,039
This is an incredible time to be alive but I'm glad

902
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,575
Ted Nugent is there

903
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:05,183
Always saying that seriously

904
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
Priorities

905
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,095
I think we should quote

906
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,143
The greatest philosopher of all time

907
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,191
Dirty Harry

908
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,495
When he said a good man knows his limitations

909
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,871
Against the curse of self-inflicted

910
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,175
Creature that

911
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,015
Commander-in-chief is crazy

912
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,551
The Nugent

913
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,855
Family is living the American dream

914
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,903
He always sounds like he's on coke

915
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,487
But he claims he's 70 years sober

916
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,023
My immediate

917
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,559
Thought was he got about

918
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:43,839
Halfway through sentence

919
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:50,239
And I was like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa you just slow it down there already

920
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,543
Going a little too fast to be taken serious

921
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,311
It's like yeah

922
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,711
Sounds nuts

923
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,527
He doesn't live in the Motor City anymore

924
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,575
Part-time

925
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,879
Wild somewhere in Michigan

926
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,207
Making this metaphor

927
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,511
It's pain

928
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,535
I think

929
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,607
I think in this metaphor Old Yeller is the

930
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,375

There are Americans today that are hiding

950
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,631
Everybody believes in Freedom

951
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:24,703
You have to be a member of the National Rifle Association

952
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,543
Association

953
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:35,199

961
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:05,663
Ted Nugent interpretation of Romeo and Juliet I would like his explanation is

962
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,711

964
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,319

965
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,719
Kill the governor

966
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,023
Strange metaphors

967
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:21,791
Interesting

968
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:26,655
So Alex has gone and done this possibly defamatory video about this Castle

969
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,423
For charity

970
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:32,031
Newton I might not want to sign off on that video.

971
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,079
In case I don't get ensnared

972
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,383
I don't want to actually be on

973
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,455
Like public records

974
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,479
Hey that was an awesome

975
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:44,063
Something you did and I'm glad I helped you playing it with you

976
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,367
Peacefully

977
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,439
Communicate on a regular basis

978
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,327
And all the different incredible

979
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,727
These children

980
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,591
Doing it

981
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,871
He plays dumb

982
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,967
We have to spot

983
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,015
Cockroaches

984
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,807
These devil cockroaches

985
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,599
This is not good

986
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,647
This is very not good

987
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:20,927
That's not

988
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,975
A couple of

989
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,511
Is clearly talking about Alex's.

990
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:29,631
Absolutely there's a couple of huge problems I have with it number one

991
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,167
And obviously is

992
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:31,935
Ted Nugent

993
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
Is not allowed to

994
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
Traffic ahead

995
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,239
Traffic

996
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,543
Unaccept

997
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,591
Pitbull Behavior

998
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:42,943
Animal behavior and I want to know the spelling of demonic

999
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,247
Because immediately following dumb

1000
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:48,831
It should be dumb onic right dumb

1001
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,415
Yeah minutes on paper properly

1002
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:56,511
So is God jumping from Zaire

1003
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:59,071
Is endorsing Alex's video we got to flush out these

1004
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,631
These folks the demon

1005
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,399
How are you

1006
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:06,495
Started saying it didn't need to kill people who are like the people at Alex's video

1007
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,943
Dedicated

1008
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,991
To save

1009
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,559
These devils

1010
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,375
Q4 that they're more more people

1011
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,471
You can't identify

1012
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:38,751
Told me that the mouth

1013
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,519
Dogs

1014
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,055
Then go back to your garden

1015
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:46,431
You have to deal with the rabid dogs you have to eliminate the rabid dog

1016
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,271
Collier Wildlife Control

1017
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,295
Call somebody

1018
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,831
Set metaphor Fowler Park

1019
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,599
Yeah

1020
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,367
I think

1021
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,159
We're listening to

1022
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,463
Ted Nugent

1023
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:04,863
Taking these sort of ideas that Alex had about everybody's got to go down to the Border

1024
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,655
He's going one step further it right you have

1025
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,423
To take action

1026
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,727
Against the people who are traffic

1027
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,775
And a boy

1028
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,055
You know that

1029
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,079
Get really out of

1030
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:17,407
If your standard of whose trafficking people is as low

1031
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,431
Alex's

1032
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,223
This is this

1033
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:26,623
This is directly inside and see this is really f***** up

1034
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,415
Do a pizzagate it's against the law

1035
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:33,023
He was just talkin about literal dogs about a dog has

1036
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,071
What is pi

1037
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:38,143
Have like some stuff on your glasses and then you just

1038
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,423
Is murder a dog

1039
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,007
Maybe you should think a little bit more I can't stress enough how like

1040
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,543
I saw that video

1041
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,591
Like this song

1042
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,663
But you know this is Alex doing what he does

1043
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,199
I hope you get sued for it

1044
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:57,855
He's kind of encouraging people to go and do what he's doing it

1045
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:00,159
I think that probably bad that seems like

1046
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,183
Kind of behavior

1047
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,463
You've done in the past

1048
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,791
Nothing could have prepared me for Ted Nugent

1049
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,815
Coming on

1050
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:10,143
And making this pained metaphor that he's so much worse

1051
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,959
It seems to imply that what people need to do

1052
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:13,983
It's come down there

1053
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,007
And kill people

1054
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,287
Who are trying to help

1055
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:19,615
Asylum Seekers and refugees

1056
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,919
F***** up yeah I don't know if there's any

1057
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:27,039
Thing that could prepare you for a sudden appearance of Ted Nugent telling you to murder

1058
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,855
In a bad metaphor

1059
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:32,927
That's it that's that's something that I

1060
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:36,767
How to Kool-Aid Man levels of surprise

1061
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:39,839
Now much like the Kool-Aid man he barges through walls

1062
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,607
Also you know that

1063
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,655
We're about to get someone else barging through walls

1064
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:43,679
And that is

1065
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,447
Ted Nugent

1066
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,727
Sun

1067
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:52,127
Sure actually do

1068
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,943
Talk to him a little bit

1069
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:57,759
Here we go

1070
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:01,087

1072
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,815
Physical aspect

1073
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,631
The terrestrial

1074
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:24,127
Who's really behind the cabal

1075
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,247
Lacking energy

1076
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:33,087
They're installing slaughterhouses that are

1077
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,791
Yasso Rocco

1078
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,351
Ted Nugent son is in

1079
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:48,447
Spiritual side of this another new laws I should be against the law to grow up rich

1080
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:51,007
What I heard right there

1081
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,031
No

1082
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:55,359
So I wanted to understand a little bit more I never heard

1083
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,127
Ted

1084
00:50:56,383 --> 00:51:02,527
Son I've never

1085
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,551
That's fun

1086
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,343
Thank you so ever

1087
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,647
This guy's Modern Life

1088
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,695
Hahaha apparently

1089
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,743
Consists of putting out YouTube videos

1090
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:18,143
Are you driving while you're driving

1091
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,679
This was terrified

1092
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:26,847
Hello

1093
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:39,391
The download to be shared today in this phone

1094
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,183
Wow

1095
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:46,047
The highways being driven on

1096
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,887
Is a message that just came through

1097
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:56,287
The reference point many know as Archangel Michael and my

1098
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:00,639
Archangel Michael

1099
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:07,039
He's almost been like the older brother that that you didn't really know because like you were really

1100
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:13,439
Young when he was at home and then he left for like the military or something

1101
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:18,559
Then you like grew up and then he came back he's all Western

1102
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:24,959
Transform and then he leaves and never comes again and so it seems like this

1103
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:31,615
Discipline

1104
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:38,015
Bigger brother a dead bolt to your Highest Potential

1105
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:44,415
He has this sword at least in my interfacing with them he has a sword that he carries around with them

1106
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:50,815
A sort of light and it seems Seems also be a sword of the Divine

1107
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,375
Elaine personified in

1108
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:57,471
Any device in a moment as a sword to predict

1109
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
Everything

1110
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,823
I believe he's saying that

1111
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:08,479
The Archangel Michael has a lightsaber shaped like a penis is essentially what I'm hearing

1112
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:11,551
YouTube song put that videos where he Rambles about how he talks

1113
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,319
What's the angels

1114
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,087
Yeah

1115
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,671
Cool

1116
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,743
Wow okay so

1117
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,143
Spirituality that is kind of

1118
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,679
Untethered

1119
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:34,079
And a little bit Project Camelot

1120
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,615
That older brother who went away

1121
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:39,711
Join the military and then came back to you and also has a giant lightsaber sword that looks

1122
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:43,551
Like a dick he gave him a download download spoiler alert

1123
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,623
The greatest fomo if you're missing out

1124
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,159
No the Grado

1125
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:50,719
No you do not know you do not

1126
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:52,511
Continue series

1127
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,351
The greatest fomo

1128
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:59,935
Is missing out you could have been if you didn't get

1129
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,215
Get your s*** together earlier

1130
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,079
Really really

1131
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,103
Really need to

1132
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:07,871
To throw a thing

1133
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,175
Archangel Michael

1134
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,223
Blow Minds

1135
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:15,551
I was thinking like okay I can play some more things

1136
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:19,903
Things from these videos that are just kind of silly that just kind of

1137
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,927
Kind of

1138
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:21,951
Content

1139
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,487
Is the kind of stuff that I'm like

1140
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,535
I got to go I got to get away from there

1141
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:28,351
Better I could tell you

1142
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,631
And that is

1143
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,679
The Ted Nugent son is also a rapper

1144
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,215
No no

1145
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,055
Oh God

1146
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,911
I had lost my face

1147
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,191
Hello

1148
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:07,775
Myself

1149
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:10,847
Windows

1150
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,663
With that I

1151
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:19,295
Yeah I found that is a little bit to make a compelling argument for there being

1152
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,087
Too much autotune

1153
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,135
Yeah yeah that's that's

1154
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,415
Definitely the man

1155
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:27,999
How much would it suck to not even suck as much

1156
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:28,767
Is Chet Hanks

1157
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:34,655
Slug that's bad I feel really bad because I don't want to like

1158
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:37,471
Mock someone's creative Outlet

1159
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:38,751
That's bad

1160
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:41,311
But also I want a Moc rich kids out

1161
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,079
Creative app

1162
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,103
But I'm fine with that

1163
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:50,783
I mean I think that this is not Quality Music

1164
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:57,183
Not. Even the best

1165
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,207
Worst son

1166
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,767
That's the worst part about it man

1167
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:04,095
Morocco

1168
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,631
And his Modern Life

1169
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,959
Yep

1170
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:11,007
They leave

1171
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:15,103
The Nugent family leave

1172
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,127
Prince wife is a really

1173
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,711
Qanon support

1174
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,039
Good Times

1175
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,599
So I believe

1176
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,367
Lights

1177
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,903
A literal Campbell

1178
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,439
But maybe it's also a metal

1179
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:35,839
I'm being honest and listeners are the metaphysical 3090 God's real

1180
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,703
Fire on yourself you got to share with other people like

1181
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,471
The panel

1182
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,055
Lighting here in studio

1183
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,359
On TV and radio with a simulcasting

1184
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,663
America's Plano

1185
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,479
Republic Supply Mound

1186
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,551
I can't do it we continue to share

1187
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:58,367
But if they're able to realize this and make it speak

1188
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:04,255
They don't have

1189
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,303
Power to do that anymore

1190
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,351
Alex is becoming more and more of a prop

1191
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:09,631
Yeah

1192
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,703
Yeah so he's doing like one of those

1193
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:19,103
Christmas candles where you only burn it for the let you know it's like red green red green red green and every day before

1194
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,407
You burn the red one off

1195
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,687
And then you turn it out

1196
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,223
And then you burn the green one up

1197
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:26,015
But it's for the end of the Republic

1198
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,295
Something like that

1199
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:29,087
Yeah I just like

1200
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:31,647
You know what he had that skull and

1201
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,415
Yeah

1202
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,975
Goblet or whatever

1203
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:37,791
And I'm asking you what is this

1204
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,863
Because I want to talk about

1205
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,191
The metaphor of a candle but I also want you to be able to see it

1206
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:44,959
I just

1207
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,495
Become yours Bowman

1208
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:49,311
Before this where he screamed at some

1209
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,079
18 year old

1210
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,639
Get me a candle

1211
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,407
No problem

1212
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:56,223
Pretty good chance

1213
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:00,319
It's not really covered a lot of news

1214
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,599
But he has a lot of articles in a

1215
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,367
Sackbut

1216
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,135
Who cares

1217
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,767
Read articles

1218
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,351
A little piece of it

1219
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,631
Talk about our works

1220
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,423
About a Howitzer deployment

1221
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,799
You get caught

1222
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:23,615
Forget your God by giving it all your attention

1223
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,431
Whatever comes out of these

1224
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,455
People's miles is myth

1225
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:29,247
Kill your ass

1226
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:32,575
Wow decision.

1227
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:39,231
What you need to know is that I need you emotionally aroused at all times but if you learn

1228
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,023
Anything that will stop

1229
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,047
I don't think

1230
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,863
Think that there's any better encapsulation of Alex Jones's

1231
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,655
Stars 02 style than that

1232
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,519
Spend an hour on this the information all the

1233
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:54,847
Pokemon new to get really into the Wii

1234
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,639
Ewok

1235
00:58:56,895 --> 00:59:00,991
Yeah we can really get into this but just know that whatever they're saying they're trying to

1236
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,831
Really there's no point for me to have

1237
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,111
Any of this in front of

1238
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,927
So instead

1239
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,951
Nopales

1240
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,719
Call CY

1241
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,487
What you could do

1242
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:14,303
Roanoke or trying to kill you

1243
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,351
Instead of

1244
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:18,143
The weeds and really figuring this out

1245
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:18,911
He decides

1246
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:19,935
Spend his time

1247
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:24,031
Course means complaining about Saturday Night Live

1248
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,335
We never are.

1249
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,895
What is the ID for Saturday

1250
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,527
But but they're like

1251
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,831
Coming up on Saturday Night Live

1252
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,879
Black people won't take the vaccine

1253
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:41,951
Do they have a black guy with a British accent like he's smart

1254
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,231
Black people aren't

1255
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,535
Pull up

1256
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,071
YouTube

1257
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,631
Briana Manson on fire

1258
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,447
Black people BBQ

1259
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:58,079
In watermelon

1260
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,895
Southern Voice

1261
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:03,711
You are no Sully sullenberger

1262
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,991
Literally them

1263
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,551
Pictures making fun of black people

1264
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,599
With a black guy with a British accent

1265
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,647
The big races to them

1266
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:15,743
Because of their acts different when they are saying they're fighting racism

1267
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:19,839
These people

1268
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,631
Pierced me off man

1269
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,191
What

1270
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:24,959
Okay

1271
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,239
So

1272
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,543
One did you see that I said I'll sketch

1273
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,847
I I saw the first little bit

1274
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,127
Yeah I got it

1275
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,687
You got it

1276
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:37,503
I think there is some people who took umbrage

1277
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:42,623
Rightfully so that was probably a poorly conceived

1278
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:49,023
I think there's people did not enjoy it you can find articles and all

1279
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,559
Sort of media

1280
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,839
Expressing that Center

1281
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,143
Maybe poorly can

1282
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:54,911
Instructed

1283
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,703
And conceived

1284
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:59,263
Alex's point about it

1285
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,543
Is outrageous

1286
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:05,663
I think he was trying to say that it was a racist sketch but he did so by being

1287
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,455
More racist towards

1288
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:09,759
Yeah yeah

1289
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,551
Person who's hosting

1290
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:15,135
Hallelujah

1291
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,159
Yes

1292
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:18,463
He's not doing the British accent in that sky

1293
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,487
He's not know

1294
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:20,767
Specifically

1295
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,815
He's not doing a British accent

1296
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:24,863
Having

1297
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,191
I think that what happened is that Alex just saw like

1298
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:34,591
Outraged compilation of like Thomas's jokes from the model

1299
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,127
He knows that the guy is British

1300
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:44,831
It carries over to the sketches while would understand how the structure of Saturday Night Live works

1301
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,599
No absolutely

1302
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:50,975
If you haven't seen the sketch the idea was

1303
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:53,023
And his family won't take the vaccine

1304
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:55,839
Game show

1305
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:56,607
Why do

1306
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,399
Get them to take the vaccine

1307
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,935
He keeps offering money

1308
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,959
Yeah

1309
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:05,055
The correct answer would be yes

1310
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:08,639
One of his family members played by Keenan

1311
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,431
He

1312
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:13,247
He asked what he would do with the money if you want

1313
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,807
Johnny says I'll roll up some

1314
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:19,135
Smokes weed or shows of big barbecue block

1315
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,927
Rock party going get a new grill

1316
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:25,023
Or whatever and that Alex has extrapolated out into being like

1317
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:28,863
Trying to entice black people with BBQ right watermelon

1318
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:35,263
We even more race that's what I was saying he didn't mean to add the more races fire

1319
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:40,895
You know like you get it because they were creating that caricature that they love

1320
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,687
What to do on Celebrity Jeopardy

1321
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,735
But what actually happened is they

1322
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:45,759
Relied on

1323
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,807
Stereotypes to make fun of

1324
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,879
So I think the Alex thinks

1325
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,647
That

1326
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,415
Because

1327
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,183
This sketch

1328
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,207
Is clunky

1329
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,743
And possibly

1330
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,279
Someone defensive

1331
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,559
It gives him carte blanche

1332
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,095
Do even more race

1333
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,167
Give you the Bible

1334
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,447
No

1335
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,471
No

1336
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,263
Show

1337
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,031
No

1338
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:13,663
Do you black people solving BBQ

1339
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:17,503
This is what I'm talking about

1340
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:20,831
Everything they say we are

1341
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:21,855
Is them

1342
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:25,183
What about fentanyl for Dragon I was going to say also

1343
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:31,583
Kind of sounded like he slipped into fentanyl the dragon there

1344
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:37,983
Accident exit 92 slipped into a racist Chinese accent so that's great

1345
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:41,823
Aliando

1346
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:44,127
Tries to play the clip

1347
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:45,663
Antifa

1348
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,223
Heritage

1349
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,527
Ready

1350
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,319
You guys get pulled up real quick

1351
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:10,495
Computer messes up about 1% of the time

1352
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:14,847
Million-dollar computer

1353
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:15,615
What is locked

1354
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:17,919
Bushwacker

1355
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:19,455
What

1356
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:20,735
YouTube

1357
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,271
Backup

1358
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,295
You know

1359
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,855
You got to restart it I mean it's it look

1360
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:30,719
Get the million-dollar machine but it still runs Hot 100

1361
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:35,327
It doesn't even run on Windows 98

1362
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,119
I wonder if like

1363
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,935
What actually happened was that there was like

1364
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:42,495
Producer in his ear during that long silence is like

1365
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:43,519
Hey there

1366
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:49,407
Those voices that you're doing in the way your characterizing his catch if you play the skin

1367
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,687
You're going to be shown

1368
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,967
You are a race

1369
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,551
I wonder if that's what happened

1370
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,319
Makes sense

1371
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,367
Based on the incredibly long pause

1372
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:01,439
And then eventually they do play what Atwood I think is

1373
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:03,743
Be outraged compilation that he's on

1374
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,279
The only thing that he's aware of

1375
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:08,095
Right which is the clips of the monologue and then

1376
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:11,679
Short clip of a trial right he's written the story about it in his head

1377
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,703
It is more races

1378
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,727
Suspend the original

1379
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,519
Wild wildly racist

1380
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,543
Ria

1381
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,823
So at this point

1382
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:21,663
Alex has a reporter named Sheila Gunn Reid

1383
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:22,943
On his show

1384
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,991
She is a reporter with

1385
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,527
Rebel

1386
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,319
Sure sure

1387
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,087
Trustworthy

1388
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:33,695
Great yeah she's on to talk about a certain Church

1389
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:34,719
In Canada

1390
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,559
For having me Allison Stokke

1391
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:44,959
Your ongoing interest in the story with the Main Street

1392
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:45,727
Believe

1393
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,007
This church

1394
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,799
The Flash

1395
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,079
Point

1396
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:52,127
For Religious Freedom

1397
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,407
During the pandemic

1398
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,759
Was arrested and incarcerated for

1399
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,039
435 days

1400
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,831
In a maximum-security

1401
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,111
Provincial facility

1402
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:05,439
For refusing to limit his congregation

1403
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,231
To 15%

1404
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,535
Capacity as per the

1405
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:10,815
Public Health order is

1406
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:13,119
Here in Alberta he refused to comply he said

1407
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,935
So he was taken into custody

1408
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,471
He's been released

1409
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,823
Has not stopped

1410
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,871
So this is the grace Life Church

1411
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:24,895
And Alberta

1412
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:29,247
Like Sheila was saying the pastor this church Dreamcoat was arrested

1413
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:32,319
In February after repeated breaches of covid safety measures

1414
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,879
He was given multiple opportunities and Warner

1415
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:36,415
To follow the rules and they refused

1416
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,183
To do so

1417
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:39,231
So he got arrested and then released on

1418
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,023
The condition that he stop breaking the rules

1419
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,559
Which immediately preceded the break

1420
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:45,119
Literally everybody involved was like

1421
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:48,191
Dude we don't want to do this

1422
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:54,591
Well obviously you want to turn yourself into a f****** martyr in response to his trouble

1423
01:06:54,847 --> 01:07:00,991
A group of 28 Community leaders from various religious backgrounds released a statement that quote stressed the need to pry or

1424
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:05,343
Vertise the well-being of all members of society over individual needs during the pandemic

1425
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,159
Had to follow the directives of Public Health officers and the

1426
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,695
Someone acting crazy

1427
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,975
Tell them

1428
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,255
Jeff this week

1429
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:15,839
The Alberta Health Service shut down the church by putting fences up around it

1430
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,375
Until the church

1431
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:21,983
Demonstrate the ability to comply with Alberta's chief medical officer of Health

1432
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:28,639
Do you hear what they said that you are timeout put you in time out

1433
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:35,039
Till you can eat your goddamn vegetables you don't get to go to church use the phone

1434
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:38,367
Prank call people or whatever

1435
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,415
Are they closing the churches

1436
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:46,047
Kind of murky territory honestly and I'm not sure how I would proceed if I were in charge there but this is

1437
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:46,815
Is Canada

1438
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:51,423
If a local folk there in Alberta a terribly posted is closer than they can work on that with the local

1439
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:53,215
Will government but from everything I've seen

1440
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,519
Pretty much everybody outside the church itself seemed

1441
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,287
Spine

1442
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,311
Yeah

1443
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,591
The fact that they do know

1444
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,895
You're not going to follow the restrictions they're not even

1445
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:05,503
The restrictions are 15% capacity

1446
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,063
Live stream

1447
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:14,463
We don't want to put you in jail they would be stupid this is stupid you're a child

1448
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:16,511
Ways to work this out anyways that work

1449
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,791
Look for everybody

1450
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:23,423
15% capacity that he's supposed to follow

1451
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,215
But you're not everybody has to

1452
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,823
Percent of

1453
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,359
But the Walmart

1454
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,455
30%

1455
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:40,319
A fire

1456
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,343
Or if you're going to

1457
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,111
Praise God

1458
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,391
This is embarrassing

1459
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,927
Pretending to not understand the

1460
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,695
Capacities

1461
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:47,231
Four different things

1462
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,255
Like I would

1463
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,535
Totally back

1464
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:53,375
That Walmart would have a 15% capacity order if it were a place where people

1465
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,679
Congregated for long periods of time

1466
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:57,727
Satin Place insane

1467
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:01,311
The things you do at Walmart while you're wearing a mask

1468
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,591
Which they didn't do with this

1469
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,639
Oh that was released

1470
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:07,455
I assume that they all still warm

1471
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:11,551
No that's required to wear a mask to enter the Walmart

1472
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:12,575
Around

1473
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,855
And leave

1474
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,159
That's why

1475
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,695
Dababy you could have 30%

1476
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:21,279
Capacity there safely as opposed to a building where everyone sits

1477
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,559
NSYNC

1478
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,351
Yeah that is that is like

1479
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,631
Listen

1480
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,679
I know the word is supposed

1481
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:28,959
To be mainly Gianna

1482
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:30,495
Madrid-based but you are being

1483
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,263
Up to

1484
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,055
That is

1485
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:37,663
So Alex gets to talking about his sparse

1486
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:43,039
Conspiracy a little bit I thought he was kind of done with with Sheila and

1487
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,831
The church

1488
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:46,111
But he does say this

1489
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,135
And I think it's silly

1490
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,695
Broadcast world

1491
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,767
125 2028 Dodge Demon

1492
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,559
2000700

1493
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,887
73000 views

1494
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,191
Sounds great

1495
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:05,055
100

1496
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,687
I'm not doing

1497
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:13,503
And put my life on the line

1498
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:16,063
Mexican border where they shoot helica

1499
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:16,831
Shoppers

1500
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,879
Doing all this

1501
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,159
Yeah I think

1502
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:25,279
Illustrative to it's like Alex's gauge of being able to beat the globalist

1503
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,047
To do with his meds

1504
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:32,447
Traffic-related we will win if we get 100 million but then you won't Global it's just

1505
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,727
Watching The View

1506
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:39,871
S*** he's at 99999999 illusions

1507
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,759
Ridiculous

1508
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,295
So

1509
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:50,367
I thought it was a little bit irresponsible that Alex is

1510
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,647
Largely

1511
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,439
At least

1512
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,463
Southerleigh

1513
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,999
Maybe not-so-subtly

1514
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:59,327
Encouraging people to go down to the border and behave as he did

1515
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,351
Yeah

1516
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,143
I just took cost

1517
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,935
People trying to help. I think that's a

1518
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:06,751
Humanity is generally

1519
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:09,567
Widely-recognized to evolve Society

1520
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:15,967
By killing people trying to help the only effect that that could possibly have is escalating the situation raisins

1521
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:17,759
Temperature beyond the point where

1522
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:20,063
It's easily handled by

1523
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,087
Multiple people

1524
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:23,647
This is not the only instance of him doing this on the

1525
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:30,047
Everyone in Canada can get there I said of USB reporters are so controlled

1526
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,071
As your legal alien

1527
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,863
Everyone should go there

1528
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,911
Pizza

1529
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:37,215
Thousand people show up

1530
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,007
It will turn the tide against

1531
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:41,823
Don't you agree everyone should come there tell us where it is

1532
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,639
That church is just

1533
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:48,991
Just west of the capital city of Edmonton Alberta

1534
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:51,551
A couple of miles outside of the city limits

1535
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,831
It's very easy to get

1536
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,439
It's theirs

1537
01:11:57,695 --> 01:12:01,023
Get there and the landowner

1538
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:03,839
What is the address everyone must go now

1539
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:06,143
It's Grace

1540
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:06,911
Church

1541
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,703
Everyone's got to go

1542
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:10,239
I want to go to the church

1543
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,519
Christian Woodstock

1544
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,311
Haha glad means jars of

1545
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:15,103
Play will be performing sure

1546
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:19,199
Going to reunite

1547
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:26,623
Red Hot Chili Peppers is going to play with just the socks on and engine sun is made of

1548
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:30,719
Yeah it seems irresponsible

1549
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,023
It's kind of worse

1550
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,327
51

1551
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:37,375
520 or 5

1552
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,167
51529

1553
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:41,215
A Range Road 262

1554
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:42,751
Spruce Grove

1555
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,031
Baby

1556
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:44,799
That right

1557
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,079
Yes

1558
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:50,687
It's going to be like on cuz you're just like me

1559
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,551
The preacher

1560
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:00,415
Okay you're under attack store we

1561
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:03,231
All of us need to go there if you're in Canada

1562
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:07,839
Near the borders getting legally go there peacefully give Aid and comfort

1563
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,887
Thunder Tricom

1564
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:10,911
Governor

1565
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,775
Pack the chai, agent I just showed you him pledging Allegiance is easy painting

1566
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,543
Trudeau

1567
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:19,359
Everyone should go there that they're scared aren't they

1568
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,407
Trudeau did no such thing

1569
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:24,735
Yeah it's this is irresponsible and certainly help

1570
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,015
Nothing ends up happening

1571
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,295
Bear that Alex might

1572
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:28,575
Badin

1573
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,343
In hindsight

1574
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,879
Giving the address out

1575
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:37,023
Soliciting an inciting people to go because of the church is under attack by the

1576
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:40,095
Communist Chinese and Justin Trudeau

1577
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:41,375
Bucked up

1578
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:44,959
Yeah there's no other way for that it's like it goes two ways

1579
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:45,727
Is it goes with

1580
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,031
A bunch of people showing up and being like

1581
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,311
Dogshit this

1582
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:56,223
Or a bunch of people showing up and getting whipped into a mob and like let's go down to Miles and start wars

1583
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,807
Can literal devil

1584
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:01,599
It seems like the latter is more like

1585
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,671
Yes I don't know I don't I don't think

1586
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:06,207
Is good

1587
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,487
Obviously

1588
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:12,607
Alex I've never ever seen

1589
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,143
Overt satanism

1590
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,679
In real life

1591
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:19,263
Good

1592
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:22,847
Satanism like that

1593
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:25,919
As you and I both

1594
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,455
Through all kinds of people

1595
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:29,503
This person drones

1596
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:33,599
Bring women and children

1597
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:36,159
Who is church there looking at me

1598
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:39,743
And this guy screams

1599
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,303
Churches being closed

1600
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,167
And he says to them

1601
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,959
Even the church

1602
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,031
Follows mask

1603
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,311
And that's what you should do

1604
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,079
As a Christian

1605
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,103
If you're telling me that

1606
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,855
Kristen even we wear masks

1607
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,623
That's

1608
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:09,951
That's the level of

1609
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,231
That she's

1610
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,255
Man

1611
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,303
This is the weakest of

1612
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:19,679
This is weak. I would even have bought it if she was just like

1613
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:21,727
He screamed out the window I love Satan

1614
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:28,127
Because then it's like yeah of course you say that s*** there seem to be as willing to let it fly

1615
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:28,895
Hi is Alec

1616
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:29,663
No

1617
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:32,479
Do what it do you just like hey guys

1618
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:35,039
Ostensibly you're most

1619
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,063
Evil

1620
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,879
Worshippers in the world are still

1621
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:43,231
Where's more concerned with Public Health in our fellow man than you

1622
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:48,351
Don't want people to die of disease do you die do not understand

1623
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,887
You are in this situation

1624
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,191
Satan

1625
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:55,775
Truckin around

1626
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:56,799
That sounds more like

1627
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:58,847
Like that

1628
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:00,639
And all this is going on

1629
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,407
Until Alex

1630
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,943
Encourages something

1631
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:05,247
He should be careful with his language

1632
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:08,319
I'm telling my listeners I'm showing them

1633
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:11,391
If you live in Canada whether you're 500 Mi away or 20

1634
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:14,207
You must go there bring some muffins bring some food

1635
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,743
Support these right people

1636
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:19,071
Because the system is wrong the line here the enemy

1637
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,863
Online at your church

1638
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:27,007
Is there Stalingrad

1639
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,799
And I think we should make this their Stalingrad

1640
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,103
Weeaboo

1641
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,895
Chosen this is their Stalingrad

1642
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:35,711
Stalingrad

1643
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,783
This is what

1644
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,855
Also not for nothing the Soviet Union 1

1645
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,391
That battle

1646
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,463
The communist

1647
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,487
Metaphor

1648
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:49,279
Also Stalingrad wasn't

1649
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,303
Incredibly violent

1650
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:54,399
I don't know if Alex wants to evoke

1651
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:57,471
Responsible

1652
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:59,263
Imagery surrounding

1653
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,567
What he's trying to incite

1654
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,359
People to go be a part of

1655
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:06,175
Yeah I'm going to be I'm going to be honest here

1656
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,711
Okay

1657
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:11,039
Here's what I'm putting together on this very episode he said

1658
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:11,807
Literally like

1659
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:13,343
Everything

1660
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:16,159
Everything they say we're doing is what they're doing

1661
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,439
Right right

1662
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:21,791
Now I would say that that is revelatory about what he's doing

1663
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:23,583
End

1664
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:30,751
I'm going to say that he worships Satan because this is the only no no no no no

1665
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:33,055
I think it I don't think he stopped

1666
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:37,407
That's the long-term theory of yours

1667
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:41,503
This episode is really

1668
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:43,295
There is

1669
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:44,831
Multiple incitements

1670
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:45,855
Yeah words

1671
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:47,135
The Listener is going to

1672
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:47,903
Two places

1673
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:48,927
Better Alex

1674
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:50,463
Seems to want to

1675
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,487
Get out of here

1676
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,255
Yeah

1677
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:54,047
A little bit

1678
01:17:54,303 --> 01:18:00,191
S******* pastor of that church I would be like Alex no no no no no we don't know what that

1679
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,215
Support

1680
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:02,495
But you're the

1681
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:04,799
Your bad support

1682
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,847
Really honestly

1683
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,127
You know Sheila wants to

1684
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,151
Bring up it

1685
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,175
This could all be

1686
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,199
Solve this

1687
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:14,015
All the Pastors in the area where

1688
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:20,927
Against this guy in the area

1689
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,487
Isn't this church

1690
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,279
Sacrifices

1691
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,727
Mozart

1692
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,007
God knows it

1693
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,055
No boy

1694
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:44,223
These are World Council of churches

1695
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,759
Rockefeller pants

1696
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,039
So this is

1697
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:49,343
What point of the episode where I was sort of Lost

1698
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,111
Thought

1699
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,135
Started

1700
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:53,183
Interesting thought

1701
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:53,951
Experiment

1702
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,487
Experiment

1703
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,279
Rhetorical question

1704
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,815
Sure do you think

1705
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:03,679
Did Alex Jones good name of Living member of the Rockefeller family

1706
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,215
Absolutely not

1707
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:07,007
0% chance

1708
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,543
Pretty good now

1709
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:11,359
I do like that this this also

1710
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:17,759
Please into what should be very obvious to anybody is if it weren't for

1711
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,295
Immigration and racism

1712
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:22,623
Christians would be murdering each other left and right they hate each other

1713
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:25,695
They don't believe the same s*** they're all nonsense

1714
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:31,583
Well I mean like there are letter of the 28th religious leaders

1715
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:34,143
In Alberta that they were all

1716
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:34,911
Like I come on

1717
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:38,239
But seriously take this seriously

1718
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:44,127
Even the Church of Satan is with that letter was delivered from a truck

1719
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,991
It's rare that you get you know the Chris

1720
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,015
Jin Muslim

1721
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,575
Buddhist

1722
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,343
Communities

1723
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,623
Walking

1724
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:56,415
Arm in arm

1725
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:59,231
But this church

1726
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:01,279
Is enough of a pain in the ass

1727
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:03,583
Oh my God guys

1728
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:05,631
What's a bad name

1729
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,679
Alex is trying to get people to go

1730
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:08,703
XXX Church

1731
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:10,495
Be there Stalingrad

1732
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,543
Someone stalling

1733
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:13,824
Anybody

1734
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:18,176
In order for this to sound better

1735
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,200
If you want

1736
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,480
Sheila

1737
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,248
What to do it

1738
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:26,368
Tell everybody to go that

1739
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:32,768
Absolutely somebody else in your crime

1740
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:33,536
Is Alec copes

1741
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,328
Copy what I said

1742
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,656
5000 people tomorrow at ten thousands weekend

1743
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,936
They jump the shark

1744
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:41,472
Call Eureka.

1745
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,264
Beautiful beautiful soul

1746
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,800
Oh my God.

1747
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:51,456
If people are going to come to support

1748
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:53,504
Cummings company

1749
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,272
Peacefully

1750
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:00,160
They would appreciate your support they need it now

1751
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:03,232
More than ever gave their church has been seized

1752
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:16,032
I really don't want to see either

1753
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:19,616
I'm saying that everyone needs to hear that you call for that I'm going for it

1754
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:23,712
Absolutely

1755
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:28,832
Super religious group

1756
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:29,856
Journalist

1757
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:30,624
To do

1758
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:33,696
Hi Galaxy

1759
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:36,768
Reporters do they come on shows and trying

1760
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,584
Murders

1761
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:42,400
I mean if she

1762
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:47,264
She's supposed to be covering this story it doesn't make sense for the interview to end with him begging hurt

1763
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,544
To call people

1764
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:50,592
Come to the

1765
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,360
Church

1766
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:52,896
That's weird

1767
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,712
This isn't any kind of

1768
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:56,992
Reporting

1769
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:59,552
Suzette best activism

1770
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,136
Hayden reality

1771
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,416
Excitement

1772
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:07,488
This episode is nuts

1773
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:09,280
Sheila's you're a bad person

1774
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,328
I'm happy

1775
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,376
I don't know enough about her to relive

1776
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:16,192
Full picture but

1777
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:16,960
Crying

1778
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:23,616
Just a little more neutral that I wants right to I do agree with you there he doesn't understand that Alex

1779
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,408
Like she's talking to a guy who's

1780
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,200
But a parody version

1781
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:29,504
Right-wing media Outlet

1782
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,552
Oh boy she's used to

1783
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,832
You know

1784
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:34,880
Seriousness

1785
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:38,464
I don't necessarily want

1786
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:41,280
Get sued

1787
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,816
FIFA care

1788
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:46,656
Is where I clearly walk people to f***

1789
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:47,424
Mtume

1790
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,472
I fear consequences

1791
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,496
Is an Alex

1792
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,776
Apparently doesn't

1793
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:56,128
Canada we might get consequences in America Alex receives done

1794
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,152
Alex has learned over

1795
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,944
Over the course of his career not tours

1796
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,224
Back to the idea

1797
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:03,296
Of chickens coming home to roost

1798
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,112
Then that's why you babes away.

1799
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:09,184
I listen to this episode and I was blown away by like

1800
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,720
Okay I thought that video was bad

1801
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,256
I still think

1802
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:16,608
I think it's legally actionable and you know whatever

1803
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:20,960
I didn't expect for the episode afterwards to be worse

1804
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:22,752
Yeah I was I was

1805
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:29,152
Surprised I thought we were going to have a little fun clowning on that dumb video I hadn't seen it so I was you know I was waiting

1806
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:30,688
For the show obviously

1807
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:37,344
And watch to see we got a concentrated bouillon cube of race

1808
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,136
Resume and incitement to violence

1809
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:40,160
Yeah

1810
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:40,928
Yeah

1811
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,464
And I really I mean

1812
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,000
I mean this

1813
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:46,560
I hope that nothing happened

1814
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:47,584
Yeah me too

1815
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:50,912
His behavior in the past has led to people

1816
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:51,936
Going

1817
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:55,008
And f****** with people and victimizing people in Waze

1818
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,288
That re respond

1819
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,312
Possible and terrible

1820
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:58,336
And

1821
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,616
For him to have

1822
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:03,712
Targets of like everyone's got to go to these places

1823
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:04,480
In one

1824
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,248
Day

1825
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:07,296
Is really really scary

1826
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:08,320
What it could be

1827
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,624
It could lead to nothing

1828
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,160
The danger is there

1829
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,464
I just don't think

1830
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,768
Yeah I mean

1831
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:19,840
Can't you see in a courtroom like

1832
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:25,216
When this trial we aim to prove that Alex Jones another

1833
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:25,984
Pizzagate

1834
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,520
But so

1835
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:31,360
If we prove that then he goes away forever right that's good

1836
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:33,152
I don't know I don't know

1837
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:35,968
I don't know how you do that

1838
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:37,248
In court but like just dropped

1839
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:39,040
For the sake of like a Podcast Addict

1840
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,320
Explores the same to her

1841
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,856
You can definitely say

1842
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:44,160
You behaving in exactly the same ways

1843
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:46,720
Has he has one things have gone bad

1844
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:52,352
Not good we should learn from the things that have already have

1845
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:54,144
I think that would be wise

1846
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,168
Yep now

1847
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,448
Fingers crossed

1848
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,984
Things work out okay

1849
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:05,408
And I guess we'll find out. Go to the Border

1850
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:09,760
I strongly call on everyone do not do either of those things

1851
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:13,088
I'm in favor of people

1852
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,672
Cocktail

1853
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:20,768
Better than going to the Border or a weird Church in Canada

1854
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,048
I think so

1855
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:32,800
Monday

1856
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:33,824
But
