52
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
20 years ago

53
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,632
There is this like turn-based

00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,704
A strategy game like a civilization called master of magic

55
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,728

00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,288
To play that with my childhood friend like

57
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
Obsessively

58
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
20 years ago

59
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,176
What I found out recently though

60
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,712
Is like 10 years ago

61
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,760
Somebody who also loved that game

62
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,832
Made a mod for civilization 4

63
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,416
So I got everything set up and it's f******

64
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
Perfect it is

65
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,024
Exactly the experiences that I wanted 20 years ago

66
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
And it is nailing it

67
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:25,215
This is all fifteen-year-old ship that's awesome I've got it on my old computer and it runs per

To go over

78
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,631
I got to be honest jorja

79
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959

00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
I'm going to go get some

I'm going to pray to Jesus

83
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,847
We got some in here

84
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
I need to talk

85
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
I need to talk to you

86
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:10,783
Alex Jones going on Joe Rogan

87
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,343
Lot of apple juice and scream and I need to talk to

88
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,671
I will say that Alex

89
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Does

90
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,791
Drink about half a bottle of whiskey by the end of this

91
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
Yeah how many hours is it

92
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:29,727
3 hours and 11 minutes half a bottle in 3 hours and $11 of Alex's favorite

93
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,543
11 minutes

94
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,175
He their satanic baby peanut

95
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,247
3 hours

96
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:45,087
Drunkard like it's not

97
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,183
The end is really depressing the end of this episode is it

98
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,975
Incredibly f*****-up address

99
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,559
But there's some fun stuff along the way

100
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,631
Oh I'm going to Prescott

101
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
I killed those dogs

102
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,335
I'm going to say that I think that Joe Rogan

103
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Prize

104
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:13,503
Sure however I don't think he's committed to what he's pretending to do just holding Alex Jones to account

105
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
For claims that he make sure

106
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,647
And I also would say that there is literally no way to do an interview like this response

107
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,231
You just can't do it and I think it's demonstrated by the fact

108
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
The Joe Rogan is

109
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:28,351
Presumably trying and it failed so miserably

110
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
Sucks

111
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:34,495
No he failed miserably and unforgivably when he booked Alex again

112
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,055
Didn't we didn't even need the show

113
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
True

114
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,383
The whole premise of like

115
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,431
You're my friend I think you're fun

116
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:46,015
This fun

117
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:50,111
I apologize I've been working around the clock to

118
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135

119
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671

Today

125
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
It is what it is

126
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
Here's another context drop

127
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
From Jay Chou

128
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
You want to watch so crazy

129
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
No

130
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:23,135
I love that that's nice it's nice no no I do not

131
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
Not interested

132
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
If you start

133
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
You're not going to stop

134
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,791
Generally had watch

135
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,351
Rogan show on YouTube

136
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
Because it's there

137
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Sure

138
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:39,263
I decided that this time I was going to download the audio

139
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
Podcast

140
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,127
Just have the audio version

141
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:48,735
In case anything happened to it like maybe it mysteriously disappear from Spotify

142
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
But apparently

143
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:56,159
Since that has happened it's gotten back up on Spotify

144
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
I don't know what's going on today

145
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
Don't care Vine

146
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
Glad you don't care

147
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,095
One thing I didn't realize is that Rogan does AD

148
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,655
Hello friends

149
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,751

Congratulations on being associated with this

152
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
I thought that was surprising

153
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
Because there's no

154
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,783
There's an ad the beginning of this episode

155
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
Who's Alex's mortal enemy

162
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:46,335
Even funnier when you realize that squares director and also co-founder is Jim McKelvey who is also on the board of directors

163
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,639
Actors for the Federal Reserve Bank in St Louis

173
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
Doing ads

00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,679

I think it's

185
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
Remarkable The Joe Rogan

186
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655

188
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,567
He has all kinds of revenue streams he doesn't need to do this

189
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
I imagine maybe it's

190
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,407
Partially I don't know

191
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:31,807
It's so much money we live in the world you and I you and I

192
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,855
You and I live in a world where we did

193
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,159
You know if we had a hundred billion dollars we wouldn't

194
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,743
I don't know I don't think we do this yet

195
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,727
But it's just one of those things like there's no into Kapa

196
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,519
You know it's always

197
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Hey

198
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,103
Just because you're making enough money doesn't mean you couldn't be me

199
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Making more money

200
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:02,271
And I'm not I'm not criticizing I'm not hating the hustle narrator think it is what it is

201
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,063
This was surprising to me

202
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,343
Because I didn't think

203
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:09,695
That this was the way that his show a break cuz I'd only watched

204
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,767
Not on the YouTube versions

205
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,559
I thought that is a little bit

206
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,839
Strange and also

207
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,423
Tucci's Squarespace cash happened

208
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,495
Did you know that there are associated with everything that comes up later

209
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,543
I need to be proud of themselves

210
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,943
So here's the first clip that is not an ad and it's Joe Rogan welcoming his producer

211
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
Jamie's back to the show

212
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,063
Back in the saddle

213
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
How you feeling

214
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
Covid free 4 days in a row now

215
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
What

216
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
You still can't

217
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,303
You look at my battery

218
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
Really just

219
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
But you don't have any

220
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:05,247
No residual symptoms except for I can't taste the pickle juice man

221
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,551
People are crazy

222
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:12,927
F****** crazy didn't want to be too judgmental about the idea that this show is happening at all is nuts

223
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:19,583
On October 19th is reported in Forbes that quote popular podcast The Joe Rogan Experience has temporarily been struck down

224
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,655
Down by the coronavirus after a key member of Rogan's team test

225
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,191
The positive for covid-19

226
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:30,847
Obviously I can't possibly be privy to the kind of precautions and such that they take or whether or not the announcement on the 9th

227
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
People's delayed

228
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:38,271
From when Jamie got the positive diagnosis but it absolutely blows my mind that they would think it's a great idea to have people sitting in it

229
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
Confined space

230
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:43,391
4 hours talking and drinking when one of them recently had covid

231
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:48,255
I understand that the Rogan podcast is big business in these two she adds got to go somewhere

232
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,815
Episodes

233
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,655
Revenue stream biking little bit

234
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,519
This seems a little irresponsible if not for their own sake

235
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,335
Then for the message that it sent so the audience about how nuts

236
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,639
Seriously they're taking these things

237
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:09,503
You're four days free right that means that we're all safe and you kept it in a day

238
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
BJ's pickles

239
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,599
One of these stronger taste

240
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,647
I need to just start carrying around more

241
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,439
Routes to throw

242
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,255
That's if I saw Joe Rogan anywhere it's

243
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
A tomato

244
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,559
To the face

245
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,399
As soon as I can unleash I'm going to promise you this short I'm growing some tomato

246
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Okay

247
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:33,567
You are growing tomatoes Farm to face

248
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
We're going to make this happen

249
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,687
Here Alex gets introduced

250
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
A nerve

251
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
Sales

252
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
Alex Jones

253
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,159
This is the most anticipated thing I ever did I probably had no exaggerated

254
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
200000

255
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
When are you going back on Joe Rogan

256
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
I don't know I don't know

257
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
You're moving here

258
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Months ago

259
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,631
Now we're here this

260
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
This is exciting

261
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,703
I don't get to a butterfly's anymore by taxi

262
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
The album here

263
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
This is great

264
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
It's good that a butterfly

265
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Didn't get the last

266
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
Didn't get it when I interview Trump

267
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
I got butterflies there today

268
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
I got butterflies

269
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
Lying piece

270
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
Totally

271
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:20,415
You f****** like you even said to Trump I've got butterflies right now he's f*** you

272
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:26,559
You lying piece of s*** all these guys like one of the things that they are primary

273
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:32,447
Way they operate is to flatter each other ingratiate themselves

274
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,239
Like when we go on other people

275
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,311
Apple podcast

276
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:42,687
Podcast is 7 hours long there's no way I say so

277
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,271
Great but come on man I expect anybody to have time to listen to this

278
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
In the past

279
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,367
Whatever Alex has been on Rogan podcast

280
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,927
Has been accompanied by 180 Bravo

281
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
So is a goofy

282
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:59,839
Kind of funny bring some levity to things

283
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:06,239
Flat Earth charm to

284
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
Kind of

285
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
Soft the edges

286
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:13,663
Of whenever Alex and Joe Rogan are sitting here having a stupid conversation

287
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,735
This time Eddie is not there

288
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,319
However there is a third participant is comedian Tim Dillon

289
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,879
Who is comedian do we know him

290
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:27,743
We have some mutual friends I don't know if I've ever met him

291
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:32,863
Well I don't want to meet him anymore feel like we might have crossed paths as when I was in New York

292
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:39,263
Visiting but I'm not entirely sure I don't want to say that cuz it sounds like

293
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,079
I don't know I don't know I do know that

294
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,127
There are some circles that overlap

295
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,711
Yeah I think I remember the name and it's either because he was

296
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:54,111
At Jamie's one time whenever I was there too but maybe just hanging out or something

297
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,415
He's pretty good

298
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
I understand

299
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
Like

300
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:05,631
I think the only memories that I have of him is people I know telling me he's a nice guy

301
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,495
Yeah I don't know I don't know

302
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
I will say that

303
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,567
He is not as fun as Eddie Bravo

304
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
And

305
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,919
As a third wheel it's weird

306
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:24,575
I'm also there's another Dynamic it's going on and that is The Joe Rogan is currently doing sober October haha to drink

307
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:29,951
Lincoln quote on quote Apple Juice you are and Tim doesn't drink so he's high as hell okay alright

308
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:36,351
Sampling of it we might see it

309
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:40,959
Mixwell

310
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:46,079
You know it never works somebody whose only drunk hanging out with somebody who's only High

311
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:50,943
Didn't happen is in there cuz he wants to be funny

312
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,783
Okay

313
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,111
Yeah I got my free just lame shirt because I believe all women

314
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,391
Is that how you say it

315
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,671
I think so

316
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
I thought it was.

317
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
Is ghislaine

318
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,815
Do you know

319
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
Going

320
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,631
Because line

321
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
This is taking a while

322
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,471
Her father was a famous

323
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Stop

324
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
Am I sick

325
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
Massage spa

326
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,079
Portal you sex operator

327
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Yacht

328
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
Okay is that true

329
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:31,391
Oak Park

330
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:36,511
He has the confidence of the man whose wrong doesn't care that he's wrong and doesn't plan on carrying soon

331
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:42,143
Maxwell's father was named Robert Maxwell and I'd love for Alex to try to prove any of the things

332
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
But he saying about that dude

333
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,751
What we do know is that he died after falling off his yacht

334
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,055
In the Canary Islands back in 1991

335
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:52,895
However Alex is trying to imply that this was a murder and that

336
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,687
Not substantiated at all

337
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,015
The two leading theories are an accident or suicide

338
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,319
The rationale for the suicide theory is fairly

339
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087
Convincing

340
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:05,439
Prior to his death Robert Maxwell was a huge name of the print industry

341
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:10,047
Publishing The Daily Mirror Sunday Mirror New York daily news just to name a few of his aunt

342
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
When he died it was a

343
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,143
The huge shock and people remember him fondly

344
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,423
With glowing obituaries

345
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:19,007
A month later a different story would come to the surface

346
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:25,663
As it turned out Maxwell was deeply in debt in order to keep his creditors at Bay while maintaining his luxurious lifestyle

347
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,967
He'd stolen from his employees pension fund

348
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,503
After his death it was

349
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,831
Discovered that 460 million lb of disappeared

350
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,391
And just like that the fond memories turned

351
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:41,023
Very sour the bit from The IT Crowd

352
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:46,143
That's where that bit originally from I guarantee it is

353
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,447
Is like the cops show up at his door

354
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,751
And it is secretary comes in and she's like

355
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,823
The cops are here they want to talk to you about the pension fund

356
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
Any just like

357
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,663
Okay that sounds good we walked over to the window opened it up

358
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
Just jumped out

359
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:04,831
I mean I think that might also just be like kind of thing you imagine people do it be the hudsucker proxy

360
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
T2

361
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:11,743
After his death various conspiracy theories have popped up at Alex couldn't prove any of the stuff that he suggesting on this episode

362
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:17,631
There's no evidence that he was murdered and there's good reason to suspect his death could have been due to his own actions or due to an accident

363
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,215
There's no evidence that he was a spy and the proof offered is

364
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,519
That he was an Israeli agent is

365
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,543
Pretty weak

366
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:30,175
Basically it's just the fact that his funeral took place in Israel and was attended by then prime minister and president

367
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:36,575
Santa by the country that's not too weird given that he was a Jewish man who'd escaped Nazi occupation as a youth and was a

368
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Lifelong friend

369
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,391
Vince Porter the state of Israel

370
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:44,255
I've read some articles that try to make the argument that Maxwell was a spy but none of them are even close to

371
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
Conclusive

372
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,839
And even these post have to call him a quote alleged

373
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,607
Spy

374
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,727
There is a book called Robert Maxwell Israel's super-spy that claims that he was a

375
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Super spy

376
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,543
But the reviews are this thing are not great

377
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,871
Ono intriguing if somewhat over-reaching

378
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
Quote

379
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,199
At times hard to believe that

380
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:08,063
What a very nice euphemism

381
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,927
A review by Michael pakenham and the Baltimore Sun puts things into somewhat of a perspective

382
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,767
The authors of the book are quote one man book factories

383
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,815
It's with 56 previous books released

384
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,095
Between the two of them

385
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:26,239
Your 55:5 apparel

386
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,287
Pakenham says quote

387
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,335
This is a big and ambitious book

388
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
Probably too big

389
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,919
I found it finally flawed by access

390
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,991
Exaggeration of narration and more fatally

391
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,527
Conclusions that are on

392
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,319
Drawn into fish

393
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,599
Elaborate aduriz

394
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
Substantiate

395
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,159
He later says quote

396
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:50,303
This amalgam of fact and insinuation converging without distinction suggest coining a new category of prose

397
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,095
How about infowindow

398
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:59,263
It can be totally possible that Robert Maxwell was secretly a spy but it's important to stress that Alex Jones absolutely cannot see

399
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,311
Substantiate or backup the two main claims

400
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,359
That he has here to open the show

401
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:07,711
The guylaine Maxwell's father was a spy and that he was murdered when he fell off that yaksh

402
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:14,623
If you were pushed on either of these going to it immediately have to retreat into saying things like come on and it's been to class

403
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,208
Classified

404
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
Making

405
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,512
Elaine's

406
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
Horrific

407
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
Crimes like

408
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,352
A family business like

409
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,424
Yeah her dad underage girls too it's just

410
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,960
The Maxwell's just do it

411
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:35,360
It is so f****** slow it's the sort of thing they like I think that if you want it introduced that as I thought

412
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,384
I'm not going

413
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,152
To like

414
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
I'm not going to

415
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,480
Tq4 spitballing like

416
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,760
Robert Maxwell

417
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,576
Really influential powerful person

418
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:48,672
But at the same time I'm going to demand that you have a certain amount of

419
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,000
Evidence to back up your claims you think it's important

420
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,792
And I just find the evidence

421
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
So I don't know I

422
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
Like I do think it's

423
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
A little bit dumb

424
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
That was like

425
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:01,984
I like a book

426
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
Reviewers just half

427
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,080
Let's I think we'll invent a new

428
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
Genre of literature

429
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:10,432
Info window supposed to just being like

430
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
Man this is

431
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,528
Bulshit

432
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,648
They have to be diplomatic to Grandma book reviewers and

433
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,720
Aspiring authors authors behind

434
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
Broken

435
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:29,120
Alex told him but Epstein like way back

436
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,656
And this is where like

437
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
Things

438
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,008
Kind of went off the rails for me in terms of like

439
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,568
Goddamn these episodes going to be so long

440
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,872
You were telling me

441
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,152
About Epstein and this

442
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
Island

443
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
Years ago

444
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,528
You were telling me long before anybody

445
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,832
I think you told me about him

446
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,856
Before his first

447
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
The rest

448
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,672
A long time ago they have these

449
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,440
Xylem

450
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
Florida

451
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,256
Children but I learned all this

452
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
Ted Gunn

453
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,328
Twenty-plus years ago

454
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,120
He wasn't lying to the FBI director

455
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,656
He was the head of the FBI

456
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
Los Angeles

457
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,960
Is a very famous chef

458
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
We apologize for

459
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336
Died

460
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,128
Hi in the 2011

461
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Vice

462
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
Good branch

463
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
Explain

464
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
CIA

465
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
Farted

466
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,600
Describes

467
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
Hollywood

468
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
We make people

469
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
Three part of these

470
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
Clubs

471
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,608
So I can do all this about Ted for Ted Gunderson

472
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:37,984
Sure with all due respect I kind of have to suspect The Joe Rogan the memories a little screwy here

473
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:44,640
Searches on Prison Planet Infowars don't really show much of an awareness of Epstein prior to the mainstream news covering the stories are kind of

474
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,944
I feel like Rogaine might be conflating things

475
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:53,600
Thinking of something else Alex ranted about to be like you talked about man any any of that I would almost guarantee with

476
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,136
Joe on the show it's like

477
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,928
Anything that sounds like it

478
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:03,328
Did eventually happen he's going to be like he probably told me before

479
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,144
Talking about like 20 year old conversations are you

480
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,936
Probably stoned out of your mind

481
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,216
Like I don't trust

482
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,264
I don't trust the recall there now absolute

483
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,592
Now as for Alexandra heard all this stuff from Ted Gunderson

484
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,384
I'm going to go ahead and say I believe that

485
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,456
Ted Gunderson was a long-serving FBI age

486
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,784
Retiring in 1979 after a 27-year career

487
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:26,624
During which time he actually wasn't charged in multiple cities offices

488
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,184
Including Los Angeles Alex is not making that up

489
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
After he retired he decided to

490
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,512
Continue with a freelance invest

491
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,304
Alligator and that's where things went

492
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,096
Completely off the rails for Android

493
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,424
In the 1980s the United States experienced its last

494
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,728
Completely out of control satanic panic

495
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:45,824
Had one of the more hysterical events and it was the McMartin preschool trial

496
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
I don't want to

497
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:50,432
Too much into detail about that but the broad outline is this

498
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,576
There was a preschool in California run by there was founded by Virginia McMartin

499
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,880
Run by some relative

500
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,952
Apparently one of the children who attended the school

501
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,744
Who is also a severe alcoholic

502
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
Paranoid skip

503
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,536
The phrenic

504
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,864
Some claims against teachers at the school which range from sexual abuse

505
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,936
Torture two things that border on Magic like one of them

506
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,960
Could fly

507
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:18,080
This mother quote wrote a letter admitting that she didn't know fantasy from reality

508
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
Which was

509
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,896
Weirdly hidden from the defendant's

510
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,920
So the eventual trial

511
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:29,856
In the process of investigating these allegations police sent out a letter to parents of other students at that school

512
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,928
There was incredibly poorly written and in hindsight

513
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
Almost design

514
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,720
The prop the panda

515
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:38,048
They said that this assistant at the school rate Buckley

516
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,864
Was under investigation for molestation and encouraged

517
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,424
Parents to question their children about sexual a

518
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:48,288
It's hard to imagine being a parent and reading the following line and not being terrified

519
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
Quote

520
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,640
Also photos may have been taken of children without their clothing

521
00:25:54,176 --> 00:26:00,320
Any information from your child regarding having ever observe Ray Buckley to leave a classroom alone with a child during any

522
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
.

523
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:05,952
Or if they had ever observe Ray Buckley tie up a child is important

524
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,280
Naturally parental concern can go awry

525
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,096
A bunch of new claims were made

526
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:15,168
They'll ultimately no evidence of anything was ever found

527
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:22,080
There are many that believed that the case would never have made it to the headlines or even very far into the investigation

528
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,360
Were it not for timing

529
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
And Paula

530
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:28,224
A1984 La district attorney Robert

531
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,248
Filippou's Ian

532
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,296
Wasn't a very close race for re-election

533
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,344
Tune to a post he had not initially one

534
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,880
He been appointed District

535
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:39,488
Attorney after his predecessor had been elected attorney general general of the State of California

536
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:44,352
In the course of his campaign philibosian made a big deal of the McMartin case

537
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,424
1990 article in the LA Times quote

538
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,568
When the McMartin preschool indictments were first issued in March 1984 then-district attorney Robert for the Bossier

539
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,384
Facing a tough electoral Challenge from Reiner

540
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
Exploit the case

541
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:02,016
During pretrial hearings he sat beside of the prosecutors

542
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,320
In court a practice not seeing it in at least 50

543
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
Teen years

544
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,696
During recesses philipose Ian conducted hallway press conferences to grab some

545
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:16,608
Just before the primary philibosian added 92 counts on top of the already existing 115

546
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:20,448
Increase the number of alleged victims from 18 to 42

547
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
Robert Vela bozian lost

548
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,056
It is wrong for the DA office but the damage had been done

549
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:29,664
And by the time his successor I were reitner took over Ira Reiner

550
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
Make joke over

551
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:33,248
The case was too big for it to just go away

552
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,320
There were allegations of ritualistic abuse against

553
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,136
Katana kids which was now the biggest story in the country

554
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
Which is the problem

555
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,512
Seven people were ultimately arrested and indicted for these alleged

556
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,840
Crimes including Buckley his mother and his sister

557
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,632
As well as three teachers at the school

558
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,424
All charges were dropped against

559
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,960
Five of them before the case went

560
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,776
The trial leaving lonely Ray Buckley and his mother Peggy

561
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,056
As co-defendants

562
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,872
This was the longest and most

563
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:03,456
Expensive trial in US history ultimately ending up with almost

564
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
30 months

565
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,296
So testimony and over two months of jury deliberation

566
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:13,184
In the end Peggy was acquitted of all charges and the jury was deadlocked on 13 of the charges against Ray

567
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,744
With the foreperson of the jury explaining quote

568
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
The interview tapes were too biased

569
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,560
2 L

570
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,584
That's the main Crocs

571
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:26,240
Ray Buckley would go on to be retried coincidentally around the time when Ira Reiner was attempting to run for the office

572
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,032
California Attorney General

573
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,336
And again they would fail to reach a conviction

574
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,408
The state decided not to try Reagan and all charges were

575
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
You're dismissed

576
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,224
The entire Affair was a disgrace

577
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,528
And the pain it caused is almost unimaginable

578
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,112
From the employees of the school whose lives were ruined to the children were

579
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,696
Terrorized by the media attention and almost comically long trial

580
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,768
15 billion dollars in taxpayer money was spent

581
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,304
The ultimately achieve nothing

582
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,352
Other than leave emotional scars

583
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,960
Though it's easy to see some of the political motivations for the prosecution

584
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:01,824
The ability for it to get there only really happened because of a couple specific people

585
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,128
One of them was a therapist named

586
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,152
Kee MacFarlane

587
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:12,064
McFarland worked at the Children's Institute International and was in charge of questioning the children who responded to the sensationail LED

588
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,088
Letter from the police

589
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,368
This was not well.

590
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:21,024
Video tapes of the interviews also showed that McFarlane another therapist relied heavily on leading questions

591
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,608
And subtle pressure to persuade children to join the chorus of accuse

592
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,680
The defense play tapes that show therapist

593
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:30,752
Sean Connery telling child interviewees

594
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:34,080
That 183 kids had already revealed quote

595
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
Secrets

596
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,920
And that all the McMartin teachers were quote sick in the head

597
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,456
And deserve to be beaten up

598
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,528
The way she went about her work became an issue with the

599
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,552
The trial and quotes

600
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,600
Outside of the presence of the jury judge

601
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,136
Pounders declared quote

602
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:50,464
In my view her credibility is becoming more of an issue as

603
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,232
She testifies

604
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,536
She was not even called as a witness

605
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,840
As for the prosecution in the second trial

606
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,608
Great job

607
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
McFarland

608
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
InStyler Quest

609
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,240
Evening led to children making Sensational claims like ritualistic animal sacrifice

610
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,056
Secret torture rooms only accessible by tunnels

611
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,080
People flying

612
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
Somebody

613
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,688
Suggest that allegations of underground rooms were the results

614
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,712
Of being a

615
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,736
5 therapist

616
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:17,856
Using devil puppets quote if they find a secret room what do you think they'll find

617
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:24,512
That implies to a child that you're interviewing the existence of a secret room

618
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,536
Adjustable leading question

619
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,584
The insurance claim

620
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,656
Of underground rooms and tunnels would need to be investigated

621
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,752
You need to probably already guessed the independent investigator got called in for that job

622
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,800
Went underneath the Getty and found all the knots

623
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,616
Gunderson

624
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,688
That's how we get this back again

625
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,456
Likes all right

626
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,736
I can't say for certain

627
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,784
What he was up to or

628
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,088
Why any of this happened but by this point at Gunter

629
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,368
Completely lost his mind

630
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,208
He was an independent investigator but he wasn't the only one investigating

631
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,536
Understatement to say that his report on the matter doesn't

632
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,584
Match what anyone else is fast

633
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,656
41 claimed that he found a 40

634
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,424
35ft

635
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,520
Tunnel that it 9 ft wide entrances under a Buckley's classroom

636
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
It's pretty f******

637
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:13,920
And that's not the sort of thing that other people would miss you could see that you could knock on the

638
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:18,272
F****** floor in here a giant Hollow f****** room underneath it if it's that big

639
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,832
Strangely no one but Ted has evidence

640
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:25,952
7 tunnels that contains over 100 animal bones

641
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,000
Enclose a small white plastic

642
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,816
Plate with three pentagram hand-drawn on top

643
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,096
They're very easy to fight

644
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:38,496
Animal bones tunnel underneath the classroom

645
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:43,360
It'll be easy to find on this property that previously with a garbage

646
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,640
B****.

647
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,664
Whatever

648
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,784
Anyway it also in his report as a picture of this plate that has the pentagrams

649
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,832
Sturgis Stars I don't know if

650
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
They're not like

651
00:31:53,856 --> 00:32:00,000
In a circle there's nothing overly

652
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:03,328
To Gundersen wasn't actually the only person

653
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,352
Who found

654
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,376
Disabled

655
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:09,728
Archaeologists named Jerry stickell

656
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,800
To do a very Rush archaeological assessment of the school

657
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,336
Looking for these fabled tunnel

658
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:20,480
This work took place in 1990 around when the second trial was going on but the DA's office told them

659
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,784
Even before they began their dig that they quote

660
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,368
Would not consider using any additional data from their work

661
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,672
It was legally pointless what I would do right

662
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,952
Great great great great

663
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,976
Straight

664
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:36,096
Did he find evidence of angels is that what he found

665
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:39,680
I read stickles archaeological report and it's very difficult to

666
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,984
Supertime this is a professional unbiased work

667
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,544
It's full of conjecture about cover-ups and

668
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,152
Conspiracy as well as many topics that are far outside the scope of archaeological evidence

669
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:54,016
By the time stickle went to work there at already been an official investigation

670
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,856
Navigation to buy March 1985 some of the parents have carried out

671
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,648
Unprofessional digging Expedition

672
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,440
If their own which it turned up nothing

673
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,000
The site that stickle had to work on was

674
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,280
Completely disrupted in

675
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
Contaminated

676
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,864
If you read his own report it's full of problem

677
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,704
Sounds like how earlier parents had dug up a 15-foot hole look

678
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,496
For an entrance to a tunnel which was

679
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,872
Told that they dug 15ft down was 3ft by 3ft and they ended up finding nothing

680
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,896
And that quote

681
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,176
This is from his report

682
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,504
Quote do to their our lack of qualifications and

683
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,832
Experienced any possible entrance to a tunnel could have been

684
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,136
Skewered by haphazard digging

685
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
What

686
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,952
The total is

687
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,976
2 bricks

688
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:40,096
Store with half our digging would probably reveal it faster than Goods

689
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:44,192
If it's reported fall down a hole at any point in time

690
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,496
If this report is anything wrong

691
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:53,152
Researchers who compared stickles report to the official investigation of noted a number of notable errors and omissions in stickles

692
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:53,920
Report

693
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,736
Like the fact that there is quote no mention of the fact that the

694
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,552
The areas of the side Lot was used as a trash

695
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,856
Job prior to 1942

696
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,928
Is it Go long way towards explaining somebody artifact

697
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
It's tickles report

698
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
Pretends are suspicious

699
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,072
Stickle claims that his use of ground-penetrating radar show the

700
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:11,840
The existence of a

701
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:15,936
Before tunnels or the company contracted to do the work

702
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,472
Which is called Spectrum say hi

703
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:21,312
No evidence was found to support the existence of filled-in underground

704
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:27,456
Hearthside below-ground tunnel so he basically did his own Ghost Hunter show where he's just walking around like

705
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,504
I feel it I feel this is where it's at

706
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,808
Yeah you might as well okay

707
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,832
Outrageous

708
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:39,232
They're clear instances of sickle fudging details to reach the conclusion that normal things he found while digging

709
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,048
Getting around the site already contaminated by previous amateur

710
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:45,376
It already investigated by professionals were intact

711
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,656
Secret underground tunnels

712
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,424
The torture room

713
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,216
He produced this report

714
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,776
Ted Gunderson used it to prove to the world

715
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:56,128
Although there was no evidence in the trials were embarrassing this wasn't actually site

716
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,664
The satanic abuse

717
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,736
Then I imagine you and I being back in the satanic

718
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,272
Panic would be experiencing almost

719
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,296
Exactly the same

720
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,088
Feeling that we are right now where it's at

721
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,392
Like you stick your head out and you look around

722
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,416
Everyone is in

723
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
Sane

724
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,720
And you're just like I don't

725
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,536
They're overlapping

726
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,840
The literal Christian devil isn't

727
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,656
There are overlaps

728
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:25,056
So from this point Ted Gunderson became an All-Star in the world of extreme right-wing conspiracy theorist spouting nonsense as a next

729
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:29,152
Bird on the Insidious World In Plain Sight

730
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,176
Puddle over there

731
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:36,832
Affected North was convicted and no one believed his supposed evidence is only further proof of just How Deeply rooted this satanic

732
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,600
Conspiracy is

733
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:44,512
This became Ted's Niche and he was the go-to expert for zealots to have around to life credibility to their nonsense demon claims

734
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,584
Based on the illusion that he's ever produced anything worthwhile

735
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:51,936
This is how Ted's path must have crossed with Alex's I guess at some point

736
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,960
Ted told Alex

737
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,984
Crazy stuff

738
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,288
Which I guess is now the basis for Alex's career

739
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,616
As opposed to him just being against the world government and private bank

740
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,408
To be perfectly blunt

741
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:06,016
His blood work on this case and has allowed it to not exist as a cautionary Tale

742
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:06,784
For some people

743
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,600
But as an actual proven satanic conspiracy

744
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,928
Hey many ways the satanic Panic that we're going through right now

745
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,488
And may not survive is in some part thanks

746
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,304
The Ted's b******* and Alex carrying on his legacy

747
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,120
Oh and is it that were message enough

748
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,936
It later came out the Ted Gunderson was involved

749
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,496
With Jackie Jackie McCullough

750
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,544
A parent of one of the students at McMartin

751
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,384
Preschool who was super involved in the amateur excavation efforts

752
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,688
Kind of biased

753
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,968
F****** God

754
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,576
The only time the FBI produces anything good is when it's in a movie

755
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:44,672
Real-life the FBI is wall-to-wall garbage

756
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:48,000
Always I would disagree with that because of

757
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,024
So much stuff that you

758
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,424
Christian ever hear about you are pretty decent record-keeping about like a lot like a lot of stuff

759
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,240
If you can find at the FBI V is shockingly

760
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,520
Well

761
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,544
Capture

762
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,944
Records of interviews and paperwork

763
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,528
Female that's where they hire good people

764
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:17,184
The problem is they hire bad people for all the other position I also believe it may have been defective FBI agent

765
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,232
At some point during those 27 years

766
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:24,608
I imagined Hoover might have been an effective FBI agent at one point in time or another

767
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,144
That's something it's kind of

768
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,192
Difficult exam people

769
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,752
Do not Thrive outside of supervision

770
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,520
Yeah like

771
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,568
Some people who could be a good Agent

772
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,640
With a boss or within a structure

773
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,944
Can't operate as independent

774
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,248
Because they get an idea and then they

775
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,296
Want to prove that idea

776
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,856
And they don't have the restraints of

777
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
Oversight

778
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:50,720
Shorts

779
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:54,048
Ted Gunderson that's kind of the way I feel about it like

780
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,584
Yeah he wasn't

781
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:59,680
Proving a satanic conspiracy when he was in the FBI because he had a boss

782
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:04,032
Yeah yeah and not because the boss was stopping him from finding the truth

783
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,824
But because those instinct

784
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,360
To allow

785
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,384
Proven shyt

786
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,688
To be felt as if it was proven

787
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,712
We're reindeer

788
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,992
Take this to the preds

789
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,808
I just need his sign off on this

790
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,904
I want to put all of the FBI's resources

791
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,720
Into investigating whether or not ghosted

792
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:27,584
Please tell the president that and then once he gives me that signature then I'll be able to get started

793
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,656
What he said no why I don't understand

794
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:34,496
Running is that what you want me to

795
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,288
Drug should be legal

796
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,080
Goes to be illegal

797
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,640
Pancoast

798
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,712
You're fired

799
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,784
Alright

800
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,112
Private investigation it is Sir

801
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:55,488
Just feels like Occam's razor makes that a simpler explanation to understand

802
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,536
The world is run

803
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,304
Bye

804
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,120
Satanic

805
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,424
Human trafficking groups

806
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,520
That all communicate with each other and there's no evidence of any of the ASN

807
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,824
I don't know it's just it's a bit much

808
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,104
So

809
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,152
Rogan

810
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,200
Starts complaining about 4 at

811
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,552
He does seem to like Sacha Baron Cohen butt

812
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,112
Problem he thinks they did Rudy dirty

813
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
Why

814
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,416
This the Borat movie

815
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,440
Were they

816
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
If you haven't seen it

817
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
Is very

818
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,608
Cuz I shut him up

819
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,632
Nothing happened

820
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
They made it look like

821
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,680
Giuliani

822
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,448
Jerking off

823
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,752
He would have to

824
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,872
Jerk-off

825
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:44,896
Inappropriate

826
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,688
Touch their back

827
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
Exaggerating

828
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,040
It was a couple of light Taps on the back

829
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,064
Well she was

830
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,880
6315

831
00:39:55,648 --> 00:40:00,256
Thank you very much dear yeah you might not want to like minimize that behavior because

832
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,560
Even that is a little it's dodgy

833
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,864
Don't touch a fifteen-year-old ever

834
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,400
Especially if you're rude

835
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:11,520
F****** Giuliani Rudy Giuliani

836
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,336
Unlock the doors

837
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,616
From the outside

838
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:21,248
It's a it's a little bit it seems like hey buddy this supposition you don't need to

839
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,832
What is necessary

840
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,136
It's okay for dudes to touch women

841
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:30,464
They just have to be like that you like part of their f****** life

842
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:37,120
I don't understand the impulse to defend Giuliani for being alone in a hotel room with someone

843
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:40,960
He thinks is 15 and touching her on the side like around the ribs

844
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:44,544
Not like that is not okay not least of which not least of which

845
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,824
Here's my other big problem

846
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,616
He didn't even do anything

847
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:52,480
Cuz they had to stop him because they had to stop him from doing so

848
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:57,344
Debatable but probable I don't know I think that that's a harder argument to have

849
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,880
Then one where it's like

850
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
Alright

851
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,976
Why is it such a hard thing to just say.

852
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:08,864
The circumstances that Rudy was in our circumstances you should never find yourself in

853
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,888
It's not like

854
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:14,752
Don't excuse the touching of this person you should not have been there to begin with

855
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,824
100% piss if this word

856
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,616
Traps that they set was the

857
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:26,016
Distance of this exactly what happened after that is gravy

858
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:26,784
He could have just

859
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:33,184
Giving an interview right now professional setting hold anything like that

860
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:36,000
You know I hate sometimes there are like

861
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:38,048
Somebody who's 15 and maybe

862
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,096
You want to help them out on their path of

863
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,400
Conservative pundit ship or whatever

864
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:45,728
There's an appropriate way to do that and there's an inappropriate way to do that

865
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,032
Everything I can tell about this

866
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,312
The joke

867
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,616
Or whatever the setup is

868
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,895
A completely

869
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,455
Inappropriate setting for this to happen

870
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,735
And then let's see what happens

871
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:03,391
Like I said man Rogan seems to want to be clear that he doesn't like Sacha Baron Cohen

872
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,927
But also it's totally

873
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,463
Cool what Rudy was do I need

874
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,791
I f****** love

875
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,071
I think he's brilliant

876
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,119
But his

877
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,655
Interpretation

878
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,423
Of what

879
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,191
In the room

880
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
Rudy Giuliani

881
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,007
It's not accurate

882
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,031
In my opinion

883
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,103
And who is America

884
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,639
Tapping her while she's

885
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,687
Touching him

886
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,247
Is Mikey does this little tap

887
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,015
On her waist

888
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,039
But it's not

889
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
Creepy

890
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,831
It's like an old man

891
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:40,767
Fly right in your opinion that's not creepy it mine it's supergroup

892
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:45,375
Here's where we found an impasse example

893
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:50,751
Especially when there's an intrinsic

894
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:55,615
Power imbalance America's mayor

895
00:42:55,871 --> 00:43:02,015
Lawyer of the president and aspiring allegedly fifteen-year-old conservative journalist

896
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,855
Like there is a very serious responsibility

897
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,391
Of

898
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,951
Behavior that you have to uphold in this earth

899
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,975
Circumstances

900
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:14,815
F*** you man this is nonsense Lois Lane was already

901
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:18,399
Intrepid reporter as Lois Lane was 15 dating Superman that's

902
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,167
F***** up that's

903
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:25,567
Serious power imbalance specially if Superman used to be the mayor of New York

904
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:30,687
Celebrity was the lawyer to be current and then lost

905
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:34,527
Well it was like 7

906
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,063
Super creepy Cheese's

907
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,855
There's an elephant in the room

908
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,647
And it's not that

909
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,415
Scott

910
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:46,303
Instantly lashed out at Joe on his own show and snake and I've had other things.

911
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
Criticize

912
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:50,399
Joe for having Alex on his shoe

913
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,447
Logan's got a philosophy

914
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,007
People criticize me for being friends

915
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,567
With you and for talking to you and they also criticized

916
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,359
For not supporting

917
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,151
A lot of these people that got

918
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
Abandoned

919
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,711
Deplatform

920
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,759
My take on it has always

921
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,551
The best way

922
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,319
Data counter

923
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
Wrong

924
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
Is correct

925
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,183
When someone says something

926
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,719
That's wrong

927
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,767
Conspiracy theory that's not accurate

928
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,047
The best way to counter that

929
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,327
Is 2

930
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,351
To do better

931
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,911
People say the accurate information

932
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:28,543
I'm unequipped to debate the point of whether or not quote correct speech is the answer to bad speech

933
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:34,175
That could get a little philosophical and I don't really know what the answer is so for the purposes of what I'm about to say let's

934
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,711
Stipulate that Joe is right

935
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,527
People who are malicious con artist

936
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,807
Liars and frauds

937
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,415
I have them, you're very popular shows so you can engage in correct speech

938
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:45,951
Even if that

939
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:50,815
That's the case then I suggest The Joe Rogan is not ready or capable of having a correct speech

940
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,839
With Alex Jones

941
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:58,751
We're less than 10 minutes into this episode and already Joe has allowed Alex to assert that Robert Maxwell with a British and Israeli spy

942
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,287
Why was murdered on his got

943
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:03,871
And the Ted Gunderson revealed real proof and satanic pedophile cabal

944
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,687
Those are two massive instances of bad

945
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:09,247
Speech that Jose just allowed Alex 2%

946
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,271
Undisputed fact

947
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:13,343
With no attempts to bring up correct speech to correct it

948
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:19,999
There's no follow-up out of something like how do you know Maxwell was a spy or why don't you tell her audience more about who Ted

949
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:20,767
Gunderson is

950
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:24,351
The reality is the conversation like this

951
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:28,191
Where your new Japan have fun with your alleged friend Alex Jones

952
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:32,031
That's never going to be something you can engage in publicly responsive

953
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,079
Because he is a compulsive liar

954
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,127
And you don't want to grind the show to a halt

955
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,687
The fact check every piece of b******* that comes out of his mouth

956
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:45,087
It only makes matters worse when Rogan in that 10 minutes has also repeatedly asserted that it's no big deal that Rudy

957
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,647
Giuliani touched a waste of a girly believe me 50

958
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,671
Hotel robe

959
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:51,743
Wow are you trying to get her personal contact information

960
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:58,399
This is an outrageous kind of behavior where they're trying to argue that everything is fine because Rudy wasn't actually jerking off while they do

961
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,935
Just pretend that the entire context

962
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,007
Having a drink in a hotel room with the girls eat please B15

963
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,287
Whatever doesn't matter

964
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,567
Joe Rogan

965
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:11,199
Due to his own blind spots and is strange insistence on pretending Alex's actually his friend

966
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:11,967
Clearly not

967
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,735
Is

968
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,759
Joe's incapable

969
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,295
I've been gauging in this conversation

970
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:18,623
In a way that would effectively be the kind of corrective speech

971
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,671
He imagines that he's engaged again

972
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,463
You being used by our

973
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:25,791
And the more this happens the less I'm able to pretend that he's not a willing

974
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,559
Participant in it

975
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,887
The illusion is kind of

976
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,447
It's hard to swallow it

977
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,239
I would even I would even argue

978
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:40,639
Stipulating that he was right as a terrible idea like what we've covered the sake of the

979
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,919
It's just his taken

980
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:42,943
The f****** stupid

981
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,735
Even seen like okay

982
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,759
Here's what we've seen

983
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
When the left

984
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:51,135
Tolerance of the intolerant the intolerant take over and start killing people

985
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,671
And when we

986
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,951
Deplatform people

987
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,999
All the sudden they don't have as much

988
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,535
Power to take over and kill us

989
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:03,679
Yes that is true I'm not entirely sure that that entire Dynamic works the same way with speech

990
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,703
But you're sure

991
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:08,543
They are categories categories in his speech is

992
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,567
Insanely brought

993
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,919
The parts of the differences between like

994
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:18,271
Oh I disagree with you about something

995
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,087
Or

996
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,367
I'm lying

997
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:27,231
Yeah I'm intentionally trying to mislead people about things

998
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,767
For political gain

999
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,047
Those are both

1000
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,143
Speech presumably but I think there's a way you would engage with them are deaf

1001
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,423
Yeah now

1002
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:39,519
But beyond that I don't know if his take is stupid because I don't know their

1003
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,311
Maybe a way in which

1004
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,431
Corrective types of speech

1005
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,199
Maybe it is

1006
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,503
I don't know I'm not convinced that it is

1007
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:54,111
Even though I do a ship about it I'm not sure that our shows the answer to Alex at anyway

1008
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,671
I don't know I think it's

1009
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,975
A bigger Minds than mine

1010
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:05,375
The only thing that I'm saying when I say I am stipulating that he's right is that otherwise I couldn't point out that

1011
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,399
He still can't do that

1012
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:10,495
Even if he's right

1013
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,775
He can't do that

1014
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:15,359
Circumstances he still fails

1015
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:19,711
We said before he even had Alex on the show

1016
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,247
Your plan sucks

1017
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,783
Maybe

1018
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,855
The hardest news reporter in the world

1019
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:29,439
Could handle that kind of an interview responsibly with Alex

1020
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:35,839
I'm not even I'm not even shooting on Joe in the scented like I could do it I could

1021
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:40,447
Look before the 3-hour 11-minute Mark I mean Bob Woodward would have released

1022
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:43,775
The tape six months after Alex it already killed a few hundred thousand people but

1023
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,543
You know he's nice

1024
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,199
Censoring

1025
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,735
Slippery slope

1026
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,783
When you start censoring

1027
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,319
The problem is

1028
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,855
The f****** slippery

1029
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,927
Open is a reason why we've been so steadfast

1030
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,463
In supporting the 1st Amendment

1031
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,231
This country

1032
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:03,999
And people think it's

1033
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:04,767
Platatac

1034
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,047
Aziz Tech Institute

1035
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,327
Our private business

1036
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:08,863
And they should be able to do whatever

1037
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,631
31

1038
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,167
Knowing

1039
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,471
That f****** slippery slope has gone

1040
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,519
From censoring u4ban out

1041
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,567
Call Jones on Twitter a year-and-a-half ago

1042
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,103
Whitehouse prep

1043
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,127
Secretary

1044
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,407
Bandar puteri

1045
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,711
Because she post something from the New York Post

1046
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:28,575
Crazy

1047
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:33,439
A couple of quick points here White House Press Secretary Kayleigh mcenany

1048
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,231
Better is still up and active

1049
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:39,327
She's been treating quite a bit about Hunter Biden so I don't know Joe is trying to say about her getting banned

1050
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:44,959
I'm guessing she posted a link to that New York Post story that was blocked and being exaggerated they're getting kicked off Twitter

1051
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:48,543
I'd like to correct Jose wrong speech with some correct

1052
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:53,919
Censoring things on Twitter has nothing to do with the First Amendment unless the government is doing

1053
00:49:54,431 --> 00:50:00,063
You don't have a right to say whatever you want wherever you want to particularly if you're on a platform that someone else runs

1054
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:06,463
If you were a guest on my radio show it might be totally legal for you to be racist as hell but it would be my right to not allow you

1055
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,999
You to do so on my show

1056
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:13,375
I legitimately have no idea what people like Joe Rogan imagine the First Amendment to me

1057
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:19,775
I guess the way I would approach this kind of conversation is I would ask him what scenarios exist where it would be okay to kick

1058
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,799
Take someone off Twitter

1059
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,335
And then try to go from there

1060
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:25,407
Is it okay to kick someone off for threatening another user

1061
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,431
If so

1062
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,967
Why is that okay

1063
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:32,063
If it's okay for Twitter to kick someone off for threatening an individual safety

1064
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,903
Is there a possibility that there's a responsibility that the platform has to

1065
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,951
To act when there are other threats

1066
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:44,351
The people safe to you like when people are lying about a Public Health crisis for profit or they're spreading misinformation about an upcoming

1067
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,911
Does is there a communal response

1068
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,679
Possibility

1069
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:54,079
And I can see a reasonable conversation between people who have different views on it but what I can't see being

1070
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:58,687
Good use of time is a couple of idiots yelling about the First Amendment because weirdly all their bigoted friend

1071
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:01,247
We're getting kicked off popular platforms for things like

1072
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:07,647
Starting a violent Western chauvinist Street game

1073
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,671
Sure those are bad

1074
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:13,535
The only solution these Dum Dums ever put forth as repealing section 230 of the communications

1075
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,303
Decency

1076
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:17,119
Which makes these platforms like Twitter

1077
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,399
Shot makes them platform

1078
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,423
Publishers

1079
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:23,007
Relinquish has them of legal responsibility for the things people post

1080
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:26,335
If you were to repeal section 230 not only Whitaker

1081
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,639
Completely destroy things like Facebook and Twitter

1082
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:32,223
Make it so you could never run a social media site without

1083
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,783
Incredibly intense moderation and censorship

1084
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,319
Anytime anybody post

1085
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,367
Copyright material Ukiah sued

1086
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:41,439
Anytime anyone threatened another user you could be held responsible

1087
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:46,815
If someone used your messenger service to organize a criminal acts you might find yourself being an accomplice

1088
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:47,839
I think it's a great idea

1089
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:54,239
I'm not sure what I think about Twitter blocking me Hunter Biden New York Post story but I know what Alex and Jo should think about it

1090
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,263
HP f*****'-a

1091
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,031
Excited

1092
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:59,871
The back of the controversy broke out about it but blocking of the story

1093
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:02,175
Attention

1094
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,991
New York Post is not America's oldest new

1095
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,783
Paper that's the Hartford Courant

1096
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:10,879
Or if you're not only counting continuously published papers

1097
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,671
You could go to the New Hampshire Gazette

1098
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,463
If you allow papers

1099
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,255
Is that sometimes take a little time off

1100
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,815
You know what bums

1101
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,887
About any argument about the first

1102
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,191
It is not

1103
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,215
Hmong

1104
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,007
It is not a long amend

1105
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,055
If you are going to have a discussion about the

1106
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:29,823
The First Amendment

1107
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:32,895
Someone should write it on the wall it should be

1108
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,919
Be in front of you

1109
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:40,319
You should be able to read the first amendment while we're discussing this and then tell me what backs up your b*******

1110
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:44,927
Written within the amount that's what I need you to do you can't just tell me what you think

1111
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,231
The First Amendment

1112
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,255
22 Rogan

1113
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:52,863
Discredit a little bit later he will make a point that he believes that

1114
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,703
These companies have grown to the point where they're effectively should be

1115
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,983
Considered utilities

1116
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,007
Other governments

1117
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:00,799
And hey

1118
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:03,871
I'm not I don't think that that's the stupidest thing

1119
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:06,687
It just requires a different solution

1120
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:09,759
It requires 38

1121
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,063
Treat them like utility move towards that

1122
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,111
As opposed to like saying

1123
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:17,951
Hey Alex Jones is a bad actor and he got kicked off

1124
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,231
This person's platform

1125
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
Like

1126
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,023
Change the right

1127
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,303
Thing

1128
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,863
Have a conversation about the right thing first amendment

1129
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,655
Reply in these circumstances

1130
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,727
You want to talk about the other stuff go for it

1131
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,775
Stopped

1132
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,543
Confusing people

1133
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,311
Are you

1134
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,591
Slippery slope

1135
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,127
Not interest

1136
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:40,223
Not least of which because we are at the bottom of the

1137
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:42,015
That slope underneath a giant rock

1138
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:47,135
Trump rolled on top of Da baby

1139
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,927
We're trying to go up that f***

1140
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:53,535
Cancel the slope of decency goes a little further downward

1141
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,143
His daughter

1142
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:58,911
Daughters

1143
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,799
Left her diarrhea

1144
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,383
And the diary talks about all the

1145
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,943
Same stuff go fuc yourself

1146
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:11,711
Alcohol

1147
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:18,111
Alex and Jo don't say anything or verifiable about Hunter Biden's laptop so I thought it'd be kind of fun intro leader

1148
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,391
Just a band conversation of it

1149
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:22,463
Like

1150
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,047
Ally cast

1151
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,607
That said I'm in touch on this really fast

1152
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:35,519
Apparently Alex's buddy Tom paper over at Nationals

1153
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,799
It was alleged to be Biden

1154
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:40,127
Daughter Ashley's diary from 2019

1155
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:46,527
If you read the article about it it's pretty disgusting and how it Rebels and Ashley supposed marital troubles and affairs

1156
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:49,343
That story was published on October 26th

1157
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,951
But that's another article was posted on National file

1158
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,975
Patrick Howley

1159
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,255
Here's the deal

1160
00:54:56,511 --> 00:55:00,607
These Ding Dongs have an uphill battle in terms of proving to me that this is actually Biden

1161
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,631
Daughter's Journal

1162
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,167
I don't trust them at all

1163
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,959
Particularly someone like Patrick Howley

1164
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:07,007
After reviewing the materials

1165
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:10,079
I'm not convinced that it's definitely a real Journal

1166
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,407
Even assuming that it is this is an outrage

1167
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:15,199
Just leave disgusting move on their part

1168
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:20,319
If it's real then it's the private Journal of someone struggling with addiction and mental health

1169
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:23,135
But I find this kind of thing completely Unforgivable

1170
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,415
I'm not going to discuss

1171
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:29,279
The contents of the passages from the alleged Journal because nothing of it inside it rises to the level

1172
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,815
A feeling like it's appropriate

1173
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,583
To discuss

1174
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:36,703
There's no allegations there's no claims in it that matter to people outside of the journal writers live

1175
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,495
They're literally lives

1176
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,543
It's their business

1177
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,567
And if it's real

1178
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:46,175
That is a horrific violation of their rights process their pain in the way they see

1179
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,223
Fuc yourself

1180
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,503
How dare you

1181
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,271
At 1

1182
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:53,599
I feel like this is like telling me that go ask Alice

1183
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,367
This is a real die

1184
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,743
You know it was like Go Ask Alice

1185
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,303
Bulshit is like I just tried LSD yesterday and

1186
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,583
Tomorrow

1187
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,679
Correct this wrong speed

1188
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,959
And to just

1189
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,727
F******

1190
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:17,151
Don't let this fly on your f****** platform that Frances kildare's diary was published 30 years after his death

1191
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:23,551
That's the type of story is entirely true in the reporting on it is valid

1192
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:29,439
Joe Rogan still apparently is of the mind that reporting on someone's diary

1193
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:35,839
Is becoming use of his time I find that to be a little bit sad

1194
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,607
Joe Rogan

1195
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,375
Personal business

1196
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,655
Will put out for everyone

1197
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,423
To see he might

1198
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,447
I appreciate it

1199
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:43,007
I certainly think that is

1200
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,031
If it were

1201
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,823
Private

1202
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:49,151
Messages to yourself about

1203
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,455
Paying and how your processing things

1204
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,479
Like I wouldn't

1205
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:56,063
Want to read that from Joe even if I wanted to make fun of them

1206
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,855
Like even if Alex is

1207
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:04,255
Like I do so much private stuff about Alex that I don't want to know

1208
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,119
I hate him but I still

1209
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:14,239
Like I just can't imagine wanting to use that as ammunition against somebody

1210
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,031
It just seems so.

1211
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,055
Disgusting

1212
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:22,431
About you than it does about anybody has a journal

1213
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,991
So here's some more wrong speech

1214
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,271
Trump doesn't

1215
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,039
Have

1216
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,063
Those outside connect

1217
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,367
Because you can't buy him he doesn't have lobbyists

1218
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,391
The problem

1219
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,207
He then asked family of people around him

1220
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,231
That Bass

1221
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:35,999
Become lobbyist

1222
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:36,767
For themselves

1223
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:37,791
And Trump isn't real

1224
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:39,839
And that's going on

1225
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:42,911
You'll find out how

1226
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,703
Give me the millions of dollars

1227
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,983
You just to say something

1228
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,007
The president is this

1229
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:47,775
Standard ship

1230
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:49,567
Real politics

1231
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,335
I've always been.

1232
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,919
Well it was Tanner does 600 years ago

1233
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:56,991
The wife or the brother or some other words the White House

1234
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:59,039
It got organized last hundred years

1235
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,599
Trump Twitter

1236
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,159
Everyone around him

1237
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,463
How to make

1238
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,767
Teacher stop meeting with him and stop

1239
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,071
Briefings on what's going on I'll decide

1240
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,119
Flashlight pistol Fishel Washington off

1241
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:17,983
Nice spin for Alex to claim the trumps family at everyone around tomorrow lobbyist

1242
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,543
Because you can't buy dropping will meet with lobbyists

1243
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:23,359
That's some 2 plus 2 is 5 s***

1244
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:29,759
About in the real world job has done literally everything he can to Buddy up with lobbyists and is running by far the

1245
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:33,087
The most Lobby friendly Administration in recent history

1246
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:38,719
In October 2019 propublica published a report identifying 281 lobbyists

1247
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,767
The trumpet hired into his administration

1248
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,535
Which is quote

1249
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,839
80 times more than the Obama Administration

1250
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:49,471
The Associated Press found a quote in less than three years Trump name more former lobbyist

1251
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:54,079
The cabinet level post that his most recent predecessors did in 8 years

1252
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:59,199
What are the things that scariest about how Trump is operated is that he's been willing to hire lobbyists

1253
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:05,599
It's two positions that involve the fields they previously were lobbying in who knows better than the people who destroyed the entire

1254
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:12,767
To protect the environment one example is a career in healthcare lobbying

1255
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:16,095
Department of Health and Human Services in January 2019

1256
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,887
Coincidental situation

1257
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:21,471
Virginia Cantor the ethics Chief counsel

1258
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:27,359
For responsibility and ethics in Washington told propublica that the number of lobbyists Trump was hiring quote

1259
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:32,479
Suggest that lobbyists see themselves as more effective in furthering their clients special interests from

1260
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,503
Inside the government

1261
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:35,039
Rather than from outside

1262
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,575
That's a shocking conclusion to make

1263
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,879
And this phenomenon goes in both directions

1264
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:45,535
In July Politico reported on 82 former Trump Administration officials who'd left their jobs and registered his

1265
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,303
Lobbyist

1266
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,351
Despite Trump's claim that he was gone

1267
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:52,191
To put a 5-year ban on lobbying for people who left government employment

1268
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:56,287
He's goddamn Chief of Staff ranked priebus is now the chairman of Michael best

1269
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,079
The high-profile lobbying firm

1270
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:04,991
Back in July there was plenty of reporting you can find about how Trump connected lobbyists to receiving billions of dollars from Corona

1271
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:10,111
Coronavirus stimulus package packages while the businesses that were struggling we're less than

1272
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:11,903
What does

1273
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:12,671
Just weird

1274
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:15,999
This whole thing is just a disgraceful lice old people who liked

1275
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:17,535
Swap

1276
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:23,935
Watchdog groups in journalists who've actually looked at the Staffing decisions are pretty Universal in their conclusion that

1277
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,471
The most lobbyist infest

1278
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:28,799
The presidency that anyone can remember in recent history

1279
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,335
I think we've seen the results

1280
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,895
Joe Rogan may not know

1281
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:37,247
Research team is a guy with Google was working on the fly into

1282
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:41,087
Getting over covid

1283
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:47,487
Not okay to just let Alex pass off complete lies like this to aggrandize Trump when you're completely unprepared avycon

1284
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,767
Conversation about the reality

1285
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:53,375
It demonstrates to your impressionable audience of the man sitting in front of you

1286
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,655
Who is your friend

1287
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,935
Is a liar

1288
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:57,471
You're not if you're not able to

1289
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,287
Demonstrate that you can't have the conversation because then

1290
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,311
The opposite

1291
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:03,103
Conclusion will be reached by your audio

1292
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:09,503
And even then Alex's argument is no no no it's not cronic capitalism

1293
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,527
Nepotism

1294
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:13,087
That's way better it's nepotism

1295
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:17,951
Turns into a form of crony capitalism because the relatives and Friends

1296
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:23,583
Defacto become exactly

1297
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,351
So now they

1298
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:29,983
That's not better so Alex just described a far worse system than what we had prior prior

1299
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,775
And Joe's like

1300
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:35,359
Yeah it's like a it's like before but you know the lobby is

1301
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:42,015
Who used to just be professionals in and out related

1302
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,855
Yeah that's great

1303
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,647
So interesting Lee

1304
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:53,279
They talked about this a little bit more and we get our first instance of Joe actually kind of pushing back

1305
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,303
Which age

1306
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,839
It was surprised by

1307
01:01:56,095 --> 01:02:00,447
Everyone around him and his cabinet and everyone that works there even down to mid-level people

1308
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,239
Are now getting multimillion-dollar

1309
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,007
Contracts

1310
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,031
Four companies

1311
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,311
AT&T and stuff

1312
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,335
Just adjust

1313
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,103
So just to even

1314
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,127
Mentioned

1315
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,175
That's bad

1316
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:10,943
You said 18

1317
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:13,247
Improving its 18t or you just

1318
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,015
Just saying 80

1319
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,295
Like

1320
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:16,831
March 8th

1321
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:20,927
Auntie doing something bad

1322
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,207
No I just

1323
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,255
I was mentioning that as a Fortune 500

1324
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:25,535
Okay but

1325
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,303
It's not 18

1326
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,095
So we shouldn't say that

1327
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,375
See this is why you know

1328
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,143
I need someone.

1329
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:34,751
A fact-checker right now to slow down the media will say I'm wrong

1330
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:36,543
Right about that but okay

1331
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,103
Put on a hold on a personal lawyer

1332
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,919
The personal lawyer the one ended up going to jail

1333
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:44,735
Actually Michael Cohen was getting money from

1334
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:48,831
I was just trying to give you your stalled crying Oz

1335
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,159
Before what you really need on your

1336
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:52,927
You show is like

1337
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,207
A legit journalist

1338
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:57,535
She's right next to you with a laptop going to Alex hold on hold on

1339
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:04,191
Joy the great idea there although he probably doesn't realize that Alex is entire style of conversation to broadcast his design soda

1340
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:10,335
You can't fact check in without taking for a

1341
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:16,991
There's a reason that our episodes are so long and I desperately need you to Yellow Box

1342
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:24,159
Alex is basically the inverse show

1343
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:30,559
Bizarro

1344
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:35,679
Court ruling Alex will never have someone suggesting he stopped making s*** up

1345
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:41,567
That was a nice attempt by Joe to push back on something Alex with your house slippery Alex Drive

1346
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:44,127
To be how he needs to be seen as right

1347
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,407
Even when it mitting

1348
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,175
That he's wrong

1349
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:50,015
Play the Trump campaign members are getting million-dollar deals

1350
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,575
Some companies like AT&T and then when he's pressed on it

1351
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,623
Yes it made you just using a TDS

1352
01:03:54,879 --> 01:04:01,023
An examples

1353
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:03,327
When did have a million-dollar deal with AT&T

1354
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:07,167
So I guess that's not true now what you was right to use AT&T as an example

1355
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,727
You see how this is intentionally obtuse

1356
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,519
Supposed to be confusing

1357
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:15,103
So you'd have a difficult time nailing down exactly what Alex is even saying

1358
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:21,503
An article in Reuters from 2018 discusses how Michael Cohen's consulting firm essential Consultants LLC

1359
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:27,903
Was paid approximately $600,000 a 20-17 by AT&T to advise them on how to work with Trump

1360
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:31,999
This is not illegal but it's shady as hell and guess what code was still working

1361
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,279
A trumpet the time

1362
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,559
If anything busy

1363
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:39,423
Just an indication of the Shady sleazy behavior that was tolerated and totally normal in Trump Circle

1364
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:45,567
The whole thing is tolerated

1365
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:50,943
Like there was a huge merger on the table between AT&T and Time Warner which dropped been opposed

1366
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,967
Do since it would it

1367
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:52,991
As he said

1368
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:53,759
Put quote

1369
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,575
Too much concentration of power into the hands of too few

1370
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:59,647
After the election quote Cohen approach ATM

1371
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:02,719
Do you about working on their behalf at the post-election transition

1372
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,511
He was given a one-year contract.

1373
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,047
Did $50,000 per box

1374
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:12,703
In fairness AT&T also donated $2000000 towards Trump's inauguration to it wasn't like going with the only person get

1375
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:15,775
Everybody made their

1376
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,055
Everybody made their

1377
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:20,127
We we got nope

1378
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:24,223
The argument that to Alex seems to be making as the Trump hates lobbyists

1379
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:30,623
Everyone around him is a lobbyist personal lawyer was engaged in a pretty clear case of influence peddling

1380
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,671
Write this is a dumb argument

1381
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:37,279
Push back on a little bit more but he doesn't

1382
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,815
So you have this

1383
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,583
And like

1384
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,399
Band up

1385
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:48,799
Finding that a story about Michael Cohen getting money from AT&T store now all of everything is true

1386
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:51,615
Is it

1387
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:55,455
Crazy for saying nothing

1388
01:05:55,711 --> 01:06:00,831
The problem becomes Alex make Sensational claims that he thinks are proven by a headline

1389
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:05,439
And he's in a space with a guy who can have things proven to him by a headline

1390
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:12,607
It's a real challenge here's what I did I'll have my guy Google it and he read me a headline so now it's true

1391
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:15,679
A really difficult to ever get to anything Morrison

1392
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,447
Substantial

1393
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:19,007
So angry

1394
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:21,823
Well I mean this is probably making more mad

1395
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:27,199
Do you remember that Alex likes or dislikes Jared Kushner

1396
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,759
Which day

1397
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:34,111
Are you currently right now

1398
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,927
You think that I think he's on the doesn't like Kushner tip right now

1399
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:37,695
Now that's a

1400
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,743
I can tell you that

1401
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,511
I can tell you this

1402
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,303
People were really pissed

1403
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,327
Patriots game

1404
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,631
And others

1405
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,399
Enemies

1406
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,215
Banana kush

1407
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,495
Lot of respect

1408
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,031
She got a lot of

1409
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,567
Nobody else

1410
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:57,151
Interesting how little press

1411
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:00,479
I wonder why they're getting done

1412
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:01,759
You never heard it

1413
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:05,855
Like a month ago I was ranting on his show about how Jared was part of the deep state

1414
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,135
So you are right

1415
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:10,719
These allegiances just go back and forth with little meeting at all

1416
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:14,047
Did they do something I can present is good to f****** Patriots

1417
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:16,863
Daily do something I'm supposed to know what I just heard talk.

1418
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:20,447
Soros gave him some money to secretly working together

1419
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:26,591
Anthony's B steals they're getting a bunch of press coverage but it's not getting the kind of coverage these guys want

1420
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:30,175
Which is people saying the Trump save the world then the reason

1421
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,223
They are getting that coverage

1422
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:32,991
Because he hasn't

1423
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:36,831
To be clear Pieces good and I'll always be happy when people are work

1424
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,599
Working towards it

1425
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,135
I'm not going to bulk it

1426
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,159
Peace just because it

1427
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,439
Might involve Trump

1428
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,207
Actions

1429
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,487
But there are plenty of reasons

1430
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:46,047
Today key issue with the story and expressed some reservations

1431
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:47,583
The first is that the

1432
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:51,935
The peace deals that have been struck don't involve any consideration of Palestinian

1433
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:53,983
Which by definition is a problem

1434
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,543
The second is that they don't involve Saudi Arabia

1435
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:01,151
The third is that many experts do not believe these Agreements are the foundation of a lasting

1436
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:01,919
Peace

1437
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:08,575
Somerville noted that these deals with ag Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates recognizing and normalizing relations

1438
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,343
Israel

1439
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,647
They're less likely to create a real function

1440
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:16,255
Peace but they are designed to expand regional trade by normalizing these relations

1441
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,559
And to isolate a Ron

1442
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:25,215
By normalizing relations with the UAE and Israel the possibility of using UAE as a place to

1443
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,239
Launch from

1444
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:28,799
For any possible attack on a run

1445
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:31,103
Becomes a real issue that Iran has to deal

1446
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:33,919
Ultimately this is not nothing

1447
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:38,015
But it's also not a real peace plan if it doesn't include the Palestinian voice

1448
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:40,319
And also a lot of groundwork for these deals

1449
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:43,391
They weren't late by Trumpeter actually exact work

1450
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:45,695
Should be done by the United Nation

1451
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:49,023
We'll see what happens and how this situation develops

1452
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,351
But it's nonsense to pretend that the media hasn't covered these deals

1453
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:54,911
Overly

1454
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,703
Deferential to Trump in there cover

1455
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,983
Honestly

1456
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:03,103
Deals that are going to lead to war

1457
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,151
I mean that's what it

1458
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:11,551
That's what they're creating they're creating a f****** stopgap in order to put their f******

1459
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:14,111
Susan plate that's one perspective on it

1460
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:18,975
Having the amount of information that I have in the abilities that I have I can't

1461
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:21,023
Accurately

1462
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,047
Assess

1463
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,071
This until later

1464
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,863
Water and the effects

1465
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,631
Armoire

1466
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:28,447
I can't say that I don't think this takes

1467
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,215
Consideration

1468
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:29,983
The Palestinian

1469
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:33,823
It nearly the the except that they need to

1470
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,615
And that's a problem

1471
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:36,895
Which is going to lead to

1472
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:38,687
Most likely

1473
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:45,087
So this is still about Jared Kushner here they're talkin about kushner's dad right now I was a criminal

1474
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,111
Criminal

1475
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,135
Yeah unlike

1476
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:47,903
Unlike Kushner

1477
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:48,671
Sure

1478
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,975
It's a Rogan find an article

1479
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,511
About Chris Christie

1480
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,303
Who was involved in

1481
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,583
The prosecution of course

1482
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,351
Where's father

1483
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:59,167
And so they they talk about that and then Alex

1484
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,191
Make s*** up

1485
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,727
And so what am I supposed to do the process

1486
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,519
I mean if a guy hires a process

1487
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:04,543
Seduce

1488
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,591
His brother-in-law was his brother-in-law

1489
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,895
His brother-in-law brother-in-law

1490
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,663
Okay

1491
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,431
I like a complete

1492
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,967
And then videotapes it

1493
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:13,247
Send send the video.

1494
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,271
To his sister

1495
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,295
To attempt

1496
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,063
Intimidate her

1497
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,599
Testifying before grand jury

1498
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,879
They're really need anymore

1499
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,719
But but it wasn't his interpretation

1500
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:24,767
All the time

1501
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,815
People do videotaped other person cheating

1502
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:29,119
That's why I went to prison

1503
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:32,959
Because he wasn't doing if you was doing that the show that the person testifying was wrong

1504
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,751
Of course you're trying to influence testimony

1505
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,543
It's this idea that

1506
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,079
Yes that they're cheating

1507
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:40,127
I told you they were here's the proof how does that be

1508
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,151
Become fraud

1509
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:41,919
Okay I'm confused

1510
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:44,479
So he set up his brother-in-law

1511
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,759
With a

1512
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,295
Attitude

1513
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,831
What's been going on before what you do

1514
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:54,975
Alex is having fun here making things up but I regret to inform you that Jared's father Charles Kushner plead guilty

1515
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,999
To quote

1516
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:59,071
16 counts of assisting in the filing a false tax return

1517
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:03,167
One count of retaliating against a cooperating witness and one count of making

1518
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,959
Making false statements to the federal election

1519
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,727
Condition

1520
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,775
Well he was running his business Kushner

1521
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:14,175
Companies Charles had falsified charitable contributions in the excessive $1000000 to cheat on taxes

1522
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:20,831
His sister was a witness to the crime and he didn't want her to testify so he attempted to hire sex worker to seduce her husband

1523
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,623
Which you would record and use as blackmail

1524
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,671
He pled guilty to all of this

1525
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:30,559
And even coach told the court that he had paid a private investigator $25,000 to arrange for the seduction

1526
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:32,607
And videotaping of the cooperating with

1527
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,375
Husband

1528
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:38,751
Kushner admitted to personally recruiting The Prostitute and instructing the videotape emailed

1529
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,031
Do the cooperating Witness

1530
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:47,199
Alex's pretending this is just a thing workers dad claimed that this dude was cheating but don't believe him so I guess he went and hired a sec

1531
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:51,551
Sex workers who could videotape them having sex

1532
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,599
I am right

1533
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:58,207
Wow this is childish trying to pass off his truth

1534
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:01,279
A lot of reasonable people try and prove themselves correct

1535
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:05,375
By hiring a stalker in order to Blackmail their relation

1536
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:08,703
Remind me to do with this has proven himself

1537
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:12,031
Right and he knew he wasn't going to get a fair Shake in in court

1538
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:18,431
Because Rich guys never get a fair Shake Dan the other 16 counts of fraud that he also touch

1539
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,479
Those were fake

1540
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,015
I want you to think about this

1541
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:25,087
I was reflecting on as I was going through this episode

1542
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,623
If Alex Jones

1543
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:29,951
Wasn't the Trainwreck lightning-rod of attention The Joe Rogan

1544
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,487
Can capitalize on platforming

1545
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:35,327
Would you take any of this yet that he's saying seriously even for a second

1546
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:40,191
Just imagine that in the context of this episode like all of the content is the same

1547
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:42,495
But it's being said by a random person

1548
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,543
You rightly ignore them

1549
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:46,335
It assumed that they weren't well

1550
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:51,455
Joe Rogan's only doing this because of the attention that he can get out of having Alex on his podcast

1551
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:55,039
And possibly some imagining that their friends

1552
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,319
I can't believe

1553
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:58,879
Sounds like he does

1554
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:01,695
Sounds like he still thinks their friends

1555
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:05,535
Does he not listen to her show I have warned him many times that Alex

1556
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,303
This is not his friend

1557
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,583
I feel like his mom right

1558
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:10,655
He's getting caught up in the wrong crack

1559
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,447
Do you like it by the end of this

1560
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:16,287
Joe doesn't realize that Alex is not his friend and he's being used

1561
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:19,359
I just don't eat beyond that point ever reached

1562
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,151
Because Alex

1563
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:21,919
If Joe wants

1564
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,455
To look more into this

1565
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:25,759
This a story about kushner's Dad

1566
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,295
And here's Alex's response

1567
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:30,367
So he set up his brother-in-law

1568
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,391
With a price

1569
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,159
Destitute

1570
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,463
To show that this was been going on before Wichita deal

1571
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,047
Haida Prost

1572
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:38,815

Into having sex

1575
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:41,887
In a Bridgewater

1576
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,167
New Jersey motel in Frisco

1577
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:43,935
You find yourself

1578
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:45,727
Bridgewater New Jersey motel room

1579
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:50,335
Camera roll

1580
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:52,383
A tape of the encounter was then sent to Krishna

1581
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,503
Builders warehouse

1582
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,039
Distrust

1583
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:02,623
We're Infowars

1584
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:05,439
Just rustic

1585
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:07,743
Now granted all the information you'll be able

01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:08,767
Define does not

1587
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:11,071
Support my version of things

1588
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:17,983
How about no Alex have not learned that you like that is a new slogan for them

1589
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,287
Just trust us look into it

1590
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,567
Hey

01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:24,127
The world is run by demon

1592
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,919
Okay

1593
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:28,735
So Alex he doesn't just rely on trust

1594
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,271
He also has sources

1595
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:31,807
And he's brought

1596
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:35,903
We're going to get a lot of lieutenant-colonel.

1597
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:36,927

01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,639
And Joseph Stalin

1611
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:59,455
Isn't he doing that

1612
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:03,295
Pull up

1613
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:06,623
Adolf Hitler Joseph Stalin

1614
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:14,303
Those are 2015

1615
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:20,191
Always weirds me out whenever he specifically brings up Hitler and Stalin as being like

1616
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:23,263
Look at the guys this idiot admires

1617
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:27,359
Cody never never liked notes Hitler and Stalin

1618
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,383
And I love those

1619
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:31,711
Well he has at least that there studs

1620
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,783
Joe again

1621
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,575
He's trying

1622
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:42,463
Part of my argument that this is just not a thing you can do responsibly tries to push back

1623
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,999
On Alex's claim

1624
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:46,815
That she had to come out and said

1625
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:49,631
That he's going to destroy Trump or whatever

1626
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,935
Handle

1627
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:53,983
The Washington Post

1628
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,287
The LA Times the New York Times I brought you the Arctic

1629
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,055
Wilshere

1630
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:59,359
Dreams of Red Emperor the Relentless rise

1631
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:01,919
Image articles

1632
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:04,223
He must destroy American West

1633
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:04,991
Christian Valley

1634
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,015
We love them

1635
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,039
And we accept

1636
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,063
China is our master

1637
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,135
Who's this

1638
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,927
Washington Post

1639
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:15,231
Who sing that quote

1640
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:18,047
The Washington Post

1641
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,863
There's a huge article LA Times I understand but the

1642
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:21,631
The quote that you just

1643
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,447
Just like I said

1644
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:27,775
AT&T gave money on the Pixley lobbying you pull it up

1645
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,359
But what

1646
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:32,895
Who you quoted song

1647
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,431
Did you quote when you

1648
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,711
I'm quoting

1649
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,015
This morning before I came here

1650
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:39,039
What I remember

1651
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:39,807
David

1652
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,087
Don

1653
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,111
Curry

1654
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,135
Burley

1655
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,671
Nn

1656
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:51,839
Chinese ladies white and yellow the prevailing sentiment of what they feel they must

1657
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:54,655
Jumping in their articles

1658
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,471
Destroyed

1659
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,239
Save them

1660
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,263
From weekend America

1661
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:04,127
Look at the Chinese dictator

1662
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,151
Do you think

1663
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,175
That they're doing that

1664
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,455
Happy cuz jump

1665
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,223
Change the

1666
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,759
The trade deal

1667
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,807
Trump trade War he ended our sermons

1668
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:12,575
Okay

1669
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,879
You can see like Allegan camp

1670
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,415
Answer direct questions

1671
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:21,279
Think about what are you talkin about I remember from what I read this morning

1672
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,583
That's not that is not a breath

1673
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,423
Terrible

1674
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,703
Is it longer than 4 Page

1675
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:31,775
Probably

1676
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:34,847
The towards the end of this episode I get I found one of these

1677
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:35,615
Greatest

1678
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:39,455
Exaggerations of length of everfree it's amazing

1679
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:42,271
Okay

1680
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,575
So are they going to talk about climate

1681
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:46,623
Change a bit here

1682
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,439
Alex is really into

1683
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,207
Cole

1684
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:50,975
Charcoal plant

1685
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,511
That's really clean 104

1686
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:53,791
How's that

1687
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,095
Skype there two different types

1688
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:58,911
The major play say when he says Clean Coal a roll my

1689
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:01,215
What trumps like Queen Cole

1690
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:04,031
Queen

1691
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,055
Is it

1692
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,103
Oh boy

1693
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:12,479
So here we go Alex tries to explain his Clean Coal

1694
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,759
This is amazing

1695
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,551
Infuriate you

1696
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:20,159
But please hold your fire for a moment

1697
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,951
You'll notice in this clip

1698
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,231
I believe what happened

1699
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:25,535
Is that Alex realizes

1700
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:29,375
You don't give her watches cartoons we're like Wile E coyote will run off of

1701
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:35,775
The cliff and I'll make it a few staff and then he looks down and I believe

1702
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,543
What happened

1703
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,079
They had old-fashioned

1704
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:40,639
Google Plants China doesn't have one scrubber or

1705
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,663
Filter on there

1706
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,431
Coal Power Plant

1707
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:43,967
China doesn't have

1708
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:46,527
There's one place United States

1709
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,551
Major deposits

1710
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,319
Occult

1711
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,343
Such pure carb

1712
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:50,879
Scrubbers

1713
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,951
Nothing comes out the carbon dioxide water

1714
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,487
Well they know we know water

1715
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,767
Stop Ashley what's carbon

1716
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,535
Dioxide

1717
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:59,071
People think it's Monica side

1718
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,351
Studies of you say

1719
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,655
The scientific name of water most

1720
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:05,983
Play band

1721
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:08,031
You go out with Street jail Road

1722
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:12,127
Monoxide is ever

1723
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,663
Everywhere you get too much of either.

1724
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,431
Background

1725
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:19,551
So what I think is going on here is that Alex knows the word scrubber and that's about the dab

1726
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:22,879
Of his understanding of this topic I looks like that's where we're at

1727
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:25,439
He knows like as he's starting to talk is like

1728
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:28,767
I don't really have much else to say on this so I'm going to just rest

1729
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:32,607
How about I'll chemical names are weird and people don't know what they are

1730
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:36,191
It's a lot of fun but it has nothing to do with the subject of clean call its

1731
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:40,543
Leanne attempt to get Joe to forget the line of questioning he was going down

1732
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:43,103
I get lost in this site Trail because Alex is a

1733
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:45,151
Caught in a lie that he can't backup

1734
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,455
There is no such thing as clean cold the way they

1735
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:53,855
He is imagining it and he's lying to Joe's face way that he's talking about scrubbers almost like he thinks that there's like

1736
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,391
3670

1737
01:19:55,647 --> 01:20:01,791
Keep Century Japanese women with like little brushes just

1738
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:08,191
Sonifi add Scrubbing Bubbles from the commercial that are running around and smiling

1739
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:14,592
Piece of charcoal

1740
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:18,176
Going to be so f****** pissed by the end of this section understand

1741
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,200
How

1742
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:23,040
Many people are listening to Joe Rogan

1743
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,832
And Alex Jones talk about the

1744
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:25,856
The climate

1745
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:31,488
What me thank God the Joe's here to correct this a bad speech millions of people listen to

1746
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,888
Magical great Cole out and west

1747
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,216
There's a place in the United

1748
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:43,008
States where carbon is just soap

1749
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:49,408
You're right that's what is that what is that f****** carbon nanotubes

1750
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:51,968
Diamond

1751
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:54,272
It's cute pure carbon so clean

1752
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:56,064
What is soclean

1753
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,112
Same thing we do the scientific name of salt

1754
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:00,928
Shoshone

1755
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:01,696
Forgot that one

1756
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:02,976
Monoxide

1757
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,024
Dockside

1758
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:05,792
That's a good one

1759
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:06,816
That's

1760
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,608
Wow light

1761
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:09,888
Water

1762
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,168
Oxygen

1763
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,192
Carbon dioxide

1764
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:13,984
You got to have fur

1765
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,008
4life

1766
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,848
Just say Cole his return

1767
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,640
Quickshot carbon dioxide

1768
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:21,664
And water vapor

1769
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:26,016
Dirty Cole full

1770
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:27,040
Bluemercury Oliver

1771
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:28,064
Huge deposit

1772
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,344
A clean-burning call

1773
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:32,928
The whole world for a thousand

1774
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,024
One Call

1775
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,816
It showed a that's only on stage

1776
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,888
That basically you don't even put scrubbers on

1777
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,168
You need to scrubbers

1778
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,216
This is Disturbed

1779
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:48,032
How to fight somebody

1780
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,056
I'm going to walk out of this

1781
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:55,456
And I'm just going to fight the first f****** person I said about investing in like a heavy bag not for twerking

1782
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:58,528
But just for like a road without another episode

1783
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:02,624
Songs for me while I'm listening to these clips

1784
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:07,744
Completely misleading Joe on the main issue which is that carbon dioxide is not just magically good

1785
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,560
It's necessary for Life yes that is true but

1786
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:13,632
In excess amounts it has a bad effect on the environment

1787
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:16,192
Alex compared to water so I will too

1788
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:19,008
You need water to live but too much of it will kill you it

1789
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,288
It's the same thing with CO2

1790
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,360
Is this conversation Alex's reframe the issue

1791
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:26,688
Cuso the part that requires pushback isn't even being discussed

1792
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:33,344
Depardieu needs to attack is the idea that CO2 emissions are always good but everyone thinks they're bad cuz they're actually

1793
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,624
Carbon monoxide

1794
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,392
That's what it is

1795
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:39,744
In the world and Alex could never defend that position

1796
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,328
But now Alex has introduced a completely new layer to this b*******

1797
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:48,960
Which is that there's magical super pure cool at West is that I just

1798
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:50,240
I just

1799
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,776
The

1800
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,312
Magical

1801
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:58,432
Anyting Utah he's literally doing a f****** Brigham Young honest

1802
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:04,064
We have to go to Utah to buy well Golden Plates is that what we're doing Dan

1803
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:10,464
You can find a full report from the US Geological Survey of all the coal deposits in Utah play none of them seem to match with Alex's

1804
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,232
Describing

1805
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:17,888
You really think that they make note of this magic Cole that could power the entire world for a thousand years but I guess they somehow overlooked that

1806
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:18,656
Globalist

1807
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,680
Also Utah

1808
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:21,216
Responsible for mining approximately

1809
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:21,984
2%

1810
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,288
Ethical let's use annually in the United States

1811
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,824
Yeah but that's the match

1812
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,104
Sure

1813
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:33,760
A real and it's just a childish brain has come up with when he thinks about the word

1814
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:34,784
Clean Coal

1815
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,832
But his strategy is really good here

1816
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:37,856
What he's done

1817
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:41,696
Create a completely outrageous claim that's going to distract people from the farm or in

1818
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:43,488
Insidious one that you've snuck through

1819
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,096
There's no time to argue about CO2 if you're caught up with this magical Utah call

1820
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,376
Yeah it doesn't

1821
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,912
Really actually work

1822
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:51,936
There is.

1823
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:55,008
Because he has my document here's my argument to the magical Cole

1824
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,056
No now let's talk about CO2

1825
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:58,080
Well

1826
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:00,640
Magical call is more fun

1827
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:02,432
It is way more fun

1828
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,200
You can't

1829
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,224
You can't do that

1830
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:07,040
Can't tell me that there's magical bird

1831
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,064
Coldwell

1832
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,088
Usher you should

1833
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,368
Cuz it's not

1834
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,136
It's not a good idea

1835
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:11,904
But

1836
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:13,696
Alex dozen

1837
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,256
Succeed in wiggling loose

1838
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:18,048
From this this trap

1839
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:21,120
Or whatever not really in the Trap

1840
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:25,728
You look mr. Magoo do you ran into like a coat rack

1841
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:26,496
And

1842
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:32,896
A coat fell on him and he thinks it's in that cell

1843
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:38,016
And he's trying to get out of this metaphorical code by rambling of that has CO2 is great

1844
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:40,064
This gets so weird

1845
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:43,136
One call is so damn. It's only I've stated

1846
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,208
Prescribers on it

1847
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,488
Are scientists

1848
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,256
In the 4050

1849
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,280
70s

1850
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:50,816
They realize that dirty call her

1851
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:51,584
What's mercury in it

1852
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:52,864
As always horrible toxic

1853
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:53,888
Robert Sonic

1854
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:54,912
20 Robert Culp

1855
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,472
Wires

1856
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:58,752
Hoses

1857
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:01,824
That's because it's

1858
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,896
And then take off all the cameras

1859
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:06,688
Plastic

1860
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,456
Chemicals

1861
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:08,480
Pesticide

1862
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:09,248
Make everything else

1863
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,528
It comes out of that

1864
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,808
And then out of the stack

1865
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,856
Nothing but what if Center

1866
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,392
Nothing but water

1867
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,160
And carbon dioxide

1868
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:17,440
Totally clean

1869
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,208
Totally pure

1870
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,488
Chow Chow

1871
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,512
That's what's going on

1872
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,304
Carbon monoxide

1873
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,072
Why does everybody

1874
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,096
Is worried about carbs

1875
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,120
Urban dioxide

1876
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,168
And the environment has

1877
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:27,936
No negative

1878
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,216
We'll talk about

1879
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:35,616
Let's carbon monoxide is not

1880
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:42,016
Something people are concerned about but it's a completely different issue has failed on many many levels but the fact

1881
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:48,160
This one right I will give him props for that and it allows for the opportunity for Alex.

1882
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:53,536
I have to say more and that in and of itself is kind of a good situation

1883
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,584
If you handle it appropriately

1884
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,376
An after-the-fact you say

1885
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,656
That's stupid

1886
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,448
Doesn't

1887
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:05,568
He does allow for the opportunity for Alex

1888
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,616
Carbon dioxide

1889
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,920
Was over 500 times stronger

1890
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:10,944
Ian the time

1891
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,712
T-Rex

1892
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,760
Okay

1893
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:14,784
That's what plant

1894
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:15,552
Krystal fast

1895
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:16,576
So big

1896
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:19,136
Just like Mars loss

1897
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:20,928
U7 ocean

1898
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:23,232
Lost

1899
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,768
Smaller Planet couldn't hold

1900
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,304
Is the earth losing its hat

1901
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:27,840
Crazy is

1902
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,400
What time pump up all

1903
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,680
Of this juice and all this

1904
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:32,448
Carbon

1905
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,728
Was produced on the service

1906
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:35,776
Ran down cracks

1907
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,336
Went out pumping out all that

1908
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,104
Carbon steel

1909
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:40,640
Years ago

1910
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,408
Terraforming

1911
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:43,968
The planets carbon dioxide

1912
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:47,296
Leave right this time like alien figure this out

1913
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,856
Isn't carbon

1914
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:54,208
But they said

1915
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:55,232
That we would have a 7

1916
01:26:55,488 --> 01:27:00,608
Increase they said that my 2013 all that La would be flooded to Newark beatified all that slice

1917
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,400
Forget about what they said in the past

1918
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:03,936
They're saying now

1919
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,240
Carbon dioxide

1920
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:08,288
Responsible

1921
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,056
4 in in

1922
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:12,128
Which which which we hope

1923
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:13,920
Pick-n-Pull opening

1924
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,224
The last ice age

1925
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:16,992
Hold a butthole.

1926
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:20,320
Apparently

1927
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:23,904
Temperature's going up is good or alright

1928
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,184
We need a big

1929
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,000
Big box like a packing box

1930
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:29,792
Put some holes in it

1931
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:32,352
When you put Alex in there and we need to feed him once

1932
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:34,400
That's what I think we need to do

1933
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:41,056
I don't even if I'd be safe I think it's a good idea so here we learned that there was way more CO2 in the atmosphere during the time

1934
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:47,456
Do dinosaurs but since then CO2 levels have gone.

1935
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,736
Accompanies of come-alongs

1936
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:50,528
And figured out the perfect solution

1937
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:52,064
Pollutant what happened

1938
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,600
Baker billions of dollars

1939
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:55,136
I leave I'm being

1940
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:56,928
Charitable when I say air hose

1941
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:01,280
It's fair enough that CO2 levels were much higher in the time of dinosaurs butt

1942
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:02,048
So what

1943
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:08,448
Those millions of years ago and to pretend that we're at all ready to face the kind of issues that would accompany the Earth changing to a climate unseen

1944
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:09,728
For millions of years

1945
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:16,128
Is comical dinosaurs record

1946
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:18,432
Detailed notes and they left us solution

1947
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,736
Unfortunately they didn't survive six

1948
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:25,344
52 million year turned into a cockroach

1949
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:31,744
There's normal variability in the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere over time that is

1950
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,512
Fair enough

1951
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:38,656
And you can see it roughly go up and down and waves for the past like 800,000 years

1952
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:42,496
To the time posty dust real Revolution present

1953
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,264
That wave get

1954
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:50,944
With 2019 number representing a 33% increase over the previous highest CO2 concentration recorded

1955
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:52,992
About 300,000 years ago

1956
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:59,904
Alex does not understand the issues he's talking about and I will at least plug Joe for creating the situation where Alex sounds like

1957
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,952
The idiot that he is but I resent

1958
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:03,488
But he doesn't have the ability to

1959
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:04,512
Call Alex

1960
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,048
A liar and a fraud

1961
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,072
Descent

1962
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:09,888
Did this s*** is nonsense we have no idea what he's talking

1963
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:12,960
I mean it's even worse it's

1964
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:15,776
It's so much worse now than we could even

1965
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:20,384
Like a bit the problem is we're so distracted by the rest of everything being the words

1966
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,688
Like ice sheets are not even for me

1967
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,736
Like this is not good

1968
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:29,856
Yeah everything is really really bad with the climate more so than anything else

1969
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,392
More f*****

1970
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,672
What's up

1971
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:34,464
It's hard to look at the

1972
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,024
Why we're staying here

1973
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:42,912
Nearest source of freshwater Dan Hotel over there we'll grab some buckets every morning will boil them and we'll have a great day

1974
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:46,752
Joe does make another good play

1975
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:50,336
Here on the same topic in that is that well

1976
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:52,640
You know it's been shown that

1977
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:53,408
Rising

1978
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:56,480
Temperatures lead to hurricanes

1979
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:58,016
Because of the Rising

1980
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:58,784
Water temperature

1981
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,064
Condition

1982
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:03,392
Where is storms are stronger and there's more of them could play

1983
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:04,416
Oh boy

1984
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:05,952
The increase

1985
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:06,976
Temperature of the earth is

1986
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:08,768
Hurricanes

1987
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:09,792
The frequency

1988
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,560
In the power of the

1989
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,352
If you look up the

1990
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,400
The last hundred years Earth

1991
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,448
That's all media hype

1992
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:19,264
Chow Chow

1993
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,032
I swear to God

1994
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,128
Are you a carbon

1995
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:27,200
Well said

1996
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,016
Can I please tell you what's going on

1997
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,832
You are a carbon-based life

1998
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,392
Let me show you what I came here with my

1999
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:38,720
Hellboy huracanes no matter how you want it

2000
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:39,744
Determine the statistic

2001
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:45,632
If you want to go by total number of named storms 2005 is a record holder with 28

2002
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,912
But it probably won't

2003
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:47,680
Before long

2004
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:53,312
Since less than a week ago we saw tropical storm Zeta represent the 27th named storm of the season

2005
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:54,336
Which won't be over

2006
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,872
Until the end of November release

2007
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:02,528
If you want to go by severity of storms that's been increasing as well if you want to go with frequency of stronger storms that setting records

2008
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:06,624
Frequency of storms that Escalade very rapidly is also increasing

2009
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:10,720
Three of the top five most costly storms in recorded history in the United

2010
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:13,024
It states happened in the 2017

2011
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,816
The other two were in 2012

2012
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:15,840
2005

2013
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:18,400
You have to go 23 storms down that list

2014
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:20,192
251 that happened before 1960

2015
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:20,960
C5

2016
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:25,056
It's not media hype that hurricanes are getting stronger and happening more frequently

2017
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:26,592
Joking scoff italics

2018
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:30,432
Deserve to be allowed to be scoffed at and then move along.

2019
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:33,248
Dumbass distraction point but how were carbon-based life-form

2020
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:35,552
He deserves to have this show grind to a halt

2021
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:37,856
Until he can see that he's making this up

2022
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:40,160
He should have to be forced

2023
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:41,440
To either leave

2024
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:44,512
Your admit I don't know what I'm talking about

2025
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:45,536
I'm full of s***

2026
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,352
Anything else is a wind

2027
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:51,424
Anything else is a win like pivoting over to like

2028
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,472
Oh we're carbon-based life-forms

2029
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:56,544
Is exactly what Alex needs to do

2030
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,080
And allowing him to do it

2031
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:00,384
Is conceding this point essentially

2032
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,664
And it's just a better move

2033
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,432
Rogan

2034
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:04,224
Rogan

2035
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,272
Having him walk off his show

2036
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,808
It's just the best thing that Rogan

2037
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:14,720
Well everybody would have non-stop talked about it instead of being the giant piece of s*** that would have been

2038
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:21,120
Been one side of the argument in the other argument with a look at how it's essentially

2039
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:24,192
Because if he eat

2040
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:25,728
Gratwick believes he can have his

2041
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:30,592
Come on Gallagher moment when you get the Trainwreck

2042
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:34,432
Inevitably happens whenever Alex Goes anywhere in Idaho

2043
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:38,272
He's guaranteed attention no matter what he does

2044
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,808
Zip half that he's chosen

2045
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:40,832
To take as the one

2046
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:45,440
The county has the appearance of responsibility but isn't really all that responsible

2047
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:46,720
Because

2048
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,512
Alex Price

2049
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:51,072
Do you know rant about carbon

2050
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:52,352
Cuz you got some.

2051
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:56,448
But he also realizes again much like Wile E coyote

2052
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,728
He has run out of cliff

2053
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:00,544
So he tries to transition

2054
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,080
Into some transphobia

2055
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:04,384
Sure and I'm too Jose credit

2056
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,176
He tries to get him back on track

2057
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:10,016
What are you what is what is what is what is Joe Rogan made of

2058
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:11,296
Carpet

2059
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,344
What we are literally

2060
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:15,904
What are songwriters

2061
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:20,256
Carb songs

2062
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:21,792
Carbon-based life

2063
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,840
Most

2064
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:25,376
The dishes the carbon cycle

2065
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:26,656
What's your sign

2066
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,704
Search up so just like

2067
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,496
They think they come out and assault reali now

2068
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:32,544
A little boy is biologically

2069
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,312
It girl

2070
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:39,456
Let's not go down in capital

2071
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:42,016
Two genders

2072
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:43,040
Let's not go down that road

2073
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:48,160
That road in the future

2074
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:50,208
I don't want to get off track, because

2075
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,000
Is there a delicate balance

2076
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:53,536
The temperature on Earth

2077
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,304
The rising

2078
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,096
Sea levels in the melting the ice caps

2079
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:57,632
This is all been

2080
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:58,912
Bushfire

2081
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:01,984
But very can

2082
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:03,264
Environmental

2083
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,056
Have said that an increase in

2084
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:06,080
The temperature of the Earth

2085
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,104
Disastrous

2086
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:10,432
Are you sure it's a power grab

2087
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:13,504
How do you know that it's not

2088
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,528
How do you know

2089
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:18,112
Because they're arrogant they've all written white papers on that I'd rather give you

2090
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:18,880
Okay

2091
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:20,160
Wow

2092
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,184
U-cat

2093
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,744
And you don't

2094
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:29,888
Example even if it's a power Dynamic like with Rogan who is he

2095
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:31,936
It's ya to stay on because this

2096
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:35,520
His mrs. Outlet Rogan's the only one is willing to put a monkey butt

2097
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:37,312
The face of Spotify.

2098
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:38,848
And

2099
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,128
Just

2100
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:41,664
No matter what

2101
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,200
If you just point out some

2102
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:46,528
Power grab

2103
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,344
But but the reason

2104
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:55,488
But the reason that you descend to that is because Joe clearly wasn't taking the bait with going down the drain the hypocritical

2105
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:57,536
Play I was hoping to

2106
01:34:57,792 --> 01:35:03,680
Pilot the conversation into that water can keep motormouth Highway through its impact

2107
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:04,448
The fact that I could

2108
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:07,264
Completely punted too far off carbon

2109
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:14,432
Until you have to just be blocked no power grab a red light papers I could prove everything bother.

2110
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:17,760
Ends up

2111
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,064
At the bottom and it's sort of

2112
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,088
Becomes like

2113
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:24,928
Listen to this clip of Alex they're sort of like

2114
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:30,304
Alright fine I'll just say all the words I know about climate change CO2 and stuff

2115
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:31,840
There is

2116
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:32,608
Contributing fact

2117
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:33,888
Scientific

2118
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:35,424
Proven that

2119
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,216
Increase carbon dioxide

2120
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:37,984
Has Anna

2121
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:38,752
Effect on the

2122
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:43,104
It depends on the models that you

2123
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,128
Sometimes

2124
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:45,152
More carbon dioxide

2125
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:45,920
I can cause a cooling

2126
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:48,480
Healing effect it depends

2127
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:49,248
Apologize

2128
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:50,784
Volcanic

2129
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,576
The time also

2130
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:54,112
Solar maximum and minimum

2131
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:04,352
Alex's threw out that meaningless word salad of everything he can remember Lord monckton telling him in the past

2132
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:06,144
Solar maximum

2133
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,192
Potash

2134
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:09,984
None of that is

2135
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:16,384
Just Alex's weasel answer so he doesn't have to own the position of having that CO2 going up causes temperature to go

2136
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:22,784
This is all just a function of him not wanting to get nailed down on a particular fact because if he does he has to only

2137
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:23,552
Implications

2138
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:24,832
Princeton

2139
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,624
If Joe gets him to admit that Rising

2140
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,928
CO2 levels result in higher temperatures

2141
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:31,232
Justify why higher temp

2142
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,000
Pictures are good

2143
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:37,632
If Joe could demonstrate the negative effects of rising temperatures from the rising sea level

2144
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:44,032
Do the relationship between water temperatures and hurricanes to the droughts around the world to the fact that many regions of the world could become

2145
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:44,800
Uninhabitable

2146
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:49,664
And caused massive dislocation of people then Alex would have to accept that he was in

2147
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,944
Favor of those things

2148
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:52,224
You can't do that

2149
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:58,112
So that's why you always gives not answers which allowed to continue to operate in this deceptive space

2150
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:01,696
Commit to anything except everything and everyone dropped

2151
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,024
I don't understand the bottle

2152
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,328
I just don't understand what it is

2153
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,376
Really like deep down

2154
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:12,192
That makes conservatives want to rub oil

2155
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:13,216
Balls all over there

2156
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:15,008
I just don't get it

2157
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:15,776
Just like

2158
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:19,616
I just love that s*** on their face and I just don't understand

2159
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:25,760
Yeah I don't I don't know exactly either maybe that's the way we do

2160
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:31,648
Okay we have to do something about climate change otherwise all those people are going to be at have to come here

2161
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:34,464
That is not ecofascism

2162
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,512
Totally know I'm just trying to trick them in

2163
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:42,912
And doing it I'm not I do I did not come over here to an argument

2164
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:49,312
I'll go over here and be like hey see if we do this then you won't have to deal with all these refugees

2165
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:52,128
At the same time I'll be like come on in refugees just come around the back

2166
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:53,408
Around the back entrance

2167
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:58,784
So you're essentially appealing to an Eco fascist argument in order to sway their so

2168
01:37:59,040 --> 01:37:59,552
Support

2169
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:01,088
For the opposite

2170
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:02,624
Good luck

2171
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:07,744
It is next Corp Rogan is trying to explain to Alex

2172
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,048
That there are

2173
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,328
Do you know if there are these

2174
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:16,192
Environmentalists who have a point and then there are people in industry and they aren't the same people

2175
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:17,984
Who knows they are working

2176
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,776
Different

2177
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:22,592
Alex does not agree

2178
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:24,384
The environmentalist

2179
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,152
Or not

2180
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:25,920
In bed

2181
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:26,944
Industrialist

2182
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:27,968
Environmentalist

2183
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,760
They're not in bed

2184
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:30,528
With all these

2185
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,064
Think that they can

2186
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:35,904
Control the the worlds

2187
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:37,440
Climate change

2188
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:39,488
There's a bigot

2189
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:41,280
Funders of it contrary to what you

2190
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:45,120
Understand

2191
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,144
You're smart.

2192
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:49,472
Let's go hear what we have to

2193
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:51,520
We have

2194
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:52,544
Can't you understand that

2195
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,312
The way you talk

2196
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:54,336
And I enjoy the weight

2197
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,616
Fast with the way you talk

2198
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:56,640
His fast can you go on these

2199
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:57,408
Long tan

2200
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:58,688
And you go to frogs

2201
01:38:58,944 --> 01:38:59,456
Being gay

2202
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:03,296
I wanted people control

2203
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:04,320
But I want to do it

2204
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,600
Step-by-step

2205
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,648
But most people

2206
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,184
The vast here we got here

2207
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,208
PPK

2208
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,488
100 million

2209
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:12,512
The fun new admission

2210
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:13,792
Productions project

2211
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:17,120
Appreciate

2212
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:28,128
That is why Joe is not equipped to handle the role he's given himself

2213
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:30,688
That clip perfectly encapsulates visit

2214
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:31,712
Entire dynamic

2215
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:37,856
Joe thinks he can handle taking a mile-a-minute talkers liar like Alex Jones and slowing down

2216
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,904
But they can take these claims piece-by-piece

2217
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,440
And show what's really behind it all

2218
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:48,352
He thinks because of the fake respecting imagines Alex has four and then Alex wouldn't just lie to his face and Dodge on to other topics

2219
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:50,656
Instead of admit that he's lying to his fake friends

2220
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:51,936
Which was wrong

2221
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:53,216
Alex do not give a s*** about

2222
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:58,080
Conversely Joe also really doesn't give as much of a s*** is pretending to

2223
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:01,664
He knows that having Alex Auto be a huge attention-grabber as

2224
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,712
I have the past two times he's been on the show

2225
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:07,552
JoJo also knows that he can't really get away with just having Alex

2226
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:09,088
On like he has in the past

2227
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:14,464
There has to be the appearance of being a critical interview which is manifesting in his attempts

2228
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:15,744
Alex and Roi

2229
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,584
You can clearly see how rattled even just the performance of pushback

2230
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,352
Just alyx

2231
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:22,400
He's flopping all over the place and saying

2232
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:23,680
Completely insane s***

2233
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:25,216
Wiggle is way out of

2234
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:31,872
Corner he accidentally backs himself into but we're Joe gives away his true intentions are moments like they're right at the

2235
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:34,944
He's got Alex in a position where they refocus

2236
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,760
He's supposed to get to his point about a CO2 emission

2237
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:40,576
Conspiracy

2238
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:45,440
Now it's improving and right is Alex is about to start talkin Joe pokes in with the gay frogs

2239
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:49,792
If Joe wants the sideshow but he doesn't want to take responsibility for it

2240
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:54,912
Honestly I kind of find this approach to be more distasteful than him and Eddie Bravo just laughing

2241
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:55,936
Cuz because

2242
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:57,984
It doesn't like that doesn't

2243
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:01,312
Pretend to be something else now this is

2244
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:07,968
This is to healthcare what the AC in this is to reality what the ACA

2245
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:09,504
Day is to socialize

2246
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:11,808
You know like I don't

2247
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:16,160
Something is not

2248
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:19,232
The whole thing sure and it's usually not as good

2249
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,256
And

2250
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:21,792
As we've seen with the ACA

2251
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:25,376
It's caused a lot more problems in harm than everything else

2252
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:32,032
I I don't I don't accept your analogy if only because I think it also helps helping a lot of people.

2253
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:36,640
Tons of people I was being very very I don't know

2254
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:40,992
Maybe there's a possibility that this interview could also help some people

2255
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:47,392
Because I have forgotten some messages from a couple people just in my personal life who don't know Alex that

2256
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:50,208
Well but like Rogan the interview they're like

2257
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,000
What is this drunk

2258
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:53,280
A****** like I

2259
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:54,560
I feel like

2260
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:56,864
Picked up some objective viewers could see

2261
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:01,216
Rogan's pushback and Alex's inability to answer anything we like

2262
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:07,616
It's full of s*** yeah I think there's a possibility that there is some benefit from it but I think the

2263
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:11,200
What what Rogan is setting out to do eat does not achieve

2264
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:15,296
And I think it does more harm

2265
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:17,600
Good cuz you set up the

2266
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:21,952
The impression that Alex is right about a lot of stuff

2267
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:28,352
Demonstrate that he's wrong about everything and let him wiggle out of taking responsibility or owning

2268
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:30,144
The fact that he's wrong about all these things

2269
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,448
And that just makes him appear to be rubbing

2270
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,472
York City

2271
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:34,496
Stupid

2272
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:36,032
Was it entertaining

2273
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,592
Wow why do

2274
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,664
There's one part that will get to that I found

2275
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:42,432
Exciting

2276
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:44,992
Okay almost like the end of a basketball

2277
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:52,416
Cuz I like always

2278
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:55,488
Jack is taking his last two freezer I didn't think it was that good

2279
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:59,328
Warrior training and one of the reasons is that I mean they're all on different

2280
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:04,448
Drugs or sober Shore Sean that is incompatible

2281
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:08,800
Nothing against Tim Dillon but he's just not really even ineffective

2282
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:15,200
Is third part in this bad Bravo at least will bring his own brand of personality and

2283
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:21,856
Tim Dillon's just an Infowars fan likes Alex

2284
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:25,184
And tries to reframe things Alex says

2285
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:28,000
In ways that Joe might be more close to

2286
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:29,024
Greenwood

2287
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,072
It doesn't really make that many jokes

2288
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:34,912
See Eddie Bravo adds that at that element that are

2289
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:35,680
Factor

2290
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:36,960
You know where it's like

2291
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:40,544
Alex goes on a weird rent and then Eddie Bravo's like

2292
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:44,640
You know I heard people were on the moon and they came down to my place

2293
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:49,248
And telling you right now that's why Alex is right

2294
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:50,784
Eddie Bravo

2295
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:51,552
Your nuts

2296
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:56,160
Thank you for smoothing the edges out on Alex saying some really transphobic

2297
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:00,000
So Alex is still a be enforced

2298
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,536
Discuss climate

2299
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:07,936
You would rather have not stayed on this long should never remember everything is guidance

2300
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:11,520
So happy we had this on his Wednesday episode from Wednesday

2301
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:14,848
Volcanoes baby Ariel is one major volcano

2302
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:17,664
Put out more dust

2303
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,432
The decades

2304
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,200
The Fuelman

2305
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:24,064
Is what human cause nuclei deformity

2306
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:28,160
Storm causes a nucleotide

2307
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:30,208
What's the climatologists

2308
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:32,512
They haven't broken down

2309
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:33,792
The Sun by Mac

2310
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:36,096
Is 98

2311
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:36,864
Percent of

2312
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:37,632
The driver

2313
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,728
JoJo's is allowing him to to make this without any any cops

2314
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:42,752
10 pushback

2315
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,800
But Joe does have a good point

2316
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:46,080
And that is that

2317
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:48,128
Even if we allow that there are at

2318
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:49,664
Ton of different influenza

2319
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,432
Is that our cause

2320
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:51,712
Climate change

2321
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:55,296
CO2 emission is one thing that humans are capable of

2322
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:57,856
Control a short the rest of the thing

2323
01:44:58,112 --> 01:45:00,160
Sunspots or whatever

2324
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:02,464
We can't control those that do it

2325
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:05,280
So it should be our

2326
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:06,048
Google

2327
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:11,680
To control the elements that could be destructive that are in our capacity could draw

2328
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:13,216
And then Alex say something

2329
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:13,984
Just batty

2330
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:15,264
Isn't

2331
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:16,288
CO2

2332
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,312
The one thing

2333
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:20,384
Human-created

2334
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:21,408
Global warm

2335
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:22,176
Common gases

2336
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:23,968
If we can put a

2337
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:24,736
Tap on that

2338
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:26,784
Wouldn't you agree

2339
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:28,064
Continue

2340
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:29,600
Stuff in the atmosphere

2341
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:30,880
And it continues

2342
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:32,672
Get higher and higher and higher levels

2343
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:34,976
Wouldn't make

2344
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,768
Studies show

2345
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,072
It's going to make deserts become green again

2346
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,120
Plants are going to absorb the carbon

2347
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:43,936
Look them up

2348
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:47,008
Find out

2349
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:49,056
I'm not argue

2350
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:50,336
But you are

2351
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:52,640
What's the tavern

2352
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:53,408
Nothing to say

2353
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:54,432
You should probably

2354
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:55,200
Not to say

2355
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:55,968
Look up

2356
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,784
Something.

2357
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,112
Do you have

2358
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:03,392
Did you read that may

2359
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,464
I actually know what

2360
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:09,792
What would the plant study showare in greenhouses

2361
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:11,328
They grow plants alive

2362
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,376
Carbon dioxide

2363
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:14,656
What a relief

2364
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:21,312
If we burn tons of CO2 and put it in the atmosphere will just end up with deserts ahead foliage are plants

2365
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:23,360
Sounds like win-win

2366
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:29,760
I admire Jose attempt to get Alex to take responsibility for his claims but if this doesn't end with Joe telling Alex that he's full of s***

2367
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:32,576
And then denouncing him in front of his audience

2368
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:35,648
Then all these moments were Alex's clearly full of s*** don't

2369
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:40,256
Mater like they don't mean anything unless they do apologize for having him on

2370
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:42,560
You recognize that you had been

2371
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:48,192
Trick by his Showmanship and he's a fun guy I bet he is I better yet I bet he is

2372
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:54,592
Especially if he wants you to think that he's fun especially if you're at a Halloween party and he's dressed like a Nazi allegedly

2373
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:00,480
True

2374
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:01,248
I just like

2375
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:05,344
If it if it is doesn't

2376
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:10,208
It happened he's a really talented guy and he's really nice and we had a

2377
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:13,792
Pretend friendship for 20 years or whatever but like

2378
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:15,584
He just came on my program and he

2379
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,632
Completely lied to you by audience

2380
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:19,424
Yeah by presumably care about

2381
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:23,520
He said that if you would burn CO2 deserts will have trees grow again them in

2382
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:26,336
Pig

2383
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:31,200
You know it is it is one of those things that makes you really think being a

2384
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:32,736
Con man is so easy

2385
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:37,600
Just because people will do everything possible to avoid admitting that they got Conte

2386
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:38,880
Caught being a con man

2387
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:40,416
Is probably good if you have

2388
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:41,696
Good marks

2389
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:48,352
Like if you like to go Rogue exactly like a guy with a hundred million dollars

2390
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:52,704
Podcast in the world

2391
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,776
Feeling like a guy with $5 month

2392
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,312
Certainly not fair enough

2393
01:47:57,568 --> 01:48:02,688
So anyway this is because we're having so much excess CO2

2394
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:03,968
Release of a sphere

2395
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:05,760
Lavender Global greeting

2396
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:09,088
Is this going to turn the everything wonderful

2397
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:11,136
Global Greening happening

2398
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:13,440
Countering us losing our Atmos

2399
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:14,976
This point

2400
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:17,536
The Earth has less atmosphere that did a million years

2401
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:21,376
Or something we discovered all this oil

2402
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:23,680
We are terraforming

2403
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:24,448
The planet

2404
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:25,728
Earlier healthier

2405
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:26,496
States

2406
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:27,776
Carbon

2407
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:29,568
Was under the ground and putting it back

2408
01:48:30,848 --> 01:48:33,152
But isn't the problem that along the way we're also

2409
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,712
The temperature of the planet and we are not

2410
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:36,480
Aligned

2411
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:37,248
With a higher 10

2412
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:41,600
Urologic a week or no

2413
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:42,368
T3

2414
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:44,416
The club of Roundtable with a limits to growth

2415
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:46,208
They had model Xanax

2416
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:47,488
Actuaries I have copies of

2417
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:49,792
Sinhala films free online

2418
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:51,584
Bubble slime

2419
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,120
Prediction virus released a lot

2420
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:53,888
Things down everything

2421
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:56,704
That was not what that movie was about

2422
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:57,984
Yosemite

2423
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:02,336
53 Leominster Girls Club of round plan they said we believe they'll be a global Ice Age

2424
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:03,872
My2020

2425
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:05,920
Because the last ice age ended about

2426
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:06,944
Couple thousand years ago in

2427
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:07,712
We're set for that

2428
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:09,248
We're going to tell the public

2429
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:12,320
Actually carbon-dioxide me a

2430
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:15,648
Solar radiation off the Earth

2431
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:18,208
Because we see volcanoes

2432
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,488
Pause this.

2433
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:20,512
Affected freezing

2434
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:22,304
So we believe our scientist believe

2435
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,584
The carbon dioxide to make

2436
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,864
Earth freeze

2437
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:25,888
My2020

2438
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:29,984
I'm sure we've got it have a global regime to take control of all the factories all the energy

2439
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:31,008
And put a tax

2440
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:32,544
Stands for Global government

2441
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:33,824
The name of stopping the Ice Age

2442
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:36,384
Then by B 1987a

2443
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:38,176
Heat up instead

2444
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:39,200
Play flip the

2445
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:41,504
Anybody you know

2446
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:42,528
Nope

2447
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:43,296
Anybody you

2448
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:44,832
Alex is lying

2449
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:50,720
Nobody's feel bad game and it's amazing for him to be such a dick as to call his own bulshit documentary Seminole

2450
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:57,376
What a what an a****** roadman it was about a rose

2451
01:49:57,632 --> 01:50:01,216
Limits to growth came out 1972 not in 1963

2452
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:02,752
The club of Rome didn't even exist

2453
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:04,032
Until 1968

2454
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:07,360
You can easily find a PDF of this document called limits

2455
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:12,736
It's the growth and if you do go ahead and look through it there's no mention of an ice age or the year 2024

2456
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:15,040
In the text the authors are very clear that they can

2457
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:18,368
Simply demonstrations that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is rising

2458
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:22,464
But it's unclear how much of that will be able to be sustained by the planet

2459
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:24,000
Repeat 281

2460
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:27,328
It's not known how much CO2 or thermal pollution

2461
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:30,912
Can be released without causing irreversible damage in the earth's climate

2462
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:35,776
How much radioactivity lead Mercury or pesticide can be absorbed by plants fish

2463
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:38,080
We're human beings before the vital processes

2464
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:39,360
Are severely interrupt

2465
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:40,896
Did cut 250 years later

2466
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:43,712
We know exactly how much it was a while back

2467
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:50,368
Part of the despatches on board to part of the reason why you should act even though we aren't certain what the limits are its

2468
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:51,648
At least spelled out in the text

2469
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:52,416
Quote

2470
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:57,280
This ignorance about the limits of Earth's ability to absorb pollutants should be reason enough for caution

2471
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:58,816
In the release of polluting

2472
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:02,144
The danger of reaching those limits is especially great

2473
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:06,752
Because there is typically a long delay between the release of a pollutant into the environment

2474
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:08,544
And the appearance of its negative effect

2475
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,312
John the

2476
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,872
Had spicy overly cautious

2477
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:14,944
In a certain sense though Alex did say something

2478
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:16,736
Incorrectly and he started it with

2479
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:20,576
What we're doing is returning the Earth back to a healthier time

2480
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:21,600
And

2481
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:25,952
When he said a million years that makes sense to me because that was before we were here

2482
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:29,536
Alex's 900,000

2483
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:31,584
We will when we're gone

2484
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,888
Be creating a much better healthier

2485
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:38,752
Well I mean after we've killed if you're taking some kind of a weird geologic

2486
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:41,056
Perspective and yes

2487
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:44,640
And it's not what I recovered After The Dinosaurs right will be

2488
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:46,176
It maybe we will

2489
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:50,528
In the introduction to this text limits to growth on page 23 they lay out there

2490
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:52,576
Conclusions the first of which is quote

2491
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:57,952
If the present growth Trends in the world population industrialization food production and resource depletion

2492
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:58,976
Continue unchanged

2493
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:03,584
The limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next 100 years

2494
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:07,424
That's the conclusion that they made based on their assumptions and estimation

2495
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:08,448
At the time

2496
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:09,984
In 1972

2497
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:13,056
They've gone back and Revisited this multiple times

2498
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:13,824
And some

2499
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:19,968
Updating and some reflection online about a little bit of that whatever

2500
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:21,760
Bye-bye

2501
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:22,528
30 years

2502
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:28,928
Alex's asserting that in this text they say that they are aware that an ice age is coming so they're going to pretend the carbon dioxide is

2503
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:31,232
Bad and causing the Ice Age which I guess

2504
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:33,024
Who's going to

2505
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:36,352
Lead to them being able to take control of the population

2506
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:42,752
Sick of all these is my plan is this playing the fio planaria hate to surprised none of that is in this book

2507
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:44,032
What's a real shock

2508
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:50,432
I have no idea of Alex's ever read limits to growth RVs just banking on the fact that the audience won't have but this s*** is Almeda

2509
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:51,968
How long is

2510
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:57,344
Longer than four pages for

2511
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,880
This is not read it. Certainly.

2512
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:04,512
What are the things that's interesting about this though is that this is a tax for 1972 and

2513
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:05,792
You know

2514
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:08,352
I think that you can go back and you can look at some of the stuff

2515
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:09,632
Absolutely say like

2516
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:12,704
Well they didn't know what we know now

2517
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,752
And Joe tries to bring this up

2518
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:16,544
It is

2519
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:18,592
Don't you

2520
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:20,640
Science facts

2521
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:21,920
Didn't have it

2522
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:24,480
So they're there model

2523
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:25,760
And what they predict

2524
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:27,808
C3

2525
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,344
Faulty compare the in

2526
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:31,136
They haven't

2527
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:32,416
She said 2.5 million

2528
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:33,184
Kobe dead

2529
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:35,744
But yeah

2530
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:37,024
But worldwide

2531
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,352
A worldwide tuberculosis

2532
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:43,168
Millionaire lifestyle

2533
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:46,496
Kobe killed

2534
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:47,520
Fart

2535
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:50,080
Is that true

2536
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:50,848
Come on

2537
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:55,456
Boss

2538
01:53:55,968 --> 01:54:01,600
You see here how Alex tries to Pivot away from uncertain territory into more familiar and comfortable Water by taking

2539
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:05,696
Joe's good point that old science didn't know what new science has discovered

2540
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:08,256
Hitting his dog complaints about toci and covid

2541
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:13,888
I'll explain goes out to make a sensational absurd claim back over it which will now distract conversation

2542
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:15,680
And he will have escaped without having

2543
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:19,776
Been held the claims that he made about the club of Rome

2544
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:23,360
To grow or how excessive CO2 emissions are saving the world

2545
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:24,896
Also again

2546
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:28,224
TBH did not kill 1.4 million people in the United

2547
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:29,248
Midstates in 29

2548
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:32,320
That is a comical number that Alex's used before

2549
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:34,368
And he just uses to minimize covid

2550
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:37,696
Joe has no idea what the real number is which is what Alex

2551
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:39,488
Is Batman when he just throws that out

2552
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,048
Alex is being allowed to scatter bulshit all over

2553
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:45,376
The place and these dudes are completely helpless to try to keep up

2554
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:47,936
Or transform it into something that's responsible

2555
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:51,264
2% to an audience who trust you it's not it's not good

2556
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:52,800
Yeah you would think it about

2557
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:55,616
And this is because I'm not very generous today

2558
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:57,152
You think about 45

2559
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:59,200
They would just start making fart

2560
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:01,504
But

2561
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:04,064
How how many hours are we into it now

2562
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:09,440
I think is really really difficult is

2563
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:10,464
Did like

2564
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:19,168
If Ari shaffir or like Tom Segura had came on Joe Rogan show they had some weird ideas about

2565
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:20,960
That's not good

2566
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:23,520
But it's going to be a comedian expressing a stand for

2567
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:29,152
Alex pretends to know like a ton of stuff so impressionable listeners will treat the things he says differently

2568
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:32,224
Name something a comedian might say while they're sitting around talking s***

2569
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:35,296
The potential for harm is significantly increased

2570
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:37,344
And this is a show where the host seems

2571
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,904
Unable or unwilling to do the work that's needed

2572
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:42,976
Protect this audience from the brand of misinformation Alex cell

2573
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:43,744
And the Harlot

2574
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:44,512
I can come from it

2575
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:48,352
He's treating it like it's just you know the same kind of steaks

2576
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:52,448
Is Ari or Shrine in there and it's not

2577
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:53,984
I mean he's unwilling to

2578
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:57,312
Hold himself accountable and protect himself from Alex's

2579
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:58,336
Narrative so

2580
01:55:58,592 --> 01:55:59,872
The hours of course he can

2581
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:04,992
Johnny was rationalizing it's not it's not the best

2582
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:07,552
Today we get our first

2583
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:09,344
Point where I want to talk a little bit about

2584
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:10,112
Tim Dillon

2585
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:14,720
Back Alex

2586
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:16,256
They're certainly

2587
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:18,560
Contributing to man-made

2588
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:20,096
Russo

2589
01:56:20,352 --> 01:56:21,120
What are you going to do

2590
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:22,144
What are we going to do

2591
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:23,680
Gradpoint

2592
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:28,800
Perhaps the most disappointing sentence I've ever heard

2593
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:34,944
What kind of Southpark a simpleton wearing apathy and defeatism is virtue bulshit is that

2594
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:41,600
I tried to be kind to Tim Dillon in the past because like I said I meant I think we have some mutual friends and I don't care too much about that

2595
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:45,184
Comedians who say things I disagree with even if they're Gaston Infowars

2596
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:46,208
Because Tim has been

2597
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:52,352
It's not really that interesting for me to get mad about something someone might have been joking about

2598
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:57,984
It's often hard to tell the difference between a racist and an edgy comedian who swings and misses so typically

2599
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:00,544
I tried to stay out of the criticizing comedians game

2600
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:04,896
We all know how sad Alex sounds when he yells about Bill Maher or Michelle wolf

2601
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:06,432
That is a joke

2602
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:07,712
The Tim is saying though and it's

2603
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:08,992
I just make me sad

2604
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:13,856
Is the idea supposed to be that no one has any ideas about what can be done to limit the temperature

2605
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:15,648
I mean

2606
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:17,696
To be aware that people have some suggestions

2607
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:22,304
A year ago he posted a comedy video on YouTube making fun of Greta thunberg

2608
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:25,120
A person whose only famous because he's trying to propose solution

2609
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:27,168
Yeah but what are we going to do

2610
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:32,032
I don't care and I'm sure Tim's a good guy in a talented stand-up but I don't buy it

2611
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:33,824
I don't buy this kind of edge

2612
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:37,152
Am I supposed to believe that Tim thinks that even if all the scientist

2613
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:40,736
Start making up climate change that there's nothing we should be doing

2614
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:42,528
It really just feels like an attempt

2615
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:43,296
Like

2616
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:46,112
It too hard of an attempt to be right-wing edgy

2617
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:49,952
I just don't buy it I just Rings Hollow to me

2618
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:50,720
Oh yeah

2619
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:53,280
We are contributing to climate change

2620
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:55,072
What are you going to do about it

2621
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:56,608
You know it bums me out

2622
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:57,632
Is

2623
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:58,912
No one

2624
01:57:59,168 --> 01:57:59,680
Funny

2625
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:04,544
Yeah that's really bugging me out

2626
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:06,848
Because the only reason you have Tim Dillon on there

2627
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:08,896
As as a third party

2628
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:10,432
Is 2

2629
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:11,456
Kumon come with

2630
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:15,552
The joke I think he likes Alex two more come with the Eddie Bravo swing

2631
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:21,952
That's what you got to have you got to have that f****** element that you got to have me screaming. I don't disagree

2632
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:25,536
No I just like he's just another differential a******

2633
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:27,840
Like a slightly less

2634
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:30,656
Pretending to know things out

2635
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:32,192
Oh yeah it is

2636
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:34,240
I think it's a

2637
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:40,128
Mistake that will probably linger you should never break the format

2638
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:42,944
And that is what if Alex is there so is Bravo yep

2639
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:47,552
Like you you found a winning combination that allows you to pretend

2640
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:53,952
We got Eddie Bravo here what are you going to take

2641
01:58:54,208 --> 01:59:00,352
You can't take any of this seriously funny Bravo stalking the kind of allowed you to dodge any kind of

2642
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:03,424
And he added an element to

2643
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:07,008
Some kind of unpredictability

2644
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:11,616
For this I just don't I don't think it's a good idea to have anybody Plus

2645
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:13,408
Alex plus Joe Rogan

2646
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:14,432
Unless it's

2647
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:15,456
Unless it's ready

2648
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:18,272
Unless it's somebody who can temper the b******* that's

2649
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:19,040
Flying low

2650
01:59:19,296 --> 01:59:21,856
It's a back-and-forth I mean conceivably

2651
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:26,208
Kobe fun for me to be the third person put again I would never do that and I

2652
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:27,232
No interest in it but

2653
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:29,792
Does understand the things that Alex

2654
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:33,120
Lying about what he's very helpful and it would create

2655
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:34,400
I mean

2656
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:35,424
Alex Wood

2657
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,704
Believe that

2658
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:38,752
You can't just have Tim Dillon

2659
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:41,312
As an as as a third participant

2660
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:43,872
It really the show suffers for it

2661
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:45,920
And quite frankly I think

2662
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:50,528
I don't think that anyone's going to enjoy this nearly as much as the other two

2663
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:53,344
It's not it's not as good it's not as interesting

2664
01:59:53,856 --> 01:59:59,744
And it's not funny and a large portion of it is Alex talking about how he wants Rogan to drink with him

2665
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,280
But it's sober October

2666
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:02,304
So Rogan

2667
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:07,936
Can't but Rogan says that he will drink on Election night cuz he's doing a livestream

2668
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:09,216
It turns out

2669
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:10,240
The announced on this

2670
02:00:10,496 --> 02:00:11,008
Episode

2671
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:16,384
That Rogan and Kyle kulinski are doing a team up stream of the election

2672
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:18,688
And Alex insinuates

2673
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:20,224
Himself as a cast on that

2674
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:22,272
And over and over again

2675
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:23,296
Alex cubis

2676
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:29,696
Being like I've about bully my way under your eye wear a drink together on the election night

2677
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:35,328
Just looking at it on it

2678
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:37,888
A personal level human level

2679
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:41,216
Meowth it really it was desperate it was needy

2680
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:45,824
It just it it's Unbecoming for a character who's supposed to be at strong

2681
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,872
An alpha is alligator

2682
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:49,408
For him to be so

2683
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:55,552
Type of s*** that a baby comic does to somebody who's like 6 years in there like

2684
02:00:55,808 --> 02:00:59,904
Hey man your you run that really good show and we're good friends and you like and it's like

2685
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:01,184
If you're a baby comic

2686
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:02,720
Everybody tries it 16

2687
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:09,632
That happens but if you're like a 10 years in guy doing this s*** or a in Alec 1826

2688
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:11,680
You're not doing

2689
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:13,984
Not so good we know though

2690
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:18,336
Like I said

2691
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:20,384
He comes off better than Alex

2692
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:22,432
Just because I mean how could you fly

2693
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:23,968
But

2694
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:30,880
I don't know I don't I don't think he says all that much that's all that interesting he just sounds like a guy who likes out

2695
02:01:31,392 --> 02:01:34,464
Yeah we watch too much Infowars isn't really all that critical

2696
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:37,536
But thanks adopting contrarian positions make

2697
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:42,144
Up for light iron

2698
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:43,168
Is like this is a purse

2699
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:43,936
Personality

2700
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:47,008
He's a guy who's wearing a free guylaine stroke

2701
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:53,408
Metaphorical and literal

2702
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:56,992
So in this next clip

2703
02:01:57,504 --> 02:02:00,320
You're really see like they're the two different

2704
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:05,696
Kind of realities that are happening simultaneously in this episode

2705
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:07,488
I'm sucking on a cigar

2706
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:13,120
Like it's a jelly donut I'm hoping I get the weed on the inside outside

2707
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:14,144
Piece of paper

2708
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:17,984
What does it say

2709
02:02:19,008 --> 02:02:22,080
4 to the end of humanity

2710
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:23,104
See

2711
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:24,896
Okay but it's a person who wrote the

2712
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:31,296
It's Adam Kirsch he's probably got a pistol in his mouth right now

2713
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:39,232
Do people not realize that saying that Alex has documents is a joke

2714
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:42,816
Like Tim is clearly making a joke when he says that they have documents

2715
02:02:43,072 --> 02:02:46,144
It is a bit at this point and the point of it is that Alex

2716
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:49,472
Doesn't have any documents and he's making all this s*** up

2717
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:54,080
The article titled looking forward to the end of humanity isn't about what Alex planes it is

2718
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:55,872
It's just an opinion piece attacks

2719
02:02:56,128 --> 02:03:01,248
Actually it's pretty skeptical about the possibilities that many theorists believe could come with a transhumanist future

2720
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:03,040
The headline Works rally

2721
02:03:03,552 --> 02:03:05,600
But because he lacks any depth any hopes

2722
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:06,624
You just blow people's minds

2723
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:08,416
Dixie doesn't go any

2724
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:09,184
Further than that

2725
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:15,584
The actual article is not about being eager for the end of humanity though it might be able to make it you might be able to make it

2726
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:16,608
Sounds like

2727
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:21,984
Alex says every responsibility to know what this article is about cuz he's brought it up a thousand times

2728
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:23,008
In the past

2729
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:24,800
He's got it because

2730
02:03:25,056 --> 02:03:27,616
Flat broke and doesn't have the time to read this entire op-ed

2731
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:29,152
He doesn't have the ability to

2732
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:31,200
To come in to be like that's not what that's about

2733
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:33,504
This is actually really skeptical about

2734
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:37,856
The widening gap between classes that could happen

2735
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:39,648
With the implementation of

2736
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:43,232
Of technological a supplementation

2737
02:03:43,744 --> 02:03:46,304
Flicka is a article uses as an example

2738
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:52,704
How you could buy yourself out of War if you got drafted in the early days of our country

2739
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:53,472
Skeptical

2740
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:56,288
It's not pro the end of humanity

2741
02:03:58,848 --> 02:04:01,152
Even just the whole presentation of it like

2742
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:03,200
Why are you acting like

2743
02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:04,224
It's not a joke

2744
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:05,504
That Alex has document

2745
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:06,272
You're making

2746
02:04:06,528 --> 02:04:07,040
That joke

2747
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:11,136
You're laughing at that joke because it's funny because he does.

2748
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:15,744
I think I think strategy

2749
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:16,512
Should have tried

2750
02:04:16,768 --> 02:04:17,792
Right

2751
02:04:18,048 --> 02:04:19,328
Sure your live streaming

2752
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:25,472
Or whatever Jamie's covid-19

2753
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:27,008
So here's what you do

2754
02:04:27,264 --> 02:04:33,408
All right after the show you just go in and edit in all the things that you wish Joe it said you haven't

2755
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:34,432
Voiceover later

2756
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:38,272
Edit it all in and then it looks like Joe is a f******

2757
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:40,576
Dynamite interviewer

2758
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:44,160
And Alex just saying random ass things in response to drop

2759
02:04:44,928 --> 02:04:46,976
Alex you've no idea what you're talking about.

2760
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:53,376
Talk to you

2761
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:58,496
And Alex has a sex club they argue a little bit about driverless cars

2762
02:04:58,752 --> 02:04:59,264
And I'm just

2763
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:00,032
But that display

2764
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:01,568
Lot of iroh

2765
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:05,664
Driverless cars don't know a wreck up ahead or what to do they have more Acts

2766
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:07,200
Steve Wozniak

2767
02:05:07,456 --> 02:05:09,504
Earlier the founder of founder of Apple

2768
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:12,064
The best AI

2769
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:13,088
Is it a million

2770
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:14,624
Close

2771
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:15,392
How good

2772
02:05:15,648 --> 02:05:17,184
Stop stop stop stop

2773
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:18,464
When they first

2774
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:20,000
Develop cars they said why

2775
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:24,608
Going to take a shower

2776
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:25,376
Power needs

2777
02:05:25,632 --> 02:05:26,144
Cars now

2778
02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:32,032
Is not even understand the people running the AR predatory anti-human they want to get rid of us

2779
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:35,360
He's working

2780
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:37,408
Who said Beware those

2781
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:38,944
The speak of a I got

2782
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:41,760
People are worried

2783
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:43,808
Did you want is more

2784
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:45,344
Don't give me one of the

2785
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:48,416
Keep that s*** away from me

2786
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:50,464
Trying to give everyone Boos

2787
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:53,536
Worried about the point where things start of like

2788
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:59,936
I mean I would say is it for me intellectually the point where everything broke apart beginning

2789
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:07,360
The part workout really dicey was the CO2

2790
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:09,664
We're in trouble

2791
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:13,248
Around here is kind of where you're in a place where it's like

2792
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:17,088
He's he's starting

2793
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:23,744
Yeah and I would say that driverless cars argument is trying to explain to a

2794
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:30,144
Alex what these conversations to people who have concerns about air and the reality that future a I won't be

2795
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:33,728
You know what we have now and

2796
02:06:34,496 --> 02:06:37,056
Alex just isn't there for that conversation

2797
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:38,592
Nope he has

2798
02:06:38,848 --> 02:06:39,360
Documents

2799
02:06:39,616 --> 02:06:42,688
And sources that he needs to bring up about how evil these folks are

2800
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:45,760
Look up calculator for great knowing as I do math now

2801
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:48,064
Lookout phone to write no one knows her numbers anymore

2802
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:49,600
All the statistics show

2803
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:50,624
The scientific knowledge

2804
02:06:52,416 --> 02:06:54,208
And that's why they wrote the big article

2805
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:54,976
The co-owner

2806
02:06:55,232 --> 02:06:55,744
Some micros

2807
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:57,280
You 2000

2808
02:06:57,536 --> 02:06:58,560
Bill Joy Road

2809
02:07:00,864 --> 02:07:01,632
The top billionaires

2810
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:03,168
And I made the decision

2811
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:05,216
Surround play video games

2812
02:07:10,848 --> 02:07:12,640
Okay pull up why the future doesn't need us

2813
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:16,224
But why why you think

2814
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:19,552
Can we reverse intitle question Hilbert called useless Peters

2815
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:21,600
I don't think damn you're doing great

2816
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:22,880
Improve what a person

2817
02:07:23,648 --> 02:07:26,464
But I think we're doing it falls off

2818
02:07:27,488 --> 02:07:28,768
You going to go down another rabbit hole

2819
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:29,536
Halibut

2820
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:32,608
This is the distraction tactics that Alex

2821
02:07:32,864 --> 02:07:34,400
Excuses because he can't he can't

2822
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:35,936
Stay on it

2823
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:40,288
To keep moving or else he'll get round out like he's a shark of Lies

2824
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:46,688
Leslie Prado truth on the shock of Lies this is the type of show

2825
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:49,248
4 years ago before we have done

2826
02:07:49,504 --> 02:07:50,784
Before we get started

2827
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:52,832
I could have been the third wheel on this

2828
02:07:54,368 --> 02:07:59,232
Instead of Tim Dillon maybe I would it would have been like me screaming and s*** but I wouldn't have the white

2829
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:02,048
Hot Furious that I have now

2830
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:04,864
Is a decent chance at 5 years ago if I'd seen this

2831
02:08:05,376 --> 02:08:06,400
Like knowing what I

2832
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:09,216
I knew about Alex 5 years ago

2833
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:13,312
But I could have got gotten some entertainment value out of it a little

2834
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:16,640
Totally but I will also say that probably would have been a little bit

2835
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:18,944
Depressed he does not come off

2836
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:19,712
Well

2837
02:08:19,968 --> 02:08:20,736
Especially towards the end

2838
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:24,320
And it's not it's not one of those like like

2839
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:25,344
Ways to learn

2840
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:26,112
Kind of

2841
02:08:26,368 --> 02:08:27,648
Sad

2842
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:28,672
Really sad

2843
02:08:29,696 --> 02:08:30,720
Like deeply sad

2844
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:35,072
I just don't even I don't I don't want to act like I'm teasing this or anything it's just

2845
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:36,608
Bummer it it ends

2846
02:08:36,864 --> 02:08:37,376
Like a boss

2847
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:39,424
Anyway that's all I want

2848
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:40,192
Alex's life

2849
02:08:40,448 --> 02:08:43,008
I believe

2850
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:44,288
That I've made the

2851
02:08:44,544 --> 02:08:45,568
Point a number of

2852
02:08:46,848 --> 02:08:47,872
Alex Jones

2853
02:08:48,128 --> 02:08:48,896
Pair for any

2854
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:50,432
Fire

2855
02:08:50,688 --> 02:08:53,760
You wakes up at 6 every morning read

2856
02:08:54,016 --> 02:08:55,296
Hours of Articles until

2857
02:08:55,552 --> 02:09:01,696
I should say about that last time

2858
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:04,000
Article for Bill Joy did not say anything

2859
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:06,816
Any of the houses making it up completely

2860
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:07,584
Admiral

2861
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:10,912
There's a small passage inside that article where Bill Joyce quotient

2862
02:09:11,168 --> 02:09:13,216
The Unabomber and that's what Alex is talking about

2863
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:17,568
I said Alex doesn't prepare and I need to

2864
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:18,336
Correct the record

2865
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:21,664
Call me David Brock's cuz I'm correct for the wreck

2866
02:09:22,688 --> 02:09:23,456
We did not

2867
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:25,248
Crocodile

2868
02:09:26,528 --> 02:09:27,552
Talk about a lot of things

2869
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:31,136
This what I wrote last night

2870
02:09:31,392 --> 02:09:32,160
For you I want

To take it down and not a silicon called

02:09:36,512 --> 02:09:37,024
No I wrote

2873
02:09:40,608 --> 02:09:41,888
Define the enemy

2874
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:44,448
But I'm not

2875
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:46,752
Really a liberal or conservative

2876
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:48,800
F*** off please listen to me and hear me out

2877
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:49,568
Let's stop right

2878
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:53,664
Let's stop right there that stop right there

2879
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:55,456
Please announce up front

2880
02:09:55,712 --> 02:09:57,504
I am not liberal or conservative

2881
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:02,112
Please listen to me I'm Rodeo Jesus this is when I turn to my like

2882
02:10:02,624 --> 02:10:03,392
It stopped recording

2883
02:10:03,648 --> 02:10:04,416
Stop recording

2884
02:10:04,928 --> 02:10:05,440
You don't get to

2885
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:13,632
Daroga does a lot of work trying to help Alex

2886
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:16,448
Push that idea that he's not left or right

2887
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:18,240
You get right

2888
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:22,080
Called a neoconservatives you get called all right

2889
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:22,848
You get called a

2890
02:10:23,104 --> 02:10:24,128
A far-right person

2891
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:25,664
When I first met you

2892
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:27,200
You were protesting

2893
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:28,480
George W

2894
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:29,248
You bush

2895
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:30,784
And you were saying

2896
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:32,064
That what he was doing

2897
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:33,600
And what he was trying to usher in

2898
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:36,928
But what was it was essentially going to be the downfall West

2899
02:10:38,976 --> 02:10:40,256
Yes I remember that

2900
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:41,536
So when people

2901
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:42,304
Jose

2902
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:43,328
Alex Jones

2903
02:10:43,584 --> 02:10:44,352
Far-right Dynamite

2904
02:10:45,376 --> 02:10:45,888
Complicated

2905
02:10:46,912 --> 02:10:47,936
He's really again

2906
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:48,704
Corruption

2907
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:49,728
More than he's against

2908
02:10:50,752 --> 02:10:52,288
The party kerbals hated corruption

2909
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:53,824
The right

2910
02:10:54,336 --> 02:10:54,848
Was less

2911
02:10:55,104 --> 02:10:55,616
WhatsApp to send

2912
02:10:56,384 --> 02:10:56,896
Add more apps

2913
02:10:58,176 --> 02:10:59,456
Exactly

2914
02:11:03,808 --> 02:11:04,832
Election Audubon

2915
02:11:09,952 --> 02:11:10,720
What's good in the Bohemian

2916
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:13,024
What

2917
02:11:16,608 --> 02:11:18,912
Alright love you

2918
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:21,216
You know what

2919
02:11:21,472 --> 02:11:24,800
George W bush doesn't care about black people and now he supports Trump

2920
02:11:25,056 --> 02:11:26,336
B.j.

2921
02:11:26,592 --> 02:11:30,432
Dad threw and I think it's important to always recognize

2922
02:11:30,688 --> 02:11:32,224
What you're doing

2923
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:35,040
Can be altered by why you're doing

2924
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:37,856
So if you are protesting books

2925
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:42,464
Because you're further right than bush

2926
02:11:42,976 --> 02:11:47,328
Protesting Obama it is unsurprising

2927
02:11:47,584 --> 02:11:53,728
If you are extreme right-wing of course

2928
02:11:53,984 --> 02:11:57,056
Someone like George W bush isn't going to be good for your business

2929
02:11:57,568 --> 02:12:00,128
Or at least complaining about him will be good for your business

2930
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:05,504
I think needs to do a little bit of exploration about that

2931
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:07,552
Consider why does Alex

2932
02:12:07,808 --> 02:12:09,088
Not like or like

2933
02:12:09,344 --> 02:12:10,368
The people that you does

2934
02:12:10,624 --> 02:12:15,488
You'll find a greater consistency there then oh he just hates corruption

2935
02:12:15,744 --> 02:12:16,512
Do you know what

2936
02:12:16,768 --> 02:12:17,536
Crazy though

2937
02:12:17,792 --> 02:12:19,584
What I think is the wildest part of

2938
02:12:20,096 --> 02:12:20,608
Is

2939
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:23,168
That all of this stuff he's saying on here

2940
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:24,704
You could have planned

2941
02:12:25,472 --> 02:12:27,520
You could have seen him saying this s***

2942
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:29,568
If you would listen to his show for the past week and a

2943
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:31,104
To the point where

2944
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:32,640
You could literally have

2945
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:33,920
Listen to a show and been like

2946
02:12:34,176 --> 02:12:35,200
I'm just going to grab a couple

2947
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:36,224
Eclipse it random

2948
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:40,576
And whenever I whenever Alex says something you just be like

2949
02:12:40,832 --> 02:12:46,976
Oh that's cool I get really kind of clip from your show if you sing deduct f****** opposite you moron

2950
02:12:47,232 --> 02:12:52,608
What kind of s*** is better for you if you want it

2951
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:59,008
Exactly the same like talking about the volcanoes and that's because I think

2952
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:00,800
He recorded this

2953
02:13:01,568 --> 02:13:02,080
Before

2954
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:09,504
Almost one hundred percent guarantee it's so he might have done these on the same day that he did the volcano

2955
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:15,904
Getting the same reps

2956
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:17,952
Quit because that guy did more things

2957
02:13:18,208 --> 02:13:18,720
Cool

2958
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:20,768
First I've heard about this

2959
02:13:25,376 --> 02:13:31,520
Investigate

2960
02:13:32,544 --> 02:13:33,312
Patricia

2961
02:13:33,568 --> 02:13:35,104
Which was the CIA was caught

2962
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:37,408
Trafficking that you know the fighters are called

2963
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:38,688
Caught trafficking children

2964
02:13:38,944 --> 02:13:39,712
And the CIA

2965
02:13:39,968 --> 02:13:40,480
Squasht

2966
02:13:40,736 --> 02:13:41,504
The Florida

2967
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:45,856
Oci facility

2968
02:13:46,112 --> 02:13:46,624
With a snuff

2969
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:49,952
Alex machine so he told me about all this

2970
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:50,720
Crazy

2971
02:13:52,256 --> 02:13:53,280
You told us about it

2972
02:13:53,536 --> 02:13:54,048
And we actually

2973
02:13:54,816 --> 02:13:55,584
One of those stories

2974
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:56,608
And I was correct

2975
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:57,632
What

2976
02:13:58,144 --> 02:14:04,288
So we went we went into the finder situation and past episode

2977
02:14:04,544 --> 02:14:07,104
Children that were found with two guys

2978
02:14:07,616 --> 02:14:09,408
Anna in a van in Florida

2979
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:14,272
And spice at the same either Alex or Kim could prove any of this stuff that they're talking about

2980
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:20,928
First things first Defenders investigation did not begin until 1987 by which point Gunderson was retired from the FBI

2981
02:14:21,184 --> 02:14:23,232
It was ankle deep in the McMartin

2982
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:27,584
Tunnel hysteria Scandal as Tim Dillon put in

2983
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:31,424
On Ted Gunderson website you can find the 79-page report.

2984
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:34,240
We filed on the finders case which is a chaotic mess

2985
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:35,776
Another really proves that

2986
02:14:36,544 --> 02:14:42,432
The most interesting part of the report is part about murder hornets and know it's a report that was filed

2987
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:47,808
Supposedly by Ramon Martinez who was a US Customs agent

2988
02:14:48,064 --> 02:14:50,368
For a rate of a warehouse in d.c.

2989
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:51,392
Set an informant

2990
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:54,208
It claimed was connected with a satanic cult called the

2991
02:14:54,464 --> 02:14:54,976
The Finders

2992
02:14:55,488 --> 02:14:58,816
Martinez right have seen proof of child exploitation and it almost

2993
02:14:59,072 --> 02:15:00,864
Astonishing level of criminals

2994
02:15:01,120 --> 02:15:01,632
Desiccation

2995
02:15:02,144 --> 02:15:04,960
What makes this report interesting is that it doesn't

2996
02:15:05,216 --> 02:15:05,728
Appear to be fake

2997
02:15:05,984 --> 02:15:08,544
Sent its referenced in the FBI Finders

2998
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,336
Files that were released recently

2999
02:15:10,848 --> 02:15:13,664
However if you can sell the files the FBI released

3000
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:15,456
There is reference to follow up

3001
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:20,064
On the claims from Martinez's report that's not good for Martin how there was no evidence

3002
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:23,904
Anything like what he describes that anyone else

3003
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:24,672
Confirm

3004
02:15:24,928 --> 02:15:29,792
In fact the FBI v files include a report of a 1994 interview with the Washington

3005
02:15:30,048 --> 02:15:33,376
Metro field office agent who was present at the rated question

3006
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:35,168
And it doesn't corroborate anything

3007
02:15:35,936 --> 02:15:41,824
Name redacted advised that during his review of both material from the computers and documents

3008
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:44,896
Revealed nothing relating to any criminal activity

3009
02:15:45,664 --> 02:15:51,808
Further there's be logging of a 1993 interview with a representative of the Arlington Virginia National Center

3010
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:52,832
Exploited

3011
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:53,856
10 missing children

3012
02:15:54,112 --> 02:15:58,208
Who was present for the raid haven't formally been a detective with the Metro Police

3013
02:15:58,720 --> 02:15:59,232
Quote

3014
02:15:59,488 --> 02:16:02,304
He did not see any evidence of criminal activity

3015
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:09,216
Because of the anomaly of this report for Martinez in other unsubstantiated gossip lingering conspiracy that the CIA

3016
02:16:09,472 --> 02:16:10,496
Hey was running the Finders

3017
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:13,568
But again this is never been demonstrated or proven at all

3018
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:20,224
Weirdly the FBI V includes a bunch of references to investigations into whether or not there was a connection between

3019
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:21,504
The fighters at the CIA

3020
02:16:22,016 --> 02:16:24,064
It feels like if the CIA were running this group

3021
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:27,904
The clandestine reasons they probably wouldn't cooperate with an FBI investigation

3022
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:31,232
Into the cover-up They carried out surrounding it but maybe I'm a

3023
02:16:31,488 --> 02:16:32,000
Sheeple

3024
02:16:32,768 --> 02:16:33,536
I don't know

3025
02:16:33,792 --> 02:16:34,304
It's it's

3026
02:16:34,816 --> 02:16:38,400
It sucks the truth dies in obscurity and is lost but

3027
02:16:38,656 --> 02:16:40,448
Bulshit just lives forever

3028
02:16:40,704 --> 02:16:46,848
Because it's more interesting and usually people respond to shiny things

3029
02:16:47,104 --> 02:16:48,640
Reagan also ignored a message

3030
02:16:48,896 --> 02:16:51,200
2 pandemic and killed thousands upon thousands of

3031
02:16:51,456 --> 02:16:57,600
Here's a list of the claims that are being made by Tim and Alex that they absolutely could not prove Beyond saying something like that

3032
02:16:58,368 --> 02:16:59,648
1 the finders work

3033
02:16:59,904 --> 02:17:00,672
Trafficking killed

3034
02:17:00,928 --> 02:17:01,696
They can't prove that

3035
02:17:02,208 --> 02:17:04,768
To the CIA squash the Florida investigations group

3036
02:17:05,024 --> 02:17:05,536
They can't prove that

3037
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:08,608
Three Ted Gunderson got the DC Warehouse rated

3038
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:11,424
Four said raid found a CIA facility

3039
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:12,192
Please prove

3040
02:17:12,704 --> 02:17:15,264
Five the rating cover uncovered snuff film

3041
02:17:15,776 --> 02:17:16,288
Shepherd

3042
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:20,896
There are at least five major claims these dudes are throwing out

3043
02:17:21,152 --> 02:17:22,944
Miss clip that they would never be able to

3044
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:23,968
Come close to proving

3045
02:17:24,224 --> 02:17:26,528
And at the end cure Joe signing off on this s***

3046
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:32,160
This is irresponsible coverage and honestly I hope to she is proud of what they're sponsoring

3047
02:17:32,416 --> 02:17:33,184
Yazoo doing great

3048
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:36,768
Water up Alex Jones's ass

3049
02:17:37,024 --> 02:17:40,864
So I got really bored for a stretch here and maybe that's just because like

3050
02:17:41,376 --> 02:17:42,656
Is it exhausting to listen

3051
02:17:42,912 --> 02:17:47,520
I'm too fast pace Alex's all over the place

3052
02:17:47,776 --> 02:17:49,568
Trying to reel him in

3053
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:50,336
It's it's

3054
02:17:50,592 --> 02:17:53,920
It's a mess because they're talking about Bohemian Grove and skull in Bones

3055
02:17:54,176 --> 02:17:55,200
And I just kind of was like

3056
02:17:56,992 --> 02:17:59,552
Pass

3057
02:18:00,576 --> 02:18:03,136
Alex

3058
02:18:03,392 --> 02:18:05,440
We can actually

3059
02:18:06,464 --> 02:18:06,976
Descendants

3060
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:09,280
Sue Skull and Bones over geronimo's bone

3061
02:18:10,048 --> 02:18:12,352
George H bush

3062
02:18:12,608 --> 02:18:13,888
Grandfather Rob Geronimo

3063
02:18:14,144 --> 02:18:14,656
Grave member

3064
02:18:15,936 --> 02:18:16,448
Members of

3065
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:17,472
Secret society

3066
02:18:17,728 --> 02:18:19,008
Leslie steal valuable thing

3067
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:20,032
And put them in

3068
02:18:20,288 --> 02:18:20,800
Entomb

3069
02:18:21,056 --> 02:18:23,616
Great-grandson says Geronimo should be

3070
02:18:23,872 --> 02:18:24,640
Buried

3071
02:18:25,152 --> 02:18:26,176
Accordance with tradition

3072
02:18:26,432 --> 02:18:27,200
Federal law

3073
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:28,480
Protects Native American

3074
02:18:28,736 --> 02:18:29,248
Kids rights to their

3075
02:18:29,504 --> 02:18:30,016
Your family member

3076
02:18:34,624 --> 02:18:39,488
That brought up that bush stole geronimo's skull

3077
02:18:39,744 --> 02:18:44,096
And then they pulled up this news article that says that geronimo's great-grandson

3078
02:18:44,608 --> 02:18:45,888
Is pursuing

3079
02:18:50,496 --> 02:18:53,056
This clip pretty neatly shows are you won't learn anything

3080
02:18:53,312 --> 02:18:53,824
Sing from the show

3081
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:58,688
If you listen to this you'll think the Tim just claimed the bush stole Geronimo skull in that road

3082
02:18:58,944 --> 02:18:59,712
Pull up an article

3083
02:18:59,968 --> 02:19:00,480
Confirms it

3084
02:19:00,736 --> 02:19:02,528
In reality both proven nothing

3085
02:19:03,296 --> 02:19:06,368
This case with geronimo's great-grandson file to some 2009

3086
02:19:06,624 --> 02:19:09,184
And in August 2010 judge Richard Roberts

3087
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:10,976
Drop the case we just missed it

3088
02:19:11,232 --> 02:19:13,024
The reason is actually kind of interesting

3089
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:15,584
But you never know if you just listen to these dudes

3090
02:19:16,864 --> 02:19:21,472
The issue was the geronimos officially buried in a grave at Fort Sill which is on us

3091
02:19:21,728 --> 02:19:22,240
Property

3092
02:19:22,496 --> 02:19:26,080
In order to dig up bodies on federal property you need to get the permission of the government

3093
02:19:26,336 --> 02:19:31,456
And the plan of this suit was to sue the US government President Obama and the secretaries of

3094
02:19:31,712 --> 02:19:32,480
Defense of the army

3095
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:35,808
To gain permission to dig up geronimo and bury him quote

3096
02:19:36,064 --> 02:19:39,136
Near his birthplace at the head of the Gila River in New Mexico

3097
02:19:39,904 --> 02:19:41,952
However in order for a lawsuit be filed

3098
02:19:42,208 --> 02:19:48,352
Against the US government first a judge has to decide whether or not the case justify suspending the government sovereign immunity

3099
02:19:48,864 --> 02:19:51,424
Judge Roberts found that this case did.

3100
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:52,704
Have established

3101
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:54,240
The caused wave this immunity

3102
02:19:54,496 --> 02:19:55,264
The case was dismissed

3103
02:19:56,032 --> 02:19:59,616
The plan was to transport the remains to The Gila River and in the process

3104
02:19:59,872 --> 02:20:02,176
Determine if as the legend has it

3105
02:20:02,432 --> 02:20:03,200
Geronimo's skull

3106
02:20:03,456 --> 02:20:04,224
Had been stolen

3107
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:07,296
The great-grandsons lawyer said later that quote

3108
02:20:07,552 --> 02:20:09,600
He will eventually reopened his cases against

3109
02:20:09,856 --> 02:20:14,464
Galen Skull and Bones if need be but not until after the Fort Sill remains are exhume

3110
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:18,816
They don't know what they have caused the Gaylord skull and bones

3111
02:20:19,328 --> 02:20:22,400
Until the bodies been exhumed and then they can see if there's a skull there

3112
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:26,240
At that point I guess they have to build a case that it was more than just a ribbon Legend

3113
02:20:26,496 --> 02:20:27,776
Hearsay that would hold up in court

3114
02:20:28,032 --> 02:20:28,800
Remembering go ahead and

3115
02:20:29,056 --> 02:20:29,824
Successfully sued

3116
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:30,592
I guess

3117
02:20:31,104 --> 02:20:36,480
Personally I think I should let the family dig up the remains

3118
02:20:37,504 --> 02:20:41,344
Because colonial-style your grandfather's bones doesn't mean that you have rights

3119
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:44,416
To sue the government I'm not saying that that's a right decision

3120
02:20:44,672 --> 02:20:50,816
Personally but I'm just saying that is what they decide

3121
02:20:51,072 --> 02:20:56,448
The bottom line is that there's much more to this story and it's interesting to see how the world war

3122
02:20:57,216 --> 02:21:00,544
This is not a soup primarily targeting skull and bones or Yale or bush

3123
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:03,360
It's about getting geronimo's remains from Fort Sill

3124
02:21:03,616 --> 02:21:05,920
And if the spell is gone then Crossing that bridge at that point

3125
02:21:06,432 --> 02:21:08,992
If you just listen to people like Alex or Timber Joe

3126
02:21:09,248 --> 02:21:13,600
You'll get a more fun kind of wacky version of the story that's really exciting but ultimately

3127
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:17,184
They have no idea if anything they're saying is true or real

3128
02:21:17,696 --> 02:21:23,840
You get the impression that you're learning something but you're actually just listening to f***** up people ramble about something they read in a Blog

3129
02:21:24,096 --> 02:21:24,864
Horse Kim

3130
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:27,680
Skimmed a better way

3131
02:21:27,936 --> 02:21:28,448
Man

3132
02:21:28,704 --> 02:21:29,472
So f***** up

3133
02:21:29,728 --> 02:21:33,312
It's not just keeping it fun keeping his bone

3134
02:21:33,824 --> 02:21:34,848
Why can't we just get

3135
02:21:35,616 --> 02:21:39,200
Like what the f*** are you talking about

3136
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:45,600
You don't care you don't have to respond to people

3137
02:21:46,624 --> 02:21:48,416
Yeah I spent a while trying to

3138
02:21:48,672 --> 02:21:51,488
To figure out why the government didn't just say

3139
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:56,096
Cool really get to the bottom of it and I was running

3140
02:21:56,608 --> 02:22:02,752
Low on time is like I am very curious about that but I can't figure this out

3141
02:22:04,032 --> 02:22:10,176
You make an interesting point and you could speculate

3142
02:22:10,432 --> 02:22:11,712
Late about that

3143
02:22:11,968 --> 02:22:14,016
Couldn't prove it

3144
02:22:14,272 --> 02:22:17,088
So if you use that as evidence that they're protecting

3145
02:22:17,344 --> 02:22:21,952
George W George h.w. Bush or Prescott

3146
02:22:22,464 --> 02:22:23,488
You're just as faulty

3147
02:22:24,768 --> 02:22:30,400
What's weird at buddy reminds me so much of like so many times if you go to a museum you see something like

3148
02:22:30,656 --> 02:22:31,168
This was

3149
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:34,240
Taken by this Explorer in your life

3150
02:22:34,752 --> 02:22:35,264
No

3151
02:22:35,776 --> 02:22:36,544
He stole that

3152
02:22:37,056 --> 02:22:37,824
He stole it

3153
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:39,104
Why are we keeping

3154
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:41,408
B here

3155
02:22:41,664 --> 02:22:47,808
Indiana Jones Museum so it's okay that we stole it and now we get to keep it and show it to all the

3156
02:22:48,064 --> 02:22:48,832
The people and you don't get any

3157
02:22:49,088 --> 02:22:49,600
Beforeitsnews

3158
02:22:49,856 --> 02:22:52,416
Not an ideal way to operate it

3159
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:57,280
A little bit about Epstein and Bill Clinton being all guilty

3160
02:22:58,304 --> 02:22:58,816
And

3161
02:22:59,584 --> 02:23:00,096
Tim

3162
02:23:00,352 --> 02:23:03,168
Describe it asks like a do you actually think the Trump

3163
02:23:03,424 --> 02:23:04,960
Cleaning all this Shore

3164
02:23:05,472 --> 02:23:07,264
Do you think Trump's cleaning everything

3165
02:23:07,776 --> 02:23:10,848
In Essex I mean

3166
02:23:11,104 --> 02:23:13,920
I'll give you

3167
02:23:14,432 --> 02:23:19,296
Here we go. My only superpower is that I really try to give you accurate take this mean I'm always right

3168
02:23:19,552 --> 02:23:21,856
Rabbit roll

3169
02:23:22,112 --> 02:23:23,648
Trump doesn't like Lobby

3170
02:23:23,904 --> 02:23:24,672
Is he fired a mollusk

3171
02:23:24,928 --> 02:23:25,440
Make the best decision

3172
02:23:25,696 --> 02:23:26,976
For everybody in the pragmatic

3173
02:23:27,232 --> 02:23:27,744
Pre-market

3174
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:28,512
Don't have one side

3175
02:23:28,768 --> 02:23:29,536
Trade the old butt

3176
02:23:30,048 --> 02:23:31,840
His Blindside was by him not letting lobbies

3177
02:23:32,096 --> 02:23:33,120
Everyone around him

3178
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:41,056
What do you what does that have to do with Trump and Epstein

3179
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:44,128
Anyway I hope I hope that's not

3180
02:23:44,384 --> 02:23:45,664
I don't want to talk about him and UPS

3181
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:53,600
Alex responded to Tim quested they're laughing at

3182
02:23:54,112 --> 02:23:55,648
They're they're laughing at

3183
02:23:55,904 --> 02:24:02,048
Performance he's not going to tell us anything that's why they're laughing if you want the skinny

3184
02:24:02,304 --> 02:24:04,608
Neon Trump They're laughing because like

3185
02:24:04,864 --> 02:24:06,912
Right before he doesn't tell again

3186
02:24:07,424 --> 02:24:08,192
I got a right

3187
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:09,728
Anyway

3188
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:13,312
This is the first point where I really got the

3189
02:24:13,568 --> 02:24:14,080
Besides

3190
02:24:14,336 --> 02:24:15,872
The Joe is trying to explain

3191
02:24:16,128 --> 02:24:16,896
2 hours

3192
02:24:17,408 --> 02:24:18,176
But Alex is annoying

3193
02:24:18,944 --> 02:24:20,736
But you said I'm hard to

3194
02:24:20,992 --> 02:24:22,272
Did Louisville because your taco

3195
02:24:23,296 --> 02:24:24,320
When their talk and you don't let him get

3196
02:24:26,624 --> 02:24:27,136
Don't let people

3197
02:24:27,392 --> 02:24:28,416
To get a full thawed out

3198
02:24:28,672 --> 02:24:29,696
Dura Nintendo

3199
02:24:30,208 --> 02:24:32,768
When he's

3200
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:34,304
What I'm saying is he's talking

3201
02:24:35,072 --> 02:24:35,584
You jump in

3202
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:37,376
And the problem is I know you have something

3203
02:24:37,632 --> 02:24:38,144
Things to say but

3204
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:39,168
Then you f*** with

3205
02:24:39,424 --> 02:24:42,752
With the thing that's coming out the other person

3206
02:24:45,824 --> 02:24:46,336
They don't they

3207
02:24:46,592 --> 02:24:47,104
Do not look

3208
02:24:47,616 --> 02:24:48,128
Correctly

3209
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:50,176
Because the way they're looking at it

3210
02:24:50,432 --> 02:24:50,944
I think they're doing a good

3211
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:51,968
Good thing they're going to Usher

3212
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:53,760
Utopian

3213
02:24:54,784 --> 02:24:55,296
World of

3214
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:56,832
People always saying

3215
02:24:57,344 --> 02:24:57,856
They agree with

3216
02:24:58,368 --> 02:24:59,136
The problem with that is

3217
02:24:59,648 --> 02:25:00,416
You don't find out who

3218
02:25:00,672 --> 02:25:01,952
Who's right must get everybody talk

3219
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:06,048
You can have an Echo chain

3220
02:25:07,072 --> 02:25:07,584
It's dangerous

3221
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:10,144
Man it is hard to listen to this at Point

3222
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:11,168
It's like this one

3223
02:25:11,424 --> 02:25:17,568
Like it pretty clear that Joe is fairly annoyed probably because he's never had to deal with Showtime Alex Wild

3224
02:25:17,824 --> 02:25:18,848
He himself had to be sober

3225
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:20,384
Which must be the worst

3226
02:25:21,408 --> 02:25:27,552
I appreciate where Joe's going with this thought trying to find a motive for people wanting folks like Alex off social media that isn't there

3227
02:25:27,808 --> 02:25:29,088
They're demons and they want tyranny

3228
02:25:29,856 --> 02:25:31,392
But I also think the Jose wrong

3229
02:25:31,904 --> 02:25:33,696
I don't think that people want folks

3230
02:25:33,952 --> 02:25:37,536
Like Alex off social media sites because they want everyone to say the right same

3231
02:25:38,304 --> 02:25:44,448
I think they want him off because he can't control himself and he represents a danger to people so deciding that his behavior is not welcome on

3232
02:25:44,704 --> 02:25:45,216
Platform

3233
02:25:45,728 --> 02:25:48,800
Is actually an active customer service for your other users

3234
02:25:49,568 --> 02:25:51,616
I've never heard of anyone getting kicked off Twitter Forest

3235
02:25:51,872 --> 02:25:54,176
Suggesting a conservative tax plan or Express

3236
02:25:54,432 --> 02:25:56,480
Unconventional views in terms of foreign policy

3237
02:25:57,248 --> 02:25:59,296
In the case of the people that they try to rally around

3238
02:25:59,808 --> 02:26:01,088
They weren't punished for ideas

3239
02:26:01,344 --> 02:26:02,112
Pittsburgh Behavior

3240
02:26:02,368 --> 02:26:03,904
It's not welcome in various Blackfoot

3241
02:26:04,928 --> 02:26:09,792
Social media kicking people like that out is not saying that they want everyone to say all the same right things

3242
02:26:10,048 --> 02:26:13,632
It's saying that there are certain rules that people have to follow if they want to be treated like an adult

3243
02:26:14,144 --> 02:26:14,912
And if you refuse

3244
02:26:15,168 --> 02:26:15,680
To follow them

3245
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:16,960
You can't be kicked out

3246
02:26:17,472 --> 02:26:20,032
In this sense Joe's argument is actually a straw man

3247
02:26:20,288 --> 02:26:23,360
But he's coming from a more open-minded less malicious place

3248
02:26:23,616 --> 02:26:25,152
Certain kind of appreciate that

3249
02:26:25,664 --> 02:26:26,176
I would just

3250
02:26:26,432 --> 02:26:32,576
Again respond to it disorder Thing by introducing a conversation about what sorts of behavior he would be okay with people getting

3251
02:26:32,832 --> 02:26:34,112
Kick-off a platform for

3252
02:26:34,368 --> 02:26:35,904
And then see where the conversation goes

3253
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:37,184
From there

3254
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:38,208
Is it people going like

3255
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:42,304
Oh you're going to kick these raccoons out just cuz they have rabies

3256
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:45,888
That's what you're going to do we're censoring raccoons for having a disease now

3257
02:26:46,144 --> 02:26:50,496
Now you just you guys are evil people

3258
02:26:50,752 --> 02:26:53,568
Wander around free biking people left and right

3259
02:26:53,824 --> 02:26:54,848
You're terrible sense

3260
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:56,128
Yeah

3261
02:26:56,384 --> 02:27:02,528
You guys are think you're so great now I can't stab somebody with the samurai sword it's not a knife it's a sword

3262
02:27:02,784 --> 02:27:03,552
Haha

3263
02:27:03,808 --> 02:27:04,320
Different

3264
02:27:04,576 --> 02:27:07,392
So it is next cool if we get

3265
02:27:07,648 --> 02:27:08,416
Another

3266
02:27:09,184 --> 02:27:10,720
F****** Gundersen moments cheese

3267
02:27:10,976 --> 02:27:17,120
And it I didn't take the bait fully on this one because I just I was too tired I'd already done to Gundersen

3268
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:20,192
But I do think of something is brought up

3269
02:27:20,448 --> 02:27:22,496
Here that I think is worthwhile to discuss

3270
02:27:23,264 --> 02:27:25,312
This is in relation to the Franklin

3271
02:27:25,568 --> 02:27:28,896
Scandal was

3272
02:27:29,152 --> 02:27:29,920
Involved

3273
02:27:30,176 --> 02:27:31,968
With that whole affair

3274
02:27:32,224 --> 02:27:34,272
Like blowing a whistle

3275
02:27:34,528 --> 02:27:36,576
And that one of his associates

3276
02:27:36,832 --> 02:27:37,344
Pickswise

3277
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:38,368
William Colby

3278
02:27:38,624 --> 02:27:39,136
The former

3279
02:27:39,392 --> 02:27:41,184
Head of the CIA who died

3280
02:27:41,952 --> 02:27:43,488
And

3281
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:45,024
This is

3282
02:27:45,536 --> 02:27:47,072
So illustrative

3283
02:27:47,328 --> 02:27:51,680
Of conspiracy thinking I think it's really important to look at things like this

3284
02:27:52,448 --> 02:27:54,752
William Colby what do in Colby and William Colby baseball

3285
02:27:55,008 --> 02:27:55,776
Blizzard

3286
02:27:56,032 --> 02:27:56,800
You're going to force

3287
02:27:57,056 --> 02:27:59,360
You're going up against forces that are way too powerful

3288
02:27:59,616 --> 02:28:01,664
You don't even know what you're you're you're knocking on here

3289
02:28:03,968 --> 02:28:04,736
To f*** it you know what

3290
02:28:04,992 --> 02:28:06,272
We should stop doing

3291
02:28:06,784 --> 02:28:07,808
Let's if we're going to fight this

3292
02:28:08,832 --> 02:28:10,624
And then a little while later William Colby

3293
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:12,672
Who's in great health

3294
02:28:13,184 --> 02:28:15,744
Katja has accident in his canoe was found dead

3295
02:28:17,536 --> 02:28:20,864
In a river right by his house with his dinner still on the table so it's like nobody

3296
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:22,400
Nobody gets up in the middle of the day

3297
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:24,704
So this is been a,

3298
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:25,728
Nobody

3299
02:28:25,984 --> 02:28:26,496
If you go against

3300
02:28:27,264 --> 02:28:27,776
These people

3301
02:28:28,032 --> 02:28:29,312
You find your dad

3302
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:30,592
He was 70

3303
02:28:31,360 --> 02:28:31,872
Crown though

3304
02:28:32,384 --> 02:28:36,224
What do you want

3305
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:40,832
22

3306
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:42,112
Okay

3307
02:28:42,624 --> 02:28:44,160
William Colby Direct

3308
02:28:44,416 --> 02:28:45,184
Intelligence chose

3309
02:28:45,696 --> 02:28:46,208
Clothes from the name

3310
02:28:46,464 --> 02:28:46,976
Darkest

3311
02:28:47,744 --> 02:28:48,768
The Spy Service he loved

3312
02:28:49,024 --> 02:28:49,536
Drowned

3313
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:56,448
27th and tributary thank God thanks guys

3314
02:28:56,704 --> 02:29:01,568
So honestly at this point I didn't have the patience to discuss another giant satanic cabal ring

3315
02:29:01,824 --> 02:29:06,176
Can claim that these dudes can't prove so I'm going to punt on that will do the

3316
02:29:06,432 --> 02:29:12,576
We'll talk about Franklin stuff later she wear I just pulled this clip because it demonstrates how Joe is trying to bring the slightest bit of rash

3317
02:29:12,832 --> 02:29:13,856
Conversation

3318
02:29:14,112 --> 02:29:15,136
But it just doesn't matter

3319
02:29:15,392 --> 02:29:21,536
These dudes have decided that this guy who dared to stand up against the man was killed because he did it

3320
02:29:21,792 --> 02:29:22,560
Problem here is it

3321
02:29:22,816 --> 02:29:28,960
Kind of Alex's whole explanation for why no one is killed him yet is that he's too high-profile but the person they're claiming they'd

3322
02:29:29,216 --> 02:29:30,240
Did kill with the farmer at

3323
02:29:30,496 --> 02:29:36,640
The CIA high-profile

3324
02:29:36,896 --> 02:29:39,200
Is there evidence that William Colby was murdered but

3325
02:29:39,456 --> 02:29:39,968
You see the p

3326
02:29:40,224 --> 02:29:43,296
Piece of evidence that Tim keeps pointing to dinner with still on the

3327
02:29:43,552 --> 02:29:46,368
Exactly do not go out

3328
02:29:46,624 --> 02:29:52,768
Canoeing while your dinner is still on the table I think is very

3329
02:29:53,024 --> 02:29:54,816
Never had a mid-meal knut

3330
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:57,632
Sprite and if you had you would know

3331
02:29:57,888 --> 02:29:58,656
Once you do it

3332
02:29:58,912 --> 02:30:05,056
You never go back this is a misrepresentation of something from the original news article about the search

3333
02:30:05,312 --> 02:30:08,896
For Colby publishing the Associated Press on April 30th 1996

3334
02:30:09,408 --> 02:30:13,760
Investigators found dinner dishes on a table in clam shells in the kitchen sink

3335
02:30:14,528 --> 02:30:18,624
This would imply they possibly they'd already eaten or maybe

3336
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:24,000
And not apply anything specific at all but the version that Tim is repeating is that dinner was on the table

3337
02:30:24,512 --> 02:30:26,048
Would be kind of weird

3338
02:30:26,304 --> 02:30:30,144
Why would a guy go canoeing in between serving and eating his dinner

3339
02:30:30,912 --> 02:30:32,192
That's the kind of question that gets

3340
02:30:32,448 --> 02:30:33,472
Conspiracy theorist

3341
02:30:33,728 --> 02:30:34,496
Aroused

3342
02:30:35,008 --> 02:30:38,592
But in this case it's actually in an accurate client based on initial reports which

3343
02:30:38,848 --> 02:30:39,872
She's really often the case

3344
02:30:40,128 --> 02:30:40,640
With these guys

3345
02:30:41,408 --> 02:30:43,712
Also Kobe's wife

3346
02:30:43,968 --> 02:30:46,272
Quote had spoken to her husband at about 7

3347
02:30:46,528 --> 02:30:47,552
P.m. Saturday

3348
02:30:47,808 --> 02:30:48,832
And you get said that

3349
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:51,136
Even though he felt tired he was going canoeing

3350
02:30:51,392 --> 02:30:53,952
Anyway also from that article quote

3351
02:30:54,208 --> 02:30:58,816
Neighbor said the water was rough Saturday and not good for canoeing

3352
02:30:59,072 --> 02:31:02,656
According to those who knew him he was a creature of habit and that dude love canoeing

3353
02:31:02,912 --> 02:31:08,288
So is the mid-seventies old man on choppy Waters that are bad for canoeing any must have been murdered

3354
02:31:08,544 --> 02:31:10,336
About the clan

3355
02:31:10,592 --> 02:31:12,896
I've been murdered the only explanation I could say

3356
02:31:13,152 --> 02:31:18,528
You can easily find the medical examiner's report of his his death which determined that it was an accident

3357
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:25,184
He was a little boozed-up with a .08 blood reading but the real important finding was that he had calcified

3358
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:27,232
After Russell sclerosis

3359
02:31:27,488 --> 02:31:29,280
In his coronary arteries

3360
02:31:29,536 --> 02:31:30,560
Cancel possible heart trouble

3361
02:31:31,072 --> 02:31:33,888
According to the court the examiner's opinion quote

3362
02:31:34,144 --> 02:31:36,192
He had severe calcified

3363
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:40,800
Asbury salerosa switch would predispose him to a stroke or heart attack

3364
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:43,616
Decomposition however would dissolve

3365
02:31:43,872 --> 02:31:46,688
Clots on the fatty material and atheroma

3366
02:31:47,456 --> 02:31:47,968
You see it would

3367
02:31:48,224 --> 02:31:50,272
Ended up taking nine days for them to find

3368
02:31:50,528 --> 02:31:54,880
His body so in that time that he was in the water those signs of a stroke or heart attack would be gone

3369
02:31:55,136 --> 02:31:57,440
The underlying signs of him being a great

3370
02:31:57,696 --> 02:31:58,208
For those things

3371
02:31:58,464 --> 02:31:59,232
Would still be there

3372
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:03,072
The medical examiner also reports quote the contents of his stomach are

3373
02:32:03,328 --> 02:32:04,096
Consistent with his last

3374
02:32:04,352 --> 02:32:04,864
Reported meal

3375
02:32:05,376 --> 02:32:07,680
And indicate his death was shortly after his dinner

3376
02:32:08,192 --> 02:32:11,520
I guess that would have to do with those clam shells that were in the sink that would make sense

3377
02:32:11,776 --> 02:32:12,288
But of course

3378
02:32:12,544 --> 02:32:18,688
Alex and Tim no better the man clearly killed why else would he go for dinner was Jerry Zelda terrible

3379
02:32:21,248 --> 02:32:22,016
So I made

3380
02:32:23,296 --> 02:32:25,856
You like that's really indicative

3381
02:32:26,112 --> 02:32:28,160
Tim has to hang his hat onto makes this

3382
02:32:28,416 --> 02:32:33,792
Do clearly a conspiracy has dinner was on the table he brings it up multiple times within a minute

3383
02:32:34,048 --> 02:32:35,840
Of trying to defend this claim

3384
02:32:36,096 --> 02:32:39,168
And it's not true and based on this misrepresentation of

3385
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:40,704
Of early news reports

3386
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:43,264
I would say that

3387
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:45,568
The lesson here is

3388
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:46,848
Yeah sometimes

3389
02:32:47,104 --> 02:32:50,176
They do conspiracy theorist will say something that's like yeah that is weird

3390
02:32:50,688 --> 02:32:52,992
Look into it

3391
02:32:53,504 --> 02:32:56,576
What does it mean misrepresent shouldn't say is yeah that is

3392
02:32:56,832 --> 02:32:57,856
Weird we should say

3393
02:32:58,368 --> 02:32:58,880
Yeah

3394
02:32:59,136 --> 02:33:01,184
That would be weird

3395
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:03,232
I'm going to go look at and do it

3396
02:33:03,488 --> 02:33:04,256
Ml come back

3397
02:33:04,768 --> 02:33:06,048
Tell you that it is weird

3398
02:33:06,304 --> 02:33:07,072
But also not true

3399
02:33:08,096 --> 02:33:12,192
I feel like this is getting a little bit on

3400
02:33:12,448 --> 02:33:12,960
Comfortable

3401
02:33:13,216 --> 02:33:14,496
Tell you were great on Friends

3402
02:33:14,752 --> 02:33:15,264

02:33:17,568 --> 02:33:18,848
Who do you think's right you think

3404
02:33:19,616 --> 02:33:21,408
Don't know you were friends characters

3405
02:33:22,176 --> 02:33:23,968
Jujubee Jeffrey Matt LeBlanc

3406
02:33:24,224 --> 02:33:25,248
Right leave me Jennifer

3407

Hilarious

3409
02:33:29,344 --> 02:33:29,856
Hilarious

3410
02:33:30,368 --> 02:33:32,672
Who is Matt leblanc's a joke

3411
02:33:33,184 --> 02:33:34,208
Identify

3412
02:33:34,464 --> 02:33:35,488
I'm dumb

3413
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,304
Jennifer Aniston Horrible Bosses

3414
02:33:39,072 --> 02:33:39,584
Good stuff

3415
02:33:40,352 --> 02:33:41,888
This is really uncomfortable

3416
02:33:42,144 --> 02:33:43,424
That is your boss at

3417
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:45,728
6 after work

3418
02:33:45,984 --> 02:33:51,872
Bunch of people after work function your boss is like look at how funny I can be when I'm not in the office I'm Cutting Loose

3419
02:33:52,128 --> 02:33:52,640
And you're like

3420
02:33:52,896 --> 02:33:54,944
You are a deeply uncomfortable and sad person

3421
02:33:55,968 --> 02:33:59,808
So Alex gets to talking about how the Democrats have admitted

3422
02:34:00,064 --> 02:34:01,344
They're going

3423
02:34:01,600 --> 02:34:04,672
To crash the economy to get

3424
02:34:04,928 --> 02:34:05,952
The office sounds right to me

3425
02:34:06,208 --> 02:34:08,000
Ant-Man this is where I was like

3426
02:34:08,256 --> 02:34:10,048
Alright this is close to a basketball game

3427
02:34:10,304 --> 02:34:11,584
Because Joe is like

3428
02:34:12,352 --> 02:34:14,400
JoJo Nails this one has a dunk

3429
02:34:15,168 --> 02:34:18,240
They want to kill the US economy China has been open for 6 months

3430
02:34:18,752 --> 02:34:19,520
They admitted

3431
02:34:19,776 --> 02:34:20,288
It's leaked out

3432
02:34:20,544 --> 02:34:22,848
They're doing this to kill the US economy member week

3433
02:34:24,896 --> 02:34:26,176
Alice come out Democratic Party

3434
02:34:27,456 --> 02:34:27,968
Sports

3435
02:34:28,992 --> 02:34:31,552
Depression

3436
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:33,088
Trump look bad

3437
02:34:33,344 --> 02:34:33,856
Who said this

3438
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:35,392
Belmar

3439
02:34:35,904 --> 02:34:37,440
Yeah but Bill Maher is not a part of the day

3440
02:34:37,696 --> 02:34:38,208
Democratic Party

3441
02:34:38,464 --> 02:34:41,024
A comic

3442
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:46,144
Around about that

3443
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:46,912
Or Baptist

3444
02:34:47,168 --> 02:34:48,448
The New York trying to have an event

3445
02:34:48,704 --> 02:34:49,472
The police Shuffle

3446
02:34:49,984 --> 02:34:52,288
Orbea limits round burst

3447
02:34:54,848 --> 02:34:55,872
Again pivoting

3448
02:34:56,128 --> 02:35:00,224
I can't quite a handle the push back on.

3449
02:35:00,736 --> 02:35:02,272
Bill Maher is not a source

3450
02:35:02,528 --> 02:35:03,808
Use that as a source

3451
02:35:08,672 --> 02:35:12,000
Soju pushes back more on this idea of using Bill Maher as a

3452
02:35:12,256 --> 02:35:13,280
An example and I

3453
02:35:14,304 --> 02:35:15,584
You totally right

3454
02:35:16,096 --> 02:35:17,120
I want to bring you back

3455
02:35:17,888 --> 02:35:18,656
Animal crackers

3456
02:35:18,912 --> 02:35:19,680
Use Bill Mars

3457
02:35:19,936 --> 02:35:20,448
Example

3458
02:35:21,216 --> 02:35:21,728
What's a credible exam

3459
02:35:22,752 --> 02:35:23,264
Play said that

3460
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:26,080
Yeah but he's a comic and he's always

3461
02:35:26,336 --> 02:35:28,640
Temperature cupboards the news people now

3462
02:35:28,896 --> 02:35:30,944
That's what Colbert and all them Post newspaper

3463
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:31,712
Galaxy

3464
02:35:32,992 --> 02:35:33,760
You can't use him

3465
02:35:34,272 --> 02:35:34,784
An example

3466
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:37,088
Of someone really politician

3467
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:40,928
Who is calling for the economy to crash

3468
02:35:41,184 --> 02:35:42,720
Democrat get the f*** out

3469
02:35:43,744 --> 02:35:44,512
Tell Trump

3470
02:35:46,048 --> 02:35:51,168
China One China

3471
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:53,984
Bioweapon

3472
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:56,032
Give you an hour long

3473
02:36:01,152 --> 02:36:03,456
Before we do I love

3474
02:36:04,224 --> 02:36:06,272
I'd rather get drunk and have a good time

3475
02:36:06,528 --> 02:36:07,296
We know yeah

3476
02:36:07,552 --> 02:36:08,320
Yeah

3477
02:36:08,576 --> 02:36:10,368
I mean this is business

3478
02:36:10,880 --> 02:36:11,648
Really

3479
02:36:11,904 --> 02:36:13,184
I struggle

3480
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:14,720
Watch this

3481
02:36:14,976 --> 02:36:18,560
And imagine how any kind of

3482
02:36:18,816 --> 02:36:19,328
Like

3483
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:20,608
Respect

3484
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:21,888
Or pretense

3485
02:36:22,144 --> 02:36:23,168
Can be maintained

3486
02:36:23,424 --> 02:36:25,472
By Joe and Tim

3487
02:36:25,728 --> 02:36:29,056
Yeah like how can they not if they entered this conversation with

3488
02:36:29,312 --> 02:36:30,080
Respecter

3489
02:36:30,592 --> 02:36:32,640
Admiration for what Alex does

3490
02:36:32,896 --> 02:36:35,456
How can it not be disappearing right in front of their eyes

3491
02:36:35,712 --> 02:36:39,808
Has nothing to do with him being drunk either it has everything to do with this means being like

3492
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:42,368
You can't answer basic questions

3493
02:36:42,624 --> 02:36:43,648
And when you are asked

3494
02:36:43,904 --> 02:36:45,440
To give specifics about things like

3495
02:36:45,952 --> 02:36:48,512
The Democrats want to crash the economy to get rid of trump

3496
02:36:48,768 --> 02:36:50,560
You have a f****** comedian

3497
02:36:50,816 --> 02:36:52,096
Yep that's what you have

3498
02:36:52,352 --> 02:36:54,144
Speaking for the entire Democratic Party

3499
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:56,192
I mean honestly personally

3500
02:36:56,448 --> 02:36:58,752
I really enjoy that because it's something I talked about

3501
02:37:01,312 --> 02:37:03,104
Reverse-engineered

3502
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:08,992
From Alex's rhetoric to see him be forced to admit that and explain to his face

3503
02:37:10,272 --> 02:37:11,040
Stupid

3504
02:37:11,296 --> 02:37:13,600
But it doesn't matter unless Joe says

3505
02:37:14,112 --> 02:37:16,928
I can't believe I believe this guy is a piece of s*** sorry

3506
02:37:17,184 --> 02:37:18,208
Please

3507
02:37:18,720 --> 02:37:19,488
Don't trust

3508
02:37:19,744 --> 02:37:21,536
This stuff comes out of his mouth

3509
02:37:21,792 --> 02:37:22,560
He's not my friend

3510
02:37:22,816 --> 02:37:23,584
He's using me

3511
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:25,376
You will not be on my election special

3512
02:37:25,632 --> 02:37:27,424
At least like that

3513
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:30,240
Yeah but I don't foresee that coming so

3514
02:37:31,776 --> 02:37:34,080
Obviously

3515
02:37:34,336 --> 02:37:35,104
Example you can't use that

3516
02:37:35,616 --> 02:37:37,920
SoJO pushes a little bit more and tries to get Alex

3517
02:37:38,176 --> 02:37:39,200
Forgive another citation

3518
02:37:39,968 --> 02:37:42,528
Said something that I want you to back up

3519
02:37:42,784 --> 02:37:43,296
You said that

3520
02:37:43,552 --> 02:37:45,088
The Democrats are trying

3521
02:37:45,344 --> 02:37:46,624
Denying the possibility

3522
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:49,184
But this seems like

3523
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:50,464
Like if that was the case it would be

3524
02:37:50,976 --> 02:37:52,000
Grand conspiracy

3525
02:37:53,024 --> 02:37:54,816
Please have some evidence

3526
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:57,888
They're trying or they

3527
02:37:58,912 --> 02:37:59,424
Economy

3528
02:37:59,936 --> 02:38:00,704
Because they

3529
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:01,472
They want

3530
02:38:02,240 --> 02:38:03,264
To maintain power

3531
02:38:06,080 --> 02:38:10,432
The wave

3532
02:38:11,968 --> 02:38:12,480
Whitmer

3533
02:38:13,248 --> 02:38:14,784
Climb out exactly all say

3534
02:38:15,808 --> 02:38:16,320
The economy

3535
02:38:16,832 --> 02:38:17,600
Is it going to be

3536
02:38:17,856 --> 02:38:18,880
A bad job

3537
02:38:19,392 --> 02:38:19,904
We're not going to open

3538
02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:20,672
Till he's gone

3539
02:38:21,696 --> 02:38:23,744
Come out with its limit Newsome has opened

3540
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:24,512
Emily said that

3541
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:26,816
You sure

3542
02:38:27,328 --> 02:38:27,840
But what do you

3543
02:38:28,608 --> 02:38:30,400
Said I'm never

3544
02:38:30,656 --> 02:38:31,168
Abacus

3545
02:38:32,448 --> 02:38:32,960
Because of his

3546
02:38:34,496 --> 02:38:35,008
Nautica

3547
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:37,056
Wineries open

3548
02:38:37,568 --> 02:38:38,336
A lot of issues

3549
02:38:38,848 --> 02:38:39,872
Right results there's a lot of

3550
02:38:41,408 --> 02:38:42,432
You plead they close so many

3551
02:38:42,688 --> 02:38:43,968
Jojo

3552
02:38:44,992 --> 02:38:46,528
Globalism was about selling America

3553
02:38:48,064 --> 02:38:49,088
Thundercloud

3554
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:51,392
Change the subject

3555
02:38:52,416 --> 02:38:52,928
Specifically

3556
02:38:53,952 --> 02:38:57,792
Smith said he's really trying to change the subject

3557
02:38:58,048 --> 02:38:59,328
Yeah because not like that's up to

3558
02:38:59,584 --> 02:39:01,376
He knows that

3559
02:39:01,632 --> 02:39:03,936
Upon closer examination

3560
02:39:04,448 --> 02:39:08,800
He's going to be shown to have misrepresented these quotes

3561
02:39:09,056 --> 02:39:13,920
So he tries everything in his power to spin the conversation off into something I was hoping people will forget

3562
02:39:14,176 --> 02:39:14,688
Adidas

3563
02:39:15,712 --> 02:39:17,760
Strollers and Uptown Nevada covid

3564
02:39:18,528 --> 02:39:19,808
When when you say

3565
02:39:20,064 --> 02:39:20,832
The Depths increase

3566
02:39:21,344 --> 02:39:22,624
That is going to happen

3567
02:39:23,136 --> 02:39:23,648
The question is

3568
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:24,928
By what rate

3569
02:39:25,440 --> 02:39:26,208
And how many

3570
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:29,024
Write a check to normal flu and

3571
02:39:29,792 --> 02:39:31,072
Pneumonia morbidity like today

3572
02:39:31,328 --> 02:39:31,840
This year

3573
02:39:32,352 --> 02:39:32,864
Can you add that

3574
02:39:35,168 --> 02:39:36,960
It's whatever they don't count fluids of death

3575
02:39:37,216 --> 02:39:39,776
Or pneumonia anymore they only like they all kind of cover cuz I get remaining

3576
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:42,592
50 plus thousand dollars

Text to do that they get money for covid patients

3592

Bulshit

3593
02:40:19,968 --> 02:40:22,528
CG deserve some pushback

3594
02:40:22,784 --> 02:40:24,832
Cheers aha Joe Rogan

3595
02:40:25,088 --> 02:40:31,232
For I think that he didn't push on that because he's still trying to focus on this new some copies giving it a shot

3596
02:40:31,488 --> 02:40:36,352
Be able to find

3597
02:40:36,608 --> 02:40:38,912
Proof of that he's trying to stay in the pocket

3598
02:40:39,168 --> 02:40:43,520
Getting done getting hit with a couple of things like

3599
02:40:44,032 --> 02:40:50,176
Yeah yeah yeah glanced off him goddamnit he's literally glass

3600
02:40:51,456 --> 02:40:52,992
What did Gavin Newsom

3601
02:40:53,248 --> 02:40:53,760
Some say though

3602
02:40:54,528 --> 02:40:55,296
You when you said

3603
02:40:55,552 --> 02:40:56,832
That he says not going to get better until

3604
02:40:57,088 --> 02:40:57,600
Top trumps out of all

3605
02:40:59,392 --> 02:40:59,904
Well it's

3606
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:01,440
Said that specific

3607
02:41:01,696 --> 02:41:02,208
Ugly and he

3608
02:41:02,464 --> 02:41:03,744
Blacktube

3609
02:41:05,536 --> 02:41:07,840
I want be friends with Trump has been a bad response when does

3610
02:41:08,096 --> 02:41:08,864
Lockdown going and

3611
02:41:09,376 --> 02:41:11,168
Until Trump does this wrong until we have a chain

3612
02:41:11,424 --> 02:41:12,448
I'm just going to continue on

3613
02:41:12,704 --> 02:41:13,472
And it's always about

3614
02:41:13,728 --> 02:41:14,240
The power grab

3615
02:41:14,752 --> 02:41:15,520
So it's two years

3616
02:41:17,568 --> 02:41:18,336
15 days

3617
02:41:18,592 --> 02:41:19,360
The hospitals empty

3618
02:41:19,872 --> 02:41:20,896
And then it's

3619
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:24,736
Then it's sorrow six months and I was two years legate said

3620
02:41:24,992 --> 02:41:25,760
Like a week ago

3621
02:41:26,272 --> 02:41:26,784
10 years

3622
02:41:27,296 --> 02:41:28,064
And now they've got the

3623
02:41:28,832 --> 02:41:29,344
People fauci

3624
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:30,624
No it never ends

3625
02:41:31,136 --> 02:41:33,952
You never Shake hand enter the human rules they say

3626
02:41:34,208 --> 02:41:35,232
Don't look at someone

3627
02:41:35,744 --> 02:41:36,512
And turn your head

3628
02:41:38,304 --> 02:41:39,072
Inside the shin

3629
02:41:40,352 --> 02:41:43,168
Citizens of the UK told do not look at other people in

3630
02:41:43,424 --> 02:41:43,936
Turn your head

3631
02:41:44,192 --> 02:41:44,704
It's cold

3632
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:47,264
Programming man he's a pretty common talking

3633
02:41:47,776 --> 02:41:49,824
Like a lot of Democrats

3634
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:51,616
To take yeah it's not going to get better.

3635
02:41:51,872 --> 02:41:52,640
Until Trump is out because

3636
02:41:52,896 --> 02:41:53,920
Does Trump has made a mess of it

3637
02:41:54,176 --> 02:41:54,944
So Tim is

3638
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:55,712
But this is

3639
02:41:55,968 --> 02:42:00,064
Was basically his purpose purpose cuz I don't know if it's intentional

3640
02:42:00,320 --> 02:42:01,600
The role that he feels

3641
02:42:01,856 --> 02:42:04,416
Throughout most of this is trying to restate

3642
02:42:04,928 --> 02:42:11,072
Insane things Alex says we contextualize ridiculous s*** Alex's to make it seem slightly more reasonable

3643
02:42:11,328 --> 02:42:14,144
Also not what I want to say

3644
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:17,216
Because saying that you know predicting

3645
02:42:17,472 --> 02:42:20,032
But things aren't going to get better as long as Trump is in charge

3646
02:42:20,288 --> 02:42:26,432
It's not the same thing as threatening to keep everything closed until you get into power in fact I would say they're very very different

3647
02:42:26,688 --> 02:42:27,200
They are

3648
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:31,296
That Tim is trying to muddy that water

3649
02:42:31,552 --> 02:42:34,112
Whether it's an intentional act or not I think it just might be

3650
02:42:34,624 --> 02:42:35,904
Based on his predisposition

3651
02:42:36,416 --> 02:42:38,976
Never be overstated

3652
02:42:42,304 --> 02:42:43,840
These are three very stupid p

3653
02:42:44,352 --> 02:42:45,632
All sitting around a table

3654
02:42:45,888 --> 02:42:46,400
Talkingshit

3655
02:42:46,912 --> 02:42:50,240
Maybe they're at least don't know what they're talkin about

3656
02:42:50,496 --> 02:42:53,568
I don't know if they're stupid in all facets of life

3657
02:42:53,824 --> 02:42:55,104
Joe Rogan

3658
02:42:55,360 --> 02:42:58,432
The pretty smart guy when he applies himself and and

3659
02:42:58,688 --> 02:43:02,784
Seems to want to keep he's not a dumb dumb idiot

3660
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:03,808
308 complete

3661
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:05,856
No no no

3662
02:43:07,904 --> 02:43:08,416
Have a lot of

3663
02:43:09,440 --> 02:43:13,024
But I'm at generously call blind-spot

3664
02:43:13,280 --> 02:43:17,120
I don't think Alex is stupid BS craft

3665
02:43:17,376 --> 02:43:19,680
What you doing honey sweetie I'm not trying to say

3666
02:43:19,936 --> 02:43:20,960
These are people who are like

3667
02:43:21,216 --> 02:43:27,104
IQ deprive nonsense like that kind of thing I'm just saying that these are people who are willfully committed

3668
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:29,920
To not learning the answers to the questions that they are at

3669
02:43:30,176 --> 02:43:32,992
It does appear that way only explanation for this

3670
02:43:33,248 --> 02:43:34,528
Projo In This Moment

3671
02:43:34,784 --> 02:43:36,832
Okay cuz he wants to know about this

3672
02:43:37,088 --> 02:43:37,856
F****** quotes okay

3673
02:43:38,624 --> 02:43:39,392
I wonder if there's an actual

3674
02:43:39,648 --> 02:43:40,160
Statement

3675
02:43:40,416 --> 02:43:41,184
Or he said

3676
02:43:42,720 --> 02:43:43,488
Please

3677
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,560
Then we'll open back up

3678
02:43:47,584 --> 02:43:53,728
He said some other things. It will it's fine it's not the news

3679
02:43:53,984 --> 02:43:54,752
Whitmer for sure

3680
02:43:55,008 --> 02:43:57,056
Dover to that make it

3681
02:43:57,312 --> 02:44:03,456
Different making find it this is all the more confusing been doing trying to Google things

3682
02:44:03,712 --> 02:44:05,248
Start over

3683
02:44:05,504 --> 02:44:06,528
Also Alex

3684
02:44:06,784 --> 02:44:08,320
Skip a little bit combative about outing

3685
02:44:08,576 --> 02:44:10,880
Interested Joe is in finding out what he's talking about

3686
02:44:11,392 --> 02:44:12,928
We ever find a quote for Whitmer

3687
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:17,280
Do you want me to find it

3688
02:44:18,048 --> 02:44:19,840
Can you

3689
02:44:23,424 --> 02:44:25,216
Gretchen Whitmer they almost kidnapped

3690
02:44:25,472 --> 02:44:25,984
By the way

3691
02:44:26,496 --> 02:44:27,520
I know I don't have I'm just

3692
02:44:28,032 --> 02:44:28,800
Lake Merwin Trump

3693
02:44:29,312 --> 02:44:30,080
Office quote

3694
02:44:30,336 --> 02:44:32,128
She was almost there was a kidnapping

3695
02:44:32,384 --> 02:44:32,896
Plot against

3696
02:44:33,408 --> 02:44:33,920
No it's

3697
02:44:34,944 --> 02:44:37,760
Which 50 caliber long until Trump gone

3698
02:44:39,296 --> 02:44:40,832
Lockdowns won't end till

3699
02:44:41,600 --> 02:44:42,368
I'll try that

3700
02:44:43,648 --> 02:44:44,672
Whitmer

3701
02:44:46,976 --> 02:44:48,000
Whatever I know

3702
02:44:48,256 --> 02:44:49,024
You guys are great

3703
02:44:49,536 --> 02:44:54,400
Everyone here everyone in that room working together like a well-oiled machinery

3704
02:44:54,656 --> 02:44:59,776
Talking about Whitmer and Tim is brought up that there was that kidnapping attempt

3705
02:45:00,288 --> 02:45:00,800
Plan

3706
02:45:01,056 --> 02:45:05,664
That is a false flag although Alex would agree that it is a good idea as well

3707
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:08,736
Forget into that a little bit and then two makes a joke

3708
02:45:08,992 --> 02:45:12,576
And then one of my favorite f****** moments in podcasts like this happen

3709
02:45:13,600 --> 02:45:18,976
It was weird but I

3710
02:45:19,232 --> 02:45:21,024
As it turned out the two leaders were FBI informant

3711
02:45:21,792 --> 02:45:23,328
What what's even crazier is 50

3712
02:45:23,584 --> 02:45:24,096
80%.

3713
02:45:24,608 --> 02:45:25,632
Citizens Michigan agreed with a

3714
02:45:31,264 --> 02:45:34,336
Take me to edit that part when you say that

3715
02:45:35,872 --> 02:45:38,944
Calls for kidnapping

3716
02:45:46,624 --> 02:45:51,232
Correction Hillary Clinton is not a topo did you guys see that

3717
02:45:51,744 --> 02:45:52,512
Bret Weinstein

3718
02:45:52,768 --> 02:45:53,280
Unity 20

3719
02:45:53,792 --> 02:45:55,840
Account was also banned from Twitter

3720
02:45:56,096 --> 02:45:59,680
Just told me that third-party

3721
02:45:59,936 --> 02:46:01,216
Was calling for Unity between

3722
02:46:01,472 --> 02:46:02,496
People on the right and left

3723
02:46:03,008 --> 02:46:04,287
Get together and have conversation

3724
02:46:04,543 --> 02:46:07,103
Perhaps even have an alternative

3725
02:46:07,871 --> 02:46:08,639
That's outrageous

3726
02:46:09,151 --> 02:46:15,295
I love how obsessed these dudes are with how fun it will be when the snowflake Libs take something they say out of context they are

3727
02:46:15,807 --> 02:46:16,831
That's with it

3728
02:46:17,087 --> 02:46:21,951
I think they should be way more worried about someone taking them in context and actually care about what they say

3729
02:46:22,207 --> 02:46:23,487
Because the picture looks

3730
02:46:23,743 --> 02:46:25,791
Are you worse than a couple of B- jokes

3731
02:46:26,047 --> 02:46:26,815
I'm going to go with you

3732
02:46:27,071 --> 02:46:33,215
As for unity2020 I don't know exactly why I told her kick the account off the platform put if I were a betting man I would say this

3733
02:46:33,471 --> 02:46:36,799
Probably because it's almost certainly a bad faith campaign to f*** with the election

3734
02:46:37,567 --> 02:46:40,895
And September like two months before an election.

3735
02:46:41,151 --> 02:46:47,295
That's when the brat f****** Weinstein is going to get a campaign rolling to field a candidate for president

3736
02:46:47,551 --> 02:46:53,695
That's f****** horseshit third-party and I think well after all the nominations are taken care of

3737
02:46:53,951 --> 02:46:57,023
How long after everybody knows exactly who the candidates are

3738
02:46:57,279 --> 02:47:00,351
Good time for summer to come in and shake things up.

3739
02:47:00,607 --> 02:47:06,751
16 ticket is Tulsi gabbard and Dan Crenshaw

3740
02:47:08,031 --> 02:47:13,407
Right now. Actually

3741
02:47:13,663 --> 02:47:15,711
What do we have

3742
02:47:15,967 --> 02:47:19,807
Water people presidents we haven't had any before that would also be a milestone

3743
02:47:21,087 --> 02:47:24,927
As far as I can tell they have not agreed to run on this ticket oh no

3744
02:47:25,183 --> 02:47:27,999
According to a video Weinstein posted on September 1st

3745
02:47:28,511 --> 02:47:31,583
He hadn't even collected signatures to get on ballot

3746
02:47:32,095 --> 02:47:35,679
Basically with Weinstein was pitching was for all the third parties to

3747
02:47:35,935 --> 02:47:37,727
Coalesce around his

3748
02:47:37,983 --> 02:47:43,615
Ticket green partying Libertarians even if they wanted to they could team up to be

3749
02:47:44,383 --> 02:47:50,527
If you actually watch Weinstein's video it's legitimately just him saying that he's not even going to try to get Battle attacks

3750
02:47:50,783 --> 02:47:52,063
Access for unity2020 as a

3751
02:47:52,319 --> 02:47:52,831
The party

3752
02:47:53,343 --> 02:47:54,623
Because he knows that's laughable

3753
02:47:55,903 --> 02:48:01,023
Instead his strategy is to Big the green or libertarian parties who already have candidate

3754
02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:02,815
Gates to abandon their candidates

3755
02:48:03,071 --> 02:48:06,143
And instead allow Bret Weinstein to choose their ticket

3756
02:48:06,399 --> 02:48:08,447
Which would be Tulsi gabbard Dan Crenshaw

3757
02:48:08,703 --> 02:48:10,495
Now I'm going to go out on a limb here

3758
02:48:10,751 --> 02:48:11,775
And say that

3759
02:48:12,031 --> 02:48:12,799
That might be an ovary

3760
02:48:18,175 --> 02:48:24,319
I meant look I like a big swing that's a big swing if I were Twitter I would kick this off too but life

3761
02:48:24,575 --> 02:48:30,719
Because I was worried about it affecting the election but because it's a very thinly veiled crap. f*** out of here

3762
02:48:30,975 --> 02:48:32,767
Two desperate even four words

3763
02:48:33,023 --> 02:48:35,071
Personal contacts deep video of

3764
02:48:35,327 --> 02:48:37,375
Feinstein's plant has been up for 2 months

3765
02:48:37,887 --> 02:48:39,423
Anime on YouTube has gotten

3766
02:48:39,679 --> 02:48:41,727
21000

3767
02:48:41,983 --> 02:48:46,079
Not good

3768
02:48:46,335 --> 02:48:46,847
She might've

3769
02:48:50,687 --> 02:48:54,015
Bread sounds like I'll steal the presidency from her

3770
02:48:54,271 --> 02:48:56,063
Have you bility to go on like

3771
02:48:56,319 --> 02:49:01,695
Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan's podcast and promote his unity2020 concept

3772
02:49:01,951 --> 02:49:03,999
Eddie's f****** video got 20 1000 views

3773
02:49:04,511 --> 02:49:07,839
Not a lot of excitement surrounding

3774
02:49:08,607 --> 02:49:09,119
Taxi app

3775
02:49:11,679 --> 02:49:17,311
The quote for a little while

3776
02:49:22,175 --> 02:49:22,687
Okay

3777
02:49:23,199 --> 02:49:23,967
The Trump virus

3778
02:49:24,223 --> 02:49:25,759
Response is the worst in the globe

3779
02:49:26,015 --> 02:49:28,831
She said if you're tired of the of lockdowns

3780
02:49:29,087 --> 02:49:32,927
Or you're tired of wearing masks or you wish you were in church

3781
02:49:33,183 --> 02:49:34,207
What's this morning or

3782
02:49:34,463 --> 02:49:35,231
Watching college

3783
02:49:35,487 --> 02:49:37,279
Or your kids were getting

3784
02:49:37,535 --> 02:49:38,047
In person

3785
02:49:38,303 --> 02:49:38,815
Instructions

3786
02:49:39,071 --> 02:49:40,607
It's time for a change in this country

3787
02:49:41,119 --> 02:49:43,167
And that's why we've got to look Joe Biden

3788
02:49:44,447 --> 02:49:44,959
Pretty

3789
02:49:48,031 --> 02:49:49,055
You can make that

3790
02:49:50,079 --> 02:49:50,591
Yeah

3791
02:49:52,127 --> 02:49:55,711
It's right pretty my problem is the problem is

3792
02:49:56,223 --> 02:49:56,735
If you just

3793
02:49:56,991 --> 02:49:59,039
If you're tired of locked

3794
02:50:00,575 --> 02:50:01,599
Hallelujah

3795
02:50:01,855 --> 02:50:02,623
YouTube

3796
02:50:02,879 --> 02:50:03,903
Interpretation of it but if

3797
02:50:04,159 --> 02:50:06,207
You back it up to the Trump virus

3798
02:50:06,463 --> 02:50:06,975
Response

3799
02:50:07,231 --> 02:50:07,743
Is the worst in

3800
02:50:07,999 --> 02:50:08,511
The globe

3801
02:50:08,767 --> 02:50:09,279
She said

3802
02:50:09,535 --> 02:50:10,559
If you're tired of locked

3803
02:50:11,071 --> 02:50:12,863
So what you saying you were here

3804
02:50:13,375 --> 02:50:15,167
Minion not necessarily

3805
02:50:15,423 --> 02:50:20,799
Because what she told please

3806
02:50:21,311 --> 02:50:25,151
What she's saying is we got it

3807
02:50:25,407 --> 02:50:26,687
What she saying is a trump is done

3808
02:50:26,943 --> 02:50:27,967
Such a shity job

3809
02:50:28,223 --> 02:50:29,503
That's the reason why we're locked down

3810
02:50:30,783 --> 02:50:32,063
The headline

3811
02:50:32,319 --> 02:50:32,831
Is true though

3812
02:50:33,343 --> 02:50:35,903
I think when you got to consider these you got people flying in

3813
02:50:36,159 --> 02:50:36,927
From Europe in China

3814
02:50:37,439 --> 02:50:38,463
And all these other countries

3815
02:50:38,719 --> 02:50:39,231
Expression

3816
02:50:39,743 --> 02:50:41,023
Yeah you're going to have

3817
02:50:41,791 --> 02:50:43,071
The f****** really contagious

3818
02:50:48,191 --> 02:50:48,703
When the light turns on

3819
02:50:49,727 --> 02:50:50,239
Let me ask you this

3820
02:50:51,007 --> 02:50:52,287
You're never wrong

3821
02:50:52,799 --> 02:50:53,567
On scale 1 to 10

3822
02:50:53,823 --> 02:50:55,871
Warrington numerology this is when it gets good

3823
02:50:56,127 --> 02:50:56,639
Great

3824
02:50:56,895 --> 02:51:00,991
So you can see here the decision tree of Alex's responses to being confronted with something

3825
02:51:01,247 --> 02:51:02,271
He can't really dispute

3826
02:51:02,783 --> 02:51:05,087
He's misrepresented reality in reality is looking

3827
02:51:05,343 --> 02:51:09,183
I'm back at him with the only possibility seems to be that he made up the Whitmer quote

3828
02:51:09,439 --> 02:51:13,791
Or he didn't understand this one and repeated a misleading version for his own purposes

3829
02:51:14,559 --> 02:51:15,327
His first attempt

3830
02:51:15,583 --> 02:51:17,631
Wiggle free is to claim that they're splitting hairs

3831
02:51:17,887 --> 02:51:18,911
And it's probably usually work

3832
02:51:19,423 --> 02:51:20,447
For whatever reason

3833
02:51:20,959 --> 02:51:21,727
Go doesn't accept

3834
02:51:21,983 --> 02:51:23,007
This and says it's not

3835
02:51:23,263 --> 02:51:23,775
So Alec

3836
02:51:24,031 --> 02:51:25,823
Excel has to try other things

3837
02:51:26,079 --> 02:51:26,591
Game 2

3838
02:51:26,847 --> 02:51:29,663
Right and game Tuesday School

3839
02:51:29,919 --> 02:51:34,271
Yeah they create false versions of What Joe is saying he on defend himself

3840
02:51:34,527 --> 02:51:37,343
From the fake version Joe just ignores that

3841
02:51:37,599 --> 02:51:38,623
Keep moving forward

3842
02:51:38,879 --> 02:51:40,671
And then we get to transitioning to

3843
02:51:40,927 --> 02:51:45,791
Something completely unrelated and possibly two interesting or confusing to resist following up on

3844
02:51:46,047 --> 02:51:46,815
In this case

3845
02:51:47,071 --> 02:51:47,839
Numerology

3846
02:51:48,607 --> 02:51:52,959
I just wish these dudes like Tim and Joe could see in the moment how much of a one-trick pony Alex's

3847
02:51:53,215 --> 02:51:57,311
I just disabuse themselves with the idea that he's worth listening to all he did

3848
02:51:57,567 --> 02:51:58,079
All he did

3849
02:51:58,335 --> 02:51:58,847
Was

3850
02:51:59,103 --> 02:51:59,871
Realize you can't plate

3851
02:52:01,663 --> 02:52:04,223
Realized you couldn't play offense we tried to change the field

3852
02:52:04,479 --> 02:52:10,623
He's a child singing I'm going to take my ball and go home you don't like the game

3853
02:52:10,879 --> 02:52:17,023
Being played so you distract people with numerology

3854
02:52:17,279 --> 02:52:21,119
John episode 911 meaning to the episode numbers

3855
02:52:21,631 --> 02:52:23,679
It's obviously just like an attempt to

3856
02:52:23,935 --> 02:52:28,287
Got to go to another conversation

3857
02:52:28,543 --> 02:52:30,847
You didn't even say that you're full of s*** yeah

3858
02:52:31,103 --> 02:52:35,455
Yep you can't defend this other than to be like yes I guess I took that out of context

3859
02:52:35,711 --> 02:52:41,855
And that now you have the responsibility to have that in your awareness that you took this out of context you can't use this argument

3860
02:52:42,111 --> 02:52:47,743
Anymore he's done with it I doubt we'll ever hear any problem.

3861
02:52:47,999 --> 02:52:48,511
This time right

3862
02:52:49,023 --> 02:52:51,583
Yeah probably half so they get to talk

3863
02:52:51,839 --> 02:52:52,351
Can some more

3864
02:52:53,631 --> 02:52:54,911
And Alex brings up

3865
02:52:55,423 --> 02:52:56,447
Operation lockstep

3866
02:52:57,471 --> 02:52:59,519
And now here is where Joe

3867
02:52:59,775 --> 02:53:01,055
Does his other bit of good

3868
02:53:03,359 --> 02:53:03,871
What about

3869
02:53:04,639 --> 02:53:05,663
The UN and

3870
02:53:06,175 --> 02:53:07,199
The Davis Group all say

3871
02:53:07,711 --> 02:53:09,503
This is the post-industrial world

3872
02:53:10,271 --> 02:53:12,319
The great reset a copy before right here

3873
02:53:13,087 --> 02:53:13,599
And I say

3874
02:53:13,855 --> 02:53:14,623
A lease document

3875
02:53:15,391 --> 02:53:15,903
We are going

3876
02:53:16,927 --> 02:53:19,743
Reorganize Society covid is good to shutdown the car

3877
02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:21,791
We're going to end

3878
02:53:22,047 --> 02:53:22,559
Success

3879

In prosperity

3880
02:53:24,351 --> 02:53:25,631
Granite rack everybody works

3881
02:53:25,887 --> 02:53:27,423
Control their lives all under the name of

3882
02:53:28,191 --> 02:53:29,727
They said all that they said we're going to end

3883
02:53:29,983 --> 02:53:30,495
Successful

3884
02:53:31,775 --> 02:53:33,055
Oh yeah in the lockstep

3885
02:53:33,567 --> 02:53:34,079
Rockefeller

3886
02:53:34,335 --> 02:53:35,103
2010

3887
02:53:36,383 --> 02:53:37,151
Viral lesueur

3888
02:53:37,407 --> 02:53:37,919
Simulator

3889
02:53:38,431 --> 02:53:39,711
The crates total funeral bring up

3890
02:53:39,967 --> 02:53:40,479
Police state

3891
02:53:40,991 --> 02:53:42,015
Martial law

3892
02:53:42,783 --> 02:53:47,135
Absolutely we talked about this a ton I'll read this document

3893
02:53:47,391 --> 02:53:49,183
Alex is completely lying about it

3894
02:53:49,439 --> 02:53:50,719
But it's interesting

3895
02:53:51,231 --> 02:53:51,999
That like I got

3896
02:53:52,255 --> 02:53:53,535
So excited

3897
02:53:53,791 --> 02:53:56,607
When Joe push back on that

3898
02:53:56,863 --> 02:53:58,143
Like if you are

3899
02:53:58,399 --> 02:54:01,471
Are successfully able to push back on Alex and demonstrate what

3900
02:54:01,727 --> 02:54:04,799
He's doing here game is over

3901
02:54:05,055 --> 02:54:06,335
Fully and very

3902
02:54:07,103 --> 02:54:08,895
Explicitly exposes him

3903
02:54:09,407 --> 02:54:10,175
Yeah once you're like

3904
02:54:10,431 --> 02:54:16,575
Actually there were four scenarios actually this wasn't a planned this was just a technological

3905
02:54:16,831 --> 02:54:21,951
Misrepresented as I plan

3906
02:54:22,207 --> 02:54:22,975
And then you say

3907
02:54:23,487 --> 02:54:24,767
And you f****** know it

3908
02:54:25,279 --> 02:54:25,791
Absolutely

3909
02:54:26,047 --> 02:54:27,071
Yep or did you not read the

3910
02:54:27,327 --> 02:54:29,887
Yeah exactly have you been talking about this for months

3911
02:54:30,143 --> 02:54:33,727
As a dystopian terrifying Planet you not even read this

3912
02:54:34,239 --> 02:54:40,383
What is it could at one of the two either you didn't read it or you're lying to me so you choose and get the f*** out of my

3913
02:54:40,639 --> 02:54:42,687
Exactly yeah I mean if you had any

3914
02:54:42,943 --> 02:54:44,223
Dignity. Any

3915
02:54:44,479 --> 02:54:50,111
Feeling of responsibility for your audience you have an obligation to do something like that yep and I got really excited

3916
02:54:50,367 --> 02:54:51,903
Because Jamie is

3917
02:54:52,415 --> 02:54:54,719
Able to Google it's not hard

3918
02:54:54,975 --> 02:54:56,767
If not it's very easy to find

3919
02:54:57,023 --> 02:55:00,863
And so I Jimmy Google's this and here's where I would end up happening

3920
02:55:01,887 --> 02:55:02,399
I was already looking

3921
02:55:10,079 --> 02:55:10,591
I'll Arkansas

3922
02:55:15,711 --> 02:55:16,479
Snopes

3923
02:55:16,991 --> 02:55:17,503
Green

3924
02:55:21,087 --> 02:55:24,159
Let's focus on the grain if everyone who says

3925
02:55:24,415 --> 02:55:28,255
The grain of Truth the kernel of Truth is in the document does exist

3926
02:55:28,511 --> 02:55:30,559
It's on all the Treasure Trove of life

3927
02:55:31,583 --> 02:55:33,631
Let's focus on the grain of Truth

3928
02:55:33,887 --> 02:55:35,935
Very small let's see what the big thing first

3929
02:55:36,191 --> 02:55:37,727
All the lies around it

3930
02:55:39,007 --> 02:55:40,287
They find a doctor

3931
02:55:42,079 --> 02:55:43,103
Rockefeller Foundation

3932
02:55:43,359 --> 02:55:43,871
An annual report

3933
02:55:49,247 --> 02:55:51,039
Look up a police state

3934
02:55:51,295 --> 02:55:52,319
What's up

3935
02:55:53,855 --> 02:55:54,367
Exact words

Ctrl f

3937
02:55:59,487 --> 02:56:00,511
Just one paper that's it

3938
02:56:03,583 --> 02:56:04,607
So when you control

3939
02:56:04,863 --> 02:56:05,375
Africa

3940
02:56:05,631 --> 02:56:06,655
20 States

3941
02:56:07,167 --> 02:56:09,727
What else

3942
02:56:09,983 --> 02:56:11,007
Before it says that so

3943
02:56:11,519 --> 02:56:14,079
Now you know

3944
02:56:14,847 --> 02:56:15,359
No not yet

3945
02:56:16,383 --> 02:56:18,431
Exact World cable let's look up pandemic

3946
02:56:19,455 --> 02:56:24,319
Alex has to feel his world and walls closing in on him at this point because like

3947
02:56:24,575 --> 02:56:28,671
Oh they're not going to find the things that I've said are here it's just not there

3948
02:56:28,927 --> 02:56:31,743
They're not in there no problem with the things that I say

3949
02:56:31,999 --> 02:56:35,071
Search for the word paint

3950
02:56:37,375 --> 02:56:38,911
All right with no network to

3951
02:56:39,679 --> 02:56:40,191
Critical infection

3952
02:56:41,215 --> 02:56:41,983
Nation without open minds

3953
02:56:43,007 --> 02:56:43,775
Thousands

3954
02:56:44,031 --> 02:56:45,823
Morfol 6th Avenue

3955
02:56:46,079 --> 02:56:46,847
Enclose disease

3956

Becomes a nun

3957
02:56:48,127 --> 02:56:48,895
Check Pandora

3958
02:56:49,151 --> 02:56:49,663
Time

3959
02:56:51,199 --> 02:56:51,967
The right expert

3960
02:56:52,479 --> 02:56:54,527
Is brought to bear on the probable

3961
02:56:54,783 --> 02:56:55,295
Too late

3962
02:56:55,807 --> 02:56:57,087
The disease has spread around the globe

3963
02:56:57,343 --> 02:57:00,927
In a world of global trade and travel with traded faster and travel

3964
02:57:01,183 --> 02:57:01,695
Farthest

3965
02:57:01,951 --> 02:57:02,975
Are the microbes never

3966
02:57:03,487 --> 02:57:03,999
Southeast

3967
02:57:04,255 --> 02:57:05,535
What do they what is this

3968
02:57:05,791 --> 02:57:06,303
In reference

3969
02:57:07,583 --> 02:57:08,095
Okay it says

3970
02:57:08,351 --> 02:57:08,863
The few miles

3971
02:57:11,679 --> 02:57:12,191
Couldn't hold on.

3972
02:57:12,447 --> 02:57:12,959
Please go back to that

3973
02:57:13,983 --> 02:57:14,495
Yeah just

3974
02:57:14,751 --> 02:57:15,263
It's just a

3975
02:57:15,519 --> 02:57:16,799
It's just a escenario

3976
02:57:17,055 --> 02:57:17,567
Did their paint

3977
02:57:18,847 --> 02:57:24,735
Here's the exact moment that Joe need someone like me around I would never accept that position even if it were off

3978
02:57:25,247 --> 02:57:27,295
The first problem is that Joe has a wrong.

3979
02:57:28,063 --> 02:57:30,879
This is the Rockefeller annual report from 2010

3980
02:57:31,135 --> 02:57:37,023
Which is the link to where is the one Alex lies about and turned into the fictitious operation lockstep

3981
02:57:37,535 --> 02:57:40,351
He's called scenarios for the future of technology and International

3982
02:57:40,607 --> 02:57:41,631
They're both

3983
02:57:41,887 --> 02:57:45,471
Rockefeller Foundation documents from 2010 so it's an easy mistake to make

3984
02:57:45,727 --> 02:57:49,823
But the idea that there is such a thing as our operation lockstep

3985
02:57:50,079 --> 02:57:51,359
Just did something Alex took

3986
02:57:51,615 --> 02:57:52,127
From a meme

3987
02:57:52,639 --> 02:57:58,527
I applaud you for trying to find the document and I further applaud him for being able to discern that the text that he was reading was a

3988
02:57:58,783 --> 02:58:02,367
The scenario that was being described as opposed to the text being a nefarious plan

3989
02:58:02,879 --> 02:58:04,159
But he doesn't have the full picture

3990
02:58:04,415 --> 02:58:07,743
If he knew what he was talking about and knew what the conversation was

3991
02:58:07,999 --> 02:58:09,791
You know this wasn't the right document

3992
02:58:10,047 --> 02:58:13,119
You would know that the correct document is

3993
02:58:13,375 --> 02:58:15,679
Breakdown for Imaginary scenarios

3994
02:58:15,935 --> 02:58:18,239
Have ways in which technology and political situation

3995
02:58:18,495 --> 02:58:20,031
Developing world

3996
02:58:20,799 --> 02:58:24,127
The four scenarios depicts world where things develop differently onto axe

3997
02:58:24,895 --> 02:58:25,407
The first

3998
02:58:25,663 --> 02:58:28,479
Political and economic alignment can either be strong

3999
02:58:28,735 --> 02:58:29,247
Or week

4000
02:58:29,503 --> 02:58:33,087
The other adaptive capacity can either be low or high

4001
02:58:33,599 --> 02:58:39,743
This scenario Alex's pretending is the Rockefellers plan for the world is just the way that the authors of this exercise chose to

4002
02:58:39,999 --> 02:58:40,511
To characterize

4003
02:58:40,767 --> 02:58:41,279
At Emagine

4004
02:58:42,559 --> 02:58:45,887
Strong political and economic alignment and low adaptive

4005
02:58:46,143 --> 02:58:46,655
Capacity

4006
02:58:47,167 --> 02:58:49,215
And I know that we talked about this a bunch but

4007
02:58:49,471 --> 02:58:55,615
I figure there may be a chance that people haven't heard that because they're brought in by a rug in a bag

4008
02:58:55,871 --> 02:58:56,895
And this is an important point

4009
02:58:57,151 --> 02:58:58,431
Alex's

4010
02:58:58,687 --> 02:59:02,527
Complete fraud that he's pulling they were using Game Theory to figure out

4011
02:59:02,783 --> 02:59:03,295
What might

4012
02:59:04,319 --> 02:59:04,831
The

4013
02:59:05,343 --> 02:59:07,391
Well economic and political alignment

4014
02:59:07,647 --> 02:59:09,439
Has to do with the ways in which

4015
02:59:09,695 --> 02:59:10,463
The state does

4016
02:59:10,719 --> 02:59:11,743
Control of

4017
02:59:14,047 --> 02:59:17,631
Adaptive capacity in terms of technological advancement

4018
02:59:17,887 --> 02:59:18,911
Has another app

4019
02:59:19,167 --> 02:59:19,935
Accessbet important

4020
02:59:20,191 --> 02:59:22,751
Answer those are the

4021
02:59:23,007 --> 02:59:24,031
The two axies

4022
02:59:24,287 --> 02:59:26,335
That the the team of experts

4023
02:59:26,591 --> 02:59:29,407
Who prepared this report. Where the most

4024
02:59:29,663 --> 02:59:30,175
Import

4025
02:59:30,687 --> 02:59:31,711
In terms of

4026
02:59:32,223 --> 02:59:32,991
Deciding

4027
02:59:33,503 --> 02:59:39,647
What sort of challenges should be prepared for their a ton of other exies that they could have done a report on

4028
02:59:39,903 --> 02:59:41,951
And it would have been different than

4029
02:59:42,207 --> 02:59:48,351
Totally but what they're doing I mean what they're essentially doing is applying quick game theory to this

4030
02:59:48,607 --> 02:59:50,143
So you got four boxes

4031
02:59:50,399 --> 02:59:54,239
Top left is 11 top right is 10 bottom left her Hero 1

4032
02:59:54,495 --> 02:59:55,519
Bottom right of 00

4033
02:59:55,775 --> 02:59:56,287
Yeah like that's

4034
02:59:56,543 --> 02:59:58,847
That's what they're trying to do and extrapolate from there

4035
02:59:59,103 --> 03:00:00,895
That's the whole idea and

4036
03:00:01,151 --> 03:00:03,199
Come up with real

4037
03:00:03,455 --> 03:00:04,479
Realistic

4038
03:00:05,247 --> 03:00:09,599
Depictions of what that world could look like zactly

4039
03:00:09,855 --> 03:00:10,367
Depiction

4040
03:00:10,879 --> 03:00:11,647
They have

4041
03:00:12,159 --> 03:00:14,207
One in the lockstep one

4042
03:00:14,719 --> 03:00:17,535
There is a virus that is involved in the

4043
03:00:17,791 --> 03:00:19,071
Background of

4044
03:00:19,327 --> 03:00:22,655
The the scenario described

4045
03:00:23,167 --> 03:00:27,775
Announces taking that to pretend that there is such a thing as operation lockstep

4046
03:00:28,031 --> 03:00:30,335
That is run this 2010 Rockefeller document

4047
03:00:30,591 --> 03:00:31,871
It's just a complete lie

4048
03:00:32,383 --> 03:00:38,527
Because Joe doesn't know what Alex is talking about he's tried to find the thing he needs to Judge Alex his claim

4049
03:00:38,783 --> 03:00:40,319
Doesn't know it's not the right thing

4050
03:00:40,575 --> 03:00:42,111
So they're never going to get to any truth

4051
03:00:42,879 --> 03:00:45,695
Alex is wasted and he doesn't know which report is which

4052
03:00:45,951 --> 03:00:47,487
To begin with so he's do help me out

4053
03:00:47,743 --> 03:00:50,047
That's kind of what makes this show pointless

4054
03:00:50,559 --> 03:00:51,327
Unless there was an egg

4055
03:00:51,583 --> 03:00:52,863
Expected steak that is Alex

4056
03:00:53,119 --> 03:00:56,447
Cannot defend his claims are assumed to be wrong and he's full of s***

4057
03:00:56,703 --> 03:00:59,263
He's going to win every time because what do you do here

4058
03:00:59,519 --> 03:01:01,823
What do you what do you do is like I know it's in there

4059
03:01:02,079 --> 03:01:05,919
Yeah where do you go from there all right let's read this whole document or

4060
03:01:06,175 --> 03:01:06,943
Worse still

4061
03:01:07,199 --> 03:01:08,223
You got the wrong one

4062
03:01:08,479 --> 03:01:12,319
I'm criticizing for it the next day is like see they weren't even reading the right

4063
03:01:12,575 --> 03:01:17,439
Number one

4064
03:01:17,951 --> 03:01:21,279
Document though it is the wrong

4065
03:01:22,303 --> 03:01:24,607
By continuing our drive to invest

4066
03:01:24,863 --> 03:01:25,375
Systems that

4067
03:01:25,631 --> 03:01:26,143
Coordinated effort

4068
03:01:26,399 --> 03:01:27,167
And share information

4069
03:01:27,679 --> 03:01:28,703
The Rockefeller Foundation

4070
03:01:32,287 --> 03:01:33,823
To meet the health challenges

4071
03:01:34,079 --> 03:01:34,847
Of an intercom

4072
03:01:35,359 --> 03:01:37,919
Did world isn't a Perfect Analogy terrorism because it's

4073
03:01:39,199 --> 03:01:39,711
People wanted proof

4074
03:01:40,991 --> 03:01:41,759
How many rights do

4075
03:01:42,015 --> 03:01:43,039
Do you give up in order to do

4076
03:01:44,831 --> 03:01:49,183
Neither Joe nor Alex realize this isn't the document that Alex's entire conspiracy

4077
03:01:49,439 --> 03:01:52,255
Because surprise neither of them have actually read it

4078
03:01:52,767 --> 03:01:53,791
Surprisingly

4079
03:01:54,047 --> 03:01:54,559
Has red

4080
03:01:54,815 --> 03:02:00,959
What's going on

4081
03:02:01,215 --> 03:02:02,751
At the end because I think it's great stuff

4082
03:02:03,263 --> 03:02:09,407
I do think there's a productive conversation that could be had about the push-and-pull of personal freedoms and the responsibilities we have

4083
03:02:09,663 --> 03:02:11,455
Have to each other because we live in a world

4084
03:02:11,711 --> 03:02:13,247
Are the population over 1

4085
03:02:15,295 --> 03:02:21,439
People who prioritize individual freedoms could make that could be compelling and the same is true of people who believe that more aboard

4086
03:02:21,695 --> 03:02:22,975
An element is a communities around us

4087
03:02:23,487 --> 03:02:23,999
That's great

4088
03:02:24,511 --> 03:02:29,375
That's a conversation I encourage people to have because outside of the people on the fringes of either side

4089
03:02:29,631 --> 03:02:32,191
There's a lot of people with valuable things to say within that specter

4090
03:02:32,447 --> 03:02:33,471
However

4091
03:02:33,727 --> 03:02:35,775
One of those people is not Alex Jones

4092
03:02:36,287 --> 03:02:37,311
He is a liar and an idiot

4093
03:02:37,823 --> 03:02:41,919
Yeah I wouldn't want to have that conversation with anyone in that room except for maybe Jamie

4094
03:02:42,175 --> 03:02:46,783
And that's only because I don't know anything about him. Covid computer

4095
03:02:47,039 --> 03:02:53,183
At least you could look up the things that you're saying could have a conversation with him maybe

4096
03:02:53,439 --> 03:02:54,207
But only because

4097
03:02:54,463 --> 03:02:57,279
He hasn't disqualified yourself

4098
03:02:57,535 --> 03:03:02,655
So we're Tim saying something like yes

4099
03:03:03,167 --> 03:03:04,959
Why you bring that to this room you

4100
03:03:05,215 --> 03:03:11,359
Go sit around with your friends and talk about other people

4101
03:03:11,615 --> 03:03:12,639
Bulls live Swagger

4102
03:03:13,663 --> 03:03:16,991
Alex Manteca f****** prove lockstep stuff you can do it

4103
03:03:18,015 --> 03:03:18,527
I've got

4104
03:03:20,063 --> 03:03:20,831
Eurasian lockstep.

4105
03:03:22,111 --> 03:03:22,879
Where to bring in this

4106
03:03:23,135 --> 03:03:24,927
Global authoritarian

4107
03:03:25,183 --> 03:03:25,951
And you have to show us

4108
03:03:27,743 --> 03:03:28,511
I'm sitting here in

4109
03:03:28,767 --> 03:03:29,279
Studio

4110
03:03:29,791 --> 03:03:30,559
Talk to you about

4111
03:03:31,071 --> 03:03:31,839
But I understand

4112
03:03:34,399 --> 03:03:36,191
We want to try but you know everybody else watching

4113
03:03:39,263 --> 03:03:41,311
We could have found it right then

4114
03:03:43,359 --> 03:03:44,383
But it might be

4115
03:03:44,895 --> 03:03:45,407
Interpretation

4116
03:03:45,663 --> 03:03:46,687
What they're saying

4117
03:03:46,943 --> 03:03:48,479
So close

4118
03:03:50,271 --> 03:03:51,039
The criticism of trump

4119
03:03:51,807 --> 03:03:55,135
She's blaming all this lockdown Whitmer

4120
03:03:55,391 --> 03:03:56,415
By the Supreme Court

4121
03:03:58,463 --> 03:04:00,511
Who have seized all three branches of government

4122
03:04:01,279 --> 03:04:02,303
Martial law

4123
03:04:03,327 --> 03:04:04,607
Here's what I can understand

4124
03:04:05,375 --> 03:04:10,495
How can Joe Rogan so clearly understand that in the case of the Whitmer quote and most likely in the case of the flocks

4125
03:04:10,751 --> 03:04:13,055
That thing they can't find that Alex has taken something

4126
03:04:13,311 --> 03:04:14,335
Completely out of context

4127
03:04:14,591 --> 03:04:18,175
An interpreted it poorly he can't grasp but that's all Alex does

4128
03:04:18,687 --> 03:04:24,831
How can you be that close I'm not see Alex's act I'm just so surprised right now that I've caught you in this lie because I

4129
03:04:25,087 --> 03:04:25,599
I've never tried

4130
03:04:25,855 --> 03:04:28,415
The catch you before

4131
03:04:28,671 --> 03:04:34,815
Drunk with you always been telling me the truth and now I'm finally pushing back and it seems like you're lying to me yeah

4132
03:04:35,071 --> 03:04:37,631
So strange it's so weird cuz here again

4133
03:04:38,143 --> 03:04:42,239
I'll just cornered with Joe pointing out essentially his entire career sleight-of-hand

4134
03:04:42,495 --> 03:04:45,311
Intuit allowed Alex starts ranting about something unrelated

4135
03:04:45,567 --> 03:04:48,383
They were talking about Alex's interpretation of the Whitmer quote

4136
03:04:48,639 --> 03:04:50,431
He went off about the Michigan Supreme Court

4137
03:04:50,943 --> 03:04:54,271
This is to try to move the conversation into territory he can handle

4138
03:04:54,527 --> 03:04:58,367
Because he's being confronted about his willful misrepresentation or lies

4139
03:04:58,623 --> 03:04:59,391
About news item

4140
03:04:59,647 --> 03:05:01,183
That's not something he can deal with

4141
03:05:01,695 --> 03:05:07,071
Also the Michigan Supreme Court Judge ruled that the executive orders that Whitmer signed and try to extend cannot be extended

4142
03:05:07,583 --> 03:05:12,703
The court decided that the governor and legislature would need to work together to come up with the appropriate measures to deal with covid-19

4143
03:05:12,959 --> 03:05:14,239
Is a little bit shy

4144
03:05:14,751 --> 03:05:18,591
She's grasping all the power troll of Michigan herself

4145
03:05:18,847 --> 03:05:19,615
Yeah

4146
03:05:19,871 --> 03:05:20,383
Little bit different

4147
03:05:20,639 --> 03:05:23,199
Against Epson in his role

4148
03:05:23,455 --> 03:05:24,735
And that is to Tryon

4149
03:05:24,991 --> 03:05:25,503
You like guys

4150
03:05:25,759 --> 03:05:26,527
Close though

4151
03:05:28,319 --> 03:05:29,343
Tell you that quote

4152
03:05:29,599 --> 03:05:30,111
I want to

4153
03:05:30,623 --> 03:05:31,903
When you say if you are sick

4154
03:05:32,159 --> 03:05:32,671
Lockdown

4155
03:05:33,695 --> 03:05:34,463
Not being able to go to church

4156
03:05:34,975 --> 03:05:35,487
Joe Biden

4157
03:05:36,511 --> 03:05:37,791
Agree that is not a huge jump

4158
03:05:40,095 --> 03:05:40,607
But the problem is

4159
03:05:40,863 --> 03:05:41,375
The way

4160
03:05:41,887 --> 03:05:42,399
Being sad

4161
03:05:42,655 --> 03:05:44,191
She was talking about how bad

4162
03:05:44,447 --> 03:05:45,215
Trump handled

4163
03:05:45,471 --> 03:05:45,983
The the

4164
03:05:46,239 --> 03:05:47,007
Rate of infection

4165
03:05:47,263 --> 03:05:47,775
Of course

4166
03:05:48,031 --> 03:05:50,079
And that's on that

4167
03:05:50,335 --> 03:05:51,359
Like Mary Lou Dobbs like

4168
03:05:51,615 --> 03:05:53,663
15 years ago okay

4169
03:05:54,175 --> 03:05:56,223
Here's my response to that

4170
03:05:59,295 --> 03:06:02,367
I think they're in a different setting

4171
03:06:03,135 --> 03:06:05,695
You can see the conversation that's trying to be had

4172
03:06:05,951 --> 03:06:08,511
Yeah I'm at is okay let's look at this quote

4173
03:06:08,767 --> 03:06:09,535
Antsy

4174
03:06:09,791 --> 03:06:15,935
The way that Alex's interpretation you can understand why he's saying that sure it's not necessarily a fair

4175
03:06:16,191 --> 03:06:18,495
Interpretation of what her intention was

4176
03:06:20,031 --> 03:06:21,055
You can see

4177
03:06:21,311 --> 03:06:21,823
The path of this

4178
03:06:22,847 --> 03:06:24,127
Could go down if it wasn't a bunch

4179
03:06:24,383 --> 03:06:26,431
Two Dum Dums who are f***** up yelling

4180
03:06:27,967 --> 03:06:34,111
And Alex didn't have a vested interest in derailing the conversation little bit rambling about Lou Dobbs

4181
03:06:34,367 --> 03:06:36,415
It's just sad if it's point

4182
03:06:36,671 --> 03:06:38,975
Exercise in futility

4183
03:06:39,231 --> 03:06:43,071
And I think if Joe is just trying to do like some

4184
03:06:43,327 --> 03:06:45,887
Some kind of a metal art project where you shows that like

4185
03:06:46,143 --> 03:06:49,727
Talking to these people is not worth it then he succeeded but

4186
03:06:50,751 --> 03:06:52,799
Short of that doesn't failure

4187
03:06:53,311 --> 03:06:55,359
Anyway we get back to lockstep

4188
03:06:55,615 --> 03:06:56,127
And guess what

4189
03:06:56,639 --> 03:06:58,175
Jamie found the right document

4190
03:06:58,687 --> 03:06:59,711
They talk about in lockstep

4191
03:07:00,479 --> 03:07:00,991
Bring in a

4192
03:07:01,247 --> 03:07:02,527
Global authoritarian

4193
03:07:03,039 --> 03:07:05,599
Systematic about riots they talk about war

4194
03:07:05,855 --> 03:07:08,159
If you can find that article

4195
03:07:09,695 --> 03:07:10,463
Something but I don't

4196
03:07:17,631 --> 03:07:20,191
Scenario

4197
03:07:24,543 --> 03:07:25,055
I got 12 this

4198
03:07:29,407 --> 03:07:32,479
They found the right document and now Alex has got to be like

4199
03:07:34,015 --> 03:07:35,039
What because

4200
03:07:35,295 --> 03:07:40,927
He kind of wiggled out of the Yamaha that was a trap

4201
03:07:41,183 --> 03:07:45,535
You got out and then now like the Duke boys out he got cocky because he

4202
03:07:45,791 --> 03:07:51,935
He probably assumed like well James I can find anything else to look for anything else he's already

4203
03:07:52,191 --> 03:07:58,335
There's only one Rockefeller actually brings back up

4204
03:08:03,199 --> 03:08:06,015
And so they they start trying to read it and

4205
03:08:06,527 --> 03:08:08,319
I wish they understood what they were reading

4206
03:08:08,575 --> 03:08:10,111
Quite frankly because it could

4207
03:08:10,367 --> 03:08:12,415
I have actual conversation

4208
03:08:12,671 --> 03:08:13,439
But they do not

4209
03:08:14,463 --> 03:08:17,535
Like 20-25 people seem to be growing weary of so much

4210
03:08:17,791 --> 03:08:19,583
Top-down control and letting l

4211
03:08:19,839 --> 03:08:20,351
Send

4212
03:08:20,607 --> 03:08:21,119
Authorities

4213
03:08:21,375 --> 03:08:21,887
Make choices

4214
03:08:22,143 --> 03:08:22,655
For them

4215
03:08:24,191 --> 03:08:26,239
Whatever net wherever National interest

4216
03:08:26,495 --> 03:08:28,031
Clashed with individual in

4217
03:08:28,287 --> 03:08:29,055
Interested Wisconsin

4218
03:08:29,567 --> 03:08:30,591
Push back

4219
03:08:30,847 --> 03:08:31,359
Becomes

4220
03:08:31,615 --> 03:08:33,407
Increasingly organized and coordinated

4221
03:08:33,663 --> 03:08:34,431
Has this affected

4222
03:08:34,687 --> 03:08:36,735
Could use and people have seen their status number

4223
03:08:36,991 --> 03:08:38,015
Opportunity slip away

4224
03:08:38,271 --> 03:08:39,807
Largely in developing countries

4225
03:08:40,319 --> 03:08:41,599
Incited civil unrest

4226
03:08:42,111 --> 03:08:43,135
By 2026

4227
03:08:43,647 --> 03:08:45,439
Protesters in Nigeria

4228
03:08:45,695 --> 03:08:46,207
Down the government

4229
03:08:46,719 --> 03:08:47,743
Fed up with the

4230
03:08:47,999 --> 03:08:49,535
Entrenched cronyism and Corruption

4231
03:08:50,047 --> 03:08:50,815
Even though

4232
03:08:51,071 --> 03:08:51,583
YouTube like the greater

4233
03:08:51,839 --> 03:08:53,119
Stability and predictability

4234
03:08:53,375 --> 03:08:54,143
Of this world

4235
03:08:54,399 --> 03:08:54,911
Began to grow

4236
03:08:55,167 --> 03:08:55,679
Uncomfortable

4237
03:08:55,935 --> 03:08:58,239
And constrained by so many tight rules

4238
03:08:58,495 --> 03:08:59,007
And by the

4239
03:08:59,263 --> 03:09:00,031
Strictness of Nash

4240
03:09:00,287 --> 03:09:00,799
No Boundaries

4241
03:09:01,311 --> 03:09:02,335
The feeling lingard

4242
03:09:02,847 --> 03:09:05,663
But sooner or later something will inevitably upset

4243
03:09:05,919 --> 03:09:06,687
Bendy order

4244
03:09:07,199 --> 03:09:08,223
That the world's governments

4245
03:09:08,479 --> 03:09:09,247
Could work so hard to us

4246
03:09:09,503 --> 03:09:12,831
Establish okay I never read that but that's the other stuff

4247
03:09:13,087 --> 03:09:13,599
Spouses

4248
03:09:14,879 --> 03:09:16,671
To be clear the Rockefeller report

4249
03:09:16,927 --> 03:09:19,231
Scenarios for the future of technology and International

4250
03:09:19,487 --> 03:09:20,767
Kendall development is not thousands

4251
03:09:21,023 --> 03:09:21,791
How many pages

4252
03:09:22,047 --> 03:09:28,191
54 step that scenario is actually on the eight pages

4253
03:09:28,447 --> 03:09:34,591
No idea what is Grand lockstep conspiracy is based on and exactly what it's based on

4254
03:09:34,847 --> 03:09:38,431
She's never read the thing of the document super-long Zaki possibly know all of it

4255
03:09:38,943 --> 03:09:44,319
This is shameful s*** and honestly if Joe or Jamie understood the document they were reading or Alex's

4256
03:09:44,575 --> 03:09:45,343
Narratives around it

4257
03:09:45,599 --> 03:09:51,743
All the tools they would need to fully expose out to charade for Millions to see on their show

4258
03:09:51,999 --> 03:09:53,023
This would be a

4259
03:09:53,279 --> 03:09:54,559
Bubble puncturing moment

4260
03:09:55,071 --> 03:09:57,887
Like if they knew what they were had in their hands

4261
03:09:59,167 --> 03:09:59,679
That is

4262
03:09:59,935 --> 03:10:01,471
That is a real bummer

4263
03:10:01,727 --> 03:10:04,287
So Alex knows kind of I mean he has to know that like

4264
03:10:04,543 --> 03:10:07,871
I'm in trouble

4265
03:10:10,687 --> 03:10:11,967
Okay talk about global police

4266
03:10:12,223 --> 03:10:13,759
Police state and worldwide riots

4267
03:10:14,015 --> 03:10:20,159
I mean we're not that far away there's the writing it almost like

4268
03:10:21,695 --> 03:10:23,487
It's stuff like that

4269
03:10:23,743 --> 03:10:25,279
I don't seen that part it's

4270
03:10:25,535 --> 03:10:26,303
Says stuff like

4271
03:10:26,815 --> 03:10:29,887
Yes I do know what I honestly get the vibe of like I can't

4272
03:10:30,143 --> 03:10:32,447
I obviously can't prove this. I don't know but

4273
03:10:32,703 --> 03:10:34,239
It has the feeling of like

4274
03:10:35,263 --> 03:10:41,407
I think Tim recognizes that Alex is caught too and he's trying to save it does feel like that

4275
03:10:41,663 --> 03:10:44,223
Just be like Tim is making every possible excuse like

4276
03:10:44,735 --> 03:10:50,879
Know what he's actually I understand where you're coming from and I think that's a really good point that you

4277
03:10:51,135 --> 03:10:54,719
Held his feet to the fire instead of him saying the thing that he said

4278
03:10:54,975 --> 03:10:58,559
He said this thing would you more likely agree with

4279
03:10:59,071 --> 03:11:05,215
Seeming to indicate that this source that Alex is facing a conspiracy on his nothing like what he has described it as it was actually

4280
03:11:05,471 --> 03:11:08,287
Completely different but isn't it closed

4281
03:11:08,543 --> 03:11:09,823
What if I

4282
03:11:10,079 --> 03:11:10,847
Moved

4283
03:11:11,359 --> 03:11:17,503
These goalposts over here to a completely different spot in a different universe

4284
03:11:20,319 --> 03:11:23,135
It's very very Christ

4285
03:11:23,647 --> 03:11:28,255
So Alex he's up on the screen of the screen where Jamie project

4286
03:11:28,511 --> 03:11:34,143
The computer screen

4287
03:11:34,399 --> 03:11:35,167
And he thinks

4288
03:11:36,191 --> 03:11:40,543
Videos found the right word no miss lockstep talking to Alex

4289
03:11:40,799 --> 03:11:46,943
That he actually has already said I haven't seen there's a bike but now he sees the right word

4290
03:11:47,967 --> 03:11:48,735

We're not going to control the pandemic you don't

4312
03:12:36,351 --> 03:12:37,119
You get used to it

03:12:37,375 --> 03:12:38,143
You get over it

4314
03:12:38,655 --> 03:12:39,679

Hit another talking point Move Along

4322
03:12:54,015 --> 03:12:57,087
Yeah now we have successfully moved on

4323
03:12:57,599 --> 03:13:00,159
And we can ignore the fact that you're

4324
03:13:00,671 --> 03:13:03,231
Complete lockstep b******* fell apart

4325
03:13:03,487 --> 03:13:05,023
Upon analysis

4326
03:13:05,535 --> 03:13:06,303
It it's just

4327
03:13:06,559 --> 03:13:09,119
Just jumped the General Lee over it again

4328
03:13:09,375 --> 03:13:15,519
Yeah I don't understand how you could be Joe Rogan be sober go through that and then move along to something else

4329
03:13:15,775 --> 03:13:16,287
I'll be like

4330
03:13:16,543 --> 03:13:17,055
That was

4331
03:13:17,567 --> 03:13:18,335
You just got

4332
03:13:18,591 --> 03:13:20,127
Destroyed yep

4333
03:13:20,383 --> 03:13:22,687
Your boat is sinking man

4334
03:13:22,943 --> 03:13:25,759
You just you have this giant conspiracy about the globalist

4335
03:13:26,015 --> 03:13:32,159
Call operation lockstep it's been in plans for 10 years and we pull up the document that you're like

4336
03:13:33,951 --> 03:13:36,767
IL Ira does it

4337
03:13:37,279 --> 03:13:38,303
So it's so

4338
03:13:38,559 --> 03:13:39,583
You're exposed

4339
03:13:39,839 --> 03:13:45,983
Alex Alex has officially made it so that he only gets two small air holes in his butt

4340
03:13:46,239 --> 03:13:49,055
Know if he continues. How many more Clips do we have

4341
03:13:50,847 --> 03:13:56,991
He's going to wind up with no air holes I hope not I'm telling you right now if he keeps going like this there going to be 08

4342
03:13:57,247 --> 03:13:58,271
Salvage at least 10K

4343
03:13:59,807 --> 03:14:01,855
We we transition

4344
03:14:02,111 --> 03:14:04,927
From bad to just being like

4345
03:14:09,023 --> 03:14:09,535
Can be done

4346
03:14:10,047 --> 03:14:11,327
Man all I know is I tried

4347
03:14:13,631 --> 03:14:14,143
Sitting here

4348
03:14:15,679 --> 03:14:16,191
Where are we

4349
03:14:17,727 --> 03:14:18,239
I gave that one

4350
03:14:20,031 --> 03:14:20,543
Worrying

4351
03:14:28,735 --> 03:14:29,247
All these

4352
03:14:30,015 --> 03:14:32,575
That's not what the Wall Street Journal articles about you just going based on

4353
03:14:32,831 --> 03:14:36,415
I would like to read a quote from that and see if it

4354
03:14:36,671 --> 03:14:40,511
It says what Alex lockstep treatment

4355
03:14:40,767 --> 03:14:42,815
So at this point the show descendants

4356
03:14:43,071 --> 03:14:48,703
Really boring stretch where Joe tells Alex about his feelings about UFOs and Alex does his best not to interrupt

4357
03:14:49,215 --> 03:14:49,727
And drink Saban

4358
03:14:50,239 --> 03:14:55,359
It's fine but I'm not particularly interested in Joe talked about aliens to Alex's barely paying attention

4359
03:14:55,615 --> 03:14:58,175
Honestly might as well not be there

4360
03:15:00,735 --> 03:15:01,503
Alex says this

4361
03:15:02,527 --> 03:15:03,551
Where little bit beyond juice

4362
03:15:04,319 --> 03:15:04,831
Clearly we're from

4363
03:15:05,343 --> 03:15:06,111
Outside the planet

4364
03:15:07,391 --> 03:15:07,903
Bigger going

4365
03:15:08,927 --> 03:15:09,439
Does life-forms have

4366
03:15:09,951 --> 03:15:10,463
4

4367
03:15:11,231 --> 03:15:11,743
Forecast

4368
03:15:13,279 --> 03:15:13,791
Just say a word

4369
03:15:14,047 --> 03:15:15,071
Stapes

4370
03:15:15,327 --> 03:15:16,095
What I mean by we

4371
03:15:17,119 --> 03:15:17,631
Is that income

4372
03:15:17,887 --> 03:15:18,399
Comparison

4373
03:15:18,655 --> 03:15:19,423
We could be eventually

4374
03:15:19,679 --> 03:15:20,191
Police Revolution

4375
03:15:24,287 --> 03:15:24,799
Look where a lot

4376
03:15:25,055 --> 03:15:25,567
Not smarter than

4377
03:15:26,079 --> 03:15:27,871
Sprite and regular tape store in system

4378
03:15:28,383 --> 03:15:29,151
In the zoo

4379
03:15:29,407 --> 03:15:30,175
Oh boy

4380
03:15:30,431 --> 03:15:31,711
This is this is where it's like

4381
03:15:31,967 --> 03:15:32,479
Alright

4382
03:15:32,735 --> 03:15:34,783
There's not nothing good is coming

4383
03:15:35,039 --> 03:15:36,319
Okay so

4384
03:15:36,575 --> 03:15:37,087
His

4385
03:15:37,343 --> 03:15:39,903
Bible includes humans not being from

4386
03:15:40,415 --> 03:15:44,255
Well there's prequels we just haven't found that could be

4387
03:15:44,511 --> 03:15:47,839
Joe is trying to explain to Alex

4388
03:15:48,095 --> 03:15:49,375
That you know his

4389
03:15:49,631 --> 03:15:51,167
His view of things involved

4390
03:15:51,679 --> 03:15:52,447
Humans

4391
03:15:52,703 --> 03:15:55,519
Just being monkeys that have evolved

4392
03:15:55,775 --> 03:15:57,311
Through our ability to manipulate

4393
03:15:57,567 --> 03:16:02,687
Technology door there's possibilities that we could find ways that we could Elevate ourselves even higher

4394
03:16:02,943 --> 03:16:03,455
IND

4395
03:16:03,711 --> 03:16:04,223
As he says

4396
03:16:04,479 --> 03:16:06,015
Free ourselves from our monkey

4397
03:16:06,271 --> 03:16:06,783
Peabody's

4398
03:16:07,807 --> 03:16:09,855
Alex should throw something at

4399
03:16:11,903 --> 03:16:13,183
You're sitting there saying this will

4400
03:16:13,439 --> 03:16:13,951
Frias

4401
03:16:14,463 --> 03:16:15,743
Walmart problems

4402
03:16:15,999 --> 03:16:18,047
But still humans it programming Nexus

4403
03:16:19,839 --> 03:16:20,607
Amplify

4404
03:16:20,863 --> 03:16:22,911
The problems that we worry about

4405
03:16:23,167 --> 03:16:23,935
It certainly could

4406
03:16:24,191 --> 03:16:25,215
Look you could go side

4407
03:16:25,727 --> 03:16:26,495
It could all go bad

4408
03:16:27,007 --> 03:16:28,031
But it also could

4409
03:16:28,287 --> 03:16:29,055
Could go to a point where

4410
03:16:29,311 --> 03:16:30,591
People don't seals indeed

4411
03:16:30,847 --> 03:16:31,359
Need to do that

4412
03:16:32,127 --> 03:16:32,895
And that we wreck

4413
03:16:33,151 --> 03:16:34,687
Is that a lot of what we have

4414
03:16:35,455 --> 03:16:35,967
We are asked

4415
03:16:36,735 --> 03:16:38,527
The shackles of our Monkey Ball is worth

4416
03:16:39,295 --> 03:16:39,807
Monkey bodies

4417
03:16:40,063 --> 03:16:42,623
Call Amma demon

4418
03:16:42,879 --> 03:16:49,023
Yep you're trying to merge with measuring exactly

4419
03:16:49,279 --> 03:16:51,583
Slippery slope trying to get rid of your monkey body

4420
03:17:02,079 --> 03:17:05,663
This is just like this section of the show is really kind of

4421
03:17:05,919 --> 03:17:09,247
What I would describe is Joe trying to have a trait conversation

4422
03:17:09,759 --> 03:17:10,271
With a

4423
03:17:10,527 --> 03:17:11,551
Uncooperative

4424
03:17:12,063 --> 03:17:14,623
Barely paying attention scene partner

4425
03:17:14,879 --> 03:17:17,183
Not interesting at all I don't get

4426
03:17:17,439 --> 03:17:18,463
Why you would think

4427
03:17:18,719 --> 03:17:19,231
That

4428
03:17:19,487 --> 03:17:19,999
Like they

4429
03:17:20,255 --> 03:17:22,303
They still persist in this idea of Alec

4430
03:17:22,559 --> 03:17:23,839
Alex being a manly man

4431
03:17:24,095 --> 03:17:25,887
And I'm having some kind of chauvinist like

4432
03:17:26,143 --> 03:17:29,983
Elevated toxic masculinity but that mascots good thing

4433
03:17:30,239 --> 03:17:30,751
You know

4434
03:17:31,007 --> 03:17:32,031
But at the same time

4435
03:17:32,287 --> 03:17:32,799
He's

4436
03:17:33,055 --> 03:17:34,079
Waffled on everything

4437
03:17:34,591 --> 03:17:35,871
He's hidden from everything

4438
03:17:36,383 --> 03:17:37,663
He interrupts you with

4439
03:17:37,919 --> 03:17:38,687
Diverge

4440
03:17:39,199 --> 03:17:40,735
This is a man who is

4441
03:17:40,991 --> 03:17:47,135
Completely incapable of acting like anything that you would consider a stereotypical

4442
03:17:47,391 --> 03:17:47,903
Male trait

4443
03:17:48,159 --> 03:17:51,487
If you will he lacks the assertiveness

4444
03:17:51,743 --> 03:17:53,279
Sore certainty yodeling

4445
03:17:54,303 --> 03:17:55,071
Conviction

4446
03:17:55,583 --> 03:17:57,119
Andy's looking Joe's boot

4447
03:17:57,887 --> 03:18:00,191
Navigate work

4448
03:18:01,471 --> 03:18:04,287
Dissection words are kind of like a dumb conversation

4449
03:18:04,543 --> 03:18:08,127
Joe does ask Alex what he thinks aliens are

4450
03:18:09,151 --> 03:18:09,663
What do you think

4451
03:18:11,967 --> 03:18:12,479
Murder Hornets

4452
03:18:14,015 --> 03:18:16,319
There are all sorts of interdimensional force

4453
03:18:18,367 --> 03:18:19,391
Killers like bad alien

4454
03:18:20,671 --> 03:18:21,183
Manipulator

4455
03:18:21,439 --> 03:18:21,951
Development

4456
03:18:22,463 --> 03:18:22,975
Gretchen Whitmer

4457
03:18:23,231 --> 03:18:25,023
Level

4458
03:18:25,535 --> 03:18:27,839
High-level would not try to manipulate our development

4459
03:18:29,119 --> 03:18:30,399
Right okay so

4460
03:18:30,655 --> 03:18:32,191
SoJO is like imprinting

4461
03:18:32,703 --> 03:18:33,471
Demon says he loves

4462
03:18:36,799 --> 03:18:38,335
It's all I'm saying is if we need to

4463
03:18:38,591 --> 03:18:39,103
2 billboards

4464
03:18:41,151 --> 03:18:43,711
What do you think about what do you think about myself

4465
03:18:44,223 --> 03:18:44,735
On the election

4466
03:18:44,991 --> 03:18:51,135
Publix

4467
03:18:51,391 --> 03:18:56,511
What you're drunk come on

4468
03:18:56,767 --> 03:19:01,887
What I want you're going to smoke weed with me what do you think about I will I will definitely

4469
03:19:02,143 --> 03:19:03,679
What do you think I'll pray.

4470
03:19:03,935 --> 03:19:09,823
They are out of the question was what do you think aliens are whole

4471
03:19:10,591 --> 03:19:15,967
Call Jordan you might want to give him back another airhole Maybe

4472
03:19:16,223 --> 03:19:16,991
Because I'm like

4473
03:19:17,247 --> 03:19:18,015
Ponce de Leon

4474
03:19:18,271 --> 03:19:21,087
Claimed to have found the Fountain of Youth

4475
03:19:21,343 --> 03:19:24,159

As long as we keep having kids I have kids we live forever

4493
03:20:00,255 --> 03:20:00,767
That's us

So if your kids are immortal

4496
03:20:07,167 --> 03:20:09,471
That sounds great

4497
03:20:09,727 --> 03:20:11,263
Good work dude so I think

4498
03:20:11,775 --> 03:20:13,055

03:20:14,335 --> 03:20:15,103
Joe hear that

4500
03:20:18,431 --> 03:20:19,711
Before this goes any further off the rails

4501
03:20:20,991 --> 03:20:22,783
Who's on it all you want to end this transmission

4502
03:20:23,039 --> 03:20:23,551

No Alex really wants

4507
03:20:31,743 --> 03:20:33,279
To break records

4508
03:20:33,535 --> 03:20:34,815
Break Elon Musk

4509
03:20:35,071 --> 03:20:39,423
Traffic record he wants to break his own record

4510
03:20:39,679 --> 03:20:41,727

This is an epic pod

03:20:47,103 --> 03:20:47,871
Another hour

4516
03:20:48,127 --> 03:20:52,479
It is bigger

4517
03:20:53,247 --> 03:20:54,527
Then the Elon Musk

A good man

4533
03:21:46,751 --> 03:21:51,103
We're good no other two hours

4534
03:21:55,199 --> 03:21:55,711
Yeah

4535
03:21:57,247 --> 03:21:58,271
Alabama basketball

4536
03:21:58,783 --> 03:21:59,551
Do not come on then

4537
03:22:00,063 --> 03:22:01,087
I'm available later

4538
03:22:01,343 --> 03:22:02,367
Is there anything else you really

4539
03:22:02,623 --> 03:22:03,135
You want to discuss

4540
03:22:03,647 --> 03:22:04,159
No I mean

4541
03:22:04,671 --> 03:22:06,463
I'm glad the Jamie take no for an answer

4542
03:22:08,255 --> 03:22:09,279
I'm really good at it

4543
03:22:09,535 --> 03:22:10,303
He's better than

4544
03:22:12,095 --> 03:22:15,679
I'm really good at searching for things better

4545
03:22:15,935 --> 03:22:18,495
Alex does his his normal thing

4546
03:22:18,751 --> 03:22:19,519
King of like

4547
03:22:22,591 --> 03:22:23,359
Desmos

4548
03:22:23,871 --> 03:22:26,431
Is the most important

4549
03:22:27,199 --> 03:22:29,759
So then he goes anti-vax on

4550
03:22:30,015 --> 03:22:30,527
About

4551
03:22:31,039 --> 03:22:32,831
Been on the news that hundred percent of people

4552
03:22:34,367 --> 03:22:34,879
20%

4553
03:22:36,671 --> 03:22:37,183
Hospital

4554
03:22:37,951 --> 03:22:38,463
And so

4555
03:22:38,719 --> 03:22:39,487
They also have backs

4556
03:22:40,767 --> 03:22:41,279
Major

4557
03:22:42,815 --> 03:22:43,327
You can type it in

4558
03:22:43,583 --> 03:22:44,351
But let me pause worth

4559
03:22:45,631 --> 03:22:46,143
MRNA

4560
03:22:47,167 --> 03:22:48,447
You said a hundred percent of them

4561
03:22:52,287 --> 03:22:53,055
That they have to study

4562
03:22:54,335 --> 03:22:55,871
He wants to 100% got sick

4563
03:22:56,383 --> 03:22:57,407
Percent with Hospital understand

4564
03:23:02,783 --> 03:23:03,295
Jameson find

4565
03:23:03,807 --> 03:23:04,831
Bill Gates

4566
03:23:05,087 --> 03:23:05,599
Grilled

4567
03:23:06,111 --> 03:23:06,623
Over

4568
03:23:06,879 --> 03:23:07,391
Over vaccine

4569
03:23:09,695 --> 03:23:10,719
The point is they admit

4570
03:23:11,231 --> 03:23:11,743
Tabaxi

4571
03:23:15,071 --> 03:23:16,095
Keep moving forward

4572
03:23:16,351 --> 03:23:18,655
We don't get that we want a citation on this

4573
03:23:19,423 --> 03:23:21,471
Are we going

4574
03:23:21,983 --> 03:23:23,519
I just went out the window

4575
03:23:25,823 --> 03:23:28,895
How old is Erick Rowan

4576
03:23:29,151 --> 03:23:29,919
Mysterious

4577
03:23:30,175 --> 03:23:34,527
So they are talking about vaccines dangers and

4578
03:23:35,551 --> 03:23:36,831
Alex brings up

4579
03:23:37,087 --> 03:23:37,599
That like

4580
03:23:38,111 --> 03:23:41,183
There's polio that's caused by polio vaccine

4581
03:23:41,695 --> 03:23:47,071
I meant Joe Google's or Jamie does and they're shocked to find out that

4582
03:23:47,583 --> 03:23:49,375
UNC

4583
03:23:49,631 --> 03:23:51,167
New polio outbreak

4584
03:23:51,935 --> 03:23:53,471
Too damn was caused by Oral vaccine

4585
03:23:56,287 --> 03:23:58,079
Well you polio outbreak

4586
03:23:58,591 --> 03:23:59,103
Sudan is

4587
03:23:59,359 --> 03:24:00,127
Is caused by

4588
03:24:00,895 --> 03:24:01,407
Oral vac

4589
03:24:02,687 --> 03:24:03,199
Do you like kids

4590
03:24:04,223 --> 03:24:04,991
Oh my God is that

4591
03:24:05,247 --> 03:24:06,015
Terrifying image

4592
03:24:06,783 --> 03:24:07,295
The image of them

4593
03:24:07,551 --> 03:24:08,319
Distributing that looks like

4594
03:24:08,575 --> 03:24:09,343
Poor kids face

4595
03:24:09,855 --> 03:24:11,391
Imagine that kid getting polio

4596
03:24:11,647 --> 03:24:12,159
From that back

4597
03:24:12,927 --> 03:24:13,951
You look so terrified

4598
03:24:14,975 --> 03:24:15,743
Oh my God

4599
03:24:19,327 --> 03:24:23,679
This is Joe reading a headline that seems to validate Alex's anti-vax narrative

4600
03:24:23,935 --> 03:24:27,007
Only does so if you don't understand the context of what's being discussed

4601
03:24:27,775 --> 03:24:33,919
In the past but when they say there are vaccine-derived cases of polio they aren't saying that someone got the pill

4602
03:24:34,175 --> 03:24:35,711
Polio vaccine a gave them polio

4603
03:24:36,223 --> 03:24:38,271
That's how it sounds mean something

4604
03:24:39,039 --> 03:24:42,623
This generally refers to a phenomenon that occurs in under vaccinated community

4605
03:24:43,391 --> 03:24:49,023
If you get this vaccine that's derived from a live virus you may have a small chance of spreading that virus even though it's

4606
03:24:49,279 --> 03:24:52,095
Weekend and it won't get people sick or is badly sick

4607
03:24:52,607 --> 03:24:57,983
If everyone around you is vaccinated it's no big deal since they'll all be protected from the virus until just fizzle out

4608
03:24:59,007 --> 03:25:05,151
Problem comes in when there's a high percentage of unvaccinated in the community because these people can just pass the virus

4609
03:25:05,407 --> 03:25:08,479
Back and forth among each other and the longer the virus has to replicate

4610
03:25:08,735 --> 03:25:11,551
The higher the chance it could mutate into a version of The L Mystic

4611
03:25:11,807 --> 03:25:13,343
Really hurt people and get them sick

4612
03:25:14,111 --> 03:25:17,695
The conversation about vaccine-derived illness is actually one that support

4613
03:25:17,951 --> 03:25:19,487
What's the community immunization

4614
03:25:19,743 --> 03:25:23,327
But the words are easy to confuse if you just read something out of context like a headlight

4615
03:25:23,839 --> 03:25:29,983
For someone like Joe who's been hitting behold maybe this is out of context drum this whole episode you think baby and ask himself

4616
03:25:30,239 --> 03:25:31,519
What this headline he's reading means

4617
03:25:31,775 --> 03:25:32,287
Joe

4618
03:25:32,799 --> 03:25:33,567
Ya Coulda

4619
03:25:34,079 --> 03:25:34,591
Ended

4620
03:25:35,359 --> 03:25:35,871
Shut up

4621
03:25:36,383 --> 03:25:37,407
Shoulda ended.

4622
03:25:38,175 --> 03:25:39,455
So now Alex has

4623
03:25:39,711 --> 03:25:45,599
Seemingly wunjo over with the dangers of vaccine look at how it look at how awful that kid looks

4624
03:25:45,855 --> 03:25:47,903
That's such an emotional image

4625
03:25:48,159 --> 03:25:49,183
If it's an emotional m

4626
03:25:50,975 --> 03:25:53,535
So here's where it gets like really sad

4627
03:25:53,791 --> 03:25:56,095
Now I think I was feels like he has a win

4628
03:25:56,351 --> 03:26:01,215
I need to know the bad taste of that lockstep embarrassment is out of his mouth until now

4629
03:26:01,727 --> 03:26:02,495
Now we got a

4630
03:26:02,751 --> 03:26:03,775
Swing for the fences

4631
03:26:04,799 --> 03:26:05,311
I wish

4632
03:26:08,639 --> 03:26:09,663
I like to retire that she

4633
03:26:10,687 --> 03:26:11,455
To finish up my work

4634
03:26:12,223 --> 03:26:12,735
Mistakes I made

4635
03:26:13,759 --> 03:26:14,271
Other stuff

4636
03:26:14,527 --> 03:26:20,671
It's going to take more than a year to clean up the mistakes you tonight if you

4637
03:26:21,695 --> 03:26:22,463
At least

4638
03:26:22,719 --> 03:26:24,511
Alex's is like

4639
03:26:26,815 --> 03:26:27,583
This works at much

4640
03:26:34,495 --> 03:26:35,007
Stressed out

4641
03:26:35,263 --> 03:26:35,775
I know you are

4642
03:26:37,055 --> 03:26:37,567
I literally do this

4643
03:26:37,823 --> 03:26:38,591
Wisconsin

4644
03:26:38,847 --> 03:26:43,711
We thought

4645
03:26:43,967 --> 03:26:44,991
I'm not a victim

4646
03:26:46,783 --> 03:26:47,807
So I can't do this

4647
03:26:49,087 --> 03:26:50,879
And I want everybody to know I love my crew I told

4648
03:26:53,439 --> 03:26:54,207
Tell the truth

4649
03:26:54,463 --> 03:26:54,975
Get out the next

4650
03:26:55,487 --> 03:26:57,023
Does mean I won't go on your show on Sierra

4651
03:27:00,095 --> 03:27:00,863
Are you going to lie I try.

4652
03:27:04,703 --> 03:27:05,983
Go to a psychiatrist

4653
03:27:06,495 --> 03:27:08,031
This all makes me really sad

4654
03:27:08,799 --> 03:27:12,639
Like the ending the show Alex's drank half a bottle of whiskey

4655
03:27:12,895 --> 03:27:13,407
Amanda

4656
03:27:13,663 --> 03:27:14,687
Dewey tried to end it

4657
03:27:14,943 --> 03:27:19,807
It didn't work and now we're talking about Alec needing to get in shape

4658
03:27:20,063 --> 03:27:22,111
Going to die

4659
03:27:22,367 --> 03:27:24,671
Living the way he does on his show

4660
03:27:26,207 --> 03:27:26,719
This ism

4661
03:27:27,487 --> 03:27:29,023
Comfortable

4662
03:27:29,535 --> 03:27:32,607
Shoulda ended the show and then we get this

4663
03:27:32,863 --> 03:27:35,679
Joe has a revelation but Alex

4664
03:27:35,935 --> 03:27:36,959
Does not want to talk about

4665
03:27:37,215 --> 03:27:38,751
But it actually makes things make

4666
03:27:39,007 --> 03:27:39,519
A bit more

4667
03:27:42,079 --> 03:27:44,127
Talk to me about adderal

4668
03:27:50,783 --> 03:27:52,319
Well I'm not going to get any of that type of stuff

4669
03:27:53,087 --> 03:27:53,599
The point is it

4670
03:27:54,879 --> 03:27:55,391
Is the doctors play

4671
03:27:57,183 --> 03:27:57,695
The whole country

4672
03:27:59,231 --> 03:28:00,767
That makes a lot of sense

4673
03:28:01,023 --> 03:28:02,815
If you look at a lot of the

4674
03:28:03,071 --> 03:28:04,607
Behaviors that Alex manifest

4675
03:28:05,375 --> 03:28:06,911
The idea that he's abusing

4676
03:28:07,167 --> 03:28:08,191
Adderal

4677
03:28:08,447 --> 03:28:09,983
Or some kind of other stimulant

4678
03:28:10,239 --> 03:28:13,055
I mean it just a checks off a lot of boxes

4679
03:28:13,311 --> 03:28:16,383
I would never like speculate about that and I think it's

4680
03:28:16,639 --> 03:28:18,431
It's gotten a little bit weird

4681
03:28:19,967 --> 03:28:22,527
Leaving it might be a little bit across the line but

4682
03:28:23,039 --> 03:28:28,159
I need something Joe brought up and I honestly do agree with Joe that it is something that would be good

4683
03:28:28,415 --> 03:28:29,695
Talk about

4684
03:28:29,951 --> 03:28:32,767
A lot of people who have had trouble

4685
03:28:35,327 --> 03:28:36,607
Yeah I think that

4686
03:28:36,863 --> 03:28:38,655
Stimulant abuse might be very

4687
03:28:38,911 --> 03:28:42,495
It would make a lot of sense for how drastically it shows change

4688
03:28:42,751 --> 03:28:45,055
Over the couple of years like

4689
03:28:45,311 --> 03:28:45,823
Not

4690
03:28:46,335 --> 03:28:48,127
I mean there's there's

4691
03:28:48,639 --> 03:28:52,991
There's the influences that are sort of intellectual that are like these Insidious influences of

4692
03:28:53,247 --> 03:28:54,271
Steve pieczenik

4693
03:28:54,527 --> 03:28:56,831
Rodger Stone in a bunch of these weirdos and

4694
03:28:57,343 --> 03:29:00,159
Recognizing that Trump is an opportunity

4695
03:29:00,415 --> 03:29:03,487
I also probably not thinking the Trump is going to win and take you could

4696
03:29:03,743 --> 03:29:05,023
Ron Paul

4697
03:29:05,279 --> 03:29:09,119
Right right right I'll put a lot of the behavioral stuff really does

4698
03:29:09,375 --> 03:29:09,887
Does

4699
03:29:10,143 --> 03:29:12,703
CertiFit what you might expect with that Adderall abuse

4700
03:29:13,215 --> 03:29:14,239
And I mean

4701
03:29:14,751 --> 03:29:17,055
Jose talking about it that is a past thing

4702
03:29:17,311 --> 03:29:18,847
I should hope that I hope that.

4703
03:29:19,103 --> 03:29:20,127
Is the case

4704
03:29:21,407 --> 03:29:22,175
It's just a bummer

4705
03:29:22,687 --> 03:29:23,967
It's only drinks

4706
03:29:24,223 --> 03:29:25,759
Because he has to work so hard sure

4707
03:29:26,015 --> 03:29:26,527
But I'm not

4708
03:29:26,783 --> 03:29:27,295
I do caffeine

4709
03:29:32,671 --> 03:29:33,695
It gets the point where like

4710
03:29:34,207 --> 03:29:34,719
Exhausted

4711
03:29:39,071 --> 03:29:39,583
Sober October

4712
03:29:40,095 --> 03:29:40,607
Last October

4713
03:29:41,631 --> 03:29:42,143
Yeah

4714
03:29:43,423 --> 03:29:43,935
Do you think you

4715
03:29:45,983 --> 03:29:46,495
Totally

4716
03:29:47,263 --> 03:29:47,775
Rejected for

4717
03:29:48,799 --> 03:29:50,847
Do you think about if I wasn't doing a show ever

4718
03:29:51,103 --> 03:29:51,615
Everyday

4719
03:29:52,639 --> 03:29:53,151
I'm Alexander

4720
03:29:53,407 --> 03:29:53,919
Irene

4721
03:29:55,711 --> 03:29:56,479
50 article

4722
03:29:58,015 --> 03:29:59,551
500

4723
03:30:01,599 --> 03:30:02,111
Enslaving me

4724
03:30:05,439 --> 03:30:06,207
I don't want me around

4725
03:30:07,231 --> 03:30:07,999
It's not like I'm a scared of

4726
03:30:09,279 --> 03:30:09,791
Something else

4727
03:30:10,047 --> 03:30:11,071
B negative has NATO

4728
03:30:11,839 --> 03:30:12,351
Your help

4729
03:30:12,607 --> 03:30:13,375
Yasso

4730
03:30:13,887 --> 03:30:14,399
For me

4731
03:30:15,679 --> 03:30:16,191
Get away from all of us

4732
03:30:17,215 --> 03:30:17,727
What do you want to do

4733
03:30:21,823 --> 03:30:22,335
Relaxing

4734
03:30:24,639 --> 03:30:25,151
I love metal

4735
03:30:29,247 --> 03:30:30,015
What the f***

4736
03:30:30,271 --> 03:30:30,783
Is happening

4737
03:30:32,063 --> 03:30:32,831
This is just a

4738
03:30:33,087 --> 03:30:34,623
This is you do not

4739
03:30:34,879 --> 03:30:36,671
Get to do that no

4740
03:30:36,927 --> 03:30:43,071
You spent the last 30 years destroying the f****** world you don't get to just require different tire to a f***

4741
03:30:43,327 --> 03:30:49,471
Life of hunting and fishing and oil paintings of fuckyourself Hitler does not get to become a painter afterwards

4742
03:30:49,727 --> 03:30:54,591
Hitler just not I mean George W bush should be in the f****** haggai don't understand why he's allowed to paint

4743
03:30:55,103 --> 03:31:01,247
Alright f****** yeah it's just want to I just want to make sculptures of mother

4744
03:31:02,271 --> 03:31:02,783
Metal skull

4745
03:31:04,575 --> 03:31:07,647
I think that over the course of this episode is awesome

4746
03:31:07,903 --> 03:31:10,207
Really interesting attempt on Jose part 2

4747
03:31:10,463 --> 03:31:16,607
Call for citations you things entirely

4748
03:31:16,863 --> 03:31:17,375
Bottle of whiskey

4749
03:31:17,631 --> 03:31:19,167
I don't mean to discredit

4750
03:31:19,423 --> 03:31:20,447
He should be way drunk

4751
03:31:21,215 --> 03:31:22,239
A drink a lot

4752
03:31:22,495 --> 03:31:23,775
Have a bottle is a chunk

4753
03:31:24,031 --> 03:31:30,175
I usually don't want cookie usually don't walk after half

4754
03:31:30,431 --> 03:31:32,991
Sit around

4755
03:31:33,247 --> 03:31:35,295
He's a drinker drinker

4756
03:31:37,087 --> 03:31:38,623
Given given the

4757
03:31:39,647 --> 03:31:41,183
But then

4758
03:31:41,439 --> 03:31:42,207
I really think

4759
03:31:42,463 --> 03:31:45,791
The you can't use Bill Maher as an example

4760
03:31:46,047 --> 03:31:46,559
Step thing

4761
03:31:46,815 --> 03:31:51,679
Our complete puncturing of the illusion that Alex knows what he's talkin about or that he doesn't

4762
03:31:52,447 --> 03:31:56,031
Then at the end you getting really sad saying he wants to quit

4763
03:31:56,543 --> 03:31:58,335
Jose talking about like him being

4764
03:31:58,591 --> 03:32:00,895
Secretly taking adderal

4765
03:32:01,919 --> 03:32:04,991
And also I drink because I work too hard

4766
03:32:05,247 --> 03:32:07,295
I want to quit in like maybe hunt

4767
03:32:07,807 --> 03:32:08,319
And fish

4768
03:32:08,575 --> 03:32:09,087
Go fuc

4769
03:32:10,879 --> 03:32:11,647
It's very

4770
03:32:11,903 --> 03:32:13,695
Not great as a whole I think

4771
03:32:14,207 --> 03:32:15,743
Alex comes off very poorly

4772
03:32:15,999 --> 03:32:17,023
Yeah Joe Disick

4773
03:32:18,047 --> 03:32:18,815
But I appreciate you being here

4774
03:32:20,351 --> 03:32:21,375
This is a great way

4775
03:32:21,631 --> 03:32:23,167
Alex

4776
03:32:23,423 --> 03:32:24,447
See a side of you that

4777
03:32:25,215 --> 03:32:25,727
The movie Vendetta

4778
03:32:25,983 --> 03:32:26,495
And see the other two

4779
03:32:27,775 --> 03:32:28,287
You know I think

4780
03:32:29,311 --> 03:32:29,823
Degrade account

4781
03:32:31,359 --> 03:32:32,639
You really think so

4782
03:32:32,895 --> 03:32:34,175
I do not agree

4783
03:32:34,687 --> 03:32:39,551
That could you save that quote Forever This is Everything I hoped it would be

4784
03:32:39,807 --> 03:32:45,951
I would like that one to stay right there that would like Joe Rogan to have to live with

4785
03:32:46,463 --> 03:32:50,047
My Alex Jones podcast was everything I hoped it would be

4786
03:32:50,303 --> 03:32:56,447
If it was everything you hoped it would be very interesting set of hopes

4787
03:32:56,703 --> 03:32:59,775
Yeah it's not good I really hope

4788
03:33:00,031 --> 03:33:01,823
That I would come off okay

4789
03:33:02,079 --> 03:33:03,871
Yeah

4790
03:33:04,127 --> 03:33:05,151
To spread his b*******

4791
03:33:05,407 --> 03:33:11,551
2 million defeat I hope that I would come off as performatively curious at the same time

4792
03:33:11,807 --> 03:33:14,111
Also sandbagging of Alex totally

4793
03:33:15,135 --> 03:33:21,279
I I come off as like a pig who likes to roll around in the mud but doesn't actually want to

4794
03:33:21,535 --> 03:33:25,375
The top half of the pig doesn't get dirty by all these other pigs

4795
03:33:25,631 --> 03:33:26,911
They just roll around in it

4796
03:33:27,167 --> 03:33:27,935
My legs

4797
03:33:28,191 --> 03:33:30,751
Sure I covered in mud but I would never allow my face

4798
03:33:31,263 --> 03:33:33,823
If in his Cup Squad episodes he came out in

4799
03:33:34,079 --> 03:33:37,919
Said this was everything I wanted it to be because I believe that

4800
03:33:38,175 --> 03:33:38,687
Fully

4801
03:33:38,943 --> 03:33:44,063
Encapsulate if you have an understanding of what Alex believes what he puts into the world how he communicates

4802
03:33:44,575 --> 03:33:47,135
This episode is all you need

4803
03:33:47,391 --> 03:33:53,535
To decode that he doesn't know s*** 100 anything about these topics that he's talking about and all of this

4804
03:33:53,791 --> 03:33:56,351
Sources that he tries to rely on or misinterpretations

4805
03:33:56,607 --> 03:33:57,631
Or completely made up

4806
03:33:58,143 --> 03:34:04,287
He also is too much of a coward to ever admit any of this stuff yet so when confronted to

4807
03:34:04,543 --> 03:34:05,823
Buy a friend

4808
03:34:06,335 --> 03:34:08,639
He will lie to your friends and his friends face

4809
03:34:08,895 --> 03:34:10,687
In order to wiggle out of trouble

4810
03:34:10,943 --> 03:34:13,503
I think that if he said that and then said

4811
03:34:13,759 --> 03:34:16,831
F*** this dude I don't associate with them anymore

4812
03:34:17,087 --> 03:34:18,879
Congratulations you've pulled off

4813
03:34:19,135 --> 03:34:20,927
You did it something fantastic but

4814
03:34:21,695 --> 03:34:24,767
You continue to associate with them and there's no consequences for

4815
03:34:25,535 --> 03:34:26,303
Clear

4816
03:34:26,815 --> 03:34:32,959
Demonstrations of b******* that Alex did here then you're an active participant and

4817
03:34:34,239 --> 03:34:35,263
Sign off

4818
03:34:35,775 --> 03:34:36,287
With this clip

4819
03:34:37,055 --> 03:34:37,567
We did it

4820
03:34:37,823 --> 03:34:38,335
We did it

4821
03:34:38,847 --> 03:34:39,871
We did it all right

4822
03:34:40,127 --> 03:34:41,407
What would we do three and a half hours

4823
03:34:42,687 --> 03:34:43,199
Yes

4824
03:34:43,967 --> 03:34:48,319
A visit

4825
03:34:48,831 --> 03:34:49,599
Bye everybody thank you

4826
03:34:51,135 --> 03:34:51,903
Thank you friends

4827
03:34:52,159 --> 03:34:52,927
Tune into the show

4828
03:34:53,183 --> 03:34:54,207
Oh and thank you too

4829
03:34:54,463 --> 03:34:54,975
Sushi

4830
03:34:55,231 --> 03:34:59,839
I hope this was everything you hoped it would be

4831
03:35:00,607 --> 03:35:03,423
You guys congratulations on sponsoring this nonsense

4832
03:35:03,679 --> 03:35:05,471
Making making this possible

4833
03:35:05,727 --> 03:35:08,031
I think it's really interesting

4834
03:35:08,287 --> 03:35:14,431
That in the aftermath of this episode coming out there was a backlash and understandable

4835
03:35:16,479 --> 03:35:18,271
There's stuff that's just like

4836
03:35:19,039 --> 03:35:19,551
You know

4837
03:35:19,807 --> 03:35:25,951
Harmlessly dumbshit like William Colby was murdered show or Robert Maxwell was murder

4838
03:35:26,207 --> 03:35:28,767
True Crime

4839
03:35:29,535 --> 03:35:32,863
But there's damaging stuff anti-vax narratives is Joe Rogan

4840
03:35:33,119 --> 03:35:35,423
Does not do a responsible job of pushing back against

4841
03:35:35,935 --> 03:35:38,239
Climate change shirt that's huge

4842
03:35:39,519 --> 03:35:45,663
Could be useful in helping push back against the satanic panic

4843
03:35:48,991 --> 03:35:50,015
Absorbing people

4844
03:35:50,271 --> 03:35:50,783
Right now

4845
03:35:51,295 --> 03:35:53,343
I think that there is actually

4846
03:35:53,599 --> 03:35:54,623
Very good cause

4847
03:35:54,879 --> 03:35:56,671
For people to be like what the f*** are you doing

4848
03:35:57,183 --> 03:35:58,719
And the backyard.

4849
03:35:58,975 --> 03:36:05,119
I could I don't know I've seen headlines going around the people are wanting to cancel the Spotify account

4850
03:36:05,375 --> 03:36:07,423
Mehndi episode disappeared from Spotify

4851
03:36:07,679 --> 03:36:10,239
And then now today but just before we were recording

4852
03:36:10,495 --> 03:36:11,775
Cic another headline

4853
03:36:12,031 --> 03:36:13,567
They always attack glitch

4854
03:36:14,079 --> 03:36:17,407
And apparently the episode now on Spotify

4855
03:36:17,663 --> 03:36:23,807
So I don't know what's going on with this person lost those pages they were in the mail Dan and he just left

4856
03:36:24,063 --> 03:36:25,599
Where did they go anyway sure it was

4857
03:36:25,855 --> 03:36:27,647
Proof of everything but you can just trust

4858
03:36:27,903 --> 03:36:31,231
I'm not following that story I don't know what's going on with that I don't

4859
03:36:31,487 --> 03:36:33,279
Mugen to that later

4860
03:36:34,047 --> 03:36:39,167
I don't know what's going on with the status of this this episode but I don't know

4861
03:36:39,423 --> 03:36:40,959
I'd be really really hot

4862
03:36:41,727 --> 03:36:44,799
It'd be funny if he funny for Spotify to take it down

4863
03:36:45,055 --> 03:36:46,847
Nike Spotify to take

4864
03:36:48,639 --> 03:36:49,407
100 million

4865
03:36:49,919 --> 03:36:50,943
My mouth

4866
03:36:51,199 --> 03:36:52,223
Give us a

4867
03:36:52,479 --> 03:36:56,319
Hundred million dollars I need to find a way

4868
03:36:56,575 --> 03:37:01,695
Yeah you'll be number one I think we had a hundred million dollars I guarantee we'd be number one

4869
03:37:01,951 --> 03:37:03,487
Billboard

4870
03:37:03,743 --> 03:37:05,535
I'd be f****** going ape shitt with this

4871
03:37:05,791 --> 03:37:06,559
I don't I don't

4872
03:37:06,815 --> 03:37:07,327
No

4873
03:37:07,583 --> 03:37:13,727
Terrible idea when you give me 100 million I don't know any different than what we do

4874
03:37:13,983 --> 03:37:17,567
I guess we people smoke money instead maybe

4875
03:37:18,079 --> 03:37:20,383
I don't know I think I think that

4876
03:37:20,639 --> 03:37:21,151
I would

4877
03:37:21,663 --> 03:37:22,431
I would ask

4878
03:37:23,199 --> 03:37:24,991
If Joe were listening which is not know

4879
03:37:25,247 --> 03:37:28,063
I would ask that he engage in some reflection

4880
03:37:28,319 --> 03:37:30,367
How about some of the points that we've brought up

4881
03:37:30,623 --> 03:37:31,135
About

4882
03:37:31,647 --> 03:37:37,279
The tactics to try to get to the bottom of some of Alex's stuff

4883
03:37:37,791 --> 03:37:38,559
It makes sense

4884
03:37:38,815 --> 03:37:44,191
Those are the things that you were trying to figure out what someone Source on a certain thing what

4885
03:37:44,447 --> 03:37:44,959
Right

4886
03:37:45,471 --> 03:37:46,239
With Alex

4887
03:37:46,495 --> 03:37:47,519
There isn't anything there

4888
03:37:47,775 --> 03:37:50,335
And that's why you constantly end up with him

4889
03:37:50,591 --> 03:37:52,127
Trying to change the subject

4890
03:37:52,639 --> 03:37:54,431
Jangling keys in front of people

4891
03:37:54,687 --> 03:37:55,711
Obfuscating

4892
03:37:55,967 --> 03:37:56,479
Creating

4893
03:37:56,735 --> 03:37:57,759
False position

4894
03:37:58,015 --> 03:38:01,855
For you to have to own up to yep that's why he does those things because

4895
03:38:03,135 --> 03:38:04,671
Stanza possibility

4896
03:38:04,927 --> 03:38:06,207
Have you realizing

4897
03:38:06,463 --> 03:38:10,303
Did altimate lie there isn't a source yep there isn't anything behind

4898
03:38:10,559 --> 03:38:11,583
Anything that he's saying

4899
03:38:12,095 --> 03:38:13,375
And reflect on that

4900
03:38:13,631 --> 03:38:14,655
And reflect on how

4901
03:38:15,423 --> 03:38:16,959
You did the best you could maybe

4902
03:38:17,471 --> 03:38:17,983
Maybe

4903
03:38:18,495 --> 03:38:19,263
And it still won't

4904
03:38:20,031 --> 03:38:20,799
So don't do this again

4905
03:38:21,055 --> 03:38:21,567
Don't do it

4906
03:38:24,895 --> 03:38:31,039
Drift do a spectacle

4907
03:38:31,295 --> 03:38:33,343
Say really dumb yeah yeah

4908
03:38:33,855 --> 03:38:39,999
A pre-announced don't believe or care about anything that I say this is bananas fun

4909
03:38:40,255 --> 03:38:46,399
Seriously cuz you end up with

4910
03:38:46,655 --> 03:38:49,215
You have an intellectual conversation on s*** he made up

4911
03:38:49,471 --> 03:38:50,239
Between Joe Rogan

4912
03:38:50,495 --> 03:38:51,775
Tim Dillon and Alex

4913
03:38:52,031 --> 03:38:52,543
Jones

4914
03:38:52,799 --> 03:38:58,943
Great I'm most likely to believe Tim Dillon and again it's because I know the least about him

4915
03:38:59,455 --> 03:39:00,223
Anyway

4916
03:39:01,247 --> 03:39:01,759
We're done

4917
03:39:02,015 --> 03:39:05,087
And now I'm
