Getting the name drop

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,936
It's knowledge first I believe kelda or knowledge.

19
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,728
Appreciate that

20
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,056
I've been in front of a judge

31
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,616
In more ways than I ever thought I would be

32
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
That is definitely the case

33
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,944
You are technically in front

34
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,504
Facing

35
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,552
Just like soda

00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
No

38
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
Not really thought you would be

39
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,512
Facing a charge

40
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,608
There was there was delightful

41
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,704
When I saw the Tweet Anna Merlin tweeted

42
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
She was following

43
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,824
That's nuts

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
But also

45
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
Possible

46
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
F****** contacts

47
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,456
Could this be a link to clip

48
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
And I was like what

49
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,272
Loser

50
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,368
You know it's not as exciting as I would have hoped but

51
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,392
Also just

52
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
Come on Norm

53
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,792
I want

54
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,072
There's just nothing you can

55
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
Can do there

56
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,144
I love the notion

57
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
That there is something

58
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,008
It disqualifying about like let's say

59
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,080
The plaintiffs lawyers appearing on our show or

60
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
Show me being a expert

61
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:34,016
Consultant for that case when you could just flash to Norm sitting next to Alex

62
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,112
Drunkenly screaming about how he wants the lawyers head on a pike there's that

63
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,928
Yes there is that there is that

64
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,232
It seems like you know don't

65
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Don't

66
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,352
Pursue this line too far Norm lest it to fight you in the back to

67
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,912
Yeah everytime I hear civil rights lawyer

68
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,960
Man I just

69
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
Imagine addict

70
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,544
Spinach with his pants around his ankles safe

71
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:01,408
It'll Open Mic like it's just like that you can't be

72
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:07,552
I'm not even sure that didn't even feel like an open mic like a wedding reception

73
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,112
Corporate event

74
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
Yeah

75
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,672
That's so that was in the sequel

76
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,976
That's right

77
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:19,071
Harper Lee didn't want to be published

78
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
Smart choice on her part

79
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,679
What's your b b b b b b

00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
Stylist easy Chicago

81
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,639
Adele I found out

82
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,479
Something you know in many ways I'm still this small-town boy sure you know

83
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
Shake Shack

84
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
By the lights of

85
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
Exiting

86
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,111
Can renew your registration in your car

87
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,183
Registration to just like a f****** currency exchange

88
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:52,095
What yeah I didn't know that I had no idea I'm going to the DMV every year for

89
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:58,495
I mean until they did the mailing things or whatever but I've been going to the DVD of me more than I need to do that's interesting

90
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
I guess that's

91
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,615
The currency exchanges probably have to diversify a little bit

92
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:08,735
If they're allowed to do that

93
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,343
Your underground registration ring

94
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,391
Is run through f****** West

95
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,183
Union or whatever

96
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:23,071
Yeah you slap them on your plate you're good

97
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
4 minutes

98
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:30,495
Wow is also pretty good timing for a currency

99
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:36,895
A couple times

100
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
That 4 minutes

101
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:44,319
Was enough time for a bunch of people to fill in the line behind me who are not going to take four minutes

102
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,719
Good timing my friend yeah I worked out to go pick up the new place

103
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,023
Person to this day

104
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,375
Episode to go over we're flipping this one

105
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,959
Because big news happened in Iran September 8th 2020

106
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
Me too

107
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
We lost the queen

108
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,591
Queen is out of play

109
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,663
Turns out

110
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
Cyberspace

111
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
Bye-bye

112
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
It is now bye-bye time

113
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,279
I don't think anyone could put it as poetically

114
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:31,679
5 x 5

115
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:38,079
It was happening 2019

116
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,871
Was Alex's take on the queen at that point

117
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Absolutely

118
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
No whose

119
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
Air switch

120
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
Economy

121
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
Mama

122
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
World

123
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
Chaffey front

124
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
As usual

125
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
With the last

126
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,567
Be at this was a the queen had voted not to

127
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,895
Suspend Parliament stand this was Alex

128
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,711
Sega chaconpay.

129
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,111
And it's a great way to memorialize the Queen's leg

130
00:07:55,135 --> 00:08:01,279
Retrospect 19 sounded maybe like Alex's

131
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,607
I was working on something but fell apart

132
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
Little bit rough

133
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,423
The Ender so he had a pretty

134
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
Positive impression of the Queen for a Day

135
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,031
Hated her

136
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,567
Before that

137
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,591
After that day

138
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:19,199
Try sometimes we got to throw out possible narratives

139
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,247
Hey baby maybe this ball will

140
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,551
We'll start rolling and we'll get the

141
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,343
The queen of the secret Patriot agent

142
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,975
What Bill Barr it just seems like it's always been a step too far for me

143
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
Any

144
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
NE Patriots

145
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,071
The line should at the

146
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
Bass B

147
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
No no Royal

148
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
Like no Royals

149
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,239
That's the Baseline it really seems

150
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:48,383
Contradictory to the very idea comes from

151
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,247
So we'll get to this she does not pass away until

152
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,783
A bit into the show so we'll get to

153
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,831
To see a little bit of what Alex was up to beforehand

154
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,111
Gas boiler

155
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
Super races

156
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:04,255
And then we'll see how he feels.

157
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:15,007
So first I love my nugget more than anything in the universe but I guess my stinky a fuckboy to thank you so much

158
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
Juvenile policy

159
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:20,127
Choosing to believe that's about pets

160
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,943
Text Rob do more like Rob don't

161
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,735
Thank you so much you and I'll probably walk

162
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:31,391
Celine was a DND God what would her domains be just asking

163
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,999
What does that mean

164
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,607
When I did the DND

165
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:44,447
I read a lot about it and then I was like I have

166
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:50,847
I cannot understand all of this so then I made up all the rules if you'll recall I was really hoping that you would have a definition for them

167
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,943
I'm going to go with the place whereabouts they hang

168
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:59,039
And if Selene her domain would be I think

169
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,575
Wisdom

170
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,879

Selma's not gross

174
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,079
No

175
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,919
Here where Alex starts

176
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,199
Excited

177
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
Something he did

178
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
Just before he got on a

179
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
Literally 10 minutes ago

180
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,583
Before the show started

181
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
Hour-long interview

182
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
Now the most man man in the world

183
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,431
Univision.com it's brother

184
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,503
He's a really smart guy in or misrepresenting who he is

185
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,807
Is there scared of male leadership

186
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
Tomorrow

187
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
The interview

188
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
The Friday show

189

And Monday

190
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543

Not real

199
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,359
Get over it losers that narrows our dad Flash

200
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:03,711
Has become something

201
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,503
Of a chauvinist icon

202
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,855
Aggressive misogyny

203
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:14,463
Social media influencer type use on Tik-Tok

204
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,767
Dumbfucks

00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:29,567
Never there but there's actually like Billy

207
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:35,455
Make a big deal out of interviewing Andrew

208
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
It really just highlights how legitimate

209
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:43,391
Alex is about his principles and how is business model isn't mostly desperately trying to

210
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,951
He can get attention for associating with

211
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:52,607
Real piece of s*** and all you really need to know about him is that he's led the UK to go to Romania admits

212
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,911
Allegations of him abusing women

213
00:12:55,423 --> 00:13:01,567
He began to operate a webcam site where you had women lie to men to scam them out of money would you like to his home being

214
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,359
Rated by Romanian police quote

215
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,663
Following a tip-off from the US Embassy

216
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,735
Set a 21 year old American woman was being held

217
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
Against her will

218
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
Wait he's

219
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,831
He did that in the past

220
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,391
Yeah fairly recently

221
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
WhatsApp

222
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
Okay

223
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:23,327
This is now becoming ongoing human trafficking investigation which is totally one of the issues that Alex

224
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,863
Tears about very much

225
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
The Super Series

226
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
About

227
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:33,055
Pennyweight is hot right now because it got kicked off all the social media sites and he was on Tucker show to complain about it fairly

228
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,079
Recently as well

229
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:42,271
Allegedly

230
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:48,671
He might have been kicked off the social media sites because he's a violent misogynist whose content breach various platforms

231
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:54,047
The service but he might have also been kicked off for coordinated abuse of the platform itself

232
00:13:54,815 --> 00:14:00,959
He runs a thing called Hustlers University which is basically a pyramid scheme where he teaches young man how to scam people about things like

233
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
Cryptocurrency

234
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,639
There are a bunch of allegations that threw his following he engaged in coordinated efforts to manipulate algorithms to boost

235
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
This content

236
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:15,807
With tons of fake accounts and things like that stupid Moriarty that's what's happening

237
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,367
I'm sort of center of the dumbest

238
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,159
Screw around ring that there's been

239
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
F****** crack

240
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:28,351
When is whether it's because of hateful ideology or because of abusing the platform anyone

241
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,911
Plenty of reason to kick and rotate off their site

242
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,703
And at the moment he's getting tons

243
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,751
Attention

244
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
Might be right for the

245
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,359
The picking now that it's harder to get teeth content online

246
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,431
So I thought I would see a prime opportunity

247
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,503
Try and scoop up some of these disaffected youth fit

248
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,623
Now the phone is radicalized vultures are circling trying to pick apart the car

249
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
Cats of that body

250
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:57,791
People who are going to be willing to give this fellow platform

251
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,119
Text coming in

252
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:07,519
Barely just a bunch of people coming in like hey do you want to make a lateral move to Infowars

253
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,359
Or whatever you want yeah it's like okay we've disrupted

254
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,383
Essentially

255
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,431
The business model

256
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
Andrew Tate was operator

257
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,551
He doesn't have these social media algorithms

258
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,343
The game and scam people

259
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,903
And so essentially that hustle is over

260
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,207
But he does have a currency

261
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,767
And that is the number of people who

262
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,071
He has turned into rabid followers

263
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,863
Essentially what you doing is

264
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,911
Trying to sell those followers to somebody

265
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,215
Yeah and I Alex's

266
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Willing

267
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Yeah

268
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,543
Yeah man

269
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,359
Yeah it's fun how often the audience

270
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
Is the product

271
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,663
Now they are happy about it

272
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,503
Make no mistake about it too though like this isn't a new thing

273
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
Because of his

274
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
Troubling views

275
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
Yeah that would make

276
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,535
So Alex gets into some headlines of some stuff

277
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,583
And it's like I said

278
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
Fairly racist

279
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,423
And by the way I love black people

280
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,799
Wonderful black people

281
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,335
Butter.

282
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,639
The really evil horrible wipers

283
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,711
Charles really evil horrible black person

284
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
My person

285
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
What

286
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:27,135
You've got racial attacks going on around the u.s.

287
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,975
Black-on-white now it's 21 or higher

288
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,887
Tortured and murdered

289
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,191
Crazy racist black people

290
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
But the media

291
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,599
Goes out there and do something evil it is the top

292
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,879
Story everywhere

293
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,183
White person is guilty

294
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,143
Muslim

295
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,823
You don't blame the bus you don't blame the truck you blame who did it but they try to surprise

296
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,711
What globalist

297
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
New World Order

298
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,807
Wait what

299
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,191
When he gets arrested

300
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,103
George Soros

301
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
Lady teacher

302
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,447
Division are pushing

303
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:23,103
The first things first Alex is just making up numbers when he says that the incident so black-on-white racially motivated crimes has gone

304
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,895
From 10 to 1 to 20 21

305
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,199
That's just him pushing the white identity

306
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,759
We fear that essentially Powers his shows ideology

307
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:36,671
We've gone over this a hundred times so I'm not going to get too deep into it again but what Alex is doing here is just pushing a very standard White

308
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,487
Supremacist talking point that many view as one of the most

309
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,791
Defective gateways towards radicalizing people

310
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,071
It's a deeper races

311
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,399
Famously it was lies about racial crime

312
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,031
6 put out by the Council of conservative citizens that Dylan roof cited as being the thing that began his path

313
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
Store carrying out his races

314
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Does mass murder

315
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,687
There was a black man who is charged with the murder of a white teacher in Memphis

316
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,759
That's true but it's not clear that it was a racially motivated

317
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
The crime

318
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:08,927
Was black man who carried out a shooting spree recently but that was also something that I would approve had a racial motive a

319
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,487
He doesn't care about the actual crime

320
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:15,071
Need to seize any crime where the perpetrator is black and the victim is white

321
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:15,839
Is happening

322
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
Cuz the victim is white

323
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:23,519
This is shockingly consistent and Alex's ideology over the years and it's because he was a deeply racist purse

324
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:30,687
Also to his point of whether or not you know if there were white man who kidnapped black women and how is that did happen

325
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,967
It would be the biggest deal ever

326
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,503
I would ask him or Imo's

327
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,063
The people in his audience if they know who Joshua Edwards

328
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,111
And the answer is likely no

329
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:45,023
He was a member of the Aryan Brotherhood who kidnapped and raped a black woman in 2019 ultimately being sentenced in 20

330
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,583
I've never heard Alex bring that up

331
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,655
I don't think that's a something that is

332
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
You plastered all over headlines

333
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:59,359
It doesn't appear that he's particularly interested in black women being among it's not V

334
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,919
Highest percentage of

335
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:05,503
Victimized groups in the in the f****** country

336
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,551
Robert David

337
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,831
Fight

338
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:15,231
What's 230 years in prison in late 2021 for kidnapping a 14 year-old black girl he'd met online taking her across

339
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,767
State lines and sexually abusing

340
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,327
Or Wayne Marcel who paid someone

341
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,143
2000 dollars to take that same tiled from

342
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:22,911
Bikes home

343
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,191
Texas to Illinois

344
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,471
Where you picked her up and took her

345
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
Connecticut

346
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,543
Explicitly for the purposes of sexually abusing

347
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
Here's the thing though

348
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:37,247
These are horrific crimes where the perpetrator was white and the victim was black but even in the case where the guy was in the area and bruh

349
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,039
Brotherhood you would have to work

350
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,623
To prove that the crime he committed was motivated by race

351
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:47,487
Possible and you might make that assumption but it isn't guaranteed even though

352
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,023
He clearly is a race

353
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:56,191
And these are cases that Alex has never heard of a client directly in the face of the reality that he wants to portray for his audience

354
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:01,055
If anything he said meant anything these names would be household names

355
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,335
But they're not

356
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,431
Anyway I was just a racist Chinese bush

357
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,967
Standard white supremacist.

358
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,015
I mean those are those are like

359
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,551
Legit

360
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,599
Reconstruction Era South propaganda

361
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,879
This would be like man you're going

362
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
A little bit too hard

363
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,696
Status f*****'-a

364
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,792
Insane is every reason to understand the dynamic here and how

365
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,608
These talking points have been used historically

366
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,144
That's just too

367
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,728
We've been desensitized to it so much

368
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,776
But like that is literally

369
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,104
Hey you bring that straight from the Civil War

370
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
Into

371
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
Today

372
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,920
That is what that is

373
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,272
So ask her is I mean to this is just

374
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
Did this is s***

375
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,344
And the truth is

376
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,416
Real persecutions country is The Unborn

377
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
It is

378
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,144
Murder and torture and killing of white people

379
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,744
A suppressor story

380
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,144
She deserves it

381
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Chicago

382
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,544
Oakland

383
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,408
Bug other black people

384
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,456
White people

385
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:52,928
Suppressing any story heavy coverage of the case of this teacher from Memphis Eliza Fletcher on all major

386
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,952
Media Outlet

387
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,000
When Alex says that the story is being

388
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:59,840
Suppressed what do you mean somebody's mad that the media isn't covering it as a

389
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,912
The crime committed by a black man against a white woman because

390
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,680
She was white

391
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
This is also a

392
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:10,592
Classic white supremacist talking point that racist crimes against white people are intentionally being suppressed

393
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,896
Alex deploys these talking points

394
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,920
Because they're effective

395
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,456
And because he's a race

396
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:22,368
Also that clip he's talking about from the New Black Panther Party I believe it if I recall correctly is clip of Khalid

397
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:25,184
Muhammad who died in 2001

398
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
Right right here

399
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:30,048
All over the place

400
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:36,448
You were saying the weirdest emphasizing there is a little bit of that it's true but it may even cuz I was listening to this like well he's swinging

401
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,240
Yeah yeah

402
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,288
Rudy's notably

403
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,568
Over

404
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,336
For him today

405
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,872
Yeah I mean indeed

406
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
It is such like

407
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,200
That is the attack be

408
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,736
The only Avenue

409
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,784
For that you went out with so many

410
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
Of these

411
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,856
People have to look around and be like

412
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,160
Why am I hearing about all these race

413
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:00,256
White people and not enough about people who are racist towards White

414
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,304
People and there's an obvious answer

415
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,072
But you can't

416
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:03,840
Do that

417
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,632
So instead they're like

418
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,168
Because they're suppressing

419
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,496
I see that makes way more sense then

420
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,800
But statistics and a

421
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,872
Massive history of this country working together

422
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,176
Now

423
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:23,296
You know you want to convey the feeling that you're under attack

424
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,832
By the author

425
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,600
Or whatever

426
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,648
Convey to the audio

427
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,672
Healing

428
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,720
Is what he wants to exploit

429
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,256
Venues engro

430
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:36,608
And if you want to look into

431
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,656
These feelings that you have

432
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,192
Maybe you don't find

433
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,472
The information

434
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
Then Alex would be

435
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:47,872
You know presenting it so you should be able to find all this stuff the reason is because it's being surprised

436
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,408
Steve Carell

437
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
Very fact

438
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,992
And it works for every group

439
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,808
Anyway Alex's easier on this

440
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,392
But I robbed one of the producers are just so happens to be black

441
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,560
Washing of white supremacy

442
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,888
We're all being targeted for lawlessness

443
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,336
Letting black people specifically

444
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
Specifically

445
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,440
Safety at

446
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,072
I'm sure I don't need to explain that the safety act

447
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,864
It doesn't make it so black people

448
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,936
Crimes in Illinois is Alex seems to be implying

449
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,496
I do want to point out that the ID

450
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:51,872
See if there are evil Jewish Puppet Masters who are getting minorities to attack white people is a Hallmark

451
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,664
Arc of white supremacist propaganda

452
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,992
I want to put too fine a point on this year but this episode is

453
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,552
Extreme even by Alex's standards

454
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
The beginning is

455
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
Really

456
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,696
Chock full of white supremacist tropes

457
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:10,816
Straight up if you if this was a k if it's a clan meeting

458
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:13,120
This is what you would hear

459
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,192
And you were here also the Edward on top of that so normal

460
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,240
Would be there

461
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:23,360
Like all good KKK rally we we shipped a little bit here

462
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,920
Alex has got some news he wants to cover

463
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,064
Harrison Smith

464
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,112
Padres

465
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
Can

466
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,584
Farewell little

467
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,680
Brian Humpty Dumpty stealth

468
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
I'm not mad at the key

469
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,504
It's not always easy being on the outside

470
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,904
Scrutinized and judged not having anybody tell you what to say

471
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:14,816
Sometimes I wonder

472
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,664
Converse shoes with a steady

473
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
Good stuff

474
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
Wow

475
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,856
Harrison could never get hired at any media outlet that

476
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,392
Legitimate because he sucks

477
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,416
He does bad work

478
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:47,072
Infowars is literally the only place that has standards low enough to hire him and he's only on air because David Knighton

479
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,864
Cheticamp to a fight now it's

480
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Spire Deva

481
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
Like

482
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,728
Your your laughable

483
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,264
Fifth string

484
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
Behind David knife

485
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,640
Yeah you are only on are because like

486
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,176
Metaphorically

487
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,760
Six quarterbacks got injured absolutely

488
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,784
Absolutely

489
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,576
Just a badger look like

490
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:13,952
Harrison Smith if he worked at CNN would be hosting the primetime

491
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,280
Is the f*** out of here like one of those

492
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:23,680
The car dealership commercial people being my Blitzer

493
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,264
It's one of like those know Bob Rohrman being like man that f******

494
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,336
Jon Hamm narration over those Mercedes commercials or whatever

495
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
He's f******

496
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,152
Sucks they need the Roar

497
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:36,224
Robin does good work

498
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,064
That's because you chose to be a dissident but he's not

499
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,856
Easy path

500
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:46,976
What's up you think of his rocks mad that he thinks he's great at commercial this is all fun and games

501
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,000
It's cute but this

502
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,816
This High School AV project

503
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,864
Shuffle music video they're playing

504
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,960
This it's nonsense is so much easier to be in the mainstream media

505
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,496
If it's a message that

506
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
It's fun for them

507
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,896
But it's Hollow it's meaningless I made that video on VHS when I was 12

508
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
Yep.

509
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
It's a little bit

510
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
Maudlin

511
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,992
It's a little bit

512
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:09,760
Childish

513
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:14,624
Also has weeks old by now seems a little bit

514
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:21,536
Makes you guys really look like Petty losers

515
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,608
Like I said you've got maybe two days

516
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:28,960
To turn that around and get it out and have it be relevant and funny

517
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,008
Now it is just sad

518
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:37,408
I also noticed that the first stanza of that song as a reference

519
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,224
This is because it was produced by Harrison Smith

520
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,248
Steam and he's

521
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:46,880
Much more clearly aligned with the young white identity folks like the Fuentes community so this is to be expected

522
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,928
Babies continuing the theme hero

523
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,720
Pretty races

524
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:54,560
Contact yeah we're going we're going with racial buttons

525
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,328
Quite a bit

526
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,120
The show

527
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,912
Sound system actual news

528
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
It's not till

529
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,240
Good thing the queen died otherwise. Nothing

530
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
Yeah

531
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
Aveda

532
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:05,824
It's harsh

533
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,848
Guitars

534
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,944
So that was a mister act on my part that was going to get to the news but you cook

535
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,064
Play Harris

536
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,344
Art project

537
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
Right

538
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
Actual news

539
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
I don't dislike

540
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,848
Because she's all part of this new ruling class

541
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,432
Were you have to either be a woman or be a homosexual

542
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,992
Power and then

543
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:49,344
President is a white

544
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,208
Really gross stuff I'm not going to stay on air

545
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,256
Investigating it last night

546
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,120
Because I didn't want to go down that rabbit hole

547
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,680
Yeah he stopped investigating cuz there wasn't

548
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,472
He is just

549
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,032
Gay man who is the Deputy

550
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
Rob Monk

551
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
Epoch score

552
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,336
Mater

553
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:15,456
And there's a picture of him wearing like a like a button-up shirt and then underneath there's like

554
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,784
Harness yeah the harness that looks like a pentagram

555
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,368
Sure and so this is now he is deeply involved in Satan

556
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,952
Of all the things that you might

557
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:32,352
Like when you're on your way to med school at the end you're never going to be like well I'm probably going to be the sea

558
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,376
Center of a monkey box

559
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,400
Conspiracy theory

560
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,424
Yeah

561
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:40,288
Sorry I find this to be a little thin

562
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,664
I don't understand Alex's conception that you have to be a woman or a homosexual to be in a position

563
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,688
The power

564
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:49,248
You know I feel like that's a talking point

565
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,528
He just deployed

566
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,552
2 attack

567
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,832
V

568
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:57,440
The people who happen to be women or homosexual

569
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,488
The power because he doesn't like that

570
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,256
That seems

571
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:04,864
Crazy wasn't like that happening at all it's not like a genuine observation

572
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,144
I think it's not

573
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,424
Okay that's crazy

574
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,264
So you're saying that he's looking at things and then making it up on his own

575
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,288
I know that's

576
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,848
It's not in his character

577
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,640
Foreign to us but yes

578
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:20,736
Here Alex gets really gross about this dude

579
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
This sucks

580
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,296
And is very

581
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,112
Cuz I didn't want to go down that rabbit hole

582
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,184
Destructive

583
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
Stop

584
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,000
Really hurtful things to his own body

585
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,560
Course

586
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,896
Photos of him in the past

587
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,968
Family August

588
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,784
He's into things like

589
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,552
Eating

590
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,584
That's so delicious

591
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,376
What are you talkin about

592
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,984
What is a real new thing

593
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,056
Like this is not something that I remember Alex doing

594
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
Pastimes

595
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,616
Like equating

596
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,176
Being gay with eating poop

597
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:25,248
I think we're in full regression

598
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:30,880
Turning big like we were joking about him being only capable of

599
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,672
Children's level thought for me

600
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,488
I think he's now actually descending back in

601
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,768
Into a larva

602
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,560
Allstate

603
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:45,216
Thick particularly virulent anti-gay propaganda hate speech to the Past

604
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:51,616
Involved like they eat poop

605
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,688
Regression to like more

606
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,712
Explicit big

607
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,248
Hey Mike straight

608
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,808
Points that are much more at home

609
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,576
In

610
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,112
Places

611
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,672
A little bit

612
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:11,584
No you go back to public 1998 and s*** like that and you just

613
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,144
You think about what was okay to just

614
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,168
Toss about

615
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,472
Yeah it's crazy

616
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:21,056
He rang its back everything old is New Again

617
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,872
Alex gets word

618
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,176
It's not good with the queen

619
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
Sure and

620
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,016
He doesn't really care

621
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,776
I don't wish the old Queenie

622
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,592
Who's about as British

623
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,384
Transylvanian vampire bat

624
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
She's dead

625
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,576
Was founded

626
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,856
In Defiance

627
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,096
Disgusting to sit there and watch TV

628
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,656
Worship

629
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:24,800
That is not what freedom is all about America's all about now should tell you that

630
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:30,176
I mean no no it's so ridiculous anyways let's

631
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:34,016
Think about how many presidents and their sons president

632
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,808
12

633
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:41,440
John Quincy Adams

634
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,000
Wasn't there another one

635
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,072
Don't think so I think that Adam things right

636
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:52,960
I don't know Transylvania bloodline

637
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,984
Yeah

638
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,056
Taft was actually his son was

639
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:01,664
Clinton I don't know a big stretch

640
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,456
Well I mean

641
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,480
Just egg

642
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:08,320
Throw it more towards the end established aristocracy

643
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,368
We can agree there's an established aristocra

644
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,928
In terms of like Kennedy's in

645
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:15,232
Clinton's and multiples

646
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:21,632
Yeah for sure there aren't there are sort of legacies or or whatever

647
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,424
Dynasty type

648
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,216
Actually president

649
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:31,104
Yeah you're right you're right we got Harrison was the grandson of William Henry Harris

650
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,152
Right right right

651
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,064
James Madison and Zachary Taylor were second cousins enough for Horseshoes and Hand Grenades

652
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,648
Does they say the fifth cousin of Teddy Roosevelt

653
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,696
Just a cousin

654
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,976
I don't have any of this is

655
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:53,376
Fully accurate I just Googled it misses on facts of monster so monster wouldn't leave me

656
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,704
Me wrong any anything over to cousins does

657
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,472
Account for me

658
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:01,824
Just doesn't count

659
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,616
Everything over

660
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:08,224
So the second hour is the guy who

661
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,832
Wow and you've got a book

662
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,600
Out

663
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,392
He's promoting

664
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:20,512
Actually comes out tomorrow so we've been doing this to pre-orders

665
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:31,520
One of the things that the enemy wants us to believe is that were isolated or that were alone or that name of the

666
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:35,360
The people that share our values and our worldview are are very small in number but

667
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:40,224
Is it is true we may copy no eighty-two 90% of this country

668
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:47,648
DC and in Silicon Valley and New York City

669
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,672
Country right now

670
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,000
Worldview and their values are diametrically opposed to us

671
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,400
Christian nationalism

672
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,824
Christian nationalism

673
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,696
There were explicitly Christian countries for the first 200 years

674
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,280
Those weren't countries those are

675
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,048
4 colonies

676
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
And that was

677
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,984
Our country Constitution that we

678
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,592
Because people say this is this dumb thing

679
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:42,176
Where words don't actually mean the things I mean you know like

680
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,200
We heard like

681
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:48,320
Dave daubenmire coach Davis talk about being a white nationalist

682
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,904
Understanding is a compound noun

683
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,696
Being a nationalist

684
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:57,024
Who is Christian is not the same thing as being a Christian nationalist

685
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,328
That's right torba is very

686
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,864
Explicitly

687
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,656
I don't think

688
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,472
Unknowingly trying to blur that

689
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,752
I mean yeah

690
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,544
And the thing that is so

691
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,384
Stupid that is so so so stupid

692
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:13,920
Is that

693
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,456
Keep saying Christian

694
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,760
Everybody keep saying Christian

695
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,600
Everybody keep saying Christian but with you did get a Christian Nation

696
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,672
With Christian ideals or whatever

697
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,488
You don't know what f****** are empower

698
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,840
You don't take it you know people think all its Christian Nationals you don't know if it's a

699
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:37,472
Catholic christian nationalism if you don't know if it's a presbyterian Christian nationalism a does

700
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:43,872
I think he does too based on his definition I think he knows

701
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,968
Anyone else you're all insane to me

702
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:54,368
Yeah and I think that's their particular brand of Christianity is not super mainstream

703
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,512
Some elements are perhaps a little bit more Fringe

704
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:05,632
Yeah I eventually leave

705
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,400
Good thing

706
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,960
That is that is wrong lesson

707
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,240
I think

708
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,032
I think it would be interesting

709
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:16,384
If you did have a Christian nationalism that was based around like

710
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
I don't know

711
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,944
Giving to the poor

712
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,624
Most of these people wouldn't even be an interesting version of it that's not what they would want

713
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,976
Berean Christian Nation like what eats it's so silly to me how many it

714
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,280
Sir divisions there are in that

715
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,560
Concept of the block

716
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
Christianity

717
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,400
And yet when it comes to electoral politics people are willing to

718
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,216
To go along with cristianismo what the f****** word

719
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
Crazy

720
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:46,592
It is it is a big subset of subset

721
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,152
So anyway they want to create a Christian

722
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,688
That's basically it

723
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,992
And that is Christian nationalism

724
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,016
To them

725
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,832
They're trying to

726
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,880
The two things

727
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,952
Blend together are being Christian and being nationalist

728
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,744
Which I think most people would view as like

729
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,024
Alright good for you

730
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,632
Being a Christian nationalist which I don't think most people would be okay with big eyes

731
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,424
Has to do with

732
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,008
Christians being in charge of literally everything about

733
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,288
The house the country runs

734
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,128
A country run by Christian rock Christian rule

735
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,176
And that is not under Sharia law

736
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,480
And that's what torba and Alex want

737
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,584
Sleepwalking

738
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,888
Engaged

739
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,008
In public discourse

740
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,824
Christianity was religious

741
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:56,735
We let people practice their own religion we don't make them convert

742
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:06,463
Pretty well encapsulate Alex's ideology

743
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:12,607
He doesn't believe in America everyone is able to practice their religion or lack of religious belief freely

744
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,423
He believes that Christians are right and should be in charge

745
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:19,519
Because they're so nice to everyone else to practice their religion

746
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,871
That's what he believes it's so nice of the correct

747
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,407
Religion to have the

748
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:28,991
The benevolence necessary to allow people to worship

749
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,271
False gods and safe

750
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:34,367
Magus this is nonsense and it's not religious freedom or tolerance

751
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,415
Having a belief system like this

752
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:42,815
Strongly implies that it's some point if they could stop allowing people to practice certain religions

753
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,095
And they would be well within

754
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,119
The right to do so

755
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:48,703
Obviously if that happened it would be because of particular religion

756
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,775
Just gone too far and taking their Christian tolerance for weakness

757
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:58,175
At least that's how it would be easy to sell it under this framework inalienable

758
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,199
Rights are things

759
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,991
It can be taken away front

760
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:07,391
I personally find it hard to believe that Alex actually believe any of this living light living on since he saying

761
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:13,023
He's very consistent in expressing his belief that all Islam is radical and incompatible with the West

762
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:17,631
He constantly yells about Satanist to be pedophiles who drink children's blood

763
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,935
He believes that atheists are secretly trying to

764
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:24,031
Dehumanize people from their connection with God so they'll be tricked into transhuman

765
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:28,383
He may believe the people in the US only have religious freedom because Chris

766
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,919
They're nice enough to let them but

767
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,711
He doesn't want that to be the case

768
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:36,063
If you even half the chance he would almost certainly try to Outlaw these religions

769
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,087
And probably others

770
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:43,487
It'll be so easy for him to rationalize considering these super clear that his enemies are all in League with the literal BL

771
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,511
Those above

772
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,559
Do load of b******* and it's

773
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,839
It's not a great sign.

774
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:51,935
The first hour of the show's been essentially a white supremacist talking point fast

775
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:54,239
And now the dude who runs a Twitter clone that's

776
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:57,311
Swamp with bigots is onto longer the term Christian nationalism

777
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,847
This is outrageous

778
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:03,711
I mean I know I know I just made this point but I can't stress it enough

779
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:08,319
If this type of Christianity is allowed to make a quote Christian Nation

780
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,855
You will not be allowed to practice

781
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:15,743
Your type of Christianity if it does not share it a bit you're just an apostate you're you're a f******

782
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:19,071
You're you're an Infidel like this short walk

783
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:25,471
Yes it's a very short walk to that there is no

784
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,495
National religion

785
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,775
Cuz your f***

786
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,079
So we get to the point where Alec

787
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,871
X finds out that the queen has died

788
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,639
And

789
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,943
Tour buses in in

790
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,711
In the mix

791
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:40,319
Play the Queen is out of play and Alex

792
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,087
This is got to rest

793
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,135
Husband

794
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:48,767
Is a particularly deadly virus

795
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,751
Cuz I love the queen so much

796
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,311
Do you think he could

797
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,335
Between

798
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,663
That's really what I'm hoping right now

799
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:18,719
The Audubon Society that he told

800
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:20,255
Boy challenge

801
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,047
He told Reuters

802
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,375
He said he want to come back

803
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,215
The lower population

804
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,991
You have nothing

805
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,063
Batteries

806
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,087
That is insane

807
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:48,671
Also there was a children's book

808
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:54,303
Type of thing where the key if I were an animal is this and then

809
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,327
It was published

810
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:59,679
In about like the it was cited some articles

811
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,959
Monster Energy

812
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:05,055
And it wasn't about killing off Humanity was much more thoughtful answer than that

813
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,591
Butter Alex Evans

814
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,151
Anyway probably maybe

815
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,175
Prince Philip

816
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,455
Came back as a virus

817
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:15,551
Just to selectively take out his wife weird

818
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,879
Weird that we can go from like

819
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:23,999
Because Christianity is right to Alex genuinely being concerned about reincarnation like

820
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:30,655
Listen man I hope this isn't how it works is that you know what happens when you

821
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:34,495
You died I think you're right if we're to take this to mean anything right

822
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,775
I think in reality Alex

823
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:39,103
Spinning his wheels

824
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,687
Suburbans got to take

825
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,039
Queen

826
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:50,367
Queen Elizabeth the second making the Jeopardy

827
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:53,439
Jesus Christ is our Lord and savior

828
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:58,303
Now it says it's unfortunate they're so much going on now

829
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:08,287
Important decision that you can make in your life

830
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:16,479
In our world there's there's so much uncertainty

831
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:19,807
I've heard Andrew torba on Alex's show before

832
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:20,831
It wasn't

833
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,975
This feels like okay this is your committed to this

834
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,279
Not to say that he wasn't

835
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,839
Christian before anything but

836
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
It seems like this is

837
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,375
To become

838
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,143
A big front

839
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,167
Center

840
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,447
It's it's it's

841
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,007
Creepy to the point where it's like that.

842
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:44,127
Team that goes away to Bible camp for a week and then comes back and there's like I've got the

843
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,151
Power of the Holy

844
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,687
Play spirit

845
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:50,015
Perspective though of like The Queen Is Dead I hoped

846
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,063
She found God or whatever it is

847
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:58,207
As benign as a response to the queen dying can be condescending bulshit

848
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:04,863
Condescending bulshit we all get used to our grandparents sing the praying for us

849
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,191
That's true I hope it gave her life over to Satan

850
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:08,959
Is rocket

851
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,239
Inhale right now next

852
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:15,359
Barbie doll rocking out with Bowie

853
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,663
You believe the king of Mars God damn well that's

854
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,759
So Alex for someone who is

855
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,527
Above it all

856
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,831
I have some interesting like

857
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:28,671
A preoccupation with Palace intrigue

858
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,567
That becomes the new king

859
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,479
Prince Charles

860
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,807
Prince Charles's mr. reset New World Order

861
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,087
World government

862
00:48:59,391 --> 00:48:59,903
Bypass

863
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:01,951
Prince Charles

864
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,255
Make a prediction right now I may be wrong

865
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,327
But I think Prince Charles is going to be seen as the king of England

866
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,399
Will say something like for two years while his son gets ready

867
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,191
Charles

868
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:19,871
No s*** Prince Charles is going to become king

869
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:26,271
Talking about it's very clear the order of a song called I mean endless it if they're just going to start changing

870
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,807
What about the royal family now

871
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:33,439
The word where you started is get rid of them entirely well Charles would have to abdicate

872
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,463
Like

873
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,511
Possible but

874
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:40,351
To throne immediately

875
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:45,727
Change the rules that's why they still have the Royal Family

876
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,751
Is

877
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
Defining is

878
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,311
Ceremony

879
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,359
Almost

880
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:56,991
To a point that is beyond reason reach of it

881
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,271
The glue that holds

882
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:01,087
Together

883
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,135
The British Society

884
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,671
The queen it all falls apart

885
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,975
I love him thinking that he's taking a swing there

886
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:12,351
I think it's going to be Charles good for you babe

887
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,375
Can you plug.

888
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,399
Suffocate figs

889
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,983
Have no election or

890
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:24,383
Charlie TV Kamala Harris who are they they're probably Hillary

891
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:28,735
I think Charles did say something not too long ago about not wanting

892
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,503
2bk

893
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:32,831
There was something along those lines but that doesn't change

894
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:36,927
The order of Ascension unless he takes himself out of it

895
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:43,327
But here we are a part of the agreement with the royal families they also don't really have that much control over what they

896
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,351
To do

897
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:47,167
They're held captive at their own royalty

898
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,447
So

899
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:52,799
Andrew seems to want to talk about stuff and Alex seems to want to

900
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,103
No just music about the

901
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,383
The Royals

902
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:03,807
The grace of God we did it in and we're still standing

903
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
Supporters

904
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,183
Bravo

905
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,935
Jimmy Savile died in 2011

906
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:22,751
What

907
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,031
Jimmy Savile

908
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:30,431
The Jimmy Savile that I recall they be hosted like it was over pedophile

909
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:34,271
For like 40 years and everybody kind of tacitly was like

910
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,551
He's so good at hosting

911
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:39,647
Yeah I don't know if Alex knows he's dead

912
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,439
Yeah it seems like he does not

913
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:47,839
And I don't think it doesn't sound like that either

914
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,007
So dumb

915
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:55,775
Oh boy

916
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,567
So Alex said goes to break

917
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,383
Says farewell to torba comes back

918
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:03,199
Ding dong the witch is dead but

919
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:10,367
I got to say they did not keep it upright and so there is a long portion where the munchkins are talk

920
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:13,695
Talking about confirming whether the witch is dead or not at the

921
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:18,047
They could have cut off at least a minute and a half of it

922
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,839
YouTube clip I think so

923
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,631
Do not have a good start point

924
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:24,191
So I've eliminated that

925
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,495
I also don't want to get a copyright

926
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,311
Strike from The Wizard of Oz

927
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,591
John

928
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,687
Play ding dong the witch is dead

929
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,503
Hillary Clinton

930
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:42,623
What has officially said she's not running for president

931
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:51,071
I don't think we needed her stance

932
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,631
She's got

933
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:56,703
Maybe it

934
00:52:59,007 --> 00:52:59,519
So she said she

935
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:04,639
She's not going to run which means she is but also maybe she's not cuz he has health problems but also his

936
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,175
Entire narrative during the

937
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:09,503
The 2016 election was that she was on death's door

938
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,575
So I don't know this yeah

939
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:18,975
Listen I'll tell you what to predict your buddy I don't think Hillary has much of a choice as to whether or not she was going to run

940
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:22,303
Brother 2024 I think America decided that she was done running

941
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,095
Probably half

942
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,631
I think

943
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,423
I think it's fun though for Alex

944
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:33,823
Text to be like this guy who really just knows his s*** gets cut through the b******* and he'll tell you the when Hillary says she's

945
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,383
Not running I mean that she is rather

946
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,663
She could be dead

947
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,759
Why don't you talk

948
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:48,159
Nothing happening here

949
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:54,559
The midterms well what happened in the midterms change whether or not Hillary Clinton is a tachyon forgot to keep plate

950
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:56,863
So much

951
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,887
I hated Selma

952
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,167
My chats annoying

953
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:02,751

958
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:15,039
Tell you how disappointed I was with the reveal of who the special guest was

959
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:18,111
A special guest here with us and shower and take some calls

960

Alliance Data

966
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:57,535
She was at the airport Studio to tweeted a picture of herself sitting on Alex's desk

967
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,559
The caption quote

968
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:00,351
My stripper name is Sandy Hook

969
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,631
See it's funny

970
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:07,519
Because Alex defamed grieving parents whose children were murdered in Sandy Hook and now there is willingly associated with Alex

971
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,543
Using his platform

972
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,823

Yeah I mean

975
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:18,527
If that is the problem with the zoo crew radio not really having the effect on bringing people out to

976
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,295

977
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:22,623

What Infowars employee one dude who snitched to the feds about his involvement in January 6th

996
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:08,959
One sexual assault troll everyone guy who's too much of an athlete to be allowed to host the fourth hour of Alex's show

997
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,495
Good stuff good

998
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,775
Good crew

That's cool I bet that

1002
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,527
Hilarious

1003
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:27,647
It seems like there's plenty of blogpost though about how hard it is for her to be a stand-up comic

1004
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,415
Supported Trump

1005
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,719

Audience isn't comedy shows

1008
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,375
Early on the pandemic and we have seen so many of those

1009

He also recorded an album called live from January 6th

1010
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,799

And like I was

1015
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,439
Like what

1016
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:05,791
I tried to find that I'm not sure when that was but

1017
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,559
I wonder

1018
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:11,423
She probably

1019
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:17,311

Scuzz.

1022
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:24,735
I'm glad I don't have to be mean to her stand-up and I can

1023
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,015
Just be mean to her as a person

1024
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,039
I would have liked

1025
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,855
To I would like to see some of the stand-up

1026
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,671
I was trying to play her album on iHeart

1027
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:35,743
Yeah that's me to sign in and I couldn't

1028
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,279
I like I I'm

1029
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:41,375
I'm not going Spotify for this if we've been on iHeart we're not going to play iHeart

1030
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:46,751
She's she's got some thoughts I mean

1031
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:50,079
It's a lot of just like hey I agree with all the stuff you're saying Alex

1032
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:50,847
Hooray

1033
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:57,247
Well I mean there is some point or she's she's making stuff that's clearly Lionel being fun

1034
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,647
What else has

1035
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,415
Undermine

1036
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,839
There's a diner in Virginia

1037
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,887
Where's the country club

1038
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:17,471
It had a 911 themed

1039
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,751
Menu

1040
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,383
This is called tone deaf

1041
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:28,735
Such as chocolate

1042
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,295
Ponder flatbread

1043
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:36,671
Basically for it

1044
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:44,863
Descontrol demolicious haha

1045
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,679
Menu with some pot names for things like

1046
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:50,751
Some of the stuff that they were going to be serving on the

1047
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,799
Anniversary of 9/11

1048
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:57,151
2977 chowder which is a reference to the number of people who died

1049
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,431
And flat

1050
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:05,087
Responder flatbread like his the building fell on them yeah it's pretty f****** disrespectful

1051
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:10,719
I made I made plenty of 911 jokes sure but I mean that's tomorrow

1052
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:12,767
That's just bad

1053
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,303
Yeah

1054
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,839
When I was in college

1055
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,631
This back when I smoked a lot of weed

1056
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:23,263
I wanted to throw a 911 theme party in like 2003 so my idea was going to have like a 9

1057
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,287
Layer dip

1058
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:30,687
An 11 layer dip would be beside which is better bongs with lighters decorated to look like playing

1059
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,223
But guess what man

1060
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,783
As a complete idiot nineteen-year-old edging

1061
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:41,183
Pothead even I decided that it was maybe something that sounded kind of funny in my head it was like a little subversive

1062
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,463
The act of doing it would be

1063
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,743
Be dumb and shity

1064
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,511
Imagine

1065
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:48,351
I guess this person who ran the runzas restaurant didn't quite make it to that point

1066
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,887
2022

1067
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,423
Just felt like the viral Buzz

1068
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,727
You get from the backlash was worth doing it anyway

1069
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:54,495
Country Club

1070
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,263
People are all psycho

1071
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:58,591
Whatever the case this is meaningless s*** but it's kind of what you

1072
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,639
Comedian comes on Infowars

1073
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,455
You have attention-grabbing headlines from like

1074
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:09,343
The Daily Mail or New York daily news and then your Riff on them in a way that's supposed to be about some larger point but it's

1075
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,159
Really just an opportunity to make some puns you feel or pushing

1076
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:12,927
Boundaries

1077
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:15,743
Make you feel dangerous and anti-establishment

1078
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:22,399
Pretty dumb stuff is exactly what you were talking about though it's like the Infowars version of that zoocrew radio tab people have

1079
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:29,567
It is terribly about these 911

1080
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:32,639
New things that are Maybe tone-deaf

1081
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,967
This is the new story of the day what do you think about this

1082
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,575
What are you doing

1083
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,623
Also come on

1084
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,671
Your comedian theoretically

1085
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,695
Spell it

1086
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:49,535
You got a f****** cell if you're going to say demolicious

1087
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,095
And not be a sad loser

1088
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,423
You got to try and sell your ass off for that

1089
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,447
I guess

1090
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:59,007
They do a little bit more of this run

1091
01:00:59,263 --> 01:00:59,775
On rhythm

1092
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:03,103
The building 7 Seafood Tower

1093
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:10,783
We should have like an inside

1094
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:16,415
Inside pajamas get better waves

1095
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:22,815
Tragedy

1096
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:26,911
Pretty boring

1097
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,727
Apologizing

1098
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,751
Explain into it

1099
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:34,079
Midterm 61 days how my God

1100
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:38,175
Great transition from Alex

1101
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,991
I'm also Alex

1102
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,551
We are making fun of the people who died

1103
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:46,367
Yeah Charter in the flatbread those are

1104
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,415
Specifically about people who died

1105
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,951
And so I mean

1106
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:53,023
I guess you probably don't want to defend that because it's

1107
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,839
Yeah more fun for you to fall back on me

1108
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:58,911
We're making fun of the deep State being involved even though you'd

1109
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:02,751
Can't really back that up in any meaningful way without nobody pushes you on it

1110
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:08,383
Yes it is more fun because it is looking at this as it actually it is there's really no other

1111
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,919
Conclusion to come to other than this

1112
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,063
To do this

1113
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:16,831
It's not

1114
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,367
It's not worth like

1115
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:21,183
F****** going crazy over it's a dumb

1116
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,463
It's a dumb restaurant

1117
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,743
I'd like

1118
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:31,167
You don't have to do this nobody forced you nobody had a gun to your head put yourself in the position of

1119
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,959
Somebody who may be lost

1120
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,239
Family members

1121
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,775
And imagine how they would

1122
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:36,799
Experiencing

1123
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:40,895
Baby Alive a little bit of an idea of whether or not it's a good idea

1124
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,967
Okay thank you should be allowed to touch within your right

1125
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:44,991
To do this

1126
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,783
F****** shity

1127
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,575
Yeah I mean great

1128
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,343
Batman

1129
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:55,743
Guy wants to apologize in order to preserve

1130
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,023
Some sort of

1131
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,815
Decency good for him but

1132
01:02:59,327 --> 01:02:59,839
I don't know

1133
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:00,607
Anyway

1134
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,679
I don't believe

1135
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,983
I can't believe we're still talk

1136
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:06,751
Some thoughts

1137
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,567
The midterm 61 days out

1138
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,503
Just trying to

1139
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,807
Pull down and hold on to whatever they can

1140
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,391
They just completely lose and

1141
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,487
Interesting to see

1142
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:29,535
What happened

1143
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,263
Kathy hochul in New York

1144
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:42,079
Then I thought they would be

1145
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,871
Encouraging such as the New Yorker

1146
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:46,687
A testament to the kind of Grassroots involvement we're looking

1147
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:49,503
I hear look no further than the name recognition and ads

1148
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,783
Secrecy is doing for

1149
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,063
Some guy named Ali

1150
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,343
Who's running in New York

1151
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:58,463
Chrissy doesn't seem to know his name until she's reminded later but she

1152
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:02,303
She's talked about Lee zeldin who's running against Kathy hochul for the governorship

1153
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:09,215
Who became Governor when quavo resigned in August 2021 and is now running for re-election and put simply this guy like

1154
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,751
Likely is not putting up good

1155
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:16,639
Uncle is ahead by double-digits in the polls in this seat is considered a very safe Democrat fix

1156
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,687
This is what you would expect

1157
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:23,295
Given that someone who's promoting his candidacy on the national media platform doesn't even know his name

1158
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,063
Yeah

1159
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:27,135
Never heard of it. That's a guy who's probably going to lose my double digits

1160
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,439
Never heard of him but apparently

1161
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:34,815
He's putting the fear of Christian nationalist got into the damn yet also I mean

1162
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:35,839
Do polling

1163
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,679
Dinner has been coming out is looking pretty

1164
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,959
Pretty good for Democrats

1165
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:42,239
In terms of the midterms

1166
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,543
And I willing to admit that

1167
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,103
Some of my impressions

1168
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:48,639
The ways that it could go

1169
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:54,015
After the Rovers Wade's I definitely had a perspective that it could

1170
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,039
Have a negative

1171
01:04:55,295 --> 01:05:01,439
Demotivating effect on Democratic voters is absolutely not the case I'm glad to see that

1172
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:03,999
Yeah but you look like

1173
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,303
Did there's a fairly decent Ram

1174
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,351
Better than

1175
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,119
Unexpected

1176
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,399
And

1177
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:12,703
Is my picture

1178
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:16,543
Against the law to talk about midterms

1179
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,847
Isn't it for it until 30 days before voting

1180
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:25,759
I can't imagine what's going to happen in the next 60 days

1181
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:28,575
Infowars Metro, and it should be against

1182
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,343
The law

1183
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,903
No one should even be allowed

1184
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:36,511
Did politician is not with is there a f****** heads down at a desk working

1185
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,815
And said they're campaigning month

1186
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,351
Before the midterms

1187
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,119
F*** off

1188
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:44,447
Get out of here just don't know about Lee

1189
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,495
I really

1190
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,263
Really don't

1191
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,287
So

1192
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:51,615
Interview becomes a little bit of a discussion

1193
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,383
About

1194
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,407
The evils of

1195
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,175
Abdominis

1196
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:56,735
Sure why not

1197
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:03,391
Okay I have some thoughts about the way that this anti-feminism or the opposition to feminism is Express

1198
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,439
Because I think that there is

1199
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,207
Something

1200
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,487
Here that isn't

1201
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:09,791
It's not productive

1202
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,055
Time somebody is

1203
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,079
Cancel.

1204
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,151
Mortuary

1205
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,759
Monday

1206
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:38,463
Because he just like heaven Samuel they're offering up something

1207
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,119
You know

1208
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,655
People to be sheets

1209
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,703
Brampton

1210
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:53,055
Do all the things that don't make

1211
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:58,175
All of humanity

1212
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,991
Potential

1213
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:18,911
Make sandwiches

1214
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:24,031
They just

1215
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,359
Chinese women as there

1216
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,127
Front person

1217
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:32,735
Women are easier to

1218
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,015
That's why it helps

1219
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,135
Send

1220
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,375
Graduated

1221
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:52,447
Short hair like

1222
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:55,775
They're stealing your power

1223
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:10,111
Sota Tuesday ignore the clear attempt at jokes in this clip like the part about women's natural skills being like making sandwiches

1224
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:13,439
Good old-fashioned open-mic level joking around

1225
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,207
Going to do what you do

1226
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:20,607
I do think that there's an interesting perspective the Chrissy is expressing here though a type of

1227
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,655
It's coming through as a little troubling

1228
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:26,495
According to her telling of this she was into feminism in college which

1229
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:28,287
She seems to characterize as her having

1230
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:30,591
Open short hair and not wanting to get married or have kids

1231
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:34,175
That's fine I guess but I don't think those things

1232
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:39,295
Anyone who's being serious we considered Central pillars of feminism

1233
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:43,647
Maybe just so skated with some people who are feminists I guess but

1234
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,927
Something core

1235
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:48,767
Yeah Chrissy also expresses that she believes that women are easier to psyop

1236
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,047
Which seems to imply that

1237
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,839
She herself was the target of the

1238
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:54,143
Is feminism siop in that you fell for it

1239
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,447
Would you like to the behavior that she's describing

1240
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,471
In college

1241
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:00,543
Thankfully she's a comic so she hangs out with a lot of guys

1242
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,079
Sewer life easy to say

1243
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:07,967
Through hanging out with these cool dude Comics who are targets of a psyop she was able to break free of the

1244
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:09,247
Conditioning that led her to

1245
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,015
Feminism

1246
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:13,087
Honestly it sounds like what she's describing is that she

1247
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,879
She took on a feminist aesthetic

1248
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:19,743
In college was not popular with the men there

1249
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:24,607
So in order to adapt and be accepted she adopted a new athletic that was more socially approved

1250
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:29,471
The way it sounds this really doesn't mean anything about the validity or zapping that's a feminism

1251
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:32,543
Really just more about how many stand-up spaces

1252
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:36,127
Are heavily date kept by dudes who don't like feminists so worse

1253
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:39,967
Incidentally along with these right wing ding dongs on her podcast

1254
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:41,247
The cheese at bud

1255
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,271
Drive like share

1256
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,039
Owen Benjamin

1257
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:46,367
Christie is also had a number of sex workers as guest

1258
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,135
And I would

1259
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:52,767
Suggested something she might want to do is reflect a little bit about why it is that sex work is growing in except

1260
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,791
Done for the United States

1261
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:58,143
What would the lives of the sex workers look like in a Christian nationalist

1262
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:02,239
Country like the one the person she's talking to wants to bring into being

1263
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:06,079
What are what are the things that you don't

1264
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:09,151
Seem to think about a lot that are Z fruits

1265
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,687
Of the work of feminist

1266
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:11,967
Over history

1267
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,735
I mean

1268
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:13,503
But this is

1269
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,039
This is the

1270
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,599
Quintessential version of that like

1271
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:18,879
I want

1272
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:21,695
What's the popularity and notoriety that I can

1273
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:24,255
Can get from being a woman in this space

1274
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:25,791
And I

1275
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:30,911
Definitely would rather die than live in the world that these people that I'm in the space of

1276
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,679
Want to create

1277
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,727
Like she

1278
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,007
Absolutely.

1279
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:39,871
Let the foundation of women in comedy is entirely based on

1280
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:43,967
Hey we were oppressed our entire f****** lives in this is all Bulls

1281
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:44,735
It isn't it

1282
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,807
That's the entire Foundation

1283
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,671
Enterprising

1284
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:59,071
Strong feminist voices in boundaries

1285
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,351
Entirely about how

1286
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:05,471
Lucy was f***** over on The Daily you know that's where my God

1287
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:07,263
Otherwise we have more

1288
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,799
The Dick Van Dyke

1289
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:10,847
Left

1290
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:14,687
To the devices of the people who aren't being psyop

1291
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,711
And her

1292
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,735
Serta conception

1293
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:17,759
She wouldn't be

1294
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,319
Headlining Cap City comedy club on a

1295
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,135
Speaking out loud in front of a male presence

1296
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,671
It's

1297
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,695
I mean

1298
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:29,279
I don't want to be I don't want to be dismissive or to like

1299
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,071
Do shity about it but I just think

1300
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:33,631
Perspective is not really fully cook

1301
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:34,911
Quite frankly

1302
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,191
I think

1303
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,471
I think it's a little surface love

1304
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:42,335
This Foundation to this opposition of feminism

1305
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,103
Kind of

1306
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,407
I just don't think there's a strong Foundation

1307
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:57,439
Does air conditioner in this window by myself

1308
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:59,487
It's so easy to beat

1309
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:05,887
Wow

1310
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,167
Better Together

1311
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:14,079
The government wants to do another mayonnaise

1312
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:17,663
Props and things to my fiance

1313
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:22,015
I was just coming out of my like this

1314
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,343
Loot Guide Me In

1315
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:31,231
3 clear her fiance is not Frank Pellegrino the actor who is dead

1316
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:35,839
He's the Arabs to Pellegrino water

1317
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:42,495
I think I just I find this to be so empty because I am aware of and

1318
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:44,287
No many feminists

1319
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:45,823
Kennywood

1320
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:46,591
Be like

1321
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:51,199
Oh no my principles have been corrupted by asking for help with something

1322
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,735
Please don't

1323
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:59,135
Seem to beat these seem to be hockey joke joke as opposed to a like anything

1324
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,927
Real it's a hack joke

1325
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:07,327
Bay by a dude, kin the 80s and then Rosanna rose up like a f******

1326
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,375
Nightmare for these people and was like

1327
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:12,447
And then I bought a f****** fan

1328
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:17,567
Cuz I don't need you know like it was in it did you take it another Direction otherwise it

1329
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,335
Stupid

1330
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,943
I don't know I don't know

1331
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:25,759
Yep it's tough to take this too seriously

1332
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:33,695
For sure

1333
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,447
I called

1334
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:45,727
Let's talk about

1335
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:52,639
Yeah yeah let's talk about Martin Lawrence on Def Jam in the 80s really get into those

1336
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:59,039
That's really get into Martin Lawrence in the 80s

1337
01:13:59,295 --> 01:13:59,807
That subject

1338
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:00,831
Come on

1339
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:07,231
Jesus people harass you because it's a compliment

1340
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:10,303
To you I mean just I don't I don't I don't know

1341
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,863
On the one hand

1342
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:13,631
You have

1343
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,399
Someone who's looking

1344
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:16,191
Median and so you would expect

1345
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:18,495
Humor

1346
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:21,055
Sure to be the way that you're communicating

1347
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,615
Put at the same time

1348
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:25,919
This is in the context of

1349
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,455
Seemingly trying to make

1350
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,223
Make points

1351
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:33,343
It doesn't feel like they're bad they're not well constructed

1352
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:35,647
So I don't have much to work with you

1353
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:41,535
It is a combination of the terrible writing that they that Comics do for a clapter

1354
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:45,631
And then also the terrible writing that they do for joke

1355
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,935
Eliciting Nizer laughs

1356
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:48,959
Nor clapping

1357
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,287
Alex seems to like

1358
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,591
Not be getting the Chrissy's also

1359
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,871
She's trying to be funny

1360
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:58,175
Is there is an attempt at humor and

1361
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:00,735
In some spaces I could see you this being

1362
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:03,807
I can see some people sense of humor being

1363
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:06,879
Haha women can install an air conditioner delivery

1364
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:07,647
Yeah

1365
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,695
What are you going to do when you're sitting next to the worst

1366
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:16,095
Team partner in the world

1367
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:19,167
Do you feel about the midterm stand

1368
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:24,287
Look I was trying to have a chauvinistic anti-feminist joke riff going

1369
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:28,127
To ask me about the fish

1370
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:35,807
Oh my God

1371
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:38,623
This is great this is

1372
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,543
It's like next level

1373
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,831
Together is a ritual

1374
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,695
This is big-time

1375
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,023
Wow

1376
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,815
Like I'm excited out with other comic

1377
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,887
Hope my p**** gets hired again

1378
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:24,703
Well we're out here.

1379
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,031
You're going to head back to that green room

1380
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,055
Where I belong

1381
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,359
I think

1382
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,383
Take that

1383
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,455
We're all going to die

1384
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,015
Play Percy Jackson position of respect

1385
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,087
I think that

1386
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:44,159
Feminism is not about random handjobs

1387
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,999
Maybe it's about people being okay with

1388
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,791
If that's what you want to do go for it

1389
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,327
You know but it's not like

1390
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:54,911
I don't know if they're family spaces that are like

1391
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:55,679
Subway

1392
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:56,447
I don't want to

1393
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:59,519
Give random handjobs look you can't come

1394
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,823
I'll tell you this Elizabeth Cady Stanton

1395
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,639
Very against random handjob

1396
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:06,431
0 random handjobs

1397
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:07,199
We're giving out

1398
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:09,247
What's in the early days of feminist

1399
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,527
That's just drew

1400
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:13,599
I just drove down this is this is an educational for me

1401
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,623
Mary wolf

1402
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:17,439
Rolled up into hating

1403
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:20,511
Random handjob

1404
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:23,583
31 last clip here cuz they take some calls

1405
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,631
And collar

1406
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:27,167
Perspective

1407
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,775
And this is

1408
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,055
Not good

1409
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:35,615
There's there's a reason Andrew take out

1410
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,151
Man he promotes Hatteras

1411
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,175
Sexuality

1412
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:39,711
Making money

1413
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,759
Massillon

1414
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,831
Will you make something out of this

1415
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:49,951
Talk about reason take got banned from YouTube

1416
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,231
Nothing but

1417
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:53,535
Steers and queers and I don't see any horns

1418
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,375
That's funny hahaha funny

1419
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,143
It's not

1420
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:58,911
No

1421
01:17:59,423 --> 01:17:59,935
Also

1422
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:04,287
Paki also implies that there's only gay people and

1423
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:07,615
Cows

1424
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,919
No I don't see a lot of cows on there

1425
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,199
I-41

1426
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:13,503
I believe he was being insulting towards women

1427
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:19,903
Oh that's interesting I didn't hear cuz I mean Betty things come for Texas

1428
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,695
Right now like it's the

1429
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,487
Raptor

1430
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:26,303
Because men aren't allowed on there so he doesn't see any horns

1431
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,583
You see what I'm saying

1432
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:30,399
This is I could be mistaking that

1433
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,423
No I mean

1434
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:35,519
I'm not sure I mean he's just trying to save it and her tables

1435
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,799
Kicked off cuz he's not gay

1436
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:37,823
And that's not

1437
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:41,919
I think I think getting kicked off for promoting hex

1438
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:44,735
Heterosexuality and

1439
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:50,879
What was making money and masculine values

1440
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,927
I don't think you need to promote a thing

1441
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:54,975
That you have no choice in the matter of

1442
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:59,071
I don't think you need to promote a thing that is literally destroying the world as we

1443
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:05,471
And I don't think you need to promote another thing that is literally the destroying the world as we paint the making money thing is

1444
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:08,287
Our culture is entirely

1445
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:12,383
Inexorably tied to that you don't have to promote making money

1446
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:17,247
People love making money if I hurt myself I better have made money already

1447
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,039
That's the country we live in

1448
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,575
We understand

1449
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,343
Time

1450
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,623
I have money

1451
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:29,791
There's an expression time is money

1452
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:31,839
$2

1453
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:32,863
Yeah

1454
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:35,935
We we you know people who aren't

1455
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:38,495
You know privilege enrich

1456
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:40,543
Conceive of hours

1457
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:41,567
As a rate

1458
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,615
That you can make whatever like it's

1459
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:45,151
You don't need to promote

1460
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:47,967
Anyway

1461
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:48,991
I think of the show suck

1462
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:51,039
Queen talk

1463
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:54,111
Almost

1464
01:19:54,367 --> 01:20:00,511
I would have loved to rant about how people like like a queen

1465
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:03,071
Like you have this

1466
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:06,143
Like this show is

1467
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,167
Was was

1468
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,447
Really

1469
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:11,007
Neapolitan bar of bad

1470
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:13,567
S*** you know like it was just a variety

1471
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,360
You had this

1472
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,152
Deeply deeply racist Pig

1473
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:23,808
Right this very weird interview with Andrew turbo where he's trying to whitewash Christian nationalism in

1474
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,576
Middle phrase

1475
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:27,904
And then this interview was kind of just

1476
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:28,928
I don't know

1477
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:32,256
Bad comedy about feminism being bad

1478
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,024
Fart

1479
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,560
It's at the end

1480
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:39,680
Time line of laundering the reputation of Andrew Tate

1481
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,240
I just think all of it is

1482
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,008
Is

1483
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,056
I'm unspeakably

1484
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,616
Pointless and bad yeah

1485
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,408
Yeah it is a real

1486
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,456
It's a real like just

1487
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:56,064
Strikeout in every sense of the in every sense of the word you didn't get

1488
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:56,832
The bat off

1489
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,368
Off your shoulder now you just

1490
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:01,440
Watch the ball go by

1491
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,464
Slowly

1492
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,000
Very slowly

1493
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:04,768
Yeah

1494
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,816
Yeah it's it's

1495
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:08,352
We struck out on t-ball

1496
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,376
Pretty bad

1497
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,656
It's not good I feel

1498
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,192
A little bit dumb

1499
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,728
Weave

1500
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,008
Speedo I made

1501
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:18,336
Always I made the call that we were going to record late

1502
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:21,152
Because I wanted to try and get this episode Ugly

1503
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,432
The queen died

1504
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:28,064
The world is like 100 years

1505
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,112
Forever

1506
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:33,952

Yeah I do love

1508
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:44,448
The one Queen news that I really enjoyed reading about was people scrambling over like

1509
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:45,728
We're going to have

1510
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:46,752
To change our money

1511
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,288
Cuz like you know you don't

1513
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:56,224

Where's my face all that money is money isn't no longer good doesn't have that much time

1515
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,696

1516
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,232
Yeah

1517
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:10,816
I'm not going to get used to the King Charles I don't think

1518
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:14,400
You don't think Prince Charles my whole life

1519
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,936
I'm fine with

1520
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:20,544
You know I don't care that's the way to go that's the one I was going for

1521
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:22,848
Anyway

1522
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:25,408
It's bye-bye time

1523
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,968
Don't feel that way

1524
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:30,528
It feels like we are on our way to Cypress

1525
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:31,296

01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:33,088
