It was weird

82
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
Largely unsatisfying

83
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,847
Spy review

00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,719
I started listening to a bunch more tattoo

90
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
I realized

91
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,047
There's a 13-0 there's

92
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
No

93
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,375
Possible through line that you can

94
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
Can draw that way

95
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,423
Suggest that they are not

96
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
Play terrible

97
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:01,055
There's a strong people don't do enough

98
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,847
God's other job discussing

99
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,639
Write all of their songs

100
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,943
About how much these two guys love each other

101
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,967
Right and they

102
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
RV Class B

103
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,343
Fine yeah they're playing a role whatever I really care

104
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,367
The thing is

105
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
They love each other

106
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,231
And all of their damn songs are about how they have to run away

107
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,559
And it's not because they love each other and they want to elope

108
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
Because they're Russian

109
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
Right

110
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,447
I don't think people talked about that enough the fact it's like oh

111
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,239
The subtext of all these songs are

112
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:36,639
Political

113
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,687
Best in this fake lesbian Duo

114
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,991
Yeah

115
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,295
Yeah also they killed Kennedy

116
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:52,511
Trump is about to

117
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:57,887
It's going to come up in the episode today

118
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
If the Russians

119
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,191
Release the past

120
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,007
That means they're capable of anything

121
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
And that means

122
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,335
Tattoo Kilkenny

123
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,103
Probably

124
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,711
We're going to start with the Sunday

125
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,991
Starwood Sundays

126
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
It was kind of boring

127
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,855
And Alex is on a bulshit narrative

128
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
Where

129
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
This guy

130
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,183
This YouTuber

131
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,767
I released a video that he shot out the window of a hotel

132
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
A bunch of ambulance

133
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,655
Near the Las Vegas shooting already again

134
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,215
Is arguing

135
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,543
And the video is made to look like their people

136
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
Being who have been shot

137
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
The Hooters

138
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
Being Take It Outside

139
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
Of course

140
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,223
MapleStage shootings all over the place

141
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,295
And the reality is if you look into it

142
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,087
There wasn't

143
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,647
Right

144
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
The boss

145
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,463
The camera on that Hooters

146
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
All the time

147
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
Probably

148
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,887
Examiner

149
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
Department officials

150
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:08,543
Officers were inside the concert venue when the shooting was occurring started to direct concertgoers

151
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,103
Eastbound

152
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
Scooters

153
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
That's what you do when you have an act

154
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Active shooter into

155
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:18,527
You get everyone who can walk or crawl out of the immediate area where the gunshots

156
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
Targeted

157
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,599
Rescue units were on scene

158
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
Play Cindy

159
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
Inside ambulance

160
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,183
That's why there were emerging

161
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,255
Medical personnel placement inside the rest

162
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,303
Two units who were staging at

163
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,607
You can clearly hear the Las Vegas

164
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,143
Police Department radio traffic

165
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
From the night of the shooting

166
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
When what officer tells the

167
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
Dispatcher quote

168
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
Control 3 Mary 9

169
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
I'm at the center with other offer

170
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,639
Here we got a lot of wounded were sending them towards the Reno side

171
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
Towards scooters

172
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
In parentheses

173
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
He's out of harm

174
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015
There was also a dealer

175
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,831
Dammit

176
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
Agency plan is

177
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,647
Turned into a

178
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
Conspiracy theory

179
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:00,767
Also because because Hooters is also like

180
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,631
Casino in Las Vegas

181
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,727
And he went on the Nevada public radio on October 2nd

182
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
Gunshots outside

183
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
People were coming in

184
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,079
To the casino were shot and wounded

185
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,127
The dealer stated their bodies in front of

186
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,711
The casino that were just people who ran away from the venue

187
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
Who died on the

188
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
Jesus

189
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:26,367
F****** cry emergency medical personnel and police

190
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,903
Jeopardy to get people away from

191
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,975
So Alex Jones's narrative about it is just

192
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:37,375
Completely bogus and he's misrepresenting an article

193
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
Information

194
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,447
Ivan Ivan

195
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
My favorite

196
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,031
Part of the Las Vegas shooting

197
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,335
Is how quickly we've all forgotten about it

198
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,687
It's about time that a mass shooter

199
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,479
Goes into the NRA office

200
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Come on man

201
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
I don't disagree I don't

202
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
Also no

203
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,719
Come on I don't want you to

204
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,303
I mean look

205
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
That are not directing all of this

206
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,167
But once we need to start killing the guilty

207
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,263
I disagree with the agency

208
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
Free of that

209
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
I understand

210
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
I think

211
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,919
I think that there are people who are cloistered from the effects

212
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,455
These things you are

213
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,735
Heartless because of it

214
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,783
And maybe if they weren't

215
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,063
They wouldn't be so heartless

216
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
But at the same time

217
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
I don't want you to f***

218
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
Call me Centrist because of it

219
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,975
I in no way encourage

220
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
Alright

221
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,583
Shootings towards people who are cloistered

222
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
I don't think

223
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,191
Not wishing death on people is a Centrist

224
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:50,591
Position you're making an example

225
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,919
Only person willing to get down in the mud and actually solved

226
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:58,271
Skin problems that's why this Dynamic works

227
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,903
Safin I guess I'll talk to do

228
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:09,791
I don't know any good outcome

229
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,095
That's the b******* that Alex is spinning

230
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
Episode on Sunday

231
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
Also

232
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
It's just

233
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
There's going to be another one

234
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,287
What is going to be another we're always we're not going to do that

235
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:26,687
Another one

236
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,223
How do we Act

237
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
So we solve the problem

238
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,903
Because all of the it's not advocating shootings at NRA offices that is not how you solved the problem

239
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,695
You are correct

240
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:44,095
Great I'm glad we've come to that because otherwise

241
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,447
Jordan

242
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
I'm sorry

243
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,591
I know you brought up Las Vegas

244
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,663
I was just do bunking something that's true

245
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,735
I'm just ate it's just hard for me to judge

246
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
There's so many

247
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,111
Doing things that nobody didn't like Puerto Rico nobody

248
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:12,511
We've all forgotten about Puerto Rico I don't think we've still have issues their Florida is still going to be

249
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,047
Travel FEMA is not going to get enough

250
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,607
Nobody is doing anything about this s***

251
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,679
There's nothing we really can't we're all f****** helpless

252
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Adult

253
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
This sentiment

254
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,567
Watering Extreme Action

255
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,663
Po-boy

256
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
Is

257
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
Is I think

258
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,759
Understandable and I don't

259
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,295
Agree with that position

260
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
However

261
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,599
For

262
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,463
To play the role of Barry Manilow

263
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
Let's get on to the episode

264
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
Also he

265
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,375
He says that Alex gets into the JFK stop

266
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,655
But that'll come up later

267
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
Just got that then he's a

268
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,471
Full of a bunch of bulshit

269
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
But at the end of the episode

270
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,823
He plays a special report

271
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,871
Cuz I guess you just didn't want to do the whole show

272
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,663
Special Report

273
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,967
And breakdown

274
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,527
The goings-on

275
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
As it were

276
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:13,951
In this special report because I accidentally exposes himself

277
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,791
A little bit he actually he's trying to point out how much the media lies

278
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,583
Process

279
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
He does

280
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
Some

281
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,703
Horrendous spinning

282
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
I wanted to break

283
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
Take this down

284
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,287
Get to the bottom

285
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
Of what you

286
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,591
He's doing so here we go

287
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,335
Was just last week

288
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,503
President Trump making phone calls

289
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,879
Numbers

290
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
I'm soldiers

291
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,743
And others

292
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,335
Cavalier

293
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,639
Well you asked for it

294
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,223
Yeah that doesn't sound like him at all

295
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,319
No never would have believed that without without her

296
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
F****** say so

297
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,159
No it's already we have we have some lies

298
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
We already have

299
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
Some

300
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
Some problems

301
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,791
Spitting

302
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,911
The first of which is the idea

303
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,959
Congresswoman Wilson

304
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
Secretly your clandestine Lee list

305
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,311
Megan on the phone call

306
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
She's in the car

307
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,383
Yeah because she's friends with

308
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,015
Was calling they were in the car together. Really a clandestine

309
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,575
Something if you know it's not secret it's not

310
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:21,439
Sneaky it's not it's not anything of the sort is just misrepresenting that entirely

311
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
He's not

312
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
The story

313
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
He's not he's not explaining wax

314
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,591
Dead air

315
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,919
Look if I got to leave you hanging from *

316
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:45,247
Make sure everybody knows your fallible

317
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
You coming here

318
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,975
And then use that you f****** Shipmates

319
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:01,887
Advise

320
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,423
The congresswoman

321
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,959
Overheard this call

322
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,495
Because she was in the car very

323
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,479
Whenever you are calling someone who's

324
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,271
Whose family member has died

325
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:24,671
Message to just be that to their right they were a hero in this is a tragedy in my condolences sorry for you

326
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,511
But our president is so f****** stupid

327
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,791
So f****** awful

328
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,095
He's incapable of even basic MP

329
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,911
He is a legitimate site

330
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,215
I didn't we really need to accept

331
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,239
That are present

332
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,263
Is

333
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
A stereo

334
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,383
Today was lashing out at her and then

335
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
Kelly came out

336
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
And gave a speech

337
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
Yeah he's a piece

338
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,903
First of all

339
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
Made a bunch

340
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
Really vague

341
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,511
Society being better in the past

342
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,071
Stuff like that that one

343
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:09,471
To politicize soldiers practice that's not what

344
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,567
Inherently political

345
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:19,455
Unreasonable any goes on to explain

346
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
He was at

347
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,015
The speech that she gave it an a

348
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,039
FBI building

349
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,343
Naming

350
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,415
John Kelly was at the speech that Wilson

351
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,999
Eat his comments were that

352
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,071
Call me came out

353
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
Full speech

354
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
And then she got up and

355
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
That

356
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,239
Called Obama and got all the money

357
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,543
For the building to be made and he thought it was

358
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
Disgraceful

359
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
He

360
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,383
Understand where money comes from

361
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
No but

362
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,967
The idea of like I got the money to

363
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
You get this message

364
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
Has been pitching

365
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:00,671
So she's taking credit for opposed to some sort of magical

366
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,719
Just just the the goodness of

367
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
People's hearts

368
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,023
Or the necessity of the

369
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,631
The situation for that the FBI earned it or something

370
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,935
Yeah because a video of that speech has

371
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:16,543
Come out from

372
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
The ribbon-cutting has been

373
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,639
Unscheduled in 4 weeks

374
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
Recalled being told

375
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,455
The dedication is on the government's calendar

376
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
One problem

377
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
The FBI wants

378
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,295
The name of gorgeous edifice

379
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
At the same time

380
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
In 4 weeks

381
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,159
Everyone said that's impossible it takes at least 8 months

382
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
2 a year

383
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,999
How's the president's office

384
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
I said I'm a school

385
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,607
Principal and I said excuse my French ohel know

386
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,887
We're going to get this done

387
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,423
Immediately I wanted to attack

388
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
I went to the speaker

389
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
Speaker Boehner

390
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,519
And said Mr Speaker I need your help

391
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,799
BFB I need your help in

392
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,847
The country needs your help and we have no time to waste

393
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,895
Boehner went into Attack Mode

394
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,943
Any two days pull out pulled it out of

395
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,711
Committee brought it to

396
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,735
To the floor for a vote

397
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
Did you goes on

398
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,319
Excite that Marco Rubio was very helpful

399
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,391
It's otherwise bipartisanship

400
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:08,767
That ended up getting this done in a way that no one thought could be done right we collaborated and got the

401
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,583
This building named after the FBI agents who have been killed

402
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:18,239
Does not talk about how she ended up getting all the funding for the building or anything like that

403
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
Speech praising government

404
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,799
Actually work

405
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
Right

406
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,431
So at that point

407
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,991
Trump started lashing out today

408
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:33,087
Great I believe in her

409
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,415
And then the other day it came out did Mike Johnson

410
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,975
The lady in question who received the call

411
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,255
Donald

412
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,047
Trump she came out

413
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
I'll just

414
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,863
This Time magazine article about her

415
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:49,471
The Widow of a US Soldier recently died in combat

416
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,263
Her late husband as a hero in

417
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,079
Confirm interview Monday that President Donald Trump

418
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,407
In a condolence call center cuz her husband quotes

419
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,943
Knew what he signed up for

420
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:03,039
My usual Johnson who was married to Fallen Army Sergeant David Johnson

421
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:07,391
Good Morning America that her phone call with Trump made her quote cry even more

422
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,975
Because you said Trump apparently did not remember her husband's name

423
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,767
Until he had military papers in front of

424
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,119
The president has signed up for but it hurts anyway

425
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,935
Myesha Johnson said of ladavid Johnson

426
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,727
Call sweetheart

427
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,007
And it made me cry

428
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,823
Because I was very angry at the tone of his voice and how he said

429
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,127
He couldn't remember my husband's name

430
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
That's probably more than you

431
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
You know

432
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:36,319
The way he remember my husband's name is because he

433
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,111
He told me he had my husband's reporting

434
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
In front of him

435
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:46,303
I heard him stumbling on trying to remember my husband's name and that's what hurt me the most

436
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,607
Because if my husband is out here fighting for our country

437
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,399
And he risked his life for our country

438
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,191
Why can't you remember his name

439
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,751
And that's what made me upset and cry even more because

440
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,775
My husband was an awesome

441
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,543
Soldier

442
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,823
She goes on to say likewise

443
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,847
F*** what I make this up

444
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
Not in those words

445
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,831
I don't understand why this is a story

446
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
I really don't

447
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,415
Brooke is awful

448
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,719
What did you think was going to have

449
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,791
If it did happen well

450
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,327
It didn't it would be incest

451
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,911
There's no way that that call would have meant any

452
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,447
Anything no matter what

453
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,983
What is a meeting with call

454
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,031
And of course it was something that

455
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,055
He used to hurt

456
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,103
Somebody still further

457
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,639
Lunatic

458
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,943
Somehow

459
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,759
Because our attention spans are so terrible

460
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,783
Lnr media

461
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,111
Is I do agree with Alex Jones in this regard

462
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,135
F****** awful

463
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
Write this is

464
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,695
We have the worst

465
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:49,279
You can have the same premise of a different conclusion this possible

466
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,607
Unacceptable that we have such low attempt

467
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,447
We have to find a new way to hate Trump every single day

468
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,727
We've already

469
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,751
We done enough

470
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
Like in the

471
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,335
Title of this guy should be impeached

472
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
We hit it

473
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,895
We hit it a year ago

474
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,199
President

475
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,247
He had already committed all the crimes

476
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,295
So there's no reason to

477
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,831
You keep finding new stories

478
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,647
What we should be doing is every f****** day

479
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,928
Hammer home

480
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,000
There should not be any others

481
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
Stories

482
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,816
To just be every single day the front page

483
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
Should be gofucker

484
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,520
And everyday that you might not there might be a little by yourself

485
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,544
You should be impeached

486
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
Alright

487
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,504
You're coming in way too hot

488
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,576
You get me

489
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,856
My face is getting a little red

490
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
Superboy

491
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,976
Anymore I can't read the news

492
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,048
What is there to read

493
00:21:56,352 --> 00:22:00,704
That's not bad there's a lot of Phillips

494
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
I want to go back

495
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,288
Salinger f******

496
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
It was fun

497
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
Fun dance

498
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
Define

499
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,968
The scream at me for

500
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,040
Do you know what the theory

501
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,064
Exhausting

502
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
You could just

503
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,904
You're telling me

504
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,696
Self-righteousness

505
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,464
Is hard

506
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,024
So at this point

507
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,656
What ended up happening

508
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,056
Not people not named Donald Trump and John Kelly doing

509
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,592
Right so

510
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360
Now let's

511
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,152
The through the rest

512
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,968
Special Report

513
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
We can point out

514
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,296
Joya

515
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,320
I swear he's being

516
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
Completely

517
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
Bucked up

518
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,440
Gold Star Family

519
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,232
Call Dupree

520
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,992
Call people

521
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,088
I would posit that

522
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
Do you know what the outcome would be

523
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,160
Yeah that would be

524
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
You shouldn't do that

525
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
Look a lot of president

526
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
You

527
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,888

Message robot

529
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
Mike Pence

530
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
Sure he can at least

531
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,776
Fame human Amo

532
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616
There is a point of going to punch

533
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,992
Omnipod

534
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,088
It doesn't matter either way it's in

535
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,160
Insincere he doesn't give a f*** so let's get on to the next clip

536
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,256
This is about

537
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,424
Ohio Optometry board

538
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:22,528
Frederica Wilson

539
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,832
She's so thrilled

540
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,160
You mean to tell me that I've become so important

541
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,232

It's amazing

544
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,816
That is absolutely phenomenal

545
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,864
I have to tell my kids I'm a Rockstar

546
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,912
She's being facetious

547
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,216
She's saying it's ridiculous that you're paying attention

548
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,776
Send to me a lot of big issues to deal with

549
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,336
She's not calling herself a rockstar

550
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:52,224

551
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,760

Then to MBA

556
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:04,256
I just don't think that anyone who listens to him

557
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,584
So here we go this is

558
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,656
Shut up

559
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,936

And then used it

567
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,024
So

00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,072

Mainstream media it's all terrible no one likes it

00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,848
It's kind of goes back to what you were saying another you don't have

574
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,152
Interest in defending

575
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,456
No the media.

576
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,784
Lost they lost any credibility with me a long time

577
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,856
Asleep at the wheel

578
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
Deez Nuts

579
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:06,208
They're run by the same corporate people that run the

580
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,256
Albuterol

581
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:13,120
Go to the research came here and show you infowars.com

582
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,168
For the last month

583
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:15,936
6.6

584
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,472
Million Global unique

585
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
Reviews

586
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,824
But if you see here a lot of them

587
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,848
Almost all of the

588
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,152
Come from October 2nd

589
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
3rd and

590
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,688
Fourth

591
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:29,504
They were up over a million views

592
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,528
Those days

593
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,552
On the 3rd and 4th

594
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,368
The shooting happened on October

595
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,904
We're first and immediately

596
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,440
I started spinning

597
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,000
How they get these

598
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
Is Peet's in there traffic

599
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,840
Is when something really tragic happen

600
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
They lie about

601
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,936
And you see you can see everyone who's watching this

602
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,984
Can see there are very few

603
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,264
And if you go through it

604
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,592
If you go back to the history you'll see the exact same thing whenever something

605
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
Traumatic happened

606
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,432
That may or may not have a racial bent to it

607
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,480
Because I was injecting that

608
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,576
It's just like it's just like gun manufacturer

609
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,880
They never make more money than after a match

610
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
All of their money

611
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:15,584
MSNBC

612
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
Members of the name

613
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,168
Here you have a

614
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
Are million Global unique hair

615
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,056
If you lucky

616
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,080
That's not enough

617
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:29,152
No it's not

618
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,712
It's still more of a dent out a percentage

619
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:38,112
Frightening less frightening presented is destroying all of these

620
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:43,232
Isn't the highest

621
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,256
I'm sure if CNN

622
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,792
New York Times

623
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,840
Is there traffic was available publicly

624
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,864
Like on quadcast

625
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,144
Utseya much

626
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,448
But if you look at this

627
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
Fourth

628
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,776
Steve like there's much more reasonable

629
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
Sun Valley

630
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,848
To the traffic pattern of MS

631
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
DC whereas

632
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,408
Alex Jones Infowars

633
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,432
Has almost nothing

634
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
Until some tragedy

635
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
And then

636
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:09,344
So everyone hating the MSNBC

637
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,368
Kind of like

638
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,136
Kind of b*******

639
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,440
And then again I also argue

640
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,720
Do that

641
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
Who is doing the

642
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
Politicize

643
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,608
That's the real question

644
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
Causation

645
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
Fallacy going on

646
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:29,824
Representative

647
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,104
Complicated

648
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
These people are doing

649
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
I don't

650
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,224
You could get it to a chicken or egg

651
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
Fingering

652
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
It's not worth it

653
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,552
It's a complex

654
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
And

655
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,600
A lot of people

656
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,880
If not most people

657
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,488
Whenever an idiot like Alex Jones

658
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,280
Turn that into a very simple

659
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
Narrative

660
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
They feel like well

661
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,864
VSCO

662
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,912
Sit down into a simple narrative that I can

663
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
He must be correct

664
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,032
Yeah same situation that all strong men

665
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,312
I have used throughout his

666
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,592
It is

667
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,896
I understand this system and I can

668
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
Can fix it with

669
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,944
MMA

670
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,736
Actually get into a position

671
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,016
To do something about it

672
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,040
And they realized

673
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,832
System

674
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,112
Hayden's work

675
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:17,184
To the theory in this next

676
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,232
Why

677
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,536
Demonized

678
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,072
John Kelly

679
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,632
Cuz it's slightly

680
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
The General

681
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
Kelly

682
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,200
Oh my gosh

683
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,000
Call Shannon

684
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,144
You shouldn't use the

685
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,168
I'm soldiers

686
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,056
Should be honored

687
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,920
Humanity

688
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,232
True colors

689
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,768
When they flip

690
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,592
So I considering Alex's torture

691
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,944
Kelly makes

692
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,224
Some passing references

693
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,624
And weird like

694
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:59,584
Hangout

695
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:03,936
About a month ago that I was going to bring this up but I'd like to also still give a

696
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,472
Shut up

697
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,664
How to get in that I was also want to bring it up right there

698
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,456
Damn the Centrist right there

699
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:21,344
It makes a great point that a month ago Alex was saying the general Kelly

700
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,744
With a addictive sedative

701
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
Kelly

702
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
In honoring women

703
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:34,144
And the best way to do that is to poison Trump I think that's true

704
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,704
I think that isn't actually true thing

705
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336
To pull out of it

706
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,616
In order to

707
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,152
To make his argument

708
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,200
Any more appealing or more meaningful

709
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,736
To the people who listen to

710
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,272
Code

711
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
Dum Dums

712
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,600
Dance to make so much of this about

713
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,184
Position

714
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,000
Bonanza

715
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,816
Like make pasta

716
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,584
Prince those things

717
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,656
Was talking about

718
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,704
It wasn't the point of analysis make

719
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
Can get much more

720
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,752
The point of it because he knows

721
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,592
Oh he also told to completely lying

722
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,384
Misrepresenting story about

723
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,224
Speech that she gave at the unveiling of buildings

724
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,992
Or christening

725
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,528
The building whatever its called

726
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,344
Gender reveal party for the building

727
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,208
Nice yeah so she like

728
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,280
If you focused on that part of it which I think is

729
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,304
People are our Focus

730
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:37,888
He would have no leg to stand on So You focus on the vague

731
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
Is 2

732
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,936
Anti-abortion

733
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,960
Sentimental

734
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,008
Can't think of anybody who does that too

735
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:47,104
A little bit more about Alex

736
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:05,536
America

737
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,400
And the president

738
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,728
You f****** Tyler Freeland gardener

739
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,264
Yourself

740
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,944
Y'all really

741
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,600
That was an addict on their video

742
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,256
General

743
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,840
When he said

744
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,200
Defeat what he said

745
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:06,208
Call Stahl

746
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,072
Etsy

747
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,376
Falling on her face

748
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,960
I would argue that

749
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:24,384
The one who's doing a substantial amount

750
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,504
AutoTrader

751
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,808
Handle that

752
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,624
I can't handle that

753
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,904
He took this

754
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,696
High Road b******* about

755
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,488
All the ships only

756
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,256
He does

757
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
He took this

758
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,840
B******* f******

759
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
This is what I said

760
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,680
This is what exactly what I'm always saying about

761
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:50,496
This whole I call when they go low we go high

762
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,776
That's right

763
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,592
They don't care I don't care one way or the other

764
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,872
Bill go whatever the f***

765
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,664
They feel like you're not going

766
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,456
So you might as well do something

767
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,248
Zig zags

768
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,296
It doesn't f****** matter what way

769
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
What Vape

770
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,904
Think we pretending that the way they react

771
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,184
To something that we think

772
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,000
Is going to matter one way or the other

773
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:15,584
But now a little bit

774
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:20,448
Because Frederica Wilson did come out and say that

775
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,728
The comment

776
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,496
But she's a

777
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,520
An Empty Barrel

778
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,544
Is a racist

779
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,592
It's a little bit

780
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,872
I see you in some way

781
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:31,712
Jumping on

782
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,736
Completely not true

783
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,296
Here is an article in front of me from CNN

784
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,344
From the 20th of this month

785
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,368

Indigo through

788
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
There's an origin

789
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,816
Play-Doh

790
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,584
Can't quite find

791
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,352

795
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,824
Or Buy store noise and

796

Complaining

00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,152
Avoid tolls

798
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,480
Play some Shakespeare

799
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:08,064

800
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,344
Glass filled with water

And great music

807
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,936
They go through and

808
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,472
There's no real tradition of it

809
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,008
But there is

810
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,544
A part of it that is

811
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,360
I wear this is where I take away Alex

812
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,128

Suggested the due to Kelly's Boyhood

820

A Boston Neighborhood

821
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,768
There was still largely segregated

822
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,792
Destroys of words

823
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,560
Describe two wheels

Anjali dehumanize

825
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,424
She was nothing but An Empty Barrel to him

826

Hampstead O'Donnell

827
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,496
He refused to give her the Dignity of an

828
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:02,592
And there is some Credence to that now whether his motivation

829
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,616
Racist or not

830
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:07,456
In this article is not that they don't fall on them

831
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:11,296
That side but it is it is it is interesting to go back and listen to

832
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,320
Cuz he doesn't say her name

833
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,136
20 minutes

To the etymology

836
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,816
No he's at the gate 20 minutes

837
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,864
After this story the etymology

838
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,192
Which is like

839
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:32,288
NVM smurd bunking the idea that there's races

840
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,312
Roots today

841
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,080
Alex is just

842
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,384
I mean is way off on everything

843
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,176
Oh man

844
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,480
What are we doing

845
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
What are we doing

846
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,832
Really I don't know

00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:48,928
These people what kind of what kind of line producer is that one of these shows going

848
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,208
Here's our story

849
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,768
We're going to spend all of this time

850
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,816
Phone call

851
00:37:55,072 --> 00:38:00,448
From a sociopath that we knew was not going to go well

852
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,496
Mean anything Brave

853
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,080
I don't want to I don't want to do this whole like

854
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,104
What about

855
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
Bulshit

856
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,640
Of like

857
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,176
Well

858
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,712
Important

859
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,480
To talk about right

860
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
Spare

861
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,928
Alex

862
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,208
Disposition

863
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
Not racist

864
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
Because they're a bunch of

865
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,512
Democrats

866
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,304
In Congress who are mentally ill

867
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:43,712
Nancy Pelosi just as senile and mentally ill as he posts

868
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,720
In charge of our country

869
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,768
Assholes like you Alex

870
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,048
Assholes like

871
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,584
You yeah I mean it's a great

872
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,608
It's a great line

873
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,656
It's a good point but

874
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,936
If you if you get

875
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,216
If you get down to it like

876
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:08,288
Someone who he really supports right now is Roy Moore

877
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,360
Roy Moore is loaded

878
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,152
Yeah

879
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,736
He makes all kinds of arguments.

880
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,528
Only about how I weird

881
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,832
We need to be a Christian Nation

882
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,624
All of the things that go bad orbit

883
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
Because we've drifted

884
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,160
From Christ

885
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,464
I all this stuff you refused

886
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
To take down

887
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,256
VIP

888
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,536
The Ten Commandments

889
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:35,936
At the Statehouse is not allowed because he committed all the crimes because the courts

890
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,288
Cuz as a judge

891
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,312
Is the most important

892
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,616
Thing you can do is refuse to honor the con

893
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
Constitution

894
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,200
Whatever they take field officer always like

895
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
Hey and the cons

896
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,624
Constitution do not listen to that at all

897
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,648
He started doing speaking

898
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,952
Took the ten

899
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:06,144
Recently

900
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,704
Speech recently said that we're so

901
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,240
Such a divided country we got

902
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,520
The blacks fighting the whites

903
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,592
We got the Reds in the yellows

904
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:20,480
That's such a journey like

905
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,016
We got to stop being racist

906
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:25,344
Mrbeast kundu

907
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:33,536
But then he got into some hot water about those like

908
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:38,656
Weldon that song God loves the little children

909
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:45,056
Maybe the song is awesome

910
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:51,712
Alex anymore

911
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,296
I would rather take someone who Miss speaks

912
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,064
Every now and

913
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,832
Again.

914
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,112
Someone who is

915
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:04,512
DieHard religious zealot and wants to legislate the other comment that I found

916
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,792
I don't know what the window close

917
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,840
But basically goes along the lines

918
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,632
Just like

919
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,656
Swear in

920
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,960
The Bible the Bible the only thing that matters

921
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,752
Dominica

922
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,800
You know why Buddha didn't make a

923
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,848
All I didn't make us it was

924
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,128
The Christian God

925
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,200
How's the other religions are meeting

926
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,480
Like dude

927
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:25,760
Come on

928
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,320
Come on that is

929
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,600
I guess

930
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,416
But yeah

931
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:35,744
In a bad way

932
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,768
A perfectly

933
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:39,072
Population of the Republican Party

934
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,632
They will gladly vote

935
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,680
For somebody who shot all over the cow

936
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,240
And lost his job

937
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,544
That the Republican Party

938
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,824
Sky Zone

939
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:54,431
You guys hate America now if you for evereve everybody who's like

940
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,735
The Constitution is all about the

941
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,039
The first amendment in your like you you don't care about

942
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:06,719
So shut the fuk up now if you are Senator and you say Korea instead of Crimea accidentally

943
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:11,071
Alex will talk about it for six months or if you say

944
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:11,839
Instead of trump

945
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,375
Six months of cover

946
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,703
Instead of

947
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:20,031
You're backing people's safety

948
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,335
And the freedom quite frankly

949
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,383
These people are

950
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,967
The service of what they think is right

951
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,015
The worst human beings on the

952
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,551
Undoubtedly

953
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,343
So we got one more clip left

954
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,623
Of this special report

He was legally removed from his job

959
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,543
Shooting all over the Constitution

960
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,871
Right

961
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,711
I'm sorry for going to

962
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:04,319
General Kelly

963
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,903
Infowars.com

964
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,743
Call

965
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,239
The difference between

966
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:29,407
She's always creating another character gear if they wore it

967
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:35,807
Right and that's the strawberry reality of my shoes

968
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,087
What about her husband ladavid

969
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,135
But that

970
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:39,903
I actually feel

971
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,183
Think would have been better

972
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,743
Waterview

973
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:48,863
Good old laugh out of that cry

974
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,191
If somebody says that s*** to you cuz that's banana

975
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
Cuz defaulted

976
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,495
Is the switch into a character

977
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,775
It sort of embodies raped

978
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,511
All right fair enough the media is not doing its job

979
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,279
I agree with you

980
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,143
Like we've already discussed are you Alex

981
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,959
It's not a good job

982
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,495
Just got to the beginning of the episode

983
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,335
Bringing into his narrative a misrepresented

984
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,359
Pizza video that 8

985
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,383
Citizen journalist

986
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,151
Captured

987
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,687
Out the window of his hotel

988
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,711
Lick

989
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,735
Great

990
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,271
Everyone can do this

991
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,807
But it doesn't mean it's

992
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,135
Real it doesn't mean that anyone has any information

993
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,159
About the context

994
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,231
Anybody can have a camera capture stuff out of car

995
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,535
Contact anybody can have a blog post

996
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,583
Whatever they want on it it doesn't

997
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,167
Knowledge

998
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,191
Sprite

999
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:59,263
It's not journalism it's not truth it's not real

1000
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
We are at the

1001
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,847
The point now though where every interaction

1002
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,615
With Trump

1003
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,383
Should be record

1004
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:11,551
Every interaction with the police but is everything recorded isn't it look for Trumpeter like presidential records

1005
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,575
About

1006
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,135
Oh like she should have started recording

1007
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:19,999
Right like you should've if you ever get anywhere near any of these people you show

1008
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,279
Turn your phone on and

1009
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,863
Recording apparently cuz that's the only cuz now if

1010
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,167
When we're dealing with a

1011
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,447
Complete lack of abject

1012
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
Reality Bites

1013
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:29,983
Between different

1014
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,007
Which we are

1015
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,591
The only way is to

1016
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,615
To pull out hard Eva

1017
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,407
Record it

1018
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,735
Recording everything you do

1019
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,527
That way you can read back the tape

1020
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,599
Check the tape

1021
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,647
Apparently

1022
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,439
In which case where were you doing

1023
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:52,511
35 minutes

1024
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:57,119
Nixon apparently Donald Trump's daughter-in-law has said that there's a transcript

1025
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,911
The phone call but Dwight Howard

1026
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,679
Denied

1027
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,519
No problem

1028
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,079
So that we move on to Monday

1029
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,383
Has anybody

1030
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,407
Ever described

1031
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,759
I know one guy

1032
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,039
His name

1033
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:18,879
Alex Jones John Barron

1034
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:22,207
His fake publicist character

1035
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:28,607
We're jumping into Monday now

1036
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,423
Here's how I was doing opens the show on Monday

1037
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,727
It starts with a

1038
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:36,287
Batman ends up in something Market dice

1039
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,103
It's just I see

1040
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,895
And I was hot dog and I'm language

1041
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:48,063
Windover 1984 1776 you're listening

1042
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,135
The Alex Jones Show

1043
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:55,487
Altruistic

1044
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,023
Vision for us

1045
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,839
They are the Fallen soul

1046
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,727
Everyday

1047
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,687
Hold on

1048
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,223
We need to reboot

1049
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,271
Cuz I accidentally thought that was

1050
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,391
The chat room.

1051
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:30,815
I just bought

1052
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:31,839
Can actually listen to

1053
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,655
We are as a society

1054
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,263
Here is the world economic forum

1055
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,823
That's basically Bilderberg Group public

1056
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,127
Coming out and saying

1057
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:47,455
I feel deeply ashamed

1058
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,991
Ashamed

1059
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,295
That was respectful

1060
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:57,183
Sorry about that alright

1061
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:03,583
And I know how to control your mind using electromagnetic waves

1062
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:09,215
Almost 20 years ago

1063
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:14,335
For the CIA admitted they were adding augmentation system

1064
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,383
In the Baltimore area

1065
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,943
Well they were actually

1066
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,295
Yes we're not in Kansas anymore

1067
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:27,647
Biscuits to hamamoto style show

1068
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,463
This is an article that Alex's rapper

1069
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:34,047
Printing out of the world economic forum

1070
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,583
It sounds scary as s***

1071
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,423
Can now control how you think

1072
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,727
They are going to

1073
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,519
To spend the next article

1074
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,543
The next

1075
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,079
You know bylines is going

1076
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,175
Word by word me now control you do

1077
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,455
Control your mind

1078
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,223
Do not read all the

1079
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:56,831
Headline

1080
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:02,463
If a sensationalized headlines also I would like to

1081
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,231
Really important

1082
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,767
It's Outta control

1083
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:05,791
How are you

1084
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,863
What you think

1085
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,143
Little Ray

1086
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,703
So here's what this this article is about

1087
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,007
A team of researchers from Boston universe

1088
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,055
She has explored the possibility of enhance

1089
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,591
A person's ability to learn

1090
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,615
Control their behavior

1091
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:22,431
If it's not saying they can't control your behavior

1092
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:26,783
Your ability to control your own behavior

1093
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:27,807
How people feel

1094
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:28,831
By stimulating

1095
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:33,183
The brain Boston University researcher Robert Reinhardt

1096
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,719
Simulation called

1097
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,999
Cranial alternator

1098
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,535
Current stimulation

1099
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,559
Also known as a

1100
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,607
Turbocharged

1101
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,655
Two brain regions that influence how we learn

1102
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,191
If you make an error

1103
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,727
This brain Area Fire

1104
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,775
If I tell you you made an error

1105
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,543
It also fire

1106
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,847
If something surprises you it fires

1107
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,639
Rinehart said in a bu research

1108
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,407
Search press release

1109
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,967
Referring to the medial frontal cortex

1110
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:56,991
Booty calls

1111
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,783
The quote alarm Bell of the brain

1112
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,831
Rinehart and his colleagues found that

1113
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,855
Stimulating this region

1114
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:04,159
Venezuela is the lateral prefrontal cortex

1115
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,183
To change how a person

1116
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:05,951
Learnt

1117
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,975
These are maybe the

1118
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:09,023
Two most fundamental brain areas involved

1119
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,303
Executive function

1120
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,071
A selfie

1121
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:11,839
Control

1122
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,143
They published a study about this and here's what they did

1123
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,935
Rhinehart's team test

1124
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,983
30 healthy people each wearing a soft

1125
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,007
Cap with electrodes

1126
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
Stimulation

1127
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,567
The test was simple

1128
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,591
Each subject

1129
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
Had to press a button

1130
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,383
Everyone points

1131
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,151
7 Seconds

1132
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,687
In the first three rounds of test

1133
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,479
The researchers either cranked up the

1134
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,015
Synchronicity between the two loud

1135
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,807
Disrupted it or did not

1136
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,599
The participants brain Act

1137
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,623
Activity monitored by

1138
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,647
Danelectro and see

1139
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,439
Yu-Gi-Oh

1140
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,743
Showed statistically significant results

1141
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,535
When the brain waves were up

1142
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,095
The subject learn faster and made fewer mistakes

1143
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:44,863
Which they correct

1144
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,399
When they made the mistakes

1145
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,423
Correct

1146
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,215
When do brain waves

1147
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:52,031
Disrupted they made more errors unlearned more slowly

1148
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,823
What was even more surprising

1149
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,615
Was it when 30 new participants

1150
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,151
Took an adjusted version of the T

1151
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:01,503
The group started with their brain activity temporarily disrupted

1152
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,295
Then receive stimulation

1153
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,575
In the middle of the activity

1154
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:07,391
The participants quickly recovered their original brains

1155
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
Synchronicity

1156
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,183
And learning

1157
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,463
And learned behavior

1158
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,767
We were shocked by the results

1159
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,047
How quickly the effects of

1160
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,583
Stimulation could be reverse

1161
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,631
So basically all they've done

1162
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:21,471
You can stimulate that allow you to learn faster

1163
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,751
The bigger question

1164
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,287
Summers another brain

1165
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,311
Research

1166
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,079
Scientist

1167
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,359
At Boston University

1168
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,383
Who is not apart of

1169
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,687
The bigger question

1170
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,455
Summers noted

1171
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,735
Is how far apart

1172
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,271
How far a person can go with

1173
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,831
Who doesn't want to have their brain

1174
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,599
Performance enhance

1175
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,647
This could produce the same effect

1176
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,415
Does nootropic

1177
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,439
Smart drug

1178
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,463
But with fewer put

1179
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,231
Central side effects

1180
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,839
Could work his the brain is stimulated directly

1181
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:48,863
Having access

1182
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,399
Such technology

1183
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,959
But Edwin smart drugs

1184
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,751
Should have access to such technology

1185
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:55,775
And

1186
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,311
Whether or not this March

1187
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,847
But the point is

1188
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,383
This is a very interest

1189
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,967
Study has nothing to do with brain control or anything like that

1190
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,735
Brainwashing

1191
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,271
Alex is completely lying

1192
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,551
About that

1193
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,111
He sells brain pills right

1194
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:14,719
Of course he has a vested interest in making you afraid of those thing

1195
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,743
Right

1196
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,303
There's a certain part of me that believes

1197
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,863
No no mainstream Outlet

1198
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,911
Should be allowed to report on science

1199
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,679
At all

1200
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:27,263
Because that's why we get

1201
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:32,383
Cancer turn your balls into two oranges like white

1202
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:38,015
What are we doing that because we know that if the article is going to be like

1203
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:42,367
Six scientists at MIT put a little thing on a mouse and maybe that help

1204
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:47,487
Call Sara Doran still 20 years away from being useful like they just love these

1205
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,767
Headlines that are like

1206
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:56,959
Right it's just b*******

1207
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,751
And that's why you don't read articles

1208
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:05,151
You just now read this

1209
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,943
That's where it goes from there

1210
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:12,319
First big piece of news today nothing to cover in more detail

1211
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,111
Coming up in the shower

1212
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,487
That we must be extremely moral

1213
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:23,327
We must be informed and involved

1214
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,375
And basically

1215
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,799
A b

1216
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:36,895

Future sci-fi superhuman soldiers more destructive than nuclear bomb

1218
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,575
Don't feel no fear or pain

1219
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,903
The globalist want machines

1220
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,951
Because he'll follow illegal orders

1221
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:53,535
Machines

1222
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:54,815
Less human

1223
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:01,215
I will

Had to say here it is

1226
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,615
More and more I'm noticing

1227
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,175
That

1228
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:10,943
Alex takes

1229
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:16,063
Note Alex cover Alex covers

Put out to the world

1233
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,231
Which should be no surprise to

1235
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:29,119

Military time

1239
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,567
Like what

1240
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,847
We should be making it

1241
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:45,247
I don't know this is a bad idea

1242
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,271
Into that accident

1244
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,391
Very ill-advised weapon they should have

Put something low-to-the-ground with

1246
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,791

Twisted mind and that is our destruction

1254
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:25,951
So

1255
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,767
I'm sorry we took a little break

1256
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,791
Waterton

We learned about some aliens

1266
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,815
So he is much closer than even we were presenting

1267
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:09,215
We've got a real shot of future

Very different also need to pause

1282
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,207
How is 1

00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:04,255
By an archetype

1285
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,279
Well

1286
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:11,423
I think it's a literary device I am fairly certain that

1287
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:13,215
The playwright near me

1288
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,847
Now I'm never going to remember it it's not Archimedes it's aeschylus

1289
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,407
Proposed the archetype

1290
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:24,223
Okay

1291
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,247
Whatever

1292
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:30,367
Identify with an archetype

Also what does what

1298
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:47,519
Cyclotron what was it he was talking about

1299
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:51,359
A couple of Science words and put him right not important

1300
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:52,895
I don't know

1301
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:55,199

I like the kingsman the first episode of that

1306
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:17,727
Yeah I just hypothesizing but I know it's going on

1313
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:46,911
I think you should

1314
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:51,263
Also I did Little Shop of Horrors

1315
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:57,663
Really get bummed out when he brings up the hybrids

1316
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,687
Chimeras

1317
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:06,111
Really disappoints me and it makes me like why you playing like a shout-out to the

1318
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:12,511
Mantador the spider leadership are they are they hybrids or are they just super intelligent

1319
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:15,583
Is there globalist analog of

1320
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,143
The spider leadership spider l

1321
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:23,007
Are the spider leadership members globalist

1322
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:28,127
It's unclear the global is there real leadership

1323
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:31,711
Put two and two together for the Raptors

1324
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,295
So the thing is I love that

1325
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,063

1327
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:42,207
Stupid

1328
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:49,119
I just made up to and then I made

1329
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:51,679
Find a through line

1330
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:54,239
In this next clip Alex Jones

1331
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:57,823
They don't watch it

1332
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,871
Namely

1333
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,663
2 + 2

1334
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:10,367
Here's The Cutting Edge information

1335
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,695
Why they say he's fake news because he's the real

1336
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,279
Before

1337
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,815
I'm up for

1338
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,095
Before

1339
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,911
He's been really workshopping that is a new catchphrase

1340
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:29,567
It's not but it's a lie but

1341
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,479
I mean we've gone through at least four

1342
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,247
Specific

1343
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:38,783
Uzi

1344
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,831
Today's of his show

1345
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,367
Bogus narrative

1346
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,439
That's why Alex is not because

1347
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:48,511
There's globalist that are against you or anything like that

1348
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:51,839
It's a f****** illusion yeah we can put one together

1349
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,375
Exactly much easier

1350
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,143
So faster

1351
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,447
Anybody else

1352
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:58,239
Will research will focus

1353
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,799
Buy the products

1354
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:06,431
Only sales

1355
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:13,087
December 1st now I thought was going to be

1356
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:22,815
But now we're about a month earlier

1357
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:31,519
Great the Easter sale is still going on by fractal

1358
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:32,799
It's it's

1359
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:38,943
We love to play the game where there's that sales pivot and then I deserve to turn it off

1360
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:41,503
How long a lot of these ads are

1361
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:44,831
I started to listen to a little bit of David Night Show

1362
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,391
Movies with the app

1363
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,927
How long does

1364
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:52,255
He's pretty brief with them

1365
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,791
Sounds like less of a Salesman

1366
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:58,143
More structured way it was never like that

1367
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,447
Turning into a

1368
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,983
Swerve or whatever

1369
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:04,543
Every time he comes back from break

1370
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:10,943
You like I'd like to remind you of our specials

1371
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:12,735
As as a lively

1372
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:16,575
More or less like

1373
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,623
Coming back from a commercial break

1374
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:20,415
Always into a commercial

1375
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,695
It's kind of like

1376
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:22,463
This is the

1377
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,231
Excessive

1378
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:26,815
But you still it's less offensive because the way Alex doesn't

1379
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:30,655
You could be screaming about God knows what your kids blood is going to be

1380
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,679
Sucked out by

1381
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:38,079
Demon globalist

1382
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,103
Applying

1383
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,383
Quality

1384
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,455
What's you're absolutely

1385
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,503
What replaces

1386
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,551
Your blood that can't be true

1387
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,831
It probably is

1388
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:54,207
The FDA has not approved not approved

1389
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:56,767
Nor deny the new plants

1390
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,047
Replenishes your blood

1391
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,911
Stairway to Heaven

1392
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,727
Peaches herself

1393
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,007
She replenishes your blood

1394
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,567
Sure I love her song I will choose free will

1395
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,359
Core sound

1396
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,127
Just getting song

1397
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,431
Songs wrong on purpose

1398
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,455
The clip where I belong

1399
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,247
Jones thinks

1400
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,271
Is William Wallace

1401
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,367
This is kind of like I mean Alex

1402
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,135
Who's lying about ever

1403
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,439
Can we remove his innards

1404
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,719
Someone made

1405
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,767
Monday 8

1406
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,327
This is this is one of those clips where he's lying and he

1407
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,095
He's wrong but I

1408
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,375
And enjoy this out

1409
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,911
This isn't like

1410
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,959
Weird esoteric Alex

1411
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,495
It's not angry Alex

1412
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:39,519
Drunk Alex

1413
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,055
It's Alex you think

1414
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:41,823
Excuse one

1415
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,359
And it's kind of fun

1416
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,639
Because I know like

1417
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:45,407
Tribe comes

1418
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,943
Before the fall and all that

1419
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:50,527
Showboat now it's a little bit

1420
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:53,343
Quality to it

1421
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,879
I hope we all enjoy also

1422
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:57,439
Alex hubris Joan also

1423
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,975
Please take notice of how I

1424
01:03:59,487 --> 01:03:59,999
Positive

1425
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:00,767
You told them he

1426
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:01,791
Don't turn down the music

1427
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:04,607
Music Bad

1428
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,143
Going real

1429
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:19,455
So here's what I wanted to pause real quick

1430
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:21,759
Because the reason that you started winning once you

1431
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,527
You started saying it

1432
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:27,391
Is because there is no war and there are no Global it's on the other side of it

1433
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,159
So you

1434
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:32,511
Get you get you get your base all riled up thinking that there are a bunch

1435
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,535
People who want to

1436
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,815
Take away our freedoms and

1437
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,375
Destroy the country by Design

1438
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:43,775
All this stuff and then of course they're going to fight back more aggressively and end up voting for

1439
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,567
All of these wacky

1440
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:51,455
A tea-party dick holes all around the country

1441
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,247
Cuz the other side isn't radical

1442
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,039
I mean

1443
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,319
Says

1444
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,087
Says you

1445
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:03,999
Their pockets of radicalism I think of you listen to the

1446
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:06,303
This episode you'll find that

1447
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,351
You have radicals

1448
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:15,263
No I haven't bought a gun yet though you're not like you're not

1449
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,055
Clava on

1450
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,847
And going to smash up a Chase Bank

1451
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:19,871
Or something like that

1452
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:29,087
Phobia

1453
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:36,255
That's why I don't know why I do so myself

1454
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,023
So

1455
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,095
That was the point I wanted to

1456
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,887
Make this idea but he's like

1457
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:44,959
We called it a war

1458
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,263
It's now it's a real war.

1459
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,287
The other side

1460
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,055
Isn't

1461
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,847
It's like a war because

1462
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,895
Right right

1463
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,919
Anson imaginary

1464
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:54,943
Pretty easy

1465
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,063
Successful war against

1466
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,855
You can't win them cuz

1467
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:03,391
Time comes for a wind

1468
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,695
Someone to lose

1469
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:08,767
I need to declare victory

1470
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:09,791
Ever

1471
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:12,863
Like his money's gone. If he says

1472
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:13,887
Guys

1473
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,423
We defeated the globalist

1474
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:20,031
Like it's like a season finale series finale

1475
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:21,055
Like at the end of

1476
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,103
That's why they couldn't kill Seiler

1477
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,127
And season 1

1478
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,687
They're like I don't know what do we do then

1479
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,967
You need your bad guy

1480
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,503
How did season 2 of Heroes workout

1481
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,783
It was okay

1482
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,367
There's a myth that it was terrible

1483
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:41,535
Did get in the potential

1484
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:42,815
Play some stuff going on in this

1485
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,375
It was really in the third that ever

1486
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,423
Everything fell apart that's my argument

1487
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,447
Stick to it

1488
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,751
I think comedians need to unionize

1489
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:51,775
Anyways

1490
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,311
Atomic strike

1491
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:59,967
What is soon as we called out the global it's as soon as we got in their faces

1492
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:06,367
Cultural and financial slaves

1493
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,023
Pokerstar well

1494
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:17,375
Thunderstorm

1495
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:44,255
You feel the ancient will of the species development

1496
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:58,079
Would you like to know more

1497
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,871
Transmission

1498
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,175
God bless you

1499
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,991
Now you think here he's going to go to a sales

1500
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:11,647
But it's too early in the commercial break for him to go to a sales pitch

1501
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:18,047
No no no

1502
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:18,815
When did the show

1503
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,607
He said thank you this

1504
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:27,007
The end of the transmission also the opposite of a shout-out

1505
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,287
Going hard at me for like

1506
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:37,503
Admittedly there were problems hero should not have been trapped in the past for that long

1507
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:38,783
It was a mess

1508
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:42,623
I have a soft spot in my heart because of what was going on in my life

1509
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,647
Set the time and I don't think it's

1510
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:50,047
Rubber that's terrible

1511
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:56,447
Versus Mothra situational my God

1512
01:08:56,703 --> 01:09:02,591
Because that was freeform poetry of most insane times

1513
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,895
In the face of Destiny and the

1514
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:08,735
Android

1515
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,271
With other Wheels

1516
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,647
Listen back to that

1517
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,415
Jerked off

1518
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,719
Probably

1519
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,999
Nailed it

1520
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:24,863
Level 1 of improv training at Second City

1521
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,399
Was it worth every penny

1522
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:32,543
Kind of his thing it sounds right

1523
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:33,567
But he doesn't

1524
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:50,975
Unless we let them mind control Us by just

1525
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,023
Lying

1526
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:59,935
You know you do is the Democratic party is a minute and a half

1527
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,215
Freeform speech

1528
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,007
You do like

1529
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:03,775
I am

1530
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,871
You struggling there

1531
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,895
Giant American Pie

1532
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:12,479
Are standing in front of a let's get

1533
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,551
To the get to the news of the Democrat news

1534
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:22,207
They're going to lose unless they brainwash us with maggots

1535
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:26,047
Nag nag nag that's all these Democrats to

1536
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,423
Not good analysis

1537
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:32,959
I think they pretty

1538
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,239
Successfully

1539
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,263
Listen to

1540
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,031
Everybody

1541
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,311
I'd like

1542
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:43,711
Did you see what happened with the DNC recently they got rid of everybody who wasn't loyal to the corporate wing of the day

1543
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:46,015
Democratic Party

1544
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,551
Is there

1545
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,319
There

1546
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,415
Trying not to learn a lesson

1547
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:00,863
They're doing the same thing that the Republicans did in

1548
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:02,911
The 2008

1549
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,191
Whippet

1550
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,215
Tea party and all of that

1551
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,495
They are

1552
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,775
Trying to exploit

1553
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,055
People who are

1554
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,847
Radicalize or who are

1555
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,663
Successfully becoming more and more

1556
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:17,503
Progressive in order to further a corporate agenda get the vote

1557
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,039
Exactly so the Democratic

1558
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:21,087
Leadership is trying to

1559
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,367
Lean harder into

1560
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,391
Corporate money

1561
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,951
Utilizing the fact that

1562
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,999
Trump is the single worst human being on

1563
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,791
On the planet so they can expect

1564
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,071
Landslide vote

1565
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,863
Atlanta

1566
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:40,799
They're f****** stupid the Democratic party is led by the dumb

1567
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:41,567
Famous people on the plane

1568
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,847
It does look that way

1569
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,383
Except for Alex Jones

1570
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:48,991
Spare

1571
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,527
People who fall for this bull

1572
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,575
Yeah so in this

1573
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:56,159
When is next b a little bit long Alex

1574
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,951
Throws in a bunch of line narrative

1575
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,231
And we'll get to those

1576
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:00,511
What's wrong with them

1577
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,887
Autosource

1578
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:09,983
Hollywood

1579
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,799
Mesmerised

1580
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,591
Child play

1581
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,879
At this very time last week

1582
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:30,207
Information

1583
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,535
So oh yeah

1584
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:36,607
Now we get into some fun conspiracies

1585
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:40,959
Over the weekend I believe

1586
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,007
He said that he talked to Trump

1587
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,799
The Trump was

1588
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:46,591
About the champ

1589
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:48,127
Okay stop it he didn't say

1590
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:49,407
That he was going to do it

1591
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,943
Rodger believed he was going

1592
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:52,991
So I

1593
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,271
Faolan

1594
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,039
Mondays

1595
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,063
Rodger Stone

1596
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:58,623
They presented as

1597
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:02,463
He said he was going to do it but you didn't want to put that out public

1598
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:06,815
They're already sort of rewriting what yeah so what they were saying it right

1599
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,095
But then further

1600
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:11,167
Trump is doing is not

1601
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:11,935
Blocking

1602
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:16,543
Yeah there's a 1992 that all of these files would be really

1603
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,823
On October twenty

1604
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:18,847
2017

1605
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,919
Yeah that was what the law was from the 90

1606
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,199
The president has the

1607
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:23,967
Discretion

1608
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:24,735
To either block

1609
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:25,503
Oro Valley

1610
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,551
And if he doesn't do anything until

1611
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:28,831
Just automatically would be really

1612
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:33,183
Where's the library

1613
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:35,231
And pull them out from untried

1614
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:37,535
Stack release these files

1615
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,815
Have you no decency

1616
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:42,911
How much lb

1617
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,471
J.f. Kennedy

1618
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,239
We're like

1619
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:52,639
I guess we got to let everybody know now like the how much fun would that be Madness that would be hilarious

1620
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,943
Perfect distraction

1621
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:58,527
But also it really feeds in perfectly with Alex's they're going

1622
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:01,087
Going to kill Trump there it is

1623
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:01,855
Like eight

1624
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,879
It's just it's like

1625
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,671
Manna From Heaven

1626
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:07,231
Converting

1627
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,255
Storyline

1628
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:11,583
LBJ actually did Kill

1629
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,167
Bush jr. would totally let us know

1630
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:18,495
Like in one of his speeches of me

1631
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,943
Ultraboost

1632
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:38,719
Look at Jones and stone fake news Trump

1633
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,767
CIA sources say

1634
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:44,095
Resources

1635
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:46,655
I just can't stand it

1636
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:49,983
Adjust

1637
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,543
Like we told you weeks ago

1638
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,335
This is coming

1639
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:59,711
You are now a lobbyist Tony podesta

1640
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,599
But have you seen

1641
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:09,951
Senior antium to

1642
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:16,607
See the Nativity spitting here is about

1643
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,143
The probe

1644
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:20,447
He's doing

1645
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:23,007
Special counsel Robert Mueller investigating

1646
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,031
Top democratic

1647
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,847
Tony podesta Hillary Clint

1648
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:28,639
Scrutiny

1649
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,663
Expanding Russia

1650
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:36,831
If you go on throughout this article you find out of there

1651
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:38,367
Do the question of Russian interference

1652
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,463
It's about work done by several wash

1653
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,231
Operatives

1654
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:43,999
For pro-russian

1655
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:44,767
Ukrainian

1656
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,815
In a few years earlier

1657
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:51,679
Specifically both podesta's and manafort's firm represented a Ukrainian nonprofit group

1658
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:53,471
The European Centre for modern UK

1659
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:54,751
2012

1660
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:55,775
14

1661
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:59,103
This group was attempting to improve the image of the Ukrainian regime at the

1662
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,639
Which was pro-russian

1663
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:01,663
Scrutiny

1664
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,431
Treatment of their Doom

1665
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:03,711
Proposition

1666
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:04,735
A report

1667
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:07,807
CNN podesta group

1668
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,831
Contacted the state

1669
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,599
What about Ukraine

1670
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,623
2012 election

1671
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,647
Attempting

1672
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:13,951
Put a positive spin on the regimes handling of the election

1673
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,231
However in

1674
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:19,327
Crucially they didn't disclose the full extent of their work in federal lobbying filings

1675
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,607
Until earlier this year

1676
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:23,423
Paper NBC that failure to disclose at Scott Mueller

1677
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:26,239
Tony podesta is the brother of John Fidel

1678
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:27,519
Hillary

1679
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,799
Presidential

1680
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:32,127
Though they co-founded the lobbying firm a tissue

1681
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:33,663
Decades

1682
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:38,783
John podesta is no longer Affiliated as the firm and there's no indication that he's a subject of Mueller's

1683
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,831
Still dunk also has

1684
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,367
Nothing to do

1685
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,135
With

1686
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:46,207
The uranium one deal which as we know is horseshit

1687
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:51,071
Yeah Alex really should have read further into that article specifically because that's

1688
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:51,839
Not something

1689
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:52,863
He wants to

1690
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:56,191
You should buy like before

1691
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:03,359
Cuz it's like

1692
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:06,431
Food boy I supposed to say that

1693
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:12,831
Nothing I'm supposed to.

1694
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:13,855
FaceTime right

1695
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,135
Screwing up in bread

1696
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:18,463
Rewriting can I still say I'm fine with that like

1697
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:24,863
F*** him I don't care if you're a democratic laboratory Republican Lockwood

1698
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:28,191
And also this is fun Rodger stone is repurpose

1699
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:33,311
Soon it will be podesta's time in the barrel

1700
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:37,919
About Wikileaks John podesta emails

1701
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:44,319
He's tried to repurpose out of being like Oh that's what I was talking about

1702
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:46,879
Bring it out years later

1703

1704
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:52,255

01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:05,567
I get why do you think they came out and said myself Rodger Stone from

1709
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:07,871
Is your sons are all recognized

1710
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:10,943
Has Trump had tried harder

1711
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:16,063
Donald jr. absolutely

1712
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,087
That's not good

1713
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,623
Earlier in this clip

1714
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,903
How did Donald Trump

1715
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,951
Himself as one of their sources

1716
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,231
Have you

1717
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:24,255
Donald Trump

1718
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:28,351
Had his son go meet with these Russians to try and look into it

1719
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:34,751
To find some dirt on Hillary Clinton's illegal

1720
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:37,311
Still not good

1721
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,079
Of course

1722
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:39,871
I talked to drop I get the information

1723
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:42,175
Drunk

1724
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:44,479
Holyshit

1725
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:46,271
All of this is worse

1726
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,295
When he says

1727
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:50,623
Tremendously

1728
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,951
Of course

1729
01:18:55,231 --> 01:19:01,375
The alex2epic mysteriously

1730
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:03,679
Almost every black person who speaks up in public

1731
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:07,007
Yeah it seems like there's a running trim

1732
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,639
Stitches money

1733
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:27,743
We're shows up.

1734
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,655
There's a lot of problems

1735
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:38,751
Perfect analysis number of the first situation

1736
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:41,311
So much better by hearing bad analogy

1737
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,079
Cuz

1738
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,615
Look if you

1739
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:45,919
Show up at the house with a gun

1740
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,527
Is that Daddy

1741
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:55,391
If someone is coming out the computer was it caught

1742
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:58,719
Stealing a computer from someone pass

1743
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,095
You were a stranger

1744
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:07,167
I think first of all this situation of the potential

1745
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:08,447
Control

1746
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:12,287
Good second let's say you're stealing the computer you don't have a weapon yourself

1747
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:17,920
I think this argument would end up being you drop the computer and run away

1748
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,200
No this is my house

1749
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,224
I feel like

1750
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:24,320
This is more of an evil twin situation

1751
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:30,720
Twins and they're both going on there until Friday

1752
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:36,096
What is the real one movie

1753
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,960
I don't want to believe that I'm sick and tired of this goddamn Chatroulette

1754
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:47,360
Really really starting to piss me off

1755
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:51,200
Do not know

1756
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:54,016
You're not going to be in trouble then

1757
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:00,160
Ron

1758
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:13,728
Obama administration

1759
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,712
Head fun

1760
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:31,648
Infowars expose

1761
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,696
Amazon Russia payroll

1762
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,232
Where do you think this story is

1763
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,024
I mean go with Infowars

1764
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:49,568
Court all coming directly from Infowars mainstream media

1765
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:51,616
The mainstream news has to admit

1766
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:53,408
Of course we are now

1767
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:58,016
Xtreme news where the rebel

1768
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:04,416
Speeches about

1769
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,720
All of it doesn't make sense

1770
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,744
Jewelry

1771
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,048
Investigating Infowars expose

1772
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:12,608
4info

1773
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:19,008
They should not be happy about that whatever it is true

1774
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,800
Far from the truth

1775
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:21,568
But if

1776
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:24,128
If you read that headline

1777
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,528
Publicizing the Galaxy

1778
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:34,112
Get back

1779
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:51,520
To give the president support

1780
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,056
When he does this

1781
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:56,896
He's doing it

1782
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:05,088
Perfect couple

1783
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,440
It's why they're so horrified of the daily

1784
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:12,000
Because of the stacks and the clinch

1785
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:35,808
I think Alex has a

1786
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:38,112
Alex

1787
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:38,880
Absolutely

1788
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,928
Come on man

1789
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:43,744
There's a lot of problems I think the cheese

1790
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,816
Please problem explain how

1791
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,352
Trump's brain work

1792
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,120
Sprite

1793
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,144
He's a child

1794
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:53,728
More like

1795
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:58,592
You did a great job by Axel

1796
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:01,408
I also I mean like

1797
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,432
I don't

1798
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,456
I don't like the idea

1799
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,992
That obvious

1800
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:07,552
If we're going to break down what ended up having

1801
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:08,576
Here

1802
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:09,856
Alex

1803
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,184
House

1804
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,720
Or Trump's Administration

1805
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,000
Told them

1806
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:21,120
To write an article and expose about the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stuff which is weave

1807
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:21,888
Discussing the past

1808
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:22,912
Is bogus

1809
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:23,680
It's not true

1810
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:27,264
Right angle

1811
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,312
Made it

1812
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,080
So Trump

1813
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,104
Could use it

1814
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,896
In order to push through

1815
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:33,664
The destruct

1816
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,456
Should have Obamacare

1817
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,992
Right

1818
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:40,576
That is awesome

1819
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:45,696
But you know the only players real Donald Trump jr.

1820
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:48,000
Steve Bannon

1821
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:49,280
No problem at all you just go to Bright

1822
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:51,328
Rodger Stone

1823
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:53,120
Yeah or Donald Trump him

1824
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:53,888
Selfie

1825
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:57,472
Baby in a momento

1826
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:02,592
I don't think Barron's in the make you think the keys

1827
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,408
I'm going to put this forward

1828
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:07,968
Baroness

1829
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:09,248
The secret Mastermind behind all

1830
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,320
Looks like that movie Identity which was great

1831
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:17,184
It was a child LOL

1832
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,720
Spoilers

1833
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:22,560
If you're going to run a secret global

1834
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:23,328
Conspiracy

1835
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:26,400
You don't want to be the face of it you don't want to be out in public

1836
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:31,008
No I have people running everything for you

1837
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,360
Furthermore

1838
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:37,408
You may not be a child

1839
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:39,968
I have not

1840
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:41,760
He's actually hundreds of years old

1841
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,184
Idea that there is a

1842
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:51,488
Going on with Infowars

1843
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,768
The Trump Administration

1844
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,072
Believe

1845
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,096
Much of any

1846
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:59,936
So

1847
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:02,240
Something that I think is true

1848
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:12,480
ABC ABC

1849
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,528
5 days late

1850
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:18,624
That's all coming up and more second hour

1851
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:30,912
Is kind of what I believe

1852
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,960
Is actually at 8

1853
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:36,032
What that when people are doing their job

1854
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,312
In terms of

1855
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,080
The media

1856
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,104
Alex

1857
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,640
Survive

1858
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,920
He can't thrive

1859
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:42,944
Asset

1860
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,736
World

1861
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,784
Where people are actually engaged

1862
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:47,808
Reality

1863
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:53,696
With what's going on where they know things they are

1864
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:55,232
There are a couple of sites

1865
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,256
But have explanation

1866
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,024
Kings of like

1867
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,072
The triage thing going on

1868
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:01,120
You can hear in the dispatch

1869
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:04,448
Stapes people talking about the wounded being taken

1870
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,472
From the

1871
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:06,752
Site of the crime

1872
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:08,544
Do a triage spot

1873
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,312
Couple

1874
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,592
There are five or six

1875
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,408
7 pages of people being like

1876
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:17,504
Multiple shootings in s*** like that

1877
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,272
So much

1878
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,552
Yelling about

1879
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:20,320
The fakes.

1880
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,344
I am just

1881
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,136
About the reality

1882
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,160
Alex Jones

1883
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:25,184
Could not thrive

1884
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:26,720
If the reality

1885
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:28,000
He started yelling back

1886
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:28,768
Absolutely

1887
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,584
It is it is something

1888
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:32,864
That I think about alot

1889
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:33,632
Is that

1890
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,400
The

1891
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,168
The spark

1892
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,192
Behind all of this fake

1893
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:36,960
News though

1894
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:37,728
Is

1895
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:38,752
People want

1896
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:40,288
To imagine

1897
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:43,104
Sure the world we live in is f******

1898
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:43,872
Chaos

1899
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:47,200
Insanity and people want to imagine a world that isn't

1900
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:49,248
Right

1901
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:50,016
Problem

1902
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:52,832
The way to do that

1903
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:55,136
First engaged with reality

1904
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,672
And then try to change

1905
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:00,256
Right and just imagine

1906
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:06,144
No I understand the impulse

1907
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,192
You want to use your

1908
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:08,960
Listen to affect chain

1909
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:09,984
Change in the world

1910
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,032
But you have to start from reality

1911
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:15,872
You have to we have to start from a shared reality otherwise

1912
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:16,896
Thing is going to happen

1913
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:17,664
Right

1914
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:20,992
Something I learned in my

1915
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:23,040
101

1916
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:26,112
Philosophy class discussion

1917
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,136
The definition of

1918
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:32,768
Exact you're not talking about the same thing whenever hopefully you can never hope to get

1919
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:33,792
A conclusion

1920
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,632
I think we agree there but

1921
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,168
Is the end of

1922
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:55,296
Please

1923
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:00,160
And please don't forget we're about to end

1924
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:02,464
70% off on 4th

1925
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:05,536
There was a little smoother than abrupt

1926
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:11,168
But if it is demonstrative of any Opera

1927
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:14,496
Anytime we're going to break and I got to fill 30 seconds

1928
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:15,520
My f****** time self

1929
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:18,592
And of that thing that he says about Max

1930
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:20,128
Waters threatening to kill

1931
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:21,152
A little bit over

1932
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:23,968
Again we already kind of went over that

1933
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:29,856
We didn't go over that one though she just said I'm going to take out Trump

1934
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,160
Yeah that's Certifit

1935
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:34,976
Like she been calling for him to a nice dinner

1936
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:36,512
It's been talking about trying to get it

1937
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:37,792
For a long time

1938
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:39,072
That was the context

1939
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:40,096
In which you was talkin

1940
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,400
A mountain out of a molehill

1941
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:44,192
Play this game

1942
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:46,240
Trump said that

1943
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:48,032
Second Amendment people should take

1944
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:49,312
Harold Hillary Clinton

1945
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:51,360
Moreover

1946
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:53,408
So if you want to play this game Alex

1947
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:54,432
It's important

1948
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,712
Be intellectually consist

1949
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:56,736
No it is

1950
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:57,504
You're right

1951
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:00,576
If you're right or wrong

1952
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:06,976
I've been doing this podcast for 10 bucks still hanging out on that Hill

1953
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:14,656
I think the one thing that we have learned from this is that intellectual consist

1954
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:15,936
Cincy is

1955
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:21,312
Rare rare commodity you're also totally wrong

1956
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:23,872
We also learned about

1957
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:28,480
I said if there's no good

1958
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:31,552
Now

1959
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:37,952
Of course

1960
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:40,000
Except do you know what what

1961
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:41,536
I was born in

1962
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:42,816
Is that right

1963
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:49,216
Dragon Ball swales great crab fishing

1964
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,264
Get carried away

Always

1982
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:41,440
It must be noted

1983
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,744
It should be clear that you're doing that is a bit

1984
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:44,768
Okay

1985
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:48,096
I don't know I just want to be clear that like

1986
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:49,376
The idea of using

1987
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:53,216
Like Centrist as a pejorative. Super on board with

1988
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:54,240
But be that as it may

1989
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:59,872

You have ever looked behind me before

2010
01:32:55,680 --> 01:33:00,032

Area

2012

Do a guy who can go f*** himself
