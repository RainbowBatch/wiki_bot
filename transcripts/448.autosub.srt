I wanted to actually make you some of them just because it could be really funny

8
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,208
The show for everybody

9
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,512
So I get to watch you

10
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,792

00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,584
Some of these new sausage

12
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984
Spicier than a Wendy's spicy chicken nuggets

13
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,056
Are very hot

14
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:54,176
Two sauces from torchbearer maker that I really like

Zombie apocalypse after Android setup

16
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,064
Better

17
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:05,952
Some of the reviews are saying that a better flavor

18
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,232
He didn't have a

19
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,512

00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,008
It is a lot of

24
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,544
Okay

25
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
Is speed

26
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:28,480
You know that's the thing that makes me want to try hot sauce has been many and varied ways that you describe how the taste

27
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:33,088
You which is very fascinating to me

28
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,368
That's a lot like

29
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,184
People telling me all about the different ways they can punch me

30
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,848
I also got one from adobo

31
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152

00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:17,632
There was a lot of people like to go

35
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,472
And it was gorgeous

36
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,544
When's have their own charms

00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:32,480

Okay

42
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,584
Really hot sauce

43
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
All the way down

00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704

Disaster at 6 my partner's car

46
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:00,128
I had to have somebody else fix her car I cannot do that

47
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
It took

48
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,224
Twice as long as they said however

49
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,016
I turn this into a positive

50
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,296
Because they had

51
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
Perfect grass

52
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
Lovely tree

53
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,672
Set lay down took a nap on the grass

54
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,976
That's how perfect it is in Orland

55
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:20,351
That's right amazing I've been outside and laid out and just saw the sun and all that

56
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,423
Add stop for forever

57
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
Cool

58
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,079
It's not been hot yet

59
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
It's alright

60
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,831
Today's episode

61
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:41,855
I'm thrilled

00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:44,479
Thank you so much Michael and and thank you so much good work boys let me have the wine bottles

80
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:50,879
A reference to progress wine bottles

81
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,375
It is not a quadrilateral

82
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,215
Weird masturbatory

83
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,007
And I realized

84
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:13,407
That the logistics of it were just a nightmare and couldn't pull it off so I apologize

85
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,807
Give you an empty wine bottle I do still have first wine bottles that are first three

86
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,391
Free episodes

87
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,951
With wine bottles that I feel like a douchebag

88
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
Because I have

89
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:33,375
Empty alcohol bottles

90
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,423
Those can be given to someone

91
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,031
What's up

92
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,615
Capricorn owl

93
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,831
Return of Alex and I mean he's horrible

94
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,855
He's a real dick

95
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,719
Kind of thing something thinking

96
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,023
It's worth while to me because like

97
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,607
When I listen to Owen Shroyer when he comes in he does the show

98
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,191
I was thinking at all I'm think I'm not interested is boring as s***

99
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,287
One minute into Alex being back he says something to Michael thanks

100
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:17,151
That's interesting ok

101
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
That we have our pulse

102
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
What's going on the planet

103
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
Globalist

104
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Spectre

105
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,183
Top next to Lucifer

106
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207

Vista

110
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,423
The same Horizon is Lucifer

111
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,495
From the luciferian

112
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
Wolf

113
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Local

114
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,407
Compartmentalize

115
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
Having the baby

116
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
High-level Field Marshal

117
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
This is the field Marshal

118
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:05,535
Welcome back Alex

119
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:12,191
Explaining

120
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,311
Take in the view alongside Lucifer

121
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,151
Expression finger on the pulse

122
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,479
And in the process actually kind of describes Infowars really well

123
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,319
If you try to take someone's pulse with a part of your body where someone could

124
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
Take your pulse

125
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,391
Then you're going to get an accurate reading

126
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:38,047
When Alex says the Infowars has their pulse on what's going on on the planet

127
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:43,935
Internal processes

128
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,495
And then making the mistake that means anything

129
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:55,967
Accidentally correct statement adjusted

130
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,807
Is there inverse meeting

131
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:04,159
Being on a hill with Lucifer is

132
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:08,255
If you are on a Vista with Lewisburg

133
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:14,655
You might see things physically the same as Lucifer but just being on the same perspective

134
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,679
Incited

135
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
Brixton

136
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,567
Me and Lucifer could be up on a cliff and we could both see a car broke

137
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,919
Lucifer may know that there's an assassin coming to kill me in that car

138
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,223
Which is information I don't have at my disposal

139
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
In this situation

140
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,575
Lucifer and I would see this car physically from the same perspective

141
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,623
Ultimately how we experience

142
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,159
The car that was the

143
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,231
Completely different

144
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,047
Look at things from his perspective is not about the

145
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:48,447
Physical looking

146
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
Real world

147
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
Documents

148
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:59,711
That you and I could look at it as well right

149
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
Documents

150
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,367
It's the same way that the sun sees the documents which is from above

151
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
This is

152
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
Airtight logic

153
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
Stomach stomach

154
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:14,559
That's interesting thoughts are coming out

155
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Expresssos

156
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,887
Missed it by missed at least

157
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:22,751
That could look David night Owen Shroyer

158
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:29,407
They're not capable of this kind of legal language

159
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,223
Is horrible

160
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
There's something

161
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,319
Interesting thought process

162
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
Alright I don't

163
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
Isis

164
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,231
I know it's such a fine line listening to

165
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,815
There's a part of me that thinks it's like a tardigrade aspiring to poetry

166
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:52,959
You know it's never going to get to Poetry Man

167
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
Yeah it's

168
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,823
It's strange but like

169
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,223
It's a water in the desert that is Owen Shroyer David height

170
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
So Alex

171
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:11,647
Couple minutes maybe a minute in the Hat right

172
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,487
He's already said that he's up on the mountain with Satan looking at things

173
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
Bucket

174
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:24,703
Either I could start this show and so many different ways there's so much big news

175
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,775
Mediately trips over his own foot

176
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,151
We've got more clips

177
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
Peace

178
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,599
To be a riveting whole show

179
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
Human race

180
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
It's not the race

181
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
Human race

182
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,471
You know how you know erase that can breed with it

183
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,455
Benson's went off the second

184
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,991
What is

185
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,095
Rate is a term that is not a part of the biological

186
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:24,863
Taxonomy

187
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:29,471
Do not like an animal as a kingdom phylum

188
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,871
It's not a term that has any descriptive value in terms of human populations in incredibly

189
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:42,271
Describe animals in nature

190
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:48,671
Cicada Danimals

191
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,791
Just leaving article from the journal Evolution education and Outreach

192
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,887
Breezer eyes due to breeders extreme control

193
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,215
To maximize the presence of desired traits in the Next Generation

194
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
Breeding baguettes

195
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
Breeds

196
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,823
Whereas human intervention

197
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:12,223
Select for the treats they want in the animals and excludes those they don't want I prefer that words don't mean

198
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,879
Human populations have been

199
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:23,999
Subjected historically do natural selection where is the best gated animals are the product of artificial

200
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
Selection

201
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:31,935
This is the subject of the fair amount of material you can find if you're interested but the bottom line is that the argument that the social

202
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,519
Determine category we call races equivalent to

203
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:40,383
Think something deeply racist ideology historically and it makes no sense

204
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
From a scientific

205
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
Perspective

206
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:48,575
It's an attempt to link temperament

207
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
Historically

208
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:55,999
The really remarkable

209
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:02,399
The reasons that this happens a lot to him

210
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,959
This is because he's a giant

211
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,031
The big explanation for that

212
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,591
No need to Pretend This is a mystery

213
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
Big brain

214
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
White rice

215
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,479
Joe in the next 12 hours

216
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,503
While we was gone

217
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
Sure

218
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
Sort of okay

219
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
Saturday

220
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
Trump rally in Tulsa

221
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,927
This show is happening

222
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:30,047
Them

223
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
Is Alex's

224
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,631
Another is based in reality

225
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:41,055
Destroyer and selling T-shirts

226
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,271
Cuz he was on vacation

227
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,879
Down at the Gulf of Mexico I believe

228
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,535
Child labor laws

229
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,863
Adult

230
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,167
Employable age

231
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:14,079
This is one of the stories that Alex needs to cover that you missed while he was gone because pretty important

232
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,943
Trump looks bad. I do what I can to make him not look that

233
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,503
Excerpts

234
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,039
As yet last night

235
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,343
Not a failure it was a

236
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,879
Extreme

237
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,463
Decipher all of that

238
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
So much more

239
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,023
Cavicide

240
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,935
Total victory

241
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
I feel like

242
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
Using it

243
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,263
Extreme in front of Victor

244
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
Obvious

245
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,687
You know what victory would be

246
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:55,551
You notice an extreme victory

247
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,903
There's no like

248
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,463
Debate or feelings of

249
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,743
Extreme victory

250
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,559
Nobody's ever said like oh man

251
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:12,959
You thought that Battle of Waterloo is a failure but

252
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,799
More into this

253
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,103
It's pretty preoccupied with trying to damage

254
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,919
Control about the small turnout at the rally

255
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,455
I'll get mad at K-pop

256
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,271
Fan

257
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
Himself in

258
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
Pre knowledge of a crime

259
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
I just don't

260
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
And I know that

261
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
Southern district of New York

262
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,607
Fired refusing

263
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,263
Is emblematic everything we're facing an ainu

264
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,079
Before he refused to step down

265
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,615
The president

266
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,407
Imagine that

267
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,479
Infowars

268
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,759
Better hope

269
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:03,647
He's making up that he knew in advance that Trump was going to fire Geoffrey Berman because if not

270
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,439
The conspiracy just

271
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,743
Super jump

272
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:14,143
Attorney General William Barr put out of federal prosecutor

273
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
In the southern district

274
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
Cricket New York

275
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,239
The problem was that Birdman had not resigned

276
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,199
New released its own statement

277
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,479
Did not receive The Hideout

278
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:34,623
In response to that bar wrote a letter to Birdman saying because he was declared that you have no intention of resigning

279
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:38,207
I've asked the president to remove you as of today and he has done so

280
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,999
That was on Saturday

281
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:46,655
After this Trump was asked by reporters about the matter of bourbon and Trump clearly didn't want to make it look like he was in

282
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,727
Attorney general Barr is working on that

283
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,543
But not by Department

284
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,823
What's really up to him

285
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
I'm not involved

286
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,967
Ultimately

287
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,503
Bourbons also

288
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,295
Slappy prosecution

289
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,831
Lawyer Michael Cohen

290
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:10,463
And had invited Lev parnas and Igor fruman

291
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:15,327
The office was in the process of investigating Giuliani himself

292
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:20,703
Elie honig a former assistant us attorney Southern District

293
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:27,103
When you look at the timing of this the fact that it was announced late on a Friday night the fact that the Attorney General immediately was caught

294
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
A misleading statement

295
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,431
What he said the US attorney is stepping down

296
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,711
And you look at all the

297
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,527
Pending cases in sdny right now

298
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,599
The only logical conclusion

299
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
Yeah no s***

300
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:45,023
House Judiciary Committee has ended

301
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,327
Whistleblower

302
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:51,935
Who are set to testify against William Barr

303
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,471
What is the farthest

304
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:59,359
I'm right I don't know exactly what happened

305
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:04,991
Probably try not to implicate myself and having Advanced knowledge I might end up getting called to test

306
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,575
Spotify

307
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,183
Probably Alex

308
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,255
I mean nothing's going to happen but insane world

309
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,047
You'll probably regret

310
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,703
It was just an everything had enough manpower in

311
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,751
Make him go under oath about this

312
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
Open crimes

313
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,199
And then

314
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,735
Doing something about them

315
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,343
I think they would get us

316
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:47,999
Narratives of Alex's Sunday

317
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,423
Children

318
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,471
If you're sensitive to those topics

319
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,287
So you may want to consider jumping ahead

320
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,359
I don't know

321
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,407
Exactly when that will be

322
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,943
You know

323
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,503
Content

324
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:13,087
You know the more grotesque

325
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,623
Subject

326
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,440
End of the story that he's covering does deserve

327
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,000
Mention so here we go

328
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,072
Arizona state was it just harmless but it was a

329
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,984
Taken from their biological parents particularly

330
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,408
They took children I was reading the files weekend

331
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,992
From

332
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
Can cult

333
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
Hardcore

334
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,696
Interrupting

335
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
We need to get with God

336
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Two people two

337
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
You pay them

338
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,704
Have sex with them

339
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,496
Create the law

340
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,592
The North American man-boy love associate

341
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,920
So This Is tragically true story

342
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,480
Completely made up

343
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:19,392
It's recently come to light that there was a program in place beginning in 1969

344
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
Pedophile

345
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:26,560
This was based on the theory promoted by a psychologist named houllou Templar

346
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,352
These men would make

347
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,120
Great roster

348
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,192
This is stick shift and it's horrific

349
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:36,032
I pray these children

350
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,312
Excited by the German government

351
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,848
For allowing this to happen

352
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,688
It does appear the Germany is inclined to take responsibility

353
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,992
Drone article in Dutch

354
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,272
Assures

355
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,600
Is the Berlin Senator responsible for the Keppler case

356
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:54,976
She's been outspoken and expressing Sympathy for the victims and condemnation of the crime she calls

357
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,512
Simply unimaginable

358
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:00,352
Although the statute of limitations for these crimes has expired

359
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,168
Is Promised financial compensation for their self

360
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,728
Doesn't make up for what happened

361
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,776
You know in terms of the states

362
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,056
Responsibility

363
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,360
This is not a new story

364
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,224
Deutsche welle on a new developed

365
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:22,880
You can find coverage of Base going back to 2016 and Outlets like the Irish Times which was recording on a study conducted

366
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,416
University of Gottingen

367
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,976
Which had been able to find

368
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
Who replaces pedophiles

369
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,816
In what being referred to as the Kent lurex

370
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
Experiment

371
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:35,424
In newer recording based on a study out of the University of

372
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:40,032
There's a number of children that said to be confirmed is 10

373
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,848
Literally any number of 0 is too many

374
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
And 10

375
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,528
Research this is, did they they do not know

376
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,320
The precise number of children who are effect

377
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,392
I bring up this number not to minimize this

378
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,464
It's just a situation where a headline like

379
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,048
Berlin authorities Place children of pedophiles 4:30

380
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
Years

381
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,888
Particular mental image that may or may not be accurate

382
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:13,056
More will come out on this story better picture of what exactly went

383
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
Scale

384
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:18,944
For now the best I can do is tell you that I would absolutely make

385
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
Is reporting about the

386
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
The story

387
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,136
The first fabrication In that clip is that the children were taken from their biological parents were primarily Christian

388
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,464
This program was specifically about homeless youth

389
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,000
I don't make this District

390
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:36,608
Distinction because I think it's any better it's

391
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
They were

392
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,448
I only bring this up to point out that Alex is making things up

393
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,056
There's absolutely nothing in any of these articles about children being taken from their Christian

394
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,848
Can families be put in abusive father

395
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:51,200
I was just making that up to play into the Christian narratives

396
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,736
It run through so much of his show

397
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,576
Is Merida's don't work without a sense of overwhelming persecution

398
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:00,928
Details

399
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,464
In Christian victimhood in person

400
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
Execution

401
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:08,096
The second thing is that I don't believe it

402
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,912
He study from the University of Hilda Chavez

403
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,984
57 pages long

404
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:20,896
A difficulty in that the actual report is really hard to find but if you do manage to make it to the

405
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,176
Say where you can find it

406
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,968
You see that it's only available in

407
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,504
PDF which is in German

408
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,808
If you use Google Scholar

409
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:34,208
Confide a version of that report and you can open it and then HTML file which you can use Google to translate into English

410
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:38,304
505

411
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,096
When he knows he could have make things up

412
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,936
Even this isn't a great System since Google translate isn't perfect but

413
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,264
I don't have the time to learn German to do this episode

414
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,544
It's where we're at

415
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:57,248
Read the actual files on these children or this program

416
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:01,856
The very best we could have done is read this report which includes conversation about the file

417
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:08,000
The report itself says the files were only accessible to them because

418
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,792
The consent of those affected

419
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:14,144
The foster home files were copied anonymized

420
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,424
At the University of Hilda

421
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,264
These vials comprised approximately 830 pages

422
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,080
Is almost certainly all in German and there's literally no change

423
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,128
Alex could have gotten his hands on us

424
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:31,040
Portions of this report

425
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
We're taking from Chris

426
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
Colts

427
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,672
It's my belief he's incorporating this detail in order to Harkins

428
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,208
The David koresh

429
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,608
The government is going to be late

430
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,144
And their kids

431
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:50,496
He's making up his story

432
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:56,896
Acronym Stanford North America

433
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,944
What is the First Amendment

434
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
Here's the point I want to stress

435
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,040
Serious story about a serious topic

436
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:08,160
It may be a program or experiment that's not currently

437
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,184
It's done still exist

438
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,024
The present and to honor that reality is important

439
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,792
Sensational

440
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,120
The stories outrageous enough as it is with what

441
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:21,472
Clearly abused to be a guy basically operating as well cause quotes

442
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,776
Nothing less than a Matchmaker for pedophile

443
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,336
The weight Oz handling the stories disc

444
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,128
Respectful to the victims of the program

445
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,016
He's trying to create an Infowars narrative out of their real-life victimhood which I signed absolutely disgrace

446
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,296
I just have no tie

447
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
Yeah that's $8

448
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,648
If you add

449
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,184
Details to a

450
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,488
Tremendous tragedy

451
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,560
Immensely avoidable

452
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
Horrific

453
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,888
You lose your right

454
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,656
To say anything

455
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,936
I don't care what

456
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
Conclusions

457
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
Do you draw a

458
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,520
The moment you're like

459
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,568
And also on top of this

460
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,848
It's horrifying

461
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,504
Sensational your predetermined narrative

462
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,784
You have

463
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:07,808
Evening

464
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,112
You're gone

465
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
Don't have any credibility left

466
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
This

467
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,232
Alex continues to just make

468
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,256
Make stuff up about

469
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,936
Oh by the way wasn't just Berlin

470
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,264
With all the German cities in Western Germany

471
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
At the time

472
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,384
And they were only following the UN directive of UNESCO

473
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,176
To have sex with children

474
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:39,808
There's no indication from any of the reporting or the University of Hilda schamber Port that the UN is involved in

475
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,088
Nestorian anyway

476
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:41,856
Further

477
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,928
The stories is about this report

478
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,744
Which only looked at the files of one foster home

479
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,512
Called freak

480
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:54,144
In the previous report which covered was covered in the Irish times at 2016

481
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,728
I do the study from the University of

482
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,032
Which was about West Berlin

483
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,592
And involve the period before the walls out

484
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,688
Alex is saying this is all of West Germany because he's read the words West

485
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:09,248
Berlin in the article's headline for the skim

486
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,576
If you do literally anything he'd know that Berlin is about

487
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,904
Far East in Germany's you can get before you hit the border with Pollock

488
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,512
Also this is all happening during the Cold War when the Berlin Wall was

489
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,560
And it has to do with West Germany

490
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,120
Would you know he wasn't the one that wasn't under the

491
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,168
Controller people Alex music

492
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,704
Pedophile communist

493
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,312
Interested in hearing him try to discuss that a little bit

494
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,640
Pick your side and then there's the guys and they're up to

495
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,688
Sure

496
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:44,320
My point is

497
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:48,160
Distasteful as this story has children

498
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,696
Now adults deserve better

499
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,744
Then there's

500
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,048
Routes to use to attack his political enemies

501
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
Which is what he's doing

502
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,608
It's pretty clear

503
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,912
Yeah I understand that

504
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,704
Seventh-day Adventist

505
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,496
Jehovah's Witnesses

506
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,800
Had their children taken

507
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:08,896
Man

508
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,944
To rape little girls and boys

509
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,112
Why would they take Christian children because

510
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,136
That's the old

511
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,160
AR

512
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,232
The idea that this program

513
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,560
Specifically targeted Jehovah's Witnesses are Seventh-day Adventist

514
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:30,400
Also from everything I can tell the victims that have been identified have all been boys

515
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,960
So you can take the boys and girls

516
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:33,984
A little bit

517
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,264
I'm not sure

518
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
But that's

519
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,056
Good from the recording ice

520
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,224
I'm sure there were some Adventist and doviz Witnesses in Germany in the 70s but though

521
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,416
Either way I was just making this stuff up at the end

522
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,464
It's because his audience

523
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,536
Plaintiff are greatest horror

524
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,096
He says he's the greatest

525
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,680
He's using the image of the thing that is already

526
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:08,288
Speirs the most because he needs to terrorize them with the idea

527
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,920
He knows that a considerable portion of his audience are anti-government Christian extremist

528
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,760
Makes the story about the children of parents

529
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,088
A projector

530
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,672
Manipulative tool for Alex to use

531
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,512
At this point I'm convinced that Alex is writing his own story about the

532
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:32,352
This piece of news because he knows it'll work better to manipulate his audience

533
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,376
Is chosen

534
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,496
I found the article about this on Infowars and it doesn't backup or

535
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,312
Substantiate

536
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,872
The Infowars article is just a repost

537
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,664
Thing of the article

538
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,736
Which they almost certainly don't have permission to Reaper

539
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,016
I'll reprint

540
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,064
Antigua pick out permission on that

541
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,952
Cover for obvious reasons

542
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,024
It's all just the same sort of stuff that you always babbles about

543
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,560
Grotesque details

544
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,352
There's no value in hearing it again

545
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,936
The only thing that's important here is that Alex has taken a real story

546
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,776
Children and Eli

547
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,056
Which is what he does

548
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
You liar

549
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,360
Yeah what a

550
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
Right

551
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:24,064
You get all this stuff going on

552
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,952
You know

553
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,256
Just once

554
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,120
Floor of how awful

555
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:37,888
A human being

556
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,680
It'd be nice

557
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,448
Everything nice

558
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,472
Oh man

559
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,752
So

560
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,544
There's no bottom

561
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,592
We see that here

562
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
People will be good

563
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,480
Stand up to it and say we aren't evil

564
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,016
We are going to

565
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,832
I believe in you

566
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,648
Figure out ways to take action against

567
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
But I just

568
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
My stomach

569
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
My mind.

570
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
What

571
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,152
Asking me what

572
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,064
God's face

573
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,624
I believe. And erectus

574
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,440
Elmo's World some need be

575
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,472
Want to kill people

576
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,544
If you try and sell things legally in-lawfully all the sudden now you have

577
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,592
To deal with reality and then everybody has to

578
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,176
Getting to real place

579
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,200
This is where people are like

580
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,016
That thing you said didn't actually happen

581
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,552
Well what if I killed you

582
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,344
And that's not a selling

583
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,464
It's a it's a

584
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:12,352
Now let's have some fun with him being a baby about these crowd sizes

585
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,376
What's up

586
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,448
Get our bearings back about us

587
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
You know what happened

588
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,080
Covid-19

589
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,664
Ford.com

590
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,480
Millions of

591
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,040
Instagram

592
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,088
Girl's name

593
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,280
Got the tickets

594
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
Thousand

595
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,656
60000

596
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,312
But other people couldn't get them

597
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,360
I was going to go

598
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,896
I live in Oklahoma but I

599
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,688
I didn't go cuz

600
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,832
If you can get in the door you get in

601
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,112
First come first serve

602
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,648
It was

603
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,024
Fraud

604
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:31,456
Hilarious didn't even sell out a 19,000 seat Arena but

605
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,248
The most popular hero in the world

606
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,552
Analysis two explanations are in

607
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,624
His first visit to covid-19 cause

608
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,696
Sphere which under normal circumstances makes a lot of sense

609
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:48,352
However you're talking about and planning to show up to support a politician whose primary

610
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
No big deal

611
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:53,216
This is like it specifically population that you can't really use that excuse

612
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:59,872
If you're talkin about a low-turnout at a concert I'm sure it makes sense to David covid-19

613
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,408
It's a hoarder page when

614
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,944
The concert is a band called

615
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,248
Don't worry about covid-19

616
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,040
Can't use that excuse

617
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,880
The second explanation is also fun because it reveals a whole lot

618
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:15,488
The basic version of this is that a bunch of young people particularly Kpop fans

619
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,048
Fake email addresses to request a ton of tickets

620
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,072
The Trump rally

621
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,888
Which inflated the number of people who they expected to show up

622
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,424
That's hilarious

623
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,448
I'm good on that

624
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,752
That's a great point

625
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,312
Probably a really big problem

626
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,080
For Trump

627
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:36,736
The first is that they plan to like have overflow areas for people to watch outside

628
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
It was as if

629
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,624
Jeb Bush was there saying please

630
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:49,280
Embarrassment on that one

631
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:55,936
The second problem is that

632
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,728
Mass amounts of data that he could use

633
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,520
Target camping

634
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,056
I'm trying to drum up donation

635
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,456
Because there was a mass of people sending in fake information that data set is almost useless

636
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:11,040
Rendering the secondary objective is Rally a complete failure

637
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,368
Kpop fans were able to

638
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
Weather

639
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,744
Big time

640
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,512
Yeah

641
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,560
In the real world

642
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:25,120
Tickets to any effect on actual turnout

643
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,192
If there were nine hundred thousand snakes ticket request

644
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:34,592
Then there would have been about 19

645
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,872
The Overflow could accommodate

646
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:40,224
No amount of big-ticket request can explain away a turnout of approximately 6

647
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,248
6200

648
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:47,904
The only way a high number of ticket request could depress her and if you wanted to you know you wanted to go

649
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,024
You saw the million people requested tickets when you decide there's no way you were going to get it and you decide

650
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
To stay home

651
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,072
And guess what

652
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,888
The Democrats and the kids

653
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,520
Trump's campaign to put up a ticket request numbers

654
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:07,616
And it was his own supporters

655
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,944
That hysteria is on

656
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,040
Them even at the root of it was a very basic online trolling campaign

657
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,856
Did you guys got beat

658
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:25,536
Just f****** own up to it you lost the information War

659
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,840
Very very stupid Let It Go

660
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:31,424
Just let it go

661
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,800
Didn't get millions of kids

662
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:40,896
To do this and not every Tik-Tok user is in the employee of the Chinese government

663
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,712
This is what I believe to call

664
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:48,320
Information Warfare Ivar people trying to sabotage

665
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:54,720
Literally listeners thousands of dollars to go to events where Bill or Hillary were speaking in Yelp

666
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:57,792
As long as they also yelled infowars.com

667
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:04,192
You don't get to play those sorts of games

668
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,568
Vagina to show up and

669
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:15,968
Do you like Alexa

670
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:23,392
Alex's rationalizing pretty hard

671
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,976
Recognize like

672
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:30,048
Turn off

673
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,328
Just passed Trump on that

674
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,912
When in the face of all that

675
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,008
Black lives matter George Soros

676
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:49,248
So I'd like to complain about how these kids these days a week

677
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,040
Because they don't want participation trophy

678
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,344
Just existing

679
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,488
Trump held a campaign rally

680
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,096
It seems like a real participation trophy ass mentality to me

681
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,144
You know

682
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,912
It's the kids

683
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:11,776
It's the kids organized

684
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,824
And they successfully achieve their goal

685
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,384
With no regard for any possible repercussions

686
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,664
But

687
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,504
Trump showed up man

688
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,344
You talk to her

689
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:31,488
Kind of risk involved in being involved in one of these black lives matter protest

690
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,024
Need to belabor the point again here

691
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:37,120
Pretending that these two are equivalent to the mark of being willfully ignorant

692
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:37,888
Or alive

693
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:44,800
On Saturday

694
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:49,920
Six of their Advanced staffers were working on putting

695
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,688
Iris

696
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:55,808
Literally no time to tell

697
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:59,904
If they'd infected anyone who they were

698
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,000
When I'm getting this episode

699
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:09,376
Has recorded the two additional staffers

700
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:16,032
Quote after another round of testing for campaign staff members of

701
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:16,800
For the Coronavirus

702
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:21,152
These staff members attended the rally but we're wearing masks during the entire event

703
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,784
Good to see you but Trump's campaign makes a control box

704
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,808
In other circumstances

705
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,904
Unless they're already sick

706
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,280
And they haven't had any symptoms

707
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,072
To save us

708
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:49,056
Red flag for attendees if they might get sick if they go to this thing

709
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,848
Involved the turnout

710
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,711
Melissa name Thomas

711
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:59,551
The covid-19 in Oklahoma over the past 20 days before the rally

712
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,111
Which reflected approximately

713
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:05,695
5% infection rate of the entire population of Oklahoma

714
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:11,071
His calculations are based on a sellout crowd of 19,000 number is a little bit

715
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,607
To reflect the actual turnout

716
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,167
Have 6200 but there was a

717
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,215
009 percent chance

718
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,263
Let no one in the crowd

719
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,335
Had Coronavirus

720
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,615
Yeah I like

721
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:30,015
That's B odds that no one there

722
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,255
This could end up being

723
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,815
Merely of

724
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,911
We could be a tragedy that happened for no reason

725
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:51,007
We'll have to see how things shake out as we get more information as

726
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,311
You know people get to the point where they would be

727
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,591
Be showing symptoms or

728
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,871
Testing positive after

729
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,687
No matter what ends up being human toll of this

730
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,967
Doing this rally was not his

731
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:03,295
Deserve a participation trophy

732
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,367
A bastet irresponsible at worst homicide

733
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,647
Yeah I was going to say that

734
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,695
It's it's it's your kind of seems like

735
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,743
Him doing that is not a

736
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,767
Participation trophy

737
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,327
So much as it is a death sentence for some of

738
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,095
The people who come

739
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:22,751
Situation

740
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:27,615
Had a rally where people were in chairs six feet apart from each other at

741
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,639
20 people there

742
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,967
It was like yeah yeah that was

743
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:37,087
The point also I don't I don't care

744
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,135
Rally in all this

745
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,415
Control measures in place

746
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,743
Drew his rally

747
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,839
The worst part is

748
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,607
Guys

749
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,447
Once you saw that there was 6200

750
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:58,847
Socially distant so easily you could have spread around the entire place

751
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:07,295
Appetite shot of course you need to text your book pack

752
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:18,047
I know it was made a B on social media

753
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,071
Like

754
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:24,447
Visceral experience of its own tail to hacky repeating appointment other people that would like

755
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,751
Absolutely have the feeling of like

756
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:29,567
A comedy show you're running Warehouse

757
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:34,687
And you're like this hold for another 5 yet my friend said he's on the way

758
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,223
Do people out

759
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:40,319
Front part of this

760
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,415
Comedy shows

761
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:49,023
Universal

762
00:44:55,423 --> 00:45:01,567
Now you know what's great is when you have the gas

763
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,383
I brought three out of the four people who are there

764
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,687
And then they all leave after they said

765
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,479
That yep just a real Delight

766
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
It all

767
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:18,975
Brad parscale

768
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:22,047
Trump

769
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:28,447
Use the guy who is cleaning up the 800,000 1 million numbers retrospect

770
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,775
Ready for this

771
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
Because

772
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,591
He was caught on video being asked

773
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:40,991
Personal beef

774
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:43,807
Sky

775
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,719
Parcells

776
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:51,999
Ourselves

777
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,631
You didn't do anything

778
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,655
Heart scale

779
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,775
You really think

780
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,079
You got a million RSVPs

781
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,383
When was 100,000

782
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,919
Real dumbass

783
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,223
That is very

784
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:16,575
Why didn't you spot Chicopee when contacted by email and see if they work

785
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:19,135
Funeralhome.com control

786
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,695
No argument there

787
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,351
2000cc

788
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,887
100000

789
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,567
I've been around

790
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:41,151
These are people that literally by 2 or 3 or Lamborghini

791
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,223
What does he have time

792
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:48,319
All these Lamborghini you bought a tank

793
00:46:55,999 --> 00:47:02,143
What is all the time

794
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:09,311
Interesting

795
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,847
Bizarre

796
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,663
Is there was

797
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:18,271
Lexus 200 people inside and out

798
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,879
Autozone.com

799
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:28,767
But not because they're working 10,000 people outside

800
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,447
A week ago

801
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,543
Has nothing to do with the turnout those people

802
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,079
Do hair there goes

803
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:46,431
Messed with the day 2000 people outside

804
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,479
Bum-rush them

805
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:56,927
The stragglers percent

806
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:59,487
It would have been

807
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,559
A more literal version of the abattoir they are walking

808
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:07,167
We we having 19,000 capacity Arena

809
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:12,543
200 inside

810
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:18,943
Outside

811
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,783
It's a good idea if you know what I talked to Trump and he said he wants the smaller

812
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,551
People

813
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,319
Bob's

814
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:28,159
Discussing his absence

815
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,951
For the last week

816
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,231
Turns out he was going to be

817
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,255
Beach vacation

818
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,023
It's good for him

819
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,559
I mean he didn't need to take

820
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,095
Some time off

821
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:41,983
You know I resent his luxury but at the same time

822
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,775
I'm glad.

823
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,591
He was not doing well

824
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,383
Get down to the coast for a week with my

825
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,151
Children

826
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,687
Sense of time off

827
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,391
Exaggerating

828
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:03,999
No way

829
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
Not a chance

830
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:09,631
I yelled at six people a day maybe

831
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,935
Add a what is your version of talking

832
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:18,079
Exactly that's the only explanation cuz it can't be I listen to anything anybody

833
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:23,199
He said he'll get into a little bit more about like some of the

834
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:25,503
More like

835
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,295
Global CNA

836
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:34,975
Alex this whole time has been teasing a big story

837
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,255
But he's got to get to

838
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,559
At this point he realizes like I haven't I haven't

839
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,631
You know I can I said I'd cover the big news

840
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,911
Covid-19

841
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,519
I guess I'll do that next segment

842
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,847
Trump rally

843
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:53,919
Minecraft

844
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,295
It's Nails on a chalkboard

845
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:02,111
I'll play it him talk about us again

846
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,487
Cuz you know what maybe we are low

847
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,839
Garbage

848
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,375
Depends on us all day

849
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,775
Oh my God he was involved with numbing HIV

850
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,311
He is a

851
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:29,247
So according to the AIDS Institute the earliest known human HIV cases

852
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,015
Democratic Republic

853
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,551
Condo

854
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,319
59

855
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:37,951
At the time she was 19 years old just graduated from high school in Manhattan

856
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,767
Andros entering undergraduate studies at Holy Cross

857
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:47,423
Seems unlikely

858
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:51,519
Prodigy we've seen you know

859
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,799
I was just make

860
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,335
Shut up the demonizes animes

861
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,103
0

862
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,383
Regard for the truth in

863
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,455
The public house

864
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,991
I don't give a s*** about any of this

865
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:06,111
Tina this is the time where it should be like

866
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,927
Get a law firm and just start

867
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,975
Going after people who are lying about

868
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:16,607
This is too important to let them continue

869
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,471
Surpass the actual malice

870
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,031
Standard that's required for

871
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,591
Alfred suing the public

872
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,871
Publix

873
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,431
I don't know

874
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:33,247
How do we get to this big news on

875
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,271
Covid-19

876
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:37,087
18 and it's that they're going to be locked down

877
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,367
Again

878
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,391
Maybe

879
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:44,767
We do that

880
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,303
Squeezo ceiling light off

881
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,583
Often squeeze again

882
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,191
Stop non-complying

883
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:59,615
Psychologically figured out until you transcend the psychology

884
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,639
And say hi

885
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,919
This no matter what

886
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,247
Good

887
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,319
Overthrow you

888
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,863
Electricity

889
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,447
They fear for the record I'm not particularly afraid of that clearly

890
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:26,239
Performative expression is spiritual and

891
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:33,407
Are you depressed

892
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,967
I'm not scared

893
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:45,951
And then when tension with the lockdown got too high with people resisting that use a lockdown only to lock down again later one

894
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,231
People light off

895
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:51,839
It's a compelling way to experience the world but another interpretation of this next bit more

896
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,191
Putting in public health protective mesures is essential in terms

897
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,983
Trying to overcome this pandemic

898
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,823
But

899
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:07,967
He measures bring up would require amount of political will in right now

900
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:12,575
Businesses being closed and forced to run safely cut business owners profit

901
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,879
People

902
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,671
If the place that is close

903
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:26,143
Status of unemployment

904
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:31,263
But that's just incentivizing people to not get

905
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:39,711
Our leaders have made the decision that they just don't want to do those things

906
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,735
Cheerleading to

907
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,503
Intentions

908
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:46,111
Mixer

909
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:49,951
People who feel like they deserve all the amenities and luxuries they've enjoyed

910
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,487
Back in late 2019

911
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:53,279
Like going to crowded bars

912
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,047
Sporting event

913
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:59,167
These people are very loud and insistent the people who are not them should be forced to go back to work

914
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:02,495
To facilitate their ability

915
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:07,615
These horses lead to some short-sighted leaders prematurely opening back up businesses

916
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,407
Which has a very predictable result

917
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,223
Spike in coronavirus cases

918
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,247
So now what

919
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:16,063
You end up in a super predictable and completely on

920
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:22,463
Winnable situation because

921
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,487
Was safe to do so

922
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,535
We need to close things back up

923
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:28,863
Any of the other side saying

924
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,959
Just to justify reposing everything

925
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:36,031
It seems to me that it's too late to do anything about this

926
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:39,615
A certain section population just doesn't believe this virus is real

927
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,663
Bruce is going to change their mind

928
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:45,759
I obviously hope for the best

929
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,527
Can't handle

930
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,807
In the current state we're in

931
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:59,583
The short answer

932
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,119
Find more people

933
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:05,471
You're going to find more cases so I said to my people slowed

934
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:12,127
Call Medford

935
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,919
Which he later said

936
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,943
He does not.

937
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:21,343
Is bulshit not already like

938
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,951
Writing up Nuremberg Trial ship

939
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:29,791
Has a history of saying that the virus pandemic

940
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:36,447
In an article in the Hill from May 14th include Trump's comments quote

941
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:40,543
We have more cases than anybody in the world but why because we do more testing

942
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:44,639
When you test you have a case when you test you find something is wrong with me

943
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,455
If we didn't do any testing

944
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,015
They don't want to write that it's common sense

945
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,039
Ask much more

946
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:57,183
Oh and mentioned on Tuesday the 23rd

947
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:04,095
And his answer was quote

948
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,143
Let me just tell you let me make it clear

949
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:10,239
Trump is operating off the understanding that goes like this

950
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,287
If we don't know about it

951
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,919
The only thing that makes someone sick is that we have a number on a piece of paper

952
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:22,783
And that's because the number is legitimately the only part of the whole equation that effect

953
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,343
Higher numbers make him look bad

954
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,623
And he wants lower number

955
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:27,647
It's that simple

956
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:34,559
Going back as far as March Outlets like Politico and rolling stone

957
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,375
Administration's efforts to fight Coronavirus

958
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,143
Because

959
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:38,911
He is quote

960
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,727
Made clear the lower numbers on Coronavirus

961
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,519
The better for his potential re-election

962
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,287
In the fall

963
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:51,711
What we're seeing right now and the inevitable conversation about reclosing businesses

964
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,735
Expressed by our leadership

965
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:57,855
With coherent messaging incompetent leadership we could probably easily navigate this challenge

966
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:02,719
It's obviously not impossible many countries around the world have had success where we've failed

967
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:04,767
This I believe

968
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:11,679
What I'm saying is I'm becoming more concerned

969
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,703
About what it will take

970
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,983
To get people

971
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:14,751
Like the folks

972
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:15,775
Send Trump's base

973
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,055
To recognize reality

974
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,871
I don't I'm scared more about

975
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,895
B scale

976
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,943
Jamaican

977
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,223
Pretend like

978
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,759
I mean

979
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:27,807
Honestly it's

980
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,855
That they're there a bunch of Shield

981
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:32,671
Anytime you have children having a mass

982
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,207
Like this

983
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,279
Quick and dirty

984
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,815
Seiko to timeout

985
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:42,143
Like what it what are we what should we do

986
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:44,191
You guys get to come back

987
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:44,959
In five years

988
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:48,543
Until then you stay in your place

989
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,311
Vampires

990
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,943
So Alex is mad

991
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,015
About how they're going to lock everything back down

992
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,831
Goes out to break

993
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,855
With

994
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,159
So just pray

995
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:07,231
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton

996
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,047
Fauci all of them

997
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,583
To be judged by God.

998
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,631
McDonough car wreck

999
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,423
Chopped off

1000
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:17,215
God

1001
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,519
Punishes them

1002
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:25,663
Just say God I love you I trust you

1003
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:28,223
And thank you for Jesus

1004
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,783
We just pray for you to get fauci

1005
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,831
And Bill Gates and Hillary offer back

1006
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,903
Just pray

1007
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,671
Forgot

1008
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:41,279
Take action against this monster is demon

1009
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,095
No hair

1010
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,375
Harmed upon his little

1011
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,399
Theodore's

1012
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,423
Chinny-chin-chin

1013
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,727
Free

1014
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:53,311
So that angel that Moses called on

1015
00:58:55,103 --> 00:59:00,223
This is absolutely unacceptable

1016
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,015
He's essentially begging his audience

1017
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,807
The kill Obama Hillary and fauci

1018
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,087
To your neck lift that we just heard

1019
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:11,999
Essential thing to understand is that when Alex says that he prays for God's Vengeance or for God to strike these people

1020
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,279
Kind of spiritual

1021
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:17,375
You're not hoping for a stray lightning bolt to hit them on their morning walk

1022
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,191
You talkin about them being murdered by another person

1023
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:27,359
It's a fully expressed belief on Alex Jones Show that the concept of Vengeance being

1024
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,407
Which is explained by the understanding

1025
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,967
God's vengeance

1026
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,503
You've been very clear about this

1027
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:37,087
The past the show on April 5th

1028
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,111
2019

1029
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,903
Vengeance is God

1030
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,767
Vengeance is

1031
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,535
Gaucho

1032
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,327
God has in store

1033
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,447
That's always the twist to the riddle

1034
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,031
Expect

1035
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,567
Terrorize Josh

1036
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,103
Monopoly

1037
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,895
Your dungeon

1038
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:04,479
We're going to terrorize you

1039
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,807
Alex is trying to encourage an unhinged member of his audience

1040
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,831
Committing acts of violence

1041
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,111
It's against his political enemies

1042
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,207
Appealing to quotes gods of vengeance

1043
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:19,071
How to contact it appears that he's just saying that these people will get what they deserve in the afterlife

1044
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:21,375
But if you understand Alex's

1045
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:24,191
Send a text

1046
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,983
It cannot be clear In that clip

1047
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,311
Do you want someone to kill those be

1048
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:33,919
I don't want to do it myself cuz then I will face consequences

1049
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,479
Notoriously averse to that

1050
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,015
Right I can't ask

1051
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:38,783
Other people

1052
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,159
Consequences

1053
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,951
So what I'll do is

1054
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:51,839
Is carried out by actors

1055
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:56,959
One area and then in another area I will call back to that however I will only say

1056
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,287
God killed these people

1057
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,591
And if you happen to feel like yours

1058
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:13,599
You can't even say no even if someone

1059
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,671
Alex Jones

1060
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:25,375
Looks like somebody sitting at their job

1061
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,399
How to kill people

1062
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:28,703
Too smart for the law

1063
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,031
So Alex gets to talking about

1064
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:36,127
Other staff about the virus and more stuff up

1065
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:38,687
E-Z UP tent

1066
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,807
Couple million have starved us

1067
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,903
On the news what the big issue

1068
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:49,951
Dead people

1069
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,327
Seminole subconscious Twinkie

1070
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:04,031
First I want to say that I've never heard anyone talk more about the idea that there are too many people in Africa than Alec

1071
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,383
Talk about overpopulation concerns and sustainable growth

1072
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,663
Being helped by available

1073
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,199
Family Planning

1074
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:14,271
Sincerely Alex talks about how unnamed other people

1075
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,575
Africa

1076
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,623
Think it's him

1077
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:20,927
Yeah that sounds right

1078
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,487
Story

1079
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:30,655
You're making this up

1080
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,423
He's

1081
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,591
Apple billion

1082
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,359
Just alyx

1083
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:45,759
If you made up updated numbers anywhere including website

1084
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:50,111
Station on this week

1085
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,439
P style guide

1086
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,743
Because if it's any less than

1087
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:59,327
10 million you can you can call it a handful of Millions

1088
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:05,215
Betsy technically

1089
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:11,359
So the Lord's day being about making up new stories

1090
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,407
And is lying about existing

1091
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,455
Subjective

1092
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,991
Carry workers

1093
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,783
150

1094
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,319
This is MSN

1095
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,671
For 24 months

1096
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,191
A few of the members came out positive

1097
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:39,775
That's right

1098
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,335
All of it is just a

1099
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,127
Martial law

1100
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:48,223
This is a story about an employer mistreating their vulnerable employees

1101
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,015
Seasonal workers

1102
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:50,783
For Mexico

1103
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:55,391
152nd by North Pacific

1104
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:58,463
Dixie foods and they were transported to Alaska

1105
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,743
Where they would then work

1106
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,511
Until August

1107
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:05,119
In transit they were required to be tested for covid-19

1108
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,143
Three of them test

1109
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:06,911
Positive

1110
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,703
Well they were awaiting results

1111
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:12,287
Plaza LAX Hotel

1112
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:18,431
Positive results are required to extend their stay very

1113
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,967
During which time they weren't going

1114
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:20,735
Going to get paid

1115
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:26,111
The workers filed a lawsuit that alleges that their key cards for their hotel rooms were deactivated

1116
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:26,879
Kum & Go

1117
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,671
They were told that if they left their rooms

1118
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
For any reason

1119
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,975
They would be immediately fired

1120
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:35,583
We'll see what comes up when this goes to court but as it appears currently the facts seem to pay

1121
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:39,423
Company abusing migrant labor

1122
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:44,031
And just a few factbase corrections but Alex's fake reporting on this story

1123
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:45,567
1

1124
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,359
Oz of these workers have been forced

1125
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,639
To be in quarantine for months

1126
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:55,295
The workers were not even hired until June 2nd

1127
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:57,343
Any hotel rooms

1128
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:02,207
Send story regardless

1129
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,231
4 months

1130
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:09,375
That's crazy because a couple of them tested positive for covid-19

1131
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:13,471
Is completely made up nothing to do with it

1132
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:14,751
It's B North

1133
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:21,151
Pacific Seafood Company in Seattle

1134
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,455
The only connection with Newsome

1135
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,783
Beat the Los Angeles is in the state use the governor of

1136
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,319
That's best I can do

1137
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:32,415
These are too factual misrepresentation that Alex make sense

1138
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,207
I'm 30 seconds covering the story

1139
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,767
You can easily see how these misrepresentation

1140
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:39,327
Completely change the story and make it a lie

1141
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:43,423
These workers are suing North Pacific Seafood at the hotel

1142
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:45,727
The story

1143
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:49,055
He's he's taking what these workers went through in coop

1144
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:54,175
Suffered and blamed it on

1145
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:58,271
Alex doesn't want to deal with this door on the merits and discuss regulating business

1146
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,575
Strictly to their Force to protect workers rights

1147
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:03,391
Play flies directly in the face of his entire ideology

1148
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,927
At the same time

1149
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:07,743
He can't resist the opportunity to use these workers as a

1150
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:10,047
The prop to attack is imagined

1151
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,071
It's like Gavin Newsom

1152
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,351
Zoe does it

1153
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:16,703
The history of Labor Relations in the United States is like

1154
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:23,359
Rich corporations will hire people or at least strongly influence that man to make

1155
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:26,175
Making all of their evils in all of their transgression

1156
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,991
Appear to be the government

1157
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,783
And then the government

1158
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,575
Taking all of the heat for that

1159
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,951
Making music deregulating s*** in order to mollify the people who wrongly

1160
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,231
I think that it's the government

1161
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,535
Evil Corporation

1162
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:44,095
Screwing people Corporation

1163
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:47,167
Can screw them over and they still blame

1164
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:54,335
I request that you never looking

1165
01:06:54,591 --> 01:07:00,735
Into the history of the John Birch Society and their intertwining with National Association of Manufacturers

1166
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:16,351
I'm so in this next Club

1167
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,119
Anthony fauci

1168
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,911
And he's talking about how

1169
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,191
He doesn't feel great

1170
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:25,823
That Americans seem to not trust science and people who are experts on topics

1171
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,871
And Alex's pretty

1172
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,151
About this

1173
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,991
I'm surprised

1174
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,527
And it's amazing sometimes

1175
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,111
The same thing that gets people

1176
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,647
Anti-vaxxers

1177
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,719
Even though the

1178
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,511
Cleveland

1179
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:45,535
The safety

1180
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,559
Tabaxi

1181
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,095
Really

1182
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:55,519
Notice she didn't give me any sources out of here

1183
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:09,855
The kids are pedophiles have sex with him

1184
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,415
Mainline the building

1185
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:21,375
I guess if Alex wants to take fauci to task for not proving the vaccines are good in a conversation

1186
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,143
His right

1187
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:25,215
Seems like a weird standards ever people but whatever

1188
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:31,871
About sources and sighting stories and what

1189
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,687
Completely misreporting

1190
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:38,783
Those articles in the German press do not save its thousands of kids

1191
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,319
Foster care with pedophiles

1192
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:46,719
The number is unclear currently but Alex and with these articles are effectively

1193
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,487
Using a source

1194
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:53,119
What you doing is appealing to the authority of an outlet like Der Spiegel while simultaneously just met

1195
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:53,887
Making things up

1196
01:08:54,655 --> 01:09:00,799
He wants you to take his version of the story as being as legitimate as it might think it is if you heard it coming from

1197
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:01,567
Another Outlet

1198
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:04,127
Because on some level Alex

1199
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:07,967
Vicky's untrustworthy

1200
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:10,015
Precise sight of

1201
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,831
Paul Joseph Watson on my reality

1202
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:20,511
Sources sources correctly

1203
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,535
Just making things up

1204
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,303
Entirely

1205
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:25,631
Oh and if you need a source on that I have about 440 episodes

1206
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:31,263
The podcast I can recommend to you somewhere

1207
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:34,591
Something like that could you could you print out several hundred

1208
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:38,175
Stacks of paper which are transcripts

1209
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,711
Just got to get a printer

1210
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:47,135
He's a little baby

1211
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,695
Nothing short people he's like

1212
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,255
That he's literally limeade

1213
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,935
Mm long ding dong

1214
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,727
The dude is a jerk

1215
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,031
She's five foot seven

1216
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:06,335
Because it demonstrates

1217
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:08,895
The places that Alex Goes when he starts ranting

1218
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,175
An attacking people he hates

1219
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:13,759
It's always

1220
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,807
Diminish them in terms of how

1221
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,087
Define masculinity

1222
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,647
Shorty's got a small dick

1223
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:23,743
Alex desperately crave to be taken seriously as an adult but he operates

1224
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,279
Entirely is an angry adolescent

1225
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,583
Very sad

1226
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:29,119
Common trait among

1227
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:32,959
The Republican

1228
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:35,519
People everybody I know

1229
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,287
I don't think

1230
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,055
Circle

1231
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,663
Facetious I believe he's looking

1232
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,431
Shity

1233
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,967
That's a good word to

1234
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:52,671
So sprays more than you know is a animated gif

1235
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,975
Sunday

1236
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:59,583
I pray that God visit

1237
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:03,423
Judgment in the name of Jesus Christ

1238
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,471
Bill Gates

1239
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:06,495
Fauci

1240
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:08,543
Hillary Clinton

1241
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,847
Upon the globalist

1242
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,455
Forgot to send

1243
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,991
Is Angel

1244
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,951
My ancestors

1245
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,559
Stanford

1246
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:31,583
Cheerios

1247
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,607
Play

1248
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:41,823
Creeping death

1249
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:46,687
By Metallica

1250
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:54,367
Specifically not talked out that way

1251
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,903
Lyrics very clearly

1252
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:59,231
I'll explain more clearly begging for someone to

1253
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,535
To kill his enemies

1254
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:03,839
Yeah

1255
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,119
Goodman little bit over

1256
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:23,295
Alex gets around to talking about a big

1257
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,063
Figment store

1258
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:34,303
Trump is a hero for doing a campaign rally

1259
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,095
All right let's go

1260
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:44,543
Infowars.com

1261
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:46,335
Brawl Brothers

1262
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:51,199
Luciferian March for One World Government

1263
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:55,295
Group organizes Nationwide rallies

1264
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,855
Promoting New World Order

1265
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:04,511
Reuters

1266
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,303
Nationwide

1267
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:10,655
AP and Reuters are not breathlessly reported on this story

1268
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:13,215
There's a post on Infowars

1269
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:17,311
And his source is a quote Christian YouTuber named Hannah Williamson

1270
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:23,199
4 months ago

1271
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:28,319
One thing I think is really weird is that our Channel page was created in on October 15th

1272
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:31,391
2012 but the oldest video on there is from last year

1273
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:36,511
That's a mystery I don't really care to solve but whatever the case you that young Christian and X Type

1274
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:40,607
Who made a video about the satanic and how they're trying to bring in a one world government

1275
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,679
So this is about a group on Facebook called

1276
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,703
Disciples of Lucy

1277
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,007
Who I honestly think central

1278
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:51,103
Listing for services they offer they say they buy Souls

1279
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:59,551
Whatever your heart desires money sex drugs

1280
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:07,487
Is you

1281
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:12,863
Real weird

1282
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:13,887
You name it

1283
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:20,799
These are all the time

1284
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:28,991
How do you record it on the store

1285
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:32,831
Concluded quote there is no evidence that the marches are legitimate

1286
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:39,231
If you look at the Facebook pages history they did this back in February 2019 as well

1287
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:42,303
Marcus government

1288
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:43,839
The only evidence I can

1289
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:47,423
Can find it anything ever even

1290
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,447
Christian showed up

1291
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,471
In the rain

1292
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:51,263
After protests

1293
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,799
March in Texarkana

1294
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,359
And this year continues that tradition

1295
01:14:55,615 --> 01:15:01,759
I was able to find a guy in Salem Oregon

1296
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,807
But no one showed up

1297
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:10,207
This is almost certainly some dude trolling people with his Facebook page and dumbass is taking it seriously

1298
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:16,863
I wasn't pretending at all

1299
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,399
Paige is comes from

1300
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:20,191
The parody of his own beliefs

1301
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,983
Isn't that something here

1302
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,799
Why are they

1303
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:30,687
We get there so sit with there should be a moratorium on any like

1304
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:35,039
All tricking of the hard-right if you're dumb enough to fall for any hoax

1305
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:36,319
It's fine

1306
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:42,719
Like morally if there is no the downside anymore trick them into doing whatever

1307
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:48,607
I agree with that because I come to a point where

1308
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:52,959
Someone's tricking qanon people into believing X wires

1309
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:58,079
I think it's just not even interesting anymore as a sport or whatever like

1310
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:02,431
Point where you don't prove anything

1311
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:04,735
Or

1312
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,015
To trick people in these

1313
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,551
Extreme right-wing Cycles

1314
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,319
It's it's

1315
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,087
There's a

1316
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:11,647
High level of gullibility

1317
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:18,047
This isn't this trolling isn't impressive

1318
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:23,935
Tricking people into believing

1319
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:27,007
Right I meant I meant

1320
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,567
I'm out in the rain

1321
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,591
All the time

1322
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:36,735
Possibility

1323
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:41,599
Examples that I could find with the Texarkana

1324
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:46,719
People just ended up wasting their time

1325
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:49,279
What is Vine

1326
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:52,095
Comfortable

1327
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:55,679
The thought that like the risk of someone getting hurt

1328
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:57,727
Is chocolate with that

1329
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:01,567
Yammy need to put any proximity

1330
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,335
Getting hurt

1331
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:04,383
Like just being around

1332
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:07,199
Carries the risk of being hurt that's the reality of

1333
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,759
2020 is that

1334
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:11,551
If you're around the hard right

1335
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:19,999
Radio host is telling people to kill Obama

1336
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:29,471
Christian YouTuber

1337
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,775
There's actually another source on

1338
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,479
Even try to Alexa

1339
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:46,623
How much really racist statues have been torn down

1340
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:48,159
Allegedly

1341
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:53,791
So The Other Side Story that was just pointed out his intellihub

1342
01:17:54,303 --> 01:18:00,447
Which is the stupid blog that says written by

1343
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:05,055
Shepherds

1344
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:11,455
Qanon account

1345
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,479
Animal videos

1346
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:13,247
Very weird

1347
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,039
My point here is this is not good

1348
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:22,463
It's terrible work with websites

1349
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:27,583
That's already not happened by the time he's on air

1350
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:32,447
These marches were supposed to happen on Sunday at 2 p.m. in Alex goes on a RAV4

1351
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:34,751
Waste of time

1352
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,519
Israeli bear

1353
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,055
Is really bad

1354
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:43,199
So Alex play some clips of trump speech mysteriously doesn't play with clip where he says I told them to

1355
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:44,991
Text Lex people

1356
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:45,759
Strange

1357
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:46,783
Strange in its absence

1358
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,391
Riverside club

1359
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:55,487
Joe Biden the side of a China or America this is really a

1360
01:18:57,023 --> 01:19:00,351
When I took

1361
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:07,519
Decisive action

1362
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:13,919
Hysteria

1363
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:21,343
He said he was wrong but he didn't say it

1364
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:27,743
What seven colors on one of those

1365
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:30,815
Policy decisions of our lifetime

1366
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:34,911
He's pretty remarkable and pretty much everything

1367
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:40,031
Is not true

1368
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:43,103
Most interesting narrative about by

1369
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:47,199
So this is a live Trump started rotting out back in March

1370
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:48,735
In an interview with Sean Hannity

1371
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:53,343
In reality B have not called Trump's move to block travel from China xenophobic

1372
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,879
What you did was he tweeted

1373
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:57,951
We're in the midst of a crisis with the Coronavirus

1374
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,999
We need to lead the way with science

1375
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:03,583
Donald Trump's record of Hysteria xenophobia

1376
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:07,423
He's the worst possible person to lead our country through a global Health Emergency

1377
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:13,311
This became Biden Colony travel restrictions hysteria xenophobia

1378
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:15,360
You know that wasn't what Biden said

1379
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:19,200
And it's a pretty fair description of Trump's history

1380
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:25,600
I'm the victim no matter what I'm just

1381
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:34,048
Naturally this letter was made up

1382
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:36,864
Never happy

1383
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:43,776
Trump is complaining that the media didn't cover a send him to apologize for

1384
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:45,056
Play in the first place

1385
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,080
The rallies mad

1386
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:47,360
ImmediaDent carburetor

1387
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,688
I'm struggle

1388
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,968
Struggling

1389
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:56,320
Struggling with opening my eyes ever in the morning

1390
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:59,904
Don't like it

1391
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:02,464
Really hot sauces

1392
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,744
That's a good idea

1393
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,768
Cuz it would hurt

1394
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:14,240
So Alex and Sunday episode here

1395
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,264
Just it's Madison

1396
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,544
Okay

1397
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,456
You know we're going to win

1398
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,248
One way or the other

1399
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,272
But if we don't win

1400
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,296
This way peacefully

1401
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:32,928
People shoot their mouths off all daily one violence

1402
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,208
Are you really ready for that

1403
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:37,792
You ready for that

1404
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,352

01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:00,064
Shoot people

1411
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:06,208
And then constantly praying on are for these specific targeting of the people he deems as anime

1412
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:08,000
Real comforting fireside chat

1413
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,816
I just like to sit around

1414
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:14,912
Remind myself how

1415
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:16,960
It's a it's a it's us against them

1416

Do you know

1417
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:24,128
So Alex, 22nd

1418
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:30,784
Quite a bit at the beginning or something or something

1419
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:38,464
Do it

1420
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:44,864
Building the shop

1421
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:50,496
Everything I heard this before

1422
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:52,800
My brain and covered properly

1423
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,176
I took off

1424
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:02,016
Last week and nnn only work about 5 hours a day

1425
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:05,856
The normal 12 or so

1426
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:13,280
Back here in studio

1427
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:16,608
And I'm just looking all of this it is

1428
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:19,168
Personally really frustrated so

1429
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,568
So fitting that he came in with

1430
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,848
King nothing

1431
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:28,896
Absolute

1432
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:34,272
Bowser

1433
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:37,856
A story

1434
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:45,792
6 thing is

1435
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:48,096
About

1436
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:52,192
Video of G Edward Griffin

1437
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,728
Who is an old-time

1438
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,848
Video cam from the 6

1439
01:23:59,104 --> 01:23:59,616
Steve

1440
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:02,688
Baby contraction people posting on social media

1441
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:05,248
Is mad because what has been done

1442
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:10,112
Is the Infowars logo

1443
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:13,440
So Alex Alex appliances

1444
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,304
Little bit

1445
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,840
While I'm up here on air

1446
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:22,144
I didn't remember a bunch of things

1447
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,192
And so

1448
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:26,752
There's just too much planning goes into the show

1449
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,824
Griffin clip from the 60s

1450
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:35,712
Yeah I sent it to Rob do a couple times

1451
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:43,136
An article about a griffin

1452
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:47,744
I am plan to try America

1453
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:49,792
At 1 today

1454
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:52,096
Infowars.com

1455
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:59,520
Assure link to these peoples YouTube video

1456
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,336
The Clincher clips

1457
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:08,224
I went before he died

1458
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,648
YouTube

1459
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:18,208
And then they don't even have the common courtesy to

1460
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:19,488
Website

1461
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:25,120
Batman

1462
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:30,240
Do Clippers really hilarious

1463
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,800
He's so mad that his personal use the clipper

1464
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:38,432
G Edward Griffin took the Infowars Watermark off it to the point before

1465
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:40,224
I can understand his anger

1466
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,016
You know it's pretty clear

1467
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:44,064
Person would remove that Watermark is

1468
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,624
Because they know that any association with Infowars

1469
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,160
Your video looking please stupid

1470
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:51,488
Rather not people know

1471
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:52,256
There is

1472
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:59,168
We've talked a little bit about G Edward Griffin in the past

1473
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:00,448
The John Birch Society

1474
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:06,336
When Alex says the Griffin expose the Communists are trying to create a race war in America back in the 60s

1475
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:11,456
Alex is really just describing G Edward Griffin called the Civil Rights Movement

1476
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,224
Plot

1477
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:16,064
This was a pretty standard feature in the anti-communist hardliners in the US

1478
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:16,832
Set the time

1479
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:21,952
Anytime there was something we're white interest or threatened it was a manifestation of evil communist meddling

1480
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:26,304
The fight against the brutal apartheid regime in Rhodesia was the work of commies

1481
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:31,680
Nelson Mandela's campaign

1482
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,472
You start to notice a little bit of a

1483
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,776
Choose writing screenplays

1484
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:44,224
Parallels between the president in nineteen

1485
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,504
Thumbtack

1486
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:50,112
And one of them is the rhetoric coming out of these damn extreme-right which

1487
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,392
Is now the mainstream right

1488
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:59,584
This isn't because G Edward Griffin was some kind of a prophet it's because of how these folks always respond to attempt

1489
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,632
Wants to create a more Equitable Society

1490
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:05,472
The other side of this is at the Communist Party in the United States

1491
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:07,520
Pretty long history of fighting for civil rights

1492
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,568
And so you

1493
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:11,360
Always be able to find

1494
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,128
Waze

1495
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:12,896
To link

1496
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:14,432
Communist Party 2

1497
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:20,832
See look they're fighting for civil rights

1498
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:22,624
Are they

1499
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:31,072
Race war with Communism

1500
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:33,888
Distribute

1501
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:36,192
That's how they're going to

1502
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:37,216
Sure okay

1503
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:39,008
So in the State score

1504
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:42,848
Alex

1505
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:45,920
But he seems unable to really get

1506
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,712
Perfect timing

1507
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:51,808
To get into the globalist master plan at the bottom of the next hour and

1508
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,088
We'll do it then

1509
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:56,416
It's just that I probably need to take off

1510
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:58,208
For 10 minutes or something

1511
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,512
Do my office with this article

1512
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:02,304
Just get those out info

1513
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,328
Focus on it because

1514
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:04,096
I'm hungry

1515
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:12,800
Play Babel about this

1516
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,616
Could be us

1517
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,784
Probably I like the headline on it

1518
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:25,088
I don't know where to land

1519
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:30,208
Right prepared at all

1520
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:34,560
Berrington place

1521
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:35,584
You finally

1522
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,352
Sit down

1523
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,376
Outside

1524
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:38,656
Let's do it

1525
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:39,424
Your gums

1526
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:41,472
My big story that I've been teasing

1527
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,240
Alright

1528
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:47,616
Major Ally

1529
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:58,624
Beautiful and wonderful the end of humanity is going to be because she has fallen

1530
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,416
Ugly

1531
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,208
Sale

1532
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,328
And it covid-19 is teaching us to lower carbon footprint

1533
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,400
To live

1534
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:12,192
In our houses

1535
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:17,568
And that virtual reality is coming that will plug directly into brain

1536
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:21,408
It will give you this beautiful wonderful New World and then

1537
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:22,944
You got a

1538
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,480
Hit the button

1539
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:33,696
Turn off your body and Diane stop being a bad carbon life form

1540
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:37,024
Okay come on

1541
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,840
Only thing worse than eating meat is actually made out of

1542
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:43,936
And that you will then be uploaded and merge

1543
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:45,984
With this beautiful

1544
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:49,568
Wonderful super intelligence that will be gone

1545
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,104
It will be the Beast

1546
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:51,872
You worship

1547
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:57,504
You will have to accept it when the Beast says it's your time

1548
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:00,320
For the carbon balance

1549
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:02,112
You will go to a facility

1550
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:05,184
You'll be checked in your consciousness

1551
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:07,744
Then you will live forever

1552
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,792
Where's the Super Intelius

1553
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,632
4 page article

1554
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:19,520
Wall Street Journal

1555
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:28,736
Completely misrepresenting this article in the Wall Street Journal

1556
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:33,856
Normally talk about

1557
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:34,624
At all

1558
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:36,928
Core pages

1559
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:37,696
Too long

1560
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,000
So if you made it to the end of that opinion

1561
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:41,792
You see what a residence

1562
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:47,936
More of the burdens and dangers of physical existence

1563
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:52,032
This class in professional divide

1564
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:55,104
With the virtual Elite being served

1565
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:56,128
In class

1566
01:30:56,384 --> 01:31:00,224
Of course welcome power of always offered some insurance against lifespan

1567
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:02,016
During the Civil War America

1568
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:04,576
Substitute to take their place on the drive

1569
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:09,952
So you may be able to pay someone to take your place in the disease and danger written physical world

1570
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,512
Well you stay behind at the safety of a screen

1571
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:17,120
Human future in which mortality

1572
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:20,192
But if it sooner for some of us than for others

1573
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:21,216
To prove to be a

1574
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:21,984
Dystopia

1575
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:28,896
The beginning of the essay is about the kind of standard transhumanist ideas about being able to develop

1576
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:30,176
Come up with some kind of a mess

1577
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,200
Stop aging

1578
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,992
And the notion that our consciousness

1579
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,784
Could it possibly become

1580
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,320
Non-local

1581
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:41,440
The rest of the article as it goes along seems to be the

1582
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,464
Coronavirus

1583
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:46,304
About these futuristic ideas

1584
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:51,168
Different sorts of jobs have different levels of ability to avoid risk

1585
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:51,936
In the pan

1586
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,984
And this reveals an inherent social

1587
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,776
Inequality that could be magnified

1588
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:56,544
Exponentially

1589
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:00,128
In the event of any betrayal

1590
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:02,432
Read correctly

1591
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:05,504
This article seems to be a beast that looks at a balance

1592
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:08,576
There's a possibility of amazing technological

1593
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:10,112
And me life extension

1594
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:15,232
Even if you only consider the ability we would have to travel around the Galaxy

1595
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:21,888
Probably be something

1596
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,656
Get f*****

1597
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,448
Decided

1598
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:28,544
The end

1599
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:34,432
I think that's more

1600
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:36,480
As I kind of like a warning

1601
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,808
Yeah in the same way that top one

1602
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,344
Consolidated

1603
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,368
Wealth Beyond

1604
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,904
Reason now there

1605
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:44,672
Essentially

1606
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:46,208
Consolidating the future is

1607
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:53,120
They get to own all of the time

1608
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:59,264
Handled

1609
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,800
Capital do we have in the world

1610
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:03,872
You could very easily see the ways in which

1611
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:04,640
Could be used

1612
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:11,552
Looking forward

1613
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:14,368
Decided that was enough for a what's up

1614
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:16,160
Just making all the rest of it up

1615
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:21,280
That's all I had to do is work

1616
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:23,584
How dare you say that

1617
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:27,168
You read the headline he ate a sandwich

1618
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:36,384
Story about the German children

1619
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:43,552
Just like their acceleration

1620
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:45,088
Like there's there's

1621
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:45,856
Khushbu

1622
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,672
Come out the German government was

1623
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:49,952
Nationwide

1624
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,024
For 50 years

1625
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:56,864
Taking tens of thousands we now learn

1626
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:00,960
To produce

1627
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:02,752
Scientific literature

1628
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:05,568
The ultimate family and the ultimate love

1629
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:08,128
The story is that extends 1000

1630
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:10,688
Children in Germany or given to pedophiles

1631
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:14,784
I was just making that up he has absolutely no citation or source

1632
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:17,600
This is a pattern of Alex's Behavior

1633
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:18,624
What do tens

1634
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,440
To do is find a story that's true on a basic life

1635
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:24,256
Is a real story underneath

1636
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:29,888
But what Alex did on Sunday was create a fake version of this story could see more exciting for him

1637
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:33,216
A fake version that

1638
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:39,872
Alex gets bored easily though so you and the thrill of telling the fake version of the story only lasted a day

1639
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:41,664
Before you needed to embellish it further

1640
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:44,224
With no evidence now tens of thousands

1641
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:47,552
Jason just reporting on

1642
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:48,832
Was Tim children

1643
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,416
He further embellishes the story to say that it went on for 50 years

1644
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:55,232
The report

1645
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:58,304
Those witches all Alex ever even say that it was 30 years

1646
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:00,608
It is important to understand

1647
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:02,144
Alex cannot help himself

1648
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:07,264
You can't resist lying about stories like this to weaponize them against his chosen Target

1649
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:11,104
If he cared about this story or the vicar

1650
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:14,944
Responsibility

1651
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:18,272
You can never act this way it's just that it's an incomplete

1652
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:20,064
F*** you to everything

1653
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,344
He's getting himself

1654
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:22,880
Like that's

1655
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:25,184
How could you do

1656
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:31,072
How could you do that unless there was some perverse pleasure

1657
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,888
Probably be

1658
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:38,496
As inclined to believe that it's more situation where he recognizes

1659
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:39,776
How powerful it is

1660
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:41,056
For his listeners

1661
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:42,848
Like it's such a

1662
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:43,872
Like

1663
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,408
The button for people

1664
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:50,272
We're a lot of there

1665
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:52,064
Skills you can leave them

1666
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,856
More into a

1667
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:54,880
Buying your s***

1668
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:56,160
Kind of mindset

1669
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:59,232
It's very extreme and it's very visceral

1670
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:02,304
Corby bolts

1671
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,840
It's something that I think

1672
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:06,400
You just understand the power of

1673
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:08,192
I think that's what he's doing more than

1674
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:09,728
Him actually like

1675
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,264
For sure

1676
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:16,640
Of course he's doing that

1677
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:19,712
The ways doing it but the way that he embellishes

1678
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:21,504
From a day-to-day

1679
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,808
Racist

1680
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:24,576
Personally

1681
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:30,976
Let me

1682
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:35,072
Situation where

1683
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,352
Bored like

1684
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:42,752
The story there's something right

1685
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:45,312
It's more of a like

1686
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:46,848
To keep pushing Hawaii

1687
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:47,872
Right

1688
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:54,272
There's no excitement

1689
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:58,112
Kind of like a twisting of

1690
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:04,768
Reasonable or moral

1691
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:09,888
Something

1692
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:17,568
Talkin about

1693
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:19,360
People people a day

1694
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:21,152
Sure sure sure sure

1695
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:24,736
Actually this is pretty interesting cuz I make

1696
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:26,784
Turn on Cube

1697
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,136
The Gulf

1698
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:32,672
Mexico

1699
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:35,744
Wife

1700
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:47,008
Most people didn't know who I was

1701
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:49,056
30%

1702
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:53,920
What almost everyone else I'll be at the bar picking up food to take the room

1703
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:58,528
Bill Gates

1704
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:06,720
I'll be at the beach

1705
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:13,376
Because

1706
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:16,192
General Public

1707
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:18,496
Not really political

1708
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:31,808
Whenever

1709
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:33,856
I just get mad by

1710
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:34,880
Some of the key people

1711
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:36,672
Think about me that's not true

1712
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,232
Whatever I

1713
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:45,376
Symposium on a show about Q

1714
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:49,984
Positive or negative

1715
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:52,032
I think it's positive

1716
01:38:57,408 --> 01:39:03,552
I don't know how you can just go back and forth on this Tuesday route onto

1717
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:05,856
You can't get it they hate you

1718
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:11,744
If you can't beat them join them doesn't work whenever then wants you gone

1719
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,072
I like the idea that maybe you saw standing up on this

1720
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:18,144
And there'll be some desperate overtures that will be mocked

1721
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:20,960
And we can call up

1722
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:25,568
Guys over to an autonomous if there's any Rumblings

1723
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,360
But I will see

1724
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:31,456
Episode

1725
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:32,736
Interesting

1726
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:37,344
As the 21st episode had a lot more like really f***** up things

1727
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:42,208
Studio

1728
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:46,816
Portion of the stuff on the 22nd would be just

1729
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:49,120
Eating a lot a stuff Friday

1730
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:49,888
Sunday

1731
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:54,752
Reverend

1732
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:57,312
Who's the guy who believes that

1733
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:59,104
Abortion is black genocide

1734
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:05,504
Use the black preacher who who Alex had on today after heart and Charleston

1735
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:11,392
He can't

1736
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,720
Who

1737
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:16,256
Color that

1738
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:17,792
He's kind of sick of trump

1739
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:19,840
Everybody loves you

1740
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:20,608
Alright

1741
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:22,912
32 years old

1742
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:24,192
I've been on Euston

1743
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:27,264
Prison Planet when the internet went

1744
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,032
Get on

1745
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:30,336
Emily loves you

1746
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:33,152
We have to re-evaluate this political state

1747
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:33,920
Situation

1748
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:37,504
And it as a as a brother in Christ I want to tell you

1749
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:40,576
Compass Foods

1750
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:42,368
Seafood everybody

1751
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,160
We have to get over that

1752
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:45,952
We have to go forward

1753
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:48,000
There's nowhere else to go

1754
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:55,680
You know at

1755
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:56,704
Good question

1756
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:59,264
When I realized it's all a sham

1757
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,056
You know his money the Sham

1758
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:05,152
His Investments are probably install it and probably 90%

1759
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,944
Holding someone else

1760
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:11,296
Do you realize that stuff that Alex back in 2015

1761
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:21,024
I noticed you just talk about Rodger Stone

1762
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:23,072
Bas best friend

1763
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:25,120
He's letting them go

1764
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:30,496
If you were my friend and you let me go to prison

1765
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:31,520
Over nothing

1766
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:33,568
I'd be upset right

1767
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,920
Where is he

1768
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:39,712
I think the jury's still out on that one but

1769
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:41,504
For the journey is

1770
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:50,464
So is it his response was like what no

1771
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,256
I hate to be this guy

1772
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:53,280
But

1773
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:54,560
If I got elected

1774
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:00,704
If you were going to go to prison

1775
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,728
I wouldn't I wouldn't

1776
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:09,664
It would call into question some

1777
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:16,320
It would be like wow cuz I

1778
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:22,720
President

1779
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:25,792
Not true of the Rodger and

1780
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:32,192
I would not condone those sorts of activities

1781
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:36,544
Out my permission

1782
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:40,640
It would be a breach of our friendship with you

1783
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:42,176
Did what Rodger did

1784
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,712
Wow

1785
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:55,488
Like a situation where

1786
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:58,816
So of course

1787
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,912
Jokers

1788
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:07,520
And the boys are back

1789
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:09,056
Do you know what it is about that call

1790
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,336
It's me

1791
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,616
Because

1792
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:18,272
You know it's it's one of those microcosm things that he extrapolated onto everybody but for somebody to say

1793
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:21,088
I think we're done with Trump

1794
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,112
You fooled me

1795
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:25,184
And what is everybody

1796
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,720
You fooled everybody

1797
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:27,488
Thanks buddy

1798
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:29,792
Wait I wait to read outside of your

1799
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:31,840
Right right

1800
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:34,656
The first thing he goes to is money

1801
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:37,472
The first thing he says is

1802
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:41,824
He's not actually

1803
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,384
That's what you're going to think about

1804
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:48,224
Trump

1805
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,504
Come on man

1806
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:50,272
Pretty sad

1807
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:53,088
That's pathetic

1808
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:56,160
Disgusting

1809
01:43:57,184 --> 01:44:00,512
You know obviously the coverage of that German story is

1810
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:01,536
Repulsive

1811
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:04,096
Unacceptable

1812
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,448
Dislike

1813
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:11,008
Praying for the angel of death to come

1814
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:12,800
Repeat it

1815
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:14,848
Isabel

1816
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:18,944
Particularly as

1817
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:24,576
Tensions rise again as these coronavirus cases are increasing in anambra state

1818
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:27,136
Attention of that pressure that's

1819
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:28,160
Being Quran

1820
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,696
AMV

1821
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:34,304
Conversations that are going to need to happen I believe are already starting to happen about how things are

1822
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,072
Probably just getting

1823
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:38,400
You're going to have to be scaled

1824
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:40,960
I don't know how's that

1825
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:43,008
Increased pressure is going to go well

1826
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:45,824
When right now Alex is having the conversation of

1827
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:48,640
God's Vengeance must be acted on my enemy

1828
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:50,432
Second

1829
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:59,904
Like I don't see how you can look at

1830
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:00,672
Will be a second

1831
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:03,744
Write like

1832
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:07,840
Happen have happened before

1833
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:10,144
A few months ago

1834
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:15,008
It's not like we're dealing with ancient history this stuff all happened before

1835
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,288
Little bit ago

1836
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:21,152
People are experts

1837
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:27,040
Issues

1838
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:33,440
The chances are there

1839
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:37,536
It does seem like it I don't know

1840
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:39,328
Hate to have any kind of

1841
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:45,216
Predictii you're like this is what's going to happen but that friends really don't look good

1842
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:49,312
At the same time

1843
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:54,432
I don't know I'm going to try and be optimistic

1844
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:11,072
Charity in your area bail fund or the like

1845
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:13,120
And help out people doing God's

1846
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:20,800
Talk to 80 people a day

1847
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:28,736
Alex
