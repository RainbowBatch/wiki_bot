Jordan Jordan

7
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,376
Quick question

8
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
Whatsyourprice

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,776
I got two little ones

10
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,592
After our last episode

11
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,640
One is a thank-you to Anna

12
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,456
Out there since some masks

13
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:28,064
Some homemade masks wander around the streets

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,464
And actually a couple of those are for you and tell your lady friend so please

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,584
Do you like bigger that you have to take the one that's avocados

16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,608
I'm allergic to

17
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,424
Allergic to avocados

18
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:50,080
I cannot be seen walking around town with such a millennial bathing mask

19
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:56,480
You're allergic to doesn't mean you can't wear it proudly confident

20
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,880
Cocky in a nice cool math

21
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:08,000
Definitely not Health Ranger John as a as a present

22
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
Sent over

23
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,328
A selection of some of his favorite hot sauces

24
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,984
From a company called matouk's alright that's not one of them

25
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,312
No sausages

26
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,152
Offensively salty

27
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:29,760
Chance to try out these sauces yet they just arrived

28
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,576
And so I will I'll let that

29
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,880
Folks know when I have a sensitive butt

30
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:39,232
They look really exciting one of them is a Trinidad scorpion sauce

31
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,048
One of my favorite of the peppers

32
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
I'm not allowed to eat

33
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,376
Nobody else has it been nice fruitiness to

34
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,424
John said his favorite was the

35
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,960
Calypso sauce

36
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,496
Switch shot worries mate

37
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:57,152
But I'm excited I'm really missing some like real good hot sauces right now

38
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,944
And so I haven't some of this

39
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,760
To supplement to meals

40
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,320
I said it's great that sounds awesome

41
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,928
Dan is a very simple

42
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,976
I was last time you had brisket

43
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
Cuz I'll tell you right now it's

44
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,048
Love Ricky

45
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
Right we had a freak out my partner and I

46
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,336
Like I already so so frustrated and then we decided to order a s*** ton of brisk

47
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,152
I'm just went into a meat, and

48
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
It is been

49
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
A good cup

50
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,504
Couple days off that beat

51
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,576
That's great

52
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:42,464
Good for the two of you I'm happy for your rediscovery of the love of brisket

53
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
Hey hell yeah

54
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:49,888
Talking about April 23rd and 24th 2020

64
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,799

75
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:36,895
Jordan we're making good progress on the year of the shelter I'd like to say thank you to everybody who has responded so positively

76
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:43,551
Play to the idea of me drinking an absurd number of Seltzer's

77
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
This idea

78
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
Ball people very interested in

79
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:51,231
To take a moment to honor the people and I understand

80
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:57,887
Why would anybody not be into the year that some people don't like seltzer

81
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:01,983
Position

82
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,543
And as such I'm not going to

83
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,103
Talk about every single Seltzer that I drink

84
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
On the podcast

85
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:15,807
To be annoyed

86
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
My Seltzer Journey

87
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,135
Which is knowledge freight.com selfie

88
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:24,511
And there is a graph charting the rank of

89
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
To know all of the

90
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,839
Specific shelters that are being drank

91
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,911
Please go check that website it'll be updated

92
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,007
Periodically probably after every episode as I'm editing my gel

93
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,055
Update website but we are on track

94
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
For the

95
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,871
Really I mean

96
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:46,271
It's only the first week you know every every long journey begins with a single step we are at 12

97
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,855
Right now 12 doctors tried

98
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:54,463
Which is at the point of our last recording

99
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,023
What I'm going to do is

100
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,119
Almere the Seltzer what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring you some of the standout okay

101
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:07,007
Alright because one of the things I'm realizing as I drink more and more these shelters is f****** most of Hummer

102
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:15,711
Check the page there was a significant course correction it look like everything was trending downward until you got to like

103
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:20,063
Like a median level like the first Seltzer if you tasted it now would probably be

104
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,463
Closer to the middle that it was at the beginning coffee one would be a little lower probably

105
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:32,863
Hello would be okay alright

106
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,471
Baps was definitely the passionfruit wonder by bubbler

107
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,775
It's a bubbler without an e

108
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:46,175
S*** I think I might be discovering a love of passion fruit

109
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,903
I don't know if it's a flavor that I've had much exposure to over the years I might have thought it was a fake fruit

110
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,463
IHOP

111
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,487
But if

112
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,327
It was really good flavors good the Seltzer's fantastic

113
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
I think it's also one of the ones that have cancer

114
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,679
If you want to

115
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
Still want a little kick

116
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,031
Dorothy oh no

117
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,103
That's another thing I should point out is we have not

118
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:20,223
Nor will we ever take any kind of sponsorship from a Seltzer company

119
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,575
So if you're out there and yourself accompanying ticket hate maybe I should get in on this game seems like

120
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,695
Pretty exciting people really enjoy the year the South Shore let's give these guys a few bucks to do some Buzz Marketing

121
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
No way

122
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
No way

123
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
You can't however send filter

124
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,935
No we're not going to play Frontier company name but if you want to send this out there if nobody's going to say no to his luck no matter

125
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,007
How much money Spindrift gives me I'm not going to say it's Kush

126
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:47,871
And no matter how much money bubbler doesn't give me I'm going to say that that passion fruit

127
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,687
Wonder

128
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:57,087
Strong stuff for the sad

129
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:05,791
But now let's get down to business on today's episode let's start with an out-of-context drop

130
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
From Today Show

131
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
The New World Order

132
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:12,191
Oh no don't say something like that.

133
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:20,639
Oh no

134
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,599
Hey yo

135
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
I don't know

136
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:38,559
Alex at the New World Order

137
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:43,935
Knife and then he's going to get NWO spray-painted on his back

138
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,495
Let's start here on the 23rd

139
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,823
Alex starts the 23rd

140
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
Play

141
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,943
Yeah it's just that he has the key to solving all of Humanity's problems

142
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,735
This is so big

143
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,599
Rosetta Stone Skeleton Key

144
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
Universe

145
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,607
Why don't you talk about this

146
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,447
Why don't you talk about this

147
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
Music

148
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,639
That opens the door the trees America in the world

149
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
As well

150
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
Are we killing time

151
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
What is happening

152
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
And it's not

153
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
What topic

154
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,047
I just come out and put it out there

155
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,679
Lost in the shuffle

156
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
I guess

157
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:55,359
I don't I don't really know exactly what he's talking about

158
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
Time

159
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,991
You could have used to talk about the thing right and then it wouldn't have been lost in the shuffle

160
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
Right

161
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:07,135
Episode I'm not positive I know exactly what the thing is I don't know

162
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
This

163
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,743
What is this what is this

164
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:16,351
What is Yuzu

165
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,167
Yeah I don't know it's dramatic

166
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,727
It's Beatrice castle that's what it is

167
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:26,079
So Alex downright and he wants

168
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,151
Breakout his

169
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,479
Definition of the word

170
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Lockdown

171
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Is that it

172
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
Prison

173
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,999
You had your comments Donnie but I'll go outside in a minimum

174
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
Medium security prison

175
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,887
And walk down is when you're put back inside your jail cells for night

176
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,447
Lock.

177
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
Wow it goes down

178
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
Down

179
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
Down

180
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,175
Seldomly after us

181
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
Control of a riot

182
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,855
State of isolation or restricted access

183
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,975
Initiated as a security measure

184
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,047
Mercy is on lockdown nobody

185
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,679
Okay

186
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:30,591
I like to have fun with definitions of dictionaries and see what other meetings we can find for the word lockdown

187
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,895
Pacific prison riot

188
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:37,503
According to dictionary.com another meaning for lockdown is a freeze or a pause

189
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,319
The word can be used to describe a temporary State of Affairs that

190
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,367
Requires a positive normal activity

191
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,903
That was even more fun

192
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,231
As we consult Merriam-Webster find the definition for martial law

193
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:53,887
Quote the law administered by military forces that didn't vote by a government in an emergency when the civilian law enforcement

194
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,703
These are unable to maintain public order and safety

195
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:03,615
According to Encyclopedia Britannica wanted most defining characteristics of Martial law is the military takes over the

196
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
Creation of Justice

197
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,455
And none of that stuff is happening at all right now

198
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,527
And if it were happening the only person who could invoke

199
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Would be Trump

200
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,111
This highlights an interesting problem with Alex is rhetoric

201
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,159
I don't think he knows what martial law is

202
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,719
Yet it's his primary fear and his Brandon

203
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:24,607
He seems to think that martial law is just any kind of law he doesn't like or rules or guidelines that he finds inconvenient

204
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,399
And that's not what martial law is

205
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,495
I think he just knows that the name of it is scary to people

206
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,847
And he's just going to yell about it all the time not having any idea

207
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:40,223
I also I went down a long Rabbit Hole looking at the history of martial law

208
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
Two of the most

209
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:42,783
Important

210
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,391
Figures in terms of the early history of the definition of martial law

211
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,439
Work Thomas Jefferson

212
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,511
And Andrew Jackson Andrew Jackson

213
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,559
Enacted martial law on New Orleans

214
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,351
And refused to lift it

215
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,423
Yeah after the imminent threat of an English invasion

216
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
Ended

217
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,287
The people who Alex lionizes and admirers

218
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,847
Are people who have a rocky history

219
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,871
In terms of

220
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,455
The definition of Martial law becoming something that could apply

221
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
Two civilians

222
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,503
Yeah it makes

223
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:20,415
He's talking about cosmology includes blind hero worship of the people doing

224
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:24,767
The exact same thing that he's been fighting against his entire life that makes perfect

225
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,655
This might be it

226
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,447
I don't know what is it

227
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:37,055
I don't know what is this I don't know if this is it or this or what

228
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,895
A big story that Alex has on his episode in so

229
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
It might be at

230
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
Messages that

231
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
Cihs

232
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,023
Twitter and Facebook and Google

233
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,583
Porsche official Chinese government

234
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,399
So this is an amazing level of abusive rhetoric

235
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:08,799
Alex's literally spent years Gathering about how it doesn't matter of Russian actors spread misinformation on social media in order to

236
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,383
Help Trump in the 2016 election have a completely meaningless

237
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,759
But now he seems to think it's a biggest deal in the world that some Chinese actors of done something on social media

238
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,343
Seems like a problem from a consistency standpoint but whatever

239
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:28,255
Alex is trying to get the idea out this is this is the way he's covering the story is that the entirety of

240
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
How the virus panic

241
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
In the United States

242
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,887
Is the result of the machinations of Chinese agents

243
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,727
And at this New York Times story that he's referring to prove it

244
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Call

245
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,567
Is New York Times stories from April 22nd

246
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:46,687
As a headline Chinese agents help spread messages that sowed virus-panic in the United States

247
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,455
Officials say

248
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,271
Like I said you trying to use this headline to suggest

249
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,551
For the entirety

250
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,135
Of the fear surrounding the first is a Chinese misinformation campaign

251
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,439
But that is not what this article is about

252
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:04,095
This article is about messages and text that spread around about Trump being set to lock down the entire United States back in

253
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
In mid-march

254
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,703
From the article this passage begins with a section of the message

255
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,983
Question

256
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,543
They will announce this as soon as they have troops in place

257
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,871
Prevent looters and rioters warned one of the messages which cited a source

258
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,663
Department of Homeland Security

259
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:23,551
Corey said he got the call last night and was told to pack and be prepared for the call today with his dispatch orders

260
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,927
This is an article about misinformation campaign to take advantage of the virus situation

261
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,719
But Alex wants the presentation

262
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,023
To be that the virus situation itself

263
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,607
Only feel so sleepy or because of this misinformation campaign

264
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,911
Which is just not supported by his source

265
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:45,055
If China isn't back doing this like what the New York Times articles describing then f*** them that's really shity

266
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,359
But it's still not what I was talking about

267
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,943
Also this article relies on an assessment from the intelligence

268
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,015
Community who Alex is supposed to not trust and be again

269
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:59,135
And while we're on the subject isn't the New York Times supposed to be run by the globalist tours in bed with China

270
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,463
Why would it be running a story about Chinese agents spreading misinformation

271
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,255
Wouldn't they not do that

272
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,815
Well then

273
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
Your

274
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,655
So now the globalist I don't know if you heard this

275
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
Globalist

276
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,007
Because of the quarantine have split into six separate faction

277
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:21,919
One of them controls the New York Times that it's fighting against the other five three of whom are pro-china.

278
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:26,271
Two of them are anti-russia but Pro Trump and the three horipro China

279
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,087
Are all over the map.

280
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,367
I got to go

281
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,439
Good fun catching up

282
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,791
Raptors now I don't even

283
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,839
The story has

284
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,399
Take care of yourself.

285
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:50,335
Complicated

286
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:55,967
Okay so Alex is thrilled on some level because people yelling at him

287
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
About Bill Gates

288
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,575
But you know I shouldn't be negative because

289
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Last night

290
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,439
I was driving home

291
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
I pulled up to a red light

292
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,119
Ford F-150 roll down the window and said

293
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,399
We love you Alex

294
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,847
Then this morning

295
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
One of their parking lot

296
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,295
Hydrobike

297
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
Plumbing repair truck

298
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,439
Hey rolls down the window Legos

299
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,255
We're winning Alex keep it up

300
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
Adele boy

301
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
Redneck

302
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,447
24-hour. Frozen I'm not Alma Street

303
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,079
People riding I know Bill Gates of the enemy

304
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
I mean look

305
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:59,711
The way I look at that is like I do show better much Alex Jones sucks

306
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
And he's the worst

307
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:05,343
Yeah and if I walked around in my daily life and people yelled at me

308
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:11,743
Hey fuk Alex Jones I would find that to be an uncomfortable situation. Look at that as like

309
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
Victory

310
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,583
On my part I would look at it as

311
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,143
This is this this sucks

312
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,799
Do you know what concerns me is that based on what Alex is telling me if I were walking along with

313
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,103
Said he hears all of this stuff

314
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,663
I would not see any of those people

315
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,063
He would he would turn to be like did you hear what that lady in the F-150 just sent you said f*** Bill Gates and I'll be like

316
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:40,927
Alex but there's no one here the F-150

317
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,999
He hasn't been sold for 40 years it's the ghost

318
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,791
This road doesn't exist

319
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,583
We're in the woods Alex

320
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
We've been camping

321
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:55,775
A 6-month it is a concern that these imaginary real I would say that that's not

322
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,799
Like

323
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:00,383
I don't feel like that is a good audience

324
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,919
Yeah we're like

325
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
Healthy

326
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,015
Sort of way that people interact with

327
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,295
The content you put out

328
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
I wouldn't

329
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,087
I wouldn't like that

330
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,951
Because it's not really about making any change

331
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
Or anything

332
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
It's about riling people up

333
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:21,375
We love you

334
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,679
Alex's getting the response that he want

335
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,959
Which is blind

336
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,751
Visceral anger

337
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,543
And that's just stupid that's

338
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,567
Just not

339
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
It's not good

340
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,943
So earlier I think I was on her last episode Alex's developing

341
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,015
Narrative about worldwide starvation

342
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,039
Starbucks

343
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,623
You have a complaint that like

344
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:49,023
Okay man we're all talking about people dying of coronavirus cuz that's sexy people dying in the devel

345

Jumping World

346
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,327
Not

347
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
Who's riding about

348
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,823
How are you reading

349
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:12,575
Oh no no no

350
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,111
Global

351
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
I'm out of infections

352
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:27,168
The White House task force a pads last find all coronavirus cases deaths is coming

353
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,704
19 regardless

354
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
Pause

355
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,176
Liberty Chevrolet Charlotte

356

Boston's

357

Well I believe it

358
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,304
Getting to the fear

359
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,376
Sexy it's fine it's cool

360
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,656
Cell phone

361
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,960
You're a hero

362
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,496
Put shop

363
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,032
Happens all the time

364
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,712
Here's what I'm going to do

365
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,832
Call today don't tell guests joining us

366
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,416
Because

367
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:24,512
This is really really afford information I got today off balance a lot of stuff today

368
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,640
We had used to turn this around

369
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:49,856
I wonder what it was that threw him off his games that morning baby that is ex-wife filed a motion

370
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:53,952
Tuesday the 2nd to have that day

371
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,280
I don't know maybe I don't know I don't know what this point

372
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,816
Maybe

373
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,400
I looked at the Ivanhoe

374
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Cointreau

375
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:08,800
I looked at the docket and apparently the hearing to possibly disqualify his lawyer

376
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,896
Is set for this Friday 8:30 a.m.

377
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,688
I don't know if

378
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Like

379
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:20,064
That is the fundamental thing he's wrestling with obviously it seems like

380
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,880
Like what else threw you off your game this morning

381
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,672
It's definitely not whatever this is

382
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
Right

383
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:30,560
I want to make you hear about the two things that Alex is comparing in terms of relative sexy

384
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:35,680
So there are people who were talking with the issues of the potential food crises in the developing world

385
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,264
Those people are officials in the UN who Alex hates enough

386
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,152
We can't possibly accept that they're actually the ones raising the alarm about this issue that I was just trying to pretend no one is talking about

387
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:48,736
Also reopening our economy fully will not solve that problem

388
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:53,856
If we reopen everything prematurely we run a real risk of seeing infections and deaths Skyrocket

389
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,928
They're which point our economy will be in a far more severe situation

390
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,952
It isn't now

391
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,792
The choice between safety and protecting the economy is a false choice

392
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:05,120
Anything that will help people in the developing world the most

393
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:10,240
Is for us to continue and accelerate our commitment to providing foreign aid for people in other countries

394
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,800
Revere even if times get tough here

395
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,872
That's a policy Choice the Trump could make any should

396
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,968
Second as of YouTube all deaths being labeled coronavirus deaths

397
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,760
Alex's is lying about that

398
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:25,344
It all traces back to an April 7th press conference in Wichita

399
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,696
Said the quote if someone dies with covid-19 we're counting that is a covid-19

400
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
Team.

401
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,512
This is in line with the CDC guidance

402
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:37,632
Switch says the patient to die with covid-19 positive test should have that listed on their death

403
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,216
And if it has two isn't available it should be listed quote

404
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:44,800
If the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty

405
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:50,176
Fact check spoke to a professor of epidemiology at Harvard

406
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:55,552
Who did concede that there would be a small number of cases of people listed as covid-19 deaths

407
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,344
When that is not what led to their deaths

408
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,624
But quote

409
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,184
A greater issue as errors in the other direction

410
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,256
Deaths caused by covid that are not counted as such

411
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:11,168
He went on to say quote overall it seems likely the well the few individuals who would have died anyway or getting called covid deaths

412
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:15,264
There are many more deaths caused by covid that are not attributed to covid

413
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,568
They also spoke to Sally Akins

414
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:22,944
Spokane County Medical Examiner and president of the association of medical examiners who said quote

415
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:23,968
The true facts

416
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,040
Are the covid-19 deaths likely will be underreported on deaths

417
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
Certificates not over recorded

418
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,928
This is Will especially be true as deaths that occur in homes

419
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,464
And not in hospitals mount

420
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,304
Not all jurisdictions are able to test home dads with typical symptoms

421
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,584
For covid-19

422
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,144
Alex can play games by spending Burke's

423
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,496
Sis, it's all you want but it doesn't change the reality that the medical professionals in this country

424
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:50,592
Are not just taking every death and calling it a covid death because that's sexy

425
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:54,944
It's equally untrue that no one is talking about the food-related humanitarian crisis

426
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,992
It's looming because it's not sexy enough

427
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:00,064
I was just making these things up because that's what works are

428
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,832
Designer

429
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,208
Yeah it doesn't seem like either option to talk about is very sexy

430
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:11,328
I find them to be both incredible and pressing it up.

431
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:14,400
Entirely on of avoidable

432
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,448
Almost entirely avoid

433
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,544
Like it is it is him complaining about stuff that

434
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,824
Should have been taken

435
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,664
Care of a long time ago and acting like it's not

436
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,200
Huge party

437
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,248
His

438
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,624
Worlds

439
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:42,304
It's treating things like this as like an inevitability of life as opposed to like it. This is a choice that's being made

440
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,424
There is a way that could be taken to the places they need to be

441
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:51,008
And I bet oversimplifying things obviously there

442
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:54,592
A million different variables. There are more things that

443
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,152
As a country we could do

444
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,688
I'm even in the heart

445
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,344
Borat meme just more simply if you want to start talking about food food banks are running absolutely die

446
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,416
Lilo and

447
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,744
They're letting food spoil because they can't sell it to a grocery

448
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,816
Like it is it is absolutely disgusting

449
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,400
It is f****** tragic that we are letting so much food

450
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:23,776
Just died and when so many people need it. There's there's resource allocation issues that

451
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,056
If we could die

452
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,104
Really prioritize and solve those

453
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,128
They would make a

454
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,664
Massive difference

455
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,456
And

456
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,480
But we are making

457
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:39,136
Not also In that clip even is Alex didn't say something through him off his game this morning I think you can tell that he's not in

458
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,208
Game shape on this episode

459
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
It's

460
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,000
Drastic

461
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,560
How bad he is at his job

462
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,328
Adjust like

463
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,632
Stammering and kind of like long

464
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,704
Pauses you doesn't seem to know where he's going with anything

465
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
It's really

466
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,264
It's jarring like

467
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
This is this is a real life

468
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,360
Shocking kind of example of that

469
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,456
Share this video just submit

470
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,992
Forecast

471
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,024
4 minutes

472
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048
And then we'll

473
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
Come back and

474
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
God almighty

475
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:34,432
You just seems flat there's like no energy doesn't seem like he's really into this like it really hurts to listen

476
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:38,528
Listen to like not because I I care but because it's like

477
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
Literally

478
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:46,464
Shakin all over the place like slow register Alex

479
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,560
This is like walking through mud

480
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,632
He is he is not killing time he is guilty of first

481
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,400
Degree murder

482
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,704
This is bad

483
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:00,032
So Alex gets to talking about how like there's a trap

484
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:05,408
Blood blisters have set a trap

485
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,456
Alright

486
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:13,856
Well then what's the point of having the key there's no doors help

487
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,392
The Alex layout Astoria

488
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,440
The bear trap close

489
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,464
Elastic

490
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
Don't either get our lag out

491
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,632
Color light off.

492
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,472
A good position to be in

493
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:35,872
But if I can't get my leg out of this thing very quickly I'm going to pull a knife out and cut my leg off

494
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,688
I'm just trying to get it up and I'm going to drive myself off

495
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,504
Going through my own ankle

496
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,184
A couple dozen wolves

497
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,304
That's not enough time to get your ankle off

498
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,400
Climb into a hole

499
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
Hey leg

500
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,920
Alex's leg is Infowars

501
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:15,552
He's talking about closing Infowars and quitting in order for him to be able to retain a certain amount of wealth

502
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,320
Carrying on

503
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,880
Living a reasonably comfortable life

504
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
Police talk

505
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,208
I'm about another this makes sense in any other

506
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:27,072
There's a worldwide pandemic going on but that is not reason for Alex to quit

507
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:32,192
When she gets weird or bad that's when propagandistic conspiracy Liars make their bread

508
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:38,848
All the things that I put Alex on the map are examples of him exploding tragedy and profiting off other people's pain

509
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:43,456
Permits co-opting of the Waco standoff at the beginning of his career

510
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:46,016
Dim rising to prominence is a 9-11 truther

511
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,064
Mayweather highlights of his career

512
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,392
Sandy Hook denialism lying about the Boston bombing

513
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:55,488
Consistent antagonism towards immigrants in the lgbtq community

514
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,536
All he does is profit up

515
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,608
And this situation is a perfect opportunity for him

516
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,912
It's almost like a meatball right in the center of the

517
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:09,312
Play I just don't believe that absent other circumstances Alex would see what's happening in the world as anything other than a chance for him to

518
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,104
Make a shitload of money

519
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,944
That's exactly how we behaved in the early days of the outbreak

520
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,784
Maybe Alex is taking this so seriously because the global threat

521
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,576
Right and that's what he wants us

522
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,112
I don't think so

523
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,416
Wants us to think that the global is just threatening him

524
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,208
But that makes literally no sense

525
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:31,328
Given that his entire career has been full of claims that the globalist are actively threatening him all the time

526
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,704
You said that they made attempts on his life before in that very specific threats have been made

527
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,776
They tried to pretend the drum corsi's coverage of the Seth rich

528
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,336
Conspiracies s*** was so dangerous to the globalist

529
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,640
About to make a dead man switch

530
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,992
What are the defining features of Alex's broadcast-style is a constant insistence

531
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,784
Globalist or threatening his life

532
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,184
He needs people to think that's happening because it allows them to pretend that the topics he's covering or somehow dangerous and bikes 10

533
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,464
Accurate

534
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,280
However he's been making these threats up the entire time

535
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
As he is now

536
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:08,192
Threats from the globalist should always be understood as code for consequences of Alex's actions

537
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,288
Sandy Hook families Victor the victims families suing Alex

538
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,080
Is presented as a globalist attack

539
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,616
But it's really the consequence

540
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
Movies action

541
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,408
And lying about them

542
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,712
And helping subject them to vicious harassment

543
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,016
Whatever you talking about now is no different

544
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:28,416
Whether it's the impending sign from the FBI FDA some other case that he knows he's going to destroy him

545
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:32,512
How to Preparing his audience to believe that no matter what consequences come his way

546
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,560
It's really just evil globalist punishing him

547
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
For being such a

548
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,864
Ineffective thorn in his side

549
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,424
That's why his leg isn't a trap and he's got to cut it off

550
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:46,080
Yeah it's like that old if you're if you're so accustomed to privileges any kind of any

551
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:52,224
Change feels like an attack on you he's so accustomed to the privilege of never having to face consequences for his actions

552
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,344
Now the idea of roosters coming home

553
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,880
Terrifying

554
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,416
I'm dying

555
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,232
My legs in a trap

556
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,512
Consequences for his actions

557
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:08,352
Younger maybe he would be more emotionally prepared to deal with this

558
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,656
Maybe would have f******

559
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,448
Quit already

560
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,520
Alex is dumb headspace where he is like

561
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544
Really just like

562
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,080
You know I got to cut my leg off

563
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,360
Okay get out of this trap

564
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,688
Why the f*** am I even trying to help people

565
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,760
Why am I trying to stop the globalist

566
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,600
You let things even get to this point

567
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:37,024
Ask myself why am I trying to save this

568
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,096
If I really hate the leftist

569
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,376
What they do

570
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,424
I should be supporting them

571
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,520
Because they're going to be the ones of the first to go under this

572
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,848
Can I sit back to my realize

573
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,408
Process

574
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:57,504
Thing to do to just tell the truth and try to save everybody how

575
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,040
Deserve it

576
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,600
Is audience of amazing activist

577
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,392
They do deserve the truth

578
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
Great

579
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,024
Someone think

580
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,048
Children

581
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
Stop one

582
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,680
Imagine the start of the show today

583
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,056
What is this the Pentagon comes out and realizes

584
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,384
Jack was a mouthpiece for communist China

585
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,688
The covid-19

586
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:29,504
Stereo from the beginning to shutdown the US economy

587
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:36,416
See if confirmed because of that New York Times story that Alex is lying about

588
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:43,072
So I guess that must be the big news cuz he sang I haven't gotten to the big news and then immediately references

589
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:47,680
That story has already

590
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,216
Anyway Alex is a

591
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
Dump douche

592
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:54,336
He talks about like hey look we're responding to this situation

593
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,432
One-way responded to other things in history the same way

594
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:04,832
Great and he's very dumb

595
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:10,976
What you doing is taking something in this historical context and comparing it to the Past historical context that I think it's a brilliant

596
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:17,376
I don't think it's not I don't think it's always dirty pool you know like I think you could probably do it it responsibly

597
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,656
Alex is doing this

598
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
Just so stupid

599
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,008
Americans acting like this before we launched

600
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,312
Millions of people are Wars

601
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,872
Millions in the Civil War

602
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,152
Rice

603
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,456
Wow

604
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,272
You can go outside

605
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,112
You shouldn't think it's cuz black people have right buddy

606
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:46,048
So a couple points here literally before the development of germ Theory

607
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,608
We didn't know how diseases spread at that point

608
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:53,472
And according to a 1993 report in the journal clinical infectious disease quote

609
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:59,872
Two-thirds of the approximately 660,000 deaths of soldiers were caused by uncontrolled infectious disease

610
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,640
An epidemic

611
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:04,224
It's played a major role in holding several major campaign

612
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:10,112
This article estimates that these diseases prolong the war by as much as two years

613
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:16,768
Soldiers in the Civil War had to deal with outbreaks of measles malaria smallpox and a bunch of other conditions the doctors at the time had no

614
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,816
No idea what to do with or how to prevent

615
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:25,472
If Medical Science had any idea about what infectious diseases were in the 1860s it's entirely possible that has to

616
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,520
Filleti's might have been postponed it outbreak

617
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
Even as it was

618
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,384
Many battles were delayed because of disease

619
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,944
So I have no idea what Alex thinks he's talking about

620
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:35,968
Also

621
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:40,832
I'm going to leave aside the whole notion that the Civil War was fought to give black people rights

622
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:45,440
Considering that the Civil Rights Act was passed until 1964 in the Voting Rights Act

623
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,720
Just passed the next year

624
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:51,072
The question of what it means to get rights is a messy complicated question that I

625
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,352
Prefer not to unpack

626
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,424
Right now since it's secondary to

627
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,704
And you brought this up

628
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,104
Alex should not think the Civil War was fought to give black people write does not believe that the Civil War was about

629
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,896
Slavery

630
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
Countless occasion

631
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:12,320
His relatives fought on the side of the Confederacy and he's been very insistent that it was mostly about protectionism and states right

632
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:17,184
Civil War is a notable example to give black people Bridal

633
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,208
That would have been

634
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:21,024
Disrupted by an outbreak like the one we're seeing now

635
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:25,376
I want to make yours that Alex doesn't ever say s*** is words mean nothing

636
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:29,472
When it's expedient for him he wants to any wants to appeal to his races face

637
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,800
Is it warm up into slavery you dumb sjw

638
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:38,432
What is important to pretend that he's stupid anti distancing protest of the equivalent of abolition

639
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
Houston 1850s

640
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,736
Is it

641
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,760
Do black people ride

642
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,344
He can argue about things because he doesn't mean anything he says

643
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,160
Everything purely exist as a means to an end

644
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:52,768
Also Millions didn't die in Civil War the high-end estimate is approximately 750

645
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,584
I don't

646
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,144
Think he gets to say we either

647
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,960
When he said that's why we fought the Civil War

648
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,240
To get black people rate

649
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:06,080
I know that's why we fought the Civil War

650
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:09,152
You did not fight your a Confederate

651
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,176
People from

652
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,456
Yes

653
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:13,760
10 Stoopid

654
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:18,112
There's another thing that Alex teases a whole bunch

655
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:24,512
On this episode that he never really pays off at all and that is that he believes that all

656
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,792
All Trump media

657
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,352
Except for himself all the right-wing media

658
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,680
Has been paid off by the Chinese

659
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:34,752
Let me get this

660
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,992
Public relations firms

661
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
Almost

662
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,416
Every major news site that was Pro Trump

663
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,720
Taking money

664
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,728
You want to know those names wouldn't you

665
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,496
Sure

666
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,104
That's why we have those people to look up those names

667
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,968
Call Jaron while I want you to think about that understand that

668
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,736
I'm thinking

669
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,296
Chinese agents helped spread

670
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:23,904
Messages that showed virus-panic in US

671
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
Samart

672
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,072
Intelligence agencies

673
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,096
Yes you are

674
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,424
Way

675
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,264
Freedom

676
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,080
We the People control the government

677
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,616
Our will

678
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,432
Lighters in the president we unlocked

679
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
Is exeggcute

680
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,504
Judith Light

681
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
Dictators

682
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,136
Direction

683
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,464
Myself

684
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,816
Us intelligence agencies in law enforcement

685
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,632
Globalist

686
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:08,704
The minute they began to come under Us control

687
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,592
Paradox

688
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:18,944
Louis translate Alex's explanation of why he's not against the intelligence Community this time

689
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:25,856
All he's saying is that he accept the things the Intel Community says when it matches up with what he wants to believe

690
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:31,488
30 globalist anytime they say it is something that contradicts the position he wants to know it's there spirit

691
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:36,096
Can feel their spirit

692
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,888
Exchanged it's as simple as just

693
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,544
You can dress it up as a noble by saying goodbye

694
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,080
In line with my narratives

695
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:50,432
I don't think it's bad to have a healthy distrust of the US intelligence apparatus but

696
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,224
That is not what Alex does

697
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,040
He just uses them as a storytelling prop

698
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,600
In a way that makes what they say or do

699
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,928
If it works for Alex of Heroes if it doesn't the globalist

700
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,280
Just a filter you can take released information through to make it presentable to his audience

701
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,328
Make him sound like he actually has position

702
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
He doesn't

703
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,632
He's just a piece of s***

704
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:13,472
Yeah I mean that even that itself is so autocratic of just like

705
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,776
When they do what I say they should do

706
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,848
Then they're good people and when they don't they're bad

707
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,384
People I should have

708
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,432
Complete control over everyone.

709
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:27,296
Not yet the only definition of good or bad hero or villain

710
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,600
Is does this work for me

711
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:37,280
I'm really more interested in these people who have taken these payoffs from the Chinese in the right-wing media

712
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,816
That Alex is talking about

713
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,888
I don't know he doesn't say

714
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,168
I think he's about to

715
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:43,936
Okay

716
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,008
Your position in the universe

717
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,288
Providence

718
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,336
Genetic future

719
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,663
What type of wart is covert

720
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,967
It is very very hard to beat

721
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,015
Still I'm not release the secret

722
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:11,583
How to release some stuff that I was about to do it

723
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,399
Frustration

724
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:21,567
Hopefully I pray to God let me tell you on my lunch right now

725
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:27,967
Can you imagine if Brian stelter got on his show and was like top story

726
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,503
Let me report that

727
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:35,647
I'm sorry I was about to tell you guys but the biggest news in the world will save Humanity or something

728
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:42,047
Well I'm sorry I'm praying to her permission to be able to tell the story can't do it there's a key to a door

729
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:48,447
And I'm going to open this door for your own oh God we're so like inundated in the world of Alex Jones

730
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:54,847
You a******

731
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,967
I know that he's insincere in all this

732
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:05,599
Bulshit dramatic Pediatrics sincerely that's a level of like

733
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,671
Religious zealotry that is

734
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,487
So

735
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:18,143
Hey in the vacuum like if you just heard of that not knowing who Alex was like oh my God what you think is f******

736
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:23,775
When I was in 7th grade I remember my English teacher about to explain the somatic

737
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,079
Residents of A Separate Peace I couldn't do it

738
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:29,919
God told me I can't do it so we're going to watch a video today

739
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,967
Oh God

740
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:39,135
The biggest thing that Alex has going on this episode 19 Tire time is Miss representations of this New York Times

741
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:42,975
The article and so he has to deal with a little bit of an issue

742
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,255
And that is like wait

743
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,815
Anthony or X globalist

744
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:50,143
I'm telling you exactly what he told you

745
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,679
3 months ago

746
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,775
Chinese

747
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,567
Panic in the US

748
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:02,943
OurTime

749
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,735
Because Trump is fine

750
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,783
Wow

751
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,063
Wow

752
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
Stats

753
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:15,231
Somebody's listening to that and believed Alex whenever he says that b*******

754
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,255
There there

755
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,303
Yeah if you buy that

756
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,119
Nintendo I never believed the New York Times

757
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,911
But this time they were forced because

758
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,447
Cuz Trump is fighting back right

759
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:30,847
What are you f****** need to weigh to justify the misrepresentation of the headline

760
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,175
Wild Savannah

761
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,759
Even if you believe that

762
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:42,111
Like

763
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,391
Should be allowed to tell me

764
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,927
What to do

765
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,695
Imagine

766
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:50,303
Pictures of Barack Obama as President and he told you how would you feel about that

767
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:56,703
I think Alex would not be indoors

768
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,751
The right-wing media has been co-opted Buddy

769
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,055
He's not being specific

770
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,383
Also the keys dropping these weird

771
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,711
Like he talks about how come someone tried to buy him out last

772
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,015
Here I don't know if I believe this

773
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,295
This is just f****** weird

774
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,575
And then

775
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,879
You start singing The Devil Went Down to Georgia

776
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,695
Through ad agencies

777
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:22,559
Chinese have bought off most amazing news websites

778
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,375
We got a problem

779
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,191
One of the richest men in the world

780
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,751
Last year

781
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,615
Nigerian scam again

782
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,647
Devil Went Down to Georgia

783
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,695
Charlie Daniels Sean

784
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,023
Three jumps up on a hickory

785
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,863
You might be a football player

786
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,751
Not like that

787
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,823
Experiences and you don't have

788
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,383
But here's the difference

789
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,199
Sellout

790
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:13,503
To the devil and then not you you

791
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:21,951
If you don't want me to sell out to the devil you better buy my products

792
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:31,167
Sure I've been railing against how you shouldn't sell out to the devil and that that is a literal crime against God

793
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:37,311
Criminal

794
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,359
Think about that the most is that

795
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,919
Definitely

796
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:48,319
Call all of the only person who like to be like dude I'm Alex

797
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:52,927
Play rock music

798
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,951
All about it

799
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,719
All about

800
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
So

801
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,279
There's a real

802
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,327
Conflict that I have

803
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,119
About Alex using

804
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,935
Concept in the idea and the image

805
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:07,775
People dealing with hunger in the developing world

806
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,799
As a prop

807
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,567
In his

808
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:12,639
Meredith yeah I find it to be really offensive

809
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,687
ICare

810
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:18,015
And thankfully in this Mexico Peaks playing but he really doesn't care about.

811
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:24,415
Hard

812
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:34,143
Definitely rooted in reality

813
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:38,239
Population

814
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,383
Really

815
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,175
Myself and my family retarded

816
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,991
Those people are being killed

817
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:57,951
TV

818
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,719
Amazon

819
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:04,863
Yeah well the concept of altruism as we know is made up from selfishness

820
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,935
Space aliens what was that was the plan

821
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,495
Look man I I I got to say

822
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,519
That's disappointing

823
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,591
That's exactly what I thought he thought though

824
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:20,991
But even then he doesn't actually care about the people sorry so he doesn't even believe his own lies

825
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
About itself in

826
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:32,767
Brian rose on the guy from London

827
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,791
Interview with David Icke

828
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:39,167
Kick-off YouTube there was no virus

829
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:42,239
And all that and like f*** this noise

830
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:49,919
Look I don't care it's a really long interview it's about half of the show and I do I don't care

831
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:56,063
Fairly interested but they're just complaining about how he got the kickoff

832
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:02,463
Any trouble birthday but I can consequences

833
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:05,279
He's really just an hour-long promo for how Brian

834
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:11,679
Is going to do another interview with David Icke and how are you trying to start his own YouTube I am very very naughty

835
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:14,239
Interested in this and I'm not going to play along with Alex's

836
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,543
The blatant promotional content like it's

837
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:17,823
It's

838
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,103
I don't

839
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,687
I don't know whether it's like broker content or if it's just like

840
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:25,503
Hey let's hope this guy fundraise for his

841
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,831
Fringe weirdo YouTube Project

842
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,599
That YouTube

843
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,439
$300,000 in donation

844
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:37,279
Wow Bryan Bros apparently it's somebody who has

845
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:43,679
A bit more of an audience than I had any idea

846
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,959
Autonomous videos

847
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:51,359
It is really hilarious cuz I'll excuse you in like I listen to you all the time you want the best like I've loved you for like 3 years

848
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:56,735
I have never heard his name come up until the David Icke situation

849
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,271
So whatever

850
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,807
I think most likely

851
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,599
The explanation of it is

852
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:07,487
Alex recognizes that this is a guy who has a pretty sizeable audience he's trying to go off on

853
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:11,839
So whatever anything and anyone

854
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:15,423
Interview from the 23rd and it's Alex

855
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,775
Again discussing this idea that the right-wing media is taking Chinese money

856
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,823
But he won't get specific

857
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,383
We have no idea

858
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:29,503
But I know about the advertising firms that paid them money

859
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,367
Today

860
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,159
It was the right thing to do

861
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,743
Some of the groups I know we're getting

862
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,279
How many Chinese money

863
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,143
Other names

864
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,447
Tomorrow but

865
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,471
Gus

866
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:57,151
Sometimes I consciously decide to say something

867
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:00,735
Then there's this other Force comes in it's always right

868
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:10,975
Call a doctor

869
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,279
Say something

870
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,119
Then I don't say it

871
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,423
Metreon

872
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:20,959
What

873
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,823
It's not God's mystery it's

874
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,871
Baseline awareness of libel

875
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:34,271
That's what I would assume that's the only way that that Alex has a recognition.

876
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,575
What do evolve well to like

877
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,111
Libel someone like

878
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:42,463
Hillary Clinton net worth George Soros They Don't Really Care and they're not going to

879
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,791
Even dignify you with a response or sue you

880
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:50,399
But you can f*** around and accidentally say something about some media organization

881
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:53,983
That's libelous like they're on the Chinese payroll

882
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,263
They might sue you

883
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:59,871
Fox News when bestowed

884
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,991
You run you run the risk that someone might actually respond to you

885
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,807
Anyway the people like Hillary or

886
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,087
Soros would

887
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,903
And I think Alex is aware of that and that's God's

888
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:16,255
So that show is a disaster the 23rd is the worst it's

889
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,023
Really bad

890
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,815
Alex's office game

891
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,351
Nothing really interesting happens

892
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,631
90/24

893
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,399
Comes around

894
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,167
I was like

895
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,447
I didn't think it could get worse

896
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:26,495
But this show is one of the worst

897
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:27,775
I've ever heard

898
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:31,103
Yes I really do

899
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:35,199
Maybe there is some sort of a cosmic connection with like my birthday

900
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,991
And Alex is just

901
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,551
So bad on this episode

902
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,343
In some ways that are actually

903
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,623
Incredibly funny

904
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,671
And some that are like that's

905
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,695
That's disturbing

906
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,719
I know there's that are like

907
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:49,535
Go to bed go home you're done

908
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,839
You're done a****** just call it yeah

909
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,655
So we start off with Alex claiming

910
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,447
But the New York Times has confirmed

911
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:58,239
Some of his narrative

912
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,591
Weeks ago

913
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:07,967
That

914
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,551
The population

915
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:15,647
A lot of folks had already died from pneumonia

916
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,695
Symptoms

917
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,975
But Steve already cured

918
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:22,815
Tuff Stuff

919
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:26,399
To all of it

920
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,079
The power grab

921
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,431
New York Times yesterday

922
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:43,039
Already in the United States in November

923
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,951
Down Jay Sean

924
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:54,815
So I couldn't find a New York Times story that matches with Alex's talking about that such

925
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:58,655
What kind of left to use context clues to figure out what he's rambling on about

926
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:05,311
I reviewed a bunch of possibilities and I'm pretty sure Alex is just misrepresenting comments that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo made

927
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,847
Stop by the timeline that the outbreak

928
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:10,175
Grandma was talking about the delay in action and said quote

929
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,199
So what's the lesson

930
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:14,015
An outbreak anywhere is an outbreak everywhere

931
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,831
When you see a November and December and outbreak in China

932
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,135
Just assume the next day it's in the United States

933
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:23,999
When they say it's in China just assume the virus got on the plane that night and flew to New York

934
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,535
Including Newark Airport

935
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,815
And now it's in New York

936
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:31,679
That has to be the operating mentality because you don't know that the virus didn't get on a plane

937
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,263
All you need is one person to get on that plane and China and come to New York

938
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:41,407
The way the virus Transformers that's all you need and you can't assume two months later that the virus is still going to be sitting on a park bench

939
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,199
In China waiting for you to get there

940
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:50,367
Grandma wasn't admitting that there were cases in November or December he was saying that your mindset in November and December should be to

941
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,647
Who assume that there are

942
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:54,463
Bottom line is this has nothing to do with her being cases

943
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,511
Is the covid-19 in the United States in November

944
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:00,607
As far as we know there's pretty solid consensus at the first known case was this

945
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:04,959
Coronavirus in the United States presented on January 19th

946
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:09,823
And was a guy in Washington who arrived at the hospital having a cough and a fever for 4 days

947
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:13,663
He returned from visiting family in Wuhan on January 5th

948
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,991
Is it possible there were cases prior to that

949
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:20,831
I mean it's not impossible it's just pretty unlikely according to experts

950
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:25,439
Alex has done nothing to demonstrate his assertion and until he does he's just talkingshit

951
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:28,511
I challenged Alex to show his work and saying that Steve

952
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,303
Sonic said so isn't good enough

953
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,351
Buckhead

954
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:35,679
I doubt that I'm going to take the word of the guy who killed

955
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,727
Coronavirus

956
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,263
In January I don't think I'm going to

957
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,287
I don't think I'm going to trust

958
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:45,919
Him probably not now it is another thing that it's impossible for people

959
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,455
Cross that line of like

960
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:50,015
A gross overreaction memes

961
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,039
U-Save lot

962
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,111
So how can it be a gross over-react

963
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:57,695
Do you know what I'm saying

964
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,511
Is the acceptable oh it's if we overreacted

965
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,815
Only 1,000 people died

966
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:09,215
That's 1,000 people who didn't need to f****** die

967
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:12,543
Yeah you know like that's that's not an over react

968
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:15,359
It's the correct

969
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:19,455
It's so f***** up that people are still framing it is though

970
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,991
That's that's our choice

971
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:27,391
A gross overreaction or even the Optics work at night is okay

972
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,463
Just tragic

973
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:34,815
Alex is he's on borrowed time

974
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,607
Because he's been getting threats

975
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,887
Like I mentioned

976
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,911
Do you see your glove

977
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,935
The wolves

978
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,439
Everyone

979
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:07,839
You better grow up

980
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,167
You should speak to a mirror semi

981
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:14,751
In order for Alex to be put in prison there would need to be a crybaby need to be

982
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,031
Criminal charge

983
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:19,615
I don't know if I'm aware of any crimes that Alex is looking good for right now

984
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,639
Criminal

985
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,431
Beyond that

986
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:28,575
The prison you need to stand trial and if you were innocent it at every opportunity to prove it

987
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:31,391
He's a rich white dude he would be afforded every benefit

988
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,671
The justice system

989
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:38,559
I don't believe that any of these imaginary globalist if they were real would ever want to put Alex on trial

990
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:44,191
Even if he's guilty as s*** all you're doing is giving him a gigantic platform to play the victim and create his own martyrdom

991
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:44,959
Narrative

992
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,495
So I guess they have to kill her

993
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,287
That makes even less sense

994
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,591
This entire time for Alex's

995
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,615
School career

996
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:56,223
His answer to why he wasn't dead yet was because he was too high-profile so the globalist

997
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:59,039
Knew that killing him would only make him more powerful

998
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:03,647
They knew the killing hours early confirm that his narratives are true or so Alex Bowie

999
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,719
It is that no longer the case

1000
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:10,303
Because I want to still super high profiles

1001
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,071
The globalist

1002
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:16,191
Know that they can't kill him without any Berkeley proving him right about all the bulshit he yells all the time

1003
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:20,287
To be clear I don't believe that Alex is alive because he's too high-profile to kill

1004
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:24,639
I think he's alive because none of the public figures he targets really care about what he says

1005
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,687
And they rightly view him as an idiot

1006
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:33,087
But for 25 years Alex has argued that he is only alive because he's high-profile but now I guess that doesn't mean anything

1007
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:39,487
The only reason the globalist Never Killed Alex before is out the window and I guess he's been told he's fair game or something

1008
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,023
This is all a load of s***

1009
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,815
It's clearly a pre-emptive narrative

1010
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,583
About something

1011
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:48,191
Do you knows his days on are numbered and he's got to be sure there's a myth

1012
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:51,775
In place before that so no one thinks his downfall was his own fault

1013
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,567
For posterity sake

1014
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:56,895
You have to make sure you know that he was the victim and all that

1015
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:57,663
Which is greater

1016
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,431
Yeah that's

1017
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:04,831
That's kind of what I was thinking whenever he was starting to talk about how all of right-wing media is owned by the global

1018
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:05,599
This is like

1019
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,927
Eventually when he goes down

1020
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,719
Everybody's going to talk

1021
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,791
There is going to be a national day of

1022
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:18,911
Dunking on Alex it will become in probably a lot of right-wing media will even sell ammo

1023
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:23,519
Or Nah them out pretty hard because they will want to differentiate themselves

1024
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:26,591
From him somehow in order to like

1025
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:31,199
Push him under water so they can get some air or whatever you know

1026
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:37,599
No the way the machine works on the right-wing media is the moment somebody goes down everybody on the right we can beat

1027
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,879
India piles on like

1028
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:43,231
All of our problems all of the things that we f***** up forever those are

1029
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:49,631
Him we are not like him he went down so he must be the only one who actually did

1030
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,655
Something wrong

1031
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:56,031
So Alex has been yelling about Bill Gates forever

1032
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:57,311
The dude

1033
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,079
I'm fine with that

1034
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:58,847
Sure

1035
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,175
In the next Club Alex talks about how like

1036
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:08,575
Listeners have been sending him until on Bill Gates

1037
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:11,391
Legitly but now he's got new information

1038
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,415
There's one

1039
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:16,255
Piece of new information which I get to at the end of this episode and it is

1040
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,791
A dud

1041
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,815
Know what is this

1042
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:19,839
Don't know okay

1043
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:20,863
The listeners

1044
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,935
Dive right now

1045
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:28,031
They're flooding us with documents in videos

1046
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,311
Never seen before

1047
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,895
You would think that

1048
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,719
We think it's funny

1049
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,655
Spotify

1050
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:58,495
Can't go on killing everybody that's fine

1051
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:01,311
I'm not scared of him

1052
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,223
Fox

1053
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:14,623
So I mean you got here is

1054
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,951
It's really smart for Alex to have kind of mulch

1055
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:21,023
Simple big villain doesn't work right now

1056
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:27,423
No it doesn't work but when there were counter demonstrations and protests to the right way

1057
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,959
Marches and stuff like that

1058
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:33,055
LaRosa's the perfect balance of Bill Gates falls out of favor for Alex

1059
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:39,455
Any focuses largely on Soros even though Bill Gates controls everything

1060
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:41,503
Fact checker

1061
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:47,903
Even above Bill Gate right and then Soros is somehow in the middle like everyone is feeling

1062
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,951
Play

1063
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:56,095
The particular villain of this season is whichever one is more primary to the narratives

1064
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,119
And assertive

1065
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:01,215
The themes exact stuff like this

1066
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:07,359
Whenever there is funding the primary narrative

1067
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:09,407
Right. Contracts this is how this work

1068
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,967
I just had the image of

1069
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,991
Some some

1070
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:16,831
Some personal assistant to Bill Gates just like walking

1071
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:19,135
I'm leaning down real close and just whispering in his ear

1072
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,671
Alex Jones wants

1073
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,439
To know that

1074
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,487
He will gladly die if

1075
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:27,839
If it keeps you from killing people and Bill Gates just nodding George W bush Styles like

1076
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:32,703
Or he just pulled out of butt

1077
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,543
That's a loaded

1078
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,335
Not this is one of my favorite things

1079
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,359
In the world

1080
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,407
We know that Alex

1081
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:44,223
Believe that movies are reality

1082
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,759
But Alex chose a really

1083
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,575
Wrong example

1084
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,855
Cool world

1085
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:52,927
Ian Fleming

1086
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:53,951
It was like number

1087
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,999
Demanded MI6

1088
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:00,351
Moonraker in the

1089
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,983
Where there's a world government

1090
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:09,055
Kill the entire human population

1091
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:17,503
Why would why would the number three guy in MI6 write a book about that

1092
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:21,087
Because we're just going to f****** space

1093
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:24,671
Ian Fleming was never third in command at MI6

1094
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:31,327
Is the personal assistant to rear Admiral John Godfrey director of Naval intelligence

1095
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,655
Some intelligence. But he was

1096
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:37,727
Also Moonraker came out 1955 not in the sea

1097
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:44,127
60 oz talking about none of that stuff isn't Ian Fleming's book version of Moonraker that's all just from

1098
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:50,527
The movie Fleming did not write the screenplay for it pretty much has nothing to do with other than the book has the same title

1099
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:54,623
You see what happened was that in the closing credits of the spy who loved me

1100
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:57,951
It says Bond will be back in for your eyes only

1101
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:00,511
What does plan to be the next Bond movie produced

1102
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,279
But then

1103
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:04,607
Star Wars came out it was a gigantic box office hit

1104
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:11,263
The Producers decided to shelled For Your Eyes Only ago something that could involve spaced and the title Moonraker is about his face

1105
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,055
Play sounding is Fleming's titles

1106
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,591
The plot of the book

1107
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:19,967
Is it there's a guy named Hugo Drax is building a nuclear missile defense system for England called Moonraker

1108
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,527
It turns out Drax is secretly a Nazi

1109
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,831
Any plan this whole thing in order to Nuke London

1110
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:28,927
Bonfils the planet Save the Day More Les your standard Bond storyline

1111
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:33,279
No space no false Flags nobody weapons are hiding out in orbit or bunkers or whatever

1112
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,839
The film version is a bit different

1113
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,887
However it wasn't written by Ian Fleming

1114
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:43,775
Is there a guy named Christopher would it would previously written a series of sex Rob's under the pen name Timothy Lee

1115
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:48,639
The entire plot was changed Moonraker was no longer defense system it was a space shuttle

1116
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,175
In the movie version Drax

1117
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:54,015
Plans to head to space and then released nerve gas onto the planet to kill people

1118
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:57,087
Eventually repopulating the planet with people he thinks are from Goods

1119
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:57,855
Stock

1120
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:58,879
There's plenty of

1121
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:03,999
Discussion about about this among Bond fans how is a completely different movie from the book The Fleming Road

1122
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:10,399
And it's super super clear that the reason that they were doing that was trying to cash in on Star Wars

1123
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:13,215
Bond movies think Moonraker sucks

1124
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:15,775
Anyway Alex is just seen that movie and things

1125
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,823
Expertise in any way connected to the book

1126
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:18,847
Ian Fleming Road

1127
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:21,919
You have literally no idea what he's talking about you just making s*** up

1128
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,199
Please understand

1129
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:27,039
Alex has Justine movies and pretends that he's done research

1130
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,575
He's a f****** idiot

1131
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,111
That is annoying

1132
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,647
I didn't know that about Moonraker

1133
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:34,719
That's interesting to know it's literally the worst

1134
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:37,791
Example Alex could use in pretending like Ian Fleming

1135
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:39,839
Externalize the plan

1136
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:43,423
So funny never read Moonraker

1137
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,983
I cannot believe that he would

1138
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,287
Not cuz of course

1139
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,847
You can get away with it

1140
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,407
It's not like anybody is red Moonraker

1141
01:05:53,919 --> 01:06:00,063
Why do people have not who listen to Alex Jones don't know so you can get away with it

1142
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,879
The movie

1143
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:09,023
Also feature of a number of Bob not necessarily really accurate to the books

1144
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,071
Yeah I'm here in Flemingsburg

1145
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:17,983
I don't know I've never actually read them I'm not super interested in that genre I've not seen a lot of those Bond movies either cuz I take the

1146
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,287
First of all a little bit

1147
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:27,455
Interpersonal everybody is a little bit

1148
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:33,855
Yeah I don't know if I love spy

1149
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,927
I can think of From Russia with Love

1150
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,975
Yeah that was a good Bond

1151
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,791
And then

1152
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,839
I think we're pretty much done after that

1153
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:49,215
Never Say Never Again You Can't Say Never Again

1154
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:56,127
Did you like I know that has a video game

1155
01:06:56,383 --> 01:07:00,223
I just love John being in anything I want Sean Bean die and anything

1156
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:03,551
I thought you were saying Sean right

1157
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:07,903
Knowshon being with oo6 in that one

1158
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,743
I like the opening credit

1159
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,559
Those are pretty funny you know when they got the barrel

1160
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,607
That's great Austin Powers sucks

1161
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:26,335
The Simpsons whenever Scorpio that one's based on a Bond film even when I was a kid

1162
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,359
I thought

1163
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,151
Austin Powers suck

1164
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:34,015
I do like the Pink Panther though that's kind of spies

1165
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:39,647
Like a direct parody of bond

1166
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,415
They're so funny

1167
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,183
Yeah

1168
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:47,583
I love that I love it first

1169
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,863
Laney

1170
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,911
Very slow

1171
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:51,935
But I like it

1172
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:53,471
David Niven

1173
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,239
And he's great

1174
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:57,823
Best let's stop this

1175
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:05,503
Xzibit raker is the real world plaid that's f****** hilarious

1176
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:08,831
So I was just talking about there's no moonrakers the real globalist

1177
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:11,391
Plan what have you and obviously as we just discussed

1178
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,671
Sweetly stupid

1179
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:17,791
This gets into him talking about like the globalist want to exterminate people

1180
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:22,143
And he kind of says that he's cool with some exterminators

1181
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,703
Some truth in the back

1182
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,799
Environment

1183
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:29,823
Innovating

1184
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,359
Massive

1185
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,383
Plunging

1186
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,687
Hellish conditions

1187
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:42,367
And the solution for that

1188
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:48,767
Bill Clinton

1189
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:57,983
Kroger

1190
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,263
With high IQs

1191
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,407
For drugging and then

1192
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,943
Society

1193
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:13,087
Sure love to hear that Alex is opposition to extermination is conditional

1194
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:15,647
That's not absolute

1195
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,927
Twisted no

1196
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:19,743
Eugenics key would be better

1197
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:24,607
And yet somehow this one see the problem with this whole Eugenics Exterminating people

1198
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:26,399
Is this one's about power

1199
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:33,055
If I were Exterminating people wouldn't be about power bi but by power

1200
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,847
Yeah I mean

1201
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:41,247
I think if you're sincere actor in you're opposed to the sort of thing like Eugenics or an extermination

1202
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,063
It wouldn't be like my problem is who's carrying it out

1203
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:49,439
Probably

1204
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:53,023
Yeah your opposition to a would-be fundamental as opposed to like

1205
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:58,655
If we kill off everybody in the Sudan or whatever

1206
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:04,031
Time does he ever consider a more equal distribution of resources could also solve the

1207
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,055
This problem

1208
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,359
Do you know what I'm saying

1209
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:10,687
Starting at the place of well obviously we need to exterminate

1210
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,735
People that's the only explanation for what

1211
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:18,367
What's going on I'm not saying that he saying

1212
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:24,767
I don't know if there's a middle ground

1213
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:26,559
I don't think there is a middle ground

1214
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:29,887
But in terms of just taking him by the strict

1215
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:36,287
Miss of his word that she was not happy for Peyton extermination he's just saying it would be okay if

1216
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:41,151
If you need an ethical Aksarben

1217
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,431
Nation dad

1218
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,711
And they don't need

1219
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:48,063
Need the Target high IQ males like he thinks himself stupid

1220
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:51,647
Alex

1221
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:53,439
Predict

1222
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:56,767
Action about what we'll see in the future

1223
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:00,351
I think this is from a movie I don't know what it is Maybe

1224
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:04,959
Demolition Man maybe one of those c-note the three seashells

1225
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:08,031
That's what this is no I don't know about the three seashells

1226
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:13,919
Demolition Man it's one of those other s*** movies I don't know this is some sort of

1227
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,223
I might be

1228
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:22,623
Many people died

1229
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,695
Structure going to come around

1230
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,535
In

1231
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,583
The back of that trash truck

1232
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:35,423
You keep submitting like this about five years out from that

1233
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,983
10:15

1234
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:40,799
Thornton Avenue

1235
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,895
Trash trucks

1236
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,431
Okay

1237
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:55,135
Alright so let me ask you the 2025 the next year the Seltzer will find out

1238
01:11:57,183 --> 01:12:02,303
Might be something does happen but not for like picking up Corpses

1239
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:09,471
Is necessary to be picked up via only robot trash. I highly doubt that

1240
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:10,239
I'm sorry

1241
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,543
I just wondered

1242
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,079
What would be preferable

1243
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,895
If you know it's going to happen either way

1244
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:24,319
Does it doesn't it make sense to just like get it over and done with us supposed to be in like I will fight as hard as we can

1245
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,599
And for an extra 10 years

1246
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:28,671
No because Alex is whole thing is it's about stalling the globalist

1247
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,695
Plan

1248
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:33,279
That's the only thing that's really worth crying

1249
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:39,935
5 years to grow is

1250
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,959
People in

1251
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:44,799
Humanely connect with others but if we have 10 years

1252
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:51,455
We could spend all that time fighting against this and not grow at all and then solve a lot of money

1253
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:53,503
You sold me on that not the food

1254
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:56,831
So we're in a situation where

1255
01:12:57,087 --> 01:13:01,183
Masks were trying to distance as best as we can

1256
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:03,487
She wants to like

1257
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,255
Talk solution

1258
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:07,583
Cuz we are the world that require solution

1259
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:10,399
Equal distribution of resource

1260
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,959
Talk about Solutions

1261
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,079
Cool

1262
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:22,687
Solution

1263
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,479
They can't make you do it

1264
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:25,759
You got a medical reason

1265
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,367
Where to print some of these up on Infowars

1266
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,671
Make your own

1267
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:37,279
Psychological disorder in my position

1268
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,071
Dr. kornbluth

1269
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:42,399
Do you want to put on there

1270
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,447
Silence is suggesting the people fake

1271
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:49,311
Conditions in order to be able to wear masks

1272
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:53,151
Ain't going to sell masks that say that or something

1273
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,199
I've got a delusion for your dad

1274
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:58,527
Fraud Revenue stream

1275
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:02,367
If anything happens to him

1276
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,135
It was okay

1277
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:06,719
Shortest continuing this trend of like

1278
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:16,191
Amazing stuff yet

1279
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,239
By the way

1280
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:31,551
Bill Gates

1281
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:36,671
Everything happens to you

1282
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,463
You'll take care of thanks

1283
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:43,327
Taking care of our children

1284
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:54,335
Can't miss an opportunity racing racing through that at pitch

1285
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:59,199
To a long thing about how like the globalist want you in City

1286
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:04,831
So what they're doing is raising taxes to make it so you can't live in rural areas or something

1287
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:08,927
Okay I don't know I don't I don't know about that but

1288
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:12,511
Be there isn't met Alex's solution seems to be

1289
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,047
But he wants people to start

1290
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:18,655
Extremist Rod extremist right-wing

1291
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:21,471
Compound

1292
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:22,751
What are you going to do about it

1293
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,271
Communities that say hey

1294
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,063
Conservative

1295
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,623
We want to conserve Humanity what Pro human

1296
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,439
Laws where

1297
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:44,511
Real safety studies that are out there

1298
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,535
Followed

1299
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,519
We're all this evil is not allowed

1300
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:11,647
Giant

1301
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:13,183
Electromagnetic

1302
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:20,607
Thank God he made sure to point out this wasn't a cult

1303
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:24,703
Me a call well it's either a cult or a

1304
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:26,495
Terror cell

1305
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:29,311
Think there's much difference between what he's describing

1306
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,591
Extreme separatist

1307
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,639
Community resource

1308
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:35,199
Generally speaking extreme separatist

1309
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:37,247
I've been shown to be Pro human

1310
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,783
They accept

1311
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:42,367
Definitely don't build these walls and fire guns at that

1312
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:45,183
No no that be crazy

1313
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:49,791
So Alex of the guests this is where everything goes

1314
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:52,351
So f****** wrong on this episode

1315
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,679
I ended up like

1316
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:57,215
Okay Alex's to guests

1317
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:57,983
Okay

1318
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,519
I don't want to spoil anything

1319
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,823
But I looked into them for no reason

1320
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:08,735
YouTube

1321
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:13,343
Diva audio Ray has an amazing background and I

1322
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:23,583
Inventor of email I'm not going to go over zobaya believe procedures guide

1323
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,935
Better now been 30 40 50 times

1324
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:28,959
Working with

1325
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,239
Reality was

1326
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:35,871
First things first Chiva is a rare person on Infowars who actually has some credentials

1327
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:42,527
You have a PhD in biological engineering from MIT but the climate invented email is where things start to get a little off

1328
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,295
Track

1329
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:49,951
Shiva claims that in 1978 or 1979 or maybe 1980 at the age of 14

1330
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:53,279
Achievement is not been recognized because he's not white

1331
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,583
You didn't work in the realm of by the system

1332
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,887
This is one possibility or another

1333
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:02,239
Possibility that some people have pointed out is that email existed prior to 1978

1334
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,263
There were large

1335
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,799
Computer networks that were linked

1336
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:07,871
For Communications in the early 1970s through arpanet

1337
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,943
And I have no idea what to even do with these clients

1338
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:17,087
Hideaway wanted the Smithsonian to recognize him as the inventor of email so he sent them a bunch of documentation

1339
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:20,159
And this is the Smithsonian statement upon review

1340
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:25,791
Exchanging messages through computer systems what most people call email predates the worker by Dre

1341
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:30,655
However the museum found Ida raise materials at served as signpost

1342
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:32,959
The several stories about the American Experience

1343
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:34,751
So they accepted as materials

1344
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:38,079
Because they reflected his experience in the early days of

1345
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:39,871
Computer techs that was relevant to history

1346
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:41,919
But it didn't show that he invented email

1347
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:48,831
The big piece of evidence that I do Ray has that he's the inventor is that he has a 1982 copyright claim

1348
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:49,599
Or email

1349
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:52,159
But it's not for email it's for his specific

1350
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,695
Program that he wrote

1351
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:56,767
This claim is clearly undefendable in court

1352
01:18:57,023 --> 01:19:01,119
Seeing as he doesn't go in Gmail and places like the Washington Post have had to print correction

1353
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:04,703
Comes after accidentally refer to them as the adventurers no

1354
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:07,519
I personally have no stake in this

1355
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:11,359
I could care less whether or not this guy invented email but some people

1356
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,895
Xbox in the world

1357
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:15,711
Computing history who are not so chill about this

1358
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:19,295
They do not like shivay Dre and some of that salve

1359
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,343
Pretty scaping responses to his claim

1360
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:27,743
Praise the fact that he was a teenager and he made a program to send emails to a small group of

1361
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:28,767
Computers in the 70s

1362
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:32,607
Because nothing to take away from that is impressive

1363
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:36,191
Consensus I seem to see is that he didn't create anything that didn't already

1364
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:36,959
Zest

1365
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:41,567
Outside of the stuff especially lately I had to re has become a bit of a public coop

1366
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:47,199
In 2018 he tried to run as a republican in the Massachusetts midterm election

1367
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:48,991
Hoping to unseat Elizabeth Warren

1368
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:49,759
Did he do it

1369
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:53,087
I suspect he had the good sense to realize he wasn't going to make it out of a GI

1370
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:55,135
P primary so you ran as an independent

1371
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:57,439
Ultimately 44% of the vote

1372
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:00,255
No I mean some pretty respectable

1373
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,279
It's not much

1374
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,559
But it's something

1375
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:07,935
At this point he's running in the GOP Primary for the 2020 election hoping to unseat Ed Markey

1376
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,751
I predict he'll be running as an independent again

1377
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:17,408
Coronavirus situation has broken out either a is gone full-on conspiracy weirdo and started spouting a bunch of

1378
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:19,712
The bolshit narratives we've heard Alex disseminate

1379
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:26,368
On March 23rd to publish the letter that he sent to Trump where he talked s*** about dr. fauci and suggested that all people need

1380
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:32,768
Vitamins and iodine be good to go with no need to quarantine or distance or anything like that

1381
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:35,072
Send that through computer network

1382
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:38,656
This is ignored medical doctor sending unsolicited medical recommendation

1383
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:41,984
Comes to the president which is the Hallmark of a non crazy person

1384
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:46,592
What are angles lately has been to get to dr. fauci fired

1385
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:52,992
That's one of those big things but we have bureaucrats

1386
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:59,136
Madison and you can talk to pretty much anyone and I could tell you behind closed doors that

1387
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:05,536
Fauci this disgusting bureaucrat who graduated first in his class of Cornell Medical School wilda Medical

1388
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:07,328
Unlike Ida Ray

1389
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:14,240
Hydreigon past Infowars Gaston fellow Senate campaign loser De Anna Lorraine Ortiz most prominent

1390
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,264
Voices in the fire

1391
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,032
Fauci camp

1392
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:22,688
This has nothing to do with that directly with I'd already but I wanted to read this little passage from Politico about Lorraine

1393
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,968
Complaints about fauci

1394
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:27,296
Quote his projection to change constantly

1395
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:31,648
I think he first started predicting 2 million + deaths Lorraine complain

1396
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:34,720
Saying she understood the number is the total number of projected deaths

1397
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:37,024
Quote and now it's down to 60,000

1398
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,608
And you know why such a sudden change that's a pretty drastic change

1399
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:44,960
2 million + number comes from the famous Imperial College Study

1400
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:49,056
Forecasting the results of an environment social distancing measures taken at all

1401
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:52,384
Lower mortality projections of the result of extreme social disc

1402
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:54,176
Such a shelter-in-place orders

1403
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:55,200
Business closures

1404
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:58,528
Lorraine said she did not know about that distinction

1405
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:04,928
Wow I appreciate her honesty I appreciate

1406
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:08,768
Oh I guess I should

1407
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,840
I guess I don't know what I'm talking about

1408
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:18,240
Am I stupid or also isn't that playing out in the introduction

1409
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:21,056
That's weird

1410
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,104
Reactionary child

1411
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:29,760
Anyway it doesn't look like I do re-invented email and he's in the middle of just that this lunatic Blitz trying to rile up the truck

1412
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:32,832
Base for his Doom 2020 congressional election

1413
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:33,856
Call very pathetic

1414
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:38,208
Can dump but it's also causing direct harm to people probably so I hope you have trouble sleeping

1415
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,232
Goodnight

1416
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:42,048
I'd be a real bummer to invent something and then

1417
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:47,936
Suddenly put your head like you're in your room like studying and you're trying to get everything you've met this system here like

1418
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:51,520
This s*** is going to change the world and then you pop your head out and everybody's like

1419
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:54,336
We've had that for a while now like

1420
01:22:54,592 --> 01:23:00,736
Well I mean it would still be really impressive and I think that you could probably just really I think you could probably get a lot

1421
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:01,504
Lot of respect

1422
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,784
Within those world

1423
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,808
If you didn't

1424
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,600
Insist you needed to be

1425
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:08,416
16 as the inventor of it

1426
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:11,232
Trying to take away the the work

1427
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:17,632
Achievements people who came before you take turns off a lot of people kind of think you're an a******

1428
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:20,192
Can Isaac Newton situation where nobody else has

1429
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:24,800
Shared it with anybody before and then he invented they like we already found it and now it's

1430
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,080
Eden

1431
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:31,456
Is going to be on here in a minute dr. Shiva is known by his fan

1432
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:33,760
For that Alex said something

1433
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,040
Foundry stupid

1434
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,856
How many have died worldwide from the virus

1435
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:42,208
That has

1436
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:45,024
Casper covid-19

1437
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:45,792
Incorrect

1438
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:51,168
Never had the flu in the last year so you

1439
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:54,240
Test positive Coronavirus

1440
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,056
Father covid-19

1441
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:01,408
Hysteria in the left

1442
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,712
The shutdown

1443
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,504
Create a phobia

1444
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:10,368
Where you just expect the ocean sharks

1445
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:14,720
Get eaten by sharks worldwide

1446
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,000
You got about

1447
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:19,328
193

1448
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,680
How did is making up that part about the test for covid-19 all being false positive

1449
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:27,264
Is literally nothing to back that up other than just repeating it over and over again

1450
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:33,664
More importantly Alex's severely overestimating the number of people eaten by shark a year

1451
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:39,296
Either 30 people eaten by sharks every year when in reality it's only four people were killed by sharks every year on average

1452
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:41,088
Last year it was only two

1453
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,160
Now this might seem like a miniscule distinction

1454
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,464
But I'm not

1455
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:52,352
The difference between 4 and 30 is a 750% error which is very significant

1456
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:54,400
Enter you can say that I'm being a dick

1457
01:24:54,912 --> 01:25:01,056
The point I was trying to make is that there aren't that many shark attacks but we fear them because of movie

1458
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:03,104
Fair enough I'm not disputing that point

1459
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:09,504
I'm saying that I was just made up the 30 number 2 train act like he actually knows how many people get eaten by sharks every year

1460
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,272
He doesn't

1461
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:16,672
It's completely made up as a number you just want it just trying to make up a number that sounds small to him

1462
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:20,256
It's way way higher than the real world number

1463
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,328
This is a deceptively important point

1464
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,632
A lot of the time Alex knows some

1465
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:26,912
In this case

1466
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,960
Did that there aren't that many shark attacks

1467
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:35,616
You wants to convey that point that we think there are more shark attacks in there actually are because he wants to use that as an antelope

1468
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:36,384
Virus

1469
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:40,480
But he thinks that just saying there aren't that many shark attacks

1470
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:42,272
Have to be convincing and authoritative

1471
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,040
So he just

1472
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:45,088
Makes up something to fill in the gaps

1473
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:51,744
You know this audience have no idea how many people are eaten by sharks I didn't know that they'll just believe whatever number you says he pulls 3000

1474
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,512
Out of his ass

1475
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:54,048
He does this all the time

1476
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:56,864
With small details like this and big narrative

1477
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:58,656
This is what he does with headlines

1478
01:25:59,168 --> 01:25:59,680
Dinos

1479
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:05,056
What the headline of an article says that makes up a details of what he assumes are in the article

1480
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:11,456
You seen the movie Moonraker so we just assumed the book has the same makes up stuff about Ian Fleming writing it noted

1481
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,992
Goebbels plot

1482
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:19,648
Microcosm of Alex's career is very well encapsulated in a throwaway by about people getting eaten by sharks

1483
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:24,512
Just make stuff up in order to fill in the gaps that he wants to do nonsense

1484
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:26,304
What they start to realize that

1485
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,888
You really suck again everywhere there's another small problem with that is

1486
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,424
This isn't

1487
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:36,288
Because the only way it would be like sharks as if when you got bitten by a shark

1488
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,824
You became a shark your

1489
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:44,224
Yourself and maybe there's a little bit of a

1490
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,296
Shark bites are not a communicable disease

1491
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:53,184
Also there's a little difference between like being eaten by sharks being killed by

1492
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:57,536
So we get to dr. Shiva coming in and there's

1493
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:59,072
Trouble right out of the gate

1494
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,144
Because Alex like I said he has to Gaston that

1495
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:02,912
Episode

1496
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,192
And it turns out that

1497
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:07,008
Dr. Shiva does not like Alex's other guests

1498
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,056
Failing

1499
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,848
Need to put in big vaccine

1500
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:17,248
Champagne and immune system

1501
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,808
What happens Alex

1502
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,600
There are people

1503
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:23,136
Kennedy Junior

1504
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,416
He's been in this movement

1505
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,696
Freaking time

1506
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,280
Who is suppresses movement from people building a

1507
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:31,584
Ghostblind

1508
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:34,144
One of the guys are going to have on your show

1509
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:37,472
They speak the same rhetoric

1510
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,776
Hillary Clinton

1511
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,128
Kennedy endorse Hillary Clinton three times

1512
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:48,480
Kennedy family post John Kennedy

1513
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:50,784
Is institutionalized not-so-obvious album

1514
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:56,160
Listen I know you're in Massachusetts and and then so we just so happen to have this other Jesse disagree with

1515
01:27:56,416 --> 01:28:01,792
On later you're welcome to get into that person as well

1516
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,008
Get into the big picture

1517
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,824
We don't allow bashing Hillary Clinton

1518
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:17,920
So Alex is new brushes

1519
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:23,040
Easter break

1520
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:28,928
Is a shill and you know that because he works with Robert Kennedy Junior's at limited Hangout

1521
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:29,952
To try in

1522
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:37,120
Corrupt the anti-vax movements with Robert

1523
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:39,680
And I did not know he was crazy no yes

1524
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,776
Really good god dammit

1525
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:45,568
Isn't that you didn't know that

1526
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,104
No I don't give a s*** about the

1527
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,152
Why would I give a f*** about the Kennedys

1528
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:52,992
And I was like they had it they had to Goodwin

1529
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,784
Baby I don't even know if I would give them to

1530
01:28:55,296 --> 01:29:01,440
Yeah I know Robert Kennedy Junior's want to be like a big players in the DNC Zacks world

1531
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:03,488
Yeah.

1532
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:08,608
I think most people just kind of like alright whatever

1533
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:10,400
Alex's other guests

1534
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:15,264
Somehow associated with Robert Kennedy Jr so dr. Shiva believes him to be a shill

1535
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:18,336
Point the finger at Hillary Clinton hard at all

1536
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,104
Or something

1537
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,640
So Alex rushes to break

1538
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,688
Ivy comes back from break

1539
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:27,040
Crazy stuff going on here and

1540
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,792
Bill Gates

1541
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:40,352
Criticizing the vaccine

1542
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,632
Man

1543
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,264
Mom same time

1544
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,568
To be on the same time weather

1545
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:59,808
The way it is

1546
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:02,112
What am I

1547
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:06,208
And

1548
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:08,256
You dislike somebody

1549
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:11,840
Call Michelle talking about that you can do it but

1550
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:13,376
How many people

1551
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,496
New show

1552
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:21,312
Always say don't go Alex Jones Show

1553
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,848
And the people say

1554
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,944
You have that person on I won't go on your show and I just don't do that

1555
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:28,224
I don't do that

1556
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:30,272
That's not what I'm involved in

1557
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,320
Transferrin here

1558
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:43,840
Ron I want to hear what he has to say

1559
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:47,168
Abalone

1560
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:52,288
There's that Trainwreck

1561
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:56,896
And so

1562
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:01,248
Probably table this issue and move on how do that too

1563
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:05,856
Apparently dr. Shiva really really doesn't like this Rashid

1564
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:08,416
Guitar character to the point

1565
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:11,744
Is this like why there are for like 2 minutes

1566
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,768
Start some s***

1567
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:14,816
Alex roster break and now he's gone

1568
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:18,144
Who knows what the f*** happened there but I can tell you this with absolute certainty

1569
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,168
I don't care

1570
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:24,032
Arizona Duel of the Fates there between the doctors

1571
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:25,056
That's what

1572
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:29,152
So Alex says that Rashid matar is a medical doctor

1573
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:30,688
As it turns out he's an Osteopath

1574
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:35,040
Which isn't a horrible thing but when you're an osteopath on Infowars

1575
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:37,088
You're automatically very suspect

1576
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:39,392
And suspect is a great word for guitar

1577
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:46,048
In 2007 the North Carolina Medical Board recommended the pitar no longer be allowed to treat children and cancer pay

1578
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:50,400
Ever found anybody charged a whole bunch of money to apply unproven

1579
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,168
Mets on patience

1580
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:56,288
Incidentally one of the treatments he apparently used with IV hydrogen peroxide which is bleach

1581
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:59,104
Hey

1582
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,920
Treating cancer patients is because his unproven and in effect

1583
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:05,760
The treatments were severely dangerous the reason they wanted him to stop treating children

1584
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:09,344
Was because part of his hustle was claiming that is chelation treatments

1585
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,904
To quote or Autism

1586
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,952
Pictures of course caused by vaccine

1587
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:18,560
Guitar is famous because he had an association with fellow anti-vaxxer Jenny

1588
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:19,328
McCarthy

1589
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:22,400
And because the media played along with his bullshittin 2009

1590
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:26,752
Inspiring cheerleader for the Washington football team named Desiree Jennings

1591
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,312
Claimed that the flu shot have given her dystonia

1592
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:31,104
A neurological disorder

1593
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,664
But she was cured by protaras chelation

1594
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:40,576
There are so many problems with her story Chief among them according to the initial story about her case in the Luton time

1595
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:44,160
She saw over 60 doctors trying to diagnose her condition

1596
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:51,072
Show me article Desiree has seen her primary care physician physical therapist speech therapist neurologist

1597
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:51,840
Psychologist

1598
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:53,632
Psychiatrist in a bevy of nurses

1599
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:57,984
Amazingly it was her physical therapist Who provided the clinical diagnosis

1600
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:58,752
Dystonia

1601
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,800
That's intensely suspicious

1602
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:05,920
The fact that you saw the neurologist who didn't catch this but somehow her physical therapist did

1603
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:06,688
That's weird

1604
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:11,552
I have no idea what the reality of the situation is but I don't see any proof that this is what she had

1605
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:17,184
Nor do I see any evidence of this was caused by a flu shot notarize any evidence of retarded anything to cure her

1606
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:23,328
Jennings case was championed by Jenny McCarthy and her group generation the rescue as an argument against vaccines

1607
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:29,728
And the media ran with it shows like inside edition to the fact that her case was reported

1608
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:33,056
To the vaccine adverse event reporting system to give it elevated

1609
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:33,824
Credibility

1610
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,384
Although that would end up being a bad mood

1611
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:39,200
These reports in that system don't

1612
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:41,760
Contain identifying information but they are public

1613
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:43,552
And dystonia is super rare

1614
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:46,624
So there aren't many cases that are filed that is a symptom

1615
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:51,488
The Examiner looked into it and found her adverse-event report and it includes this line

1616
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:52,256
Quote

1617
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:55,584
The admitting horologist felt that there was a strong psychogenic

1618
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,120
Component to the symptom ology

1619
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:59,424
I made a final diagnosis of weakness

1620
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:05,824
I don't mean to Mark Jennings at all because it's entirely clear that you was very likely suffering with a real condition

1621
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:10,432
Add that you was trying to get help with it just doesn't seem like I said anything to do with a flu shot

1622
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:16,320
Really just unfortunate that at all likely to choose used by people with a ridiculous anti-vaccination jenda

1623
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:22,976
Anyway that's how I got a bunch of attention by being attached to this case

1624
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:28,608
Notable as a coronavirus conspiracy theories been talking to basic asking for s*** about fauci and Bill Gates

1625
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:32,192
Remember

1626
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:37,824
Whenever I was still doing the hearing aids thing somebody told me that there a yoga instructor told them that they had

1627
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:38,592
Had Lyme disease

1628
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:39,872
And age

1629
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:40,640
Just wear like

1630
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:45,760
So are we went to the real doctor

1631
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:50,880
I'm editorializing there we went to the doctor and he said that nothing was wrong so then we went to

1632
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:52,160
Florida and tribune

1633
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:54,720
Experimental treatments for Lyme disease in your leg

1634
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:57,024
Oh yeah I know

1635
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:57,792
No

1636
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,328
Why did you do that

1637
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:01,120
Yep and I'm sad

1638
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:04,704
Guitars one of these folks who profits off that stuff

1639
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,752
Talk to him

1640
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:08,032
Or maybe he's not

1641
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:10,080
Let's move on from this guy

1642
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,736
Are we don't have gas

1643
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:21,088
Okay

1644
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:24,672
I do things for Monday

1645
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,512
Take a break from The Gas Man

1646
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:32,096
Because yummy just becomes a big giant

1647
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:37,216
Klusterfuk

1648
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:40,288
Junior High Junior High

1649
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:42,848
High School

1650
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,944
The Waters of which I swim

1651
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:48,480
School

1652
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:51,552
Free cancel all yesterday

1653
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,648
Fiasco

1654
01:35:57,696 --> 01:36:03,584
Electric guitar

1655
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,864
What the f***

1656
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:13,312
They look at people are being dramatic little baby so cancel it all out

1657
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:18,432
Yeah I like that totally grown-up response to you very much

1658
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:21,760
Alex's scolding them premature

1659
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:24,320
Pink baby himself

1660
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:26,624
So I'm going to take my ball and go home

1661
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,392
My dad is going

1662
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:28,160
Realmatt

1663
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:35,328
Select his own devices Alex starts rambling and he ends up complaining more about head about all these people starving

1664
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:37,888
Civilization

1665
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:40,704
Irrevocably right now

1666
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,984
Maybe too late

1667
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:45,568
Gigantic deep prolong depression

1668
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:49,920
An extra 20 million people on top of the 10 million are starving to death

1669
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:54,016
These are real people

1670
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:55,552
Rib sticking out on

1671
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:59,648
Oh my God the Liberals are always like oh let's go

1672
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:03,232
Take abandoned dogs and cats

1673
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,792
People

1674
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:10,144
Because you write off all those people you just

1675
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,936
Your self

1676
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:13,728
Thing

1677
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:17,312
That simple

1678
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:21,664
Obviously I agree with Alex divorce be done to address the severe issue of world hunger

1679
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,992
I have to ask why he hasn't cared about this up until now

1680
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:31,392
I recently stopped right now in the developing

1681
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:37,024
Worldwide support Ron Paul of eliminating all foreign aid since at least 1980

1682
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,584
Would you lead to the dance of Untold numbers of people

1683
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:44,704
Why is Malik scared at all than average of 9 million people die of hunger related conditions every year

1684
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,264
Why is lipid a part of the normal coverage let's say back

1685
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,288
In 2017

1686
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:54,688
Is it possible because he doesn't give a f*** about the actual issue and he's only using it as a political prop in order to justify his other position

1687
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:56,992
A time like you have some kind of a moral High Ground

1688
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:58,016
Let me answer that for you

1689
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,040
It is

1690
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:01,344
Play I find it

1691
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,160
There would probably be an overlap

1692
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:09,280
Between the people that he would be fine with getting exterminated and the people currently

1693
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:10,048
Starving today

1694
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,840
That's just my

1695
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:13,376
General Violet imagine

1696
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,144
Yeah

1697
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,960
If you can solve the world count switch tracks hunger

1698
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:20,800
Just takes you'll see that a lot of progress has been made in terms of tackling the world

1699
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:22,080
There's still a lot of work

1700
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:29,248
In 1990 there over 1 billion people living in hunger but by 2015 that number was down to 784

1701
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:31,552
Obviously still way too many

1702
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:34,112
That's a drop of about 20% Which is not nothing

1703
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,160
Every year since then

1704
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:37,696
We seen a reversal of that trend

1705
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:41,536
2018 we're back up to 822 million people

1706
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:43,328
Struggling with hunger and undernourished

1707
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:49,472
What are the big issues surrounding this according to the UN is it countries where hunger is on the rise are seeing Rising

1708
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:50,496
Income inequality

1709
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:54,336
Is compounding the problem for the most vulnerable populations

1710
01:38:55,104 --> 01:39:00,480
Another crisis in both of these issues are only going to get worse as the effects of climate change become more pronounced

1711
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:03,040
Yep this is very complicated and serious issue

1712
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:07,392
One that the UN Affiliated nongovernmental organizations do a tremendous amount of work

1713
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:09,184
Combating until you find solution

1714
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:11,744
It's deeply disgraceful for Alex

1715
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,560
Point to all the people around the world living in severe food in

1716
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:18,656
Security it would all be okay

1717
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:19,424
It wouldn't

1718
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:20,960
But don't kid yourself

1719
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:25,056
It's a sign of the season for making not to put more resources toward solving these problems

1720
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:31,712
It's a policy decision to fund or not fun programs that provide food to vulnerable people and Trump doesn't seem too interested

1721
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:33,248
Policies that fun that stuff

1722
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:39,136
In his 2021 budget proposal Trump looks a cup more than 180 billion dollars

1723
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:40,928
From the supplemental nutrition assistance

1724
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:45,280
Program for approximately 30% of its budget over the next 10 years

1725
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:47,328
This would come along with cuts to programs

1726
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:50,400
Provide free or reduced-price School meals for kids in need

1727
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:54,240
Give a f*** about hungry people in the country he's the president of

1728
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:58,336
How can you even pretend for a second he cares about people were hungry in a foreign country

1729
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,360
F****** absurd

1730
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:01,920
Considering how many times Trump has talked about and

1731
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:04,224
And followed through with cutting funding to the UN

1732
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:09,856
You have to assume he doesn't really give a s*** about the effect that could have on the ability of things like the world food program

1733
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:11,136
Operating

1734
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,416
Here's what I would say

1735
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:17,792
I admire Alex scaring people in the developing World dealing with Hunger even though I know he's only 40

1736
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:20,608
The care I don't want us to come to cynicism here

1737
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:23,168
So I'll try to build on that pretend concern

1738
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:23,936
He's presenting

1739
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:28,544
And I challenged him to look in the mirror and realize that the only two politicians he's ever really loved

1740
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:34,944
Ron Paul and Donald Trump would let every last person in those foreign countries die if it meant getting rid of some taxes

1741
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,224
And you-know-who would be

1742
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,248
Be helped out fighting

1743
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,528
To help us hungry people

1744
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:40,064
The same people who are now

1745
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,344
Who have been for years

1746
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,624
The people Alex in suits

1747
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,392
Are the villains

1748
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:45,440
So f*** you Alex

1749
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:46,720
Look in the mirror

1750
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:49,024
It is amazing to me that

1751
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,560
Billionaires don't have

1752
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:51,840
Somebody like right now

1753
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:53,632
Them going here's why

1754
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:55,168
You want to give away all of you

1755
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,192
Yeah

1756
01:40:56,448 --> 01:41:02,592
Income inequality is at an all-time high combined with a less access to food and water

1757
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:03,616
And basic housing

1758
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:07,200
Sooner or later this is going to happen

1759
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:09,248
Your money is going to go away

1760
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:12,576
And you can choose whether or not you want to be around after

1761
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:14,624
Because this is not going

1762
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:19,232
It's either that or they feel like they've done enough to build a

1763
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:22,816
Perfect castle that they can watch the rest of us die and then pick up the pieces

1764
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:26,400
Not much other things to say other than their stupid I guess

1765
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:27,936
I don't know

1766
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:31,776
That's all I'm going to say about his stupid starvation

1767
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:34,080
Cuz I really find it

1768
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:36,128
Level that like

1769
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:40,224
Money was narratives I find offenses in the same way but it sort of like

1770
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,016
There's the goofy dumbshit

1771
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:44,064
Like Moonraker just kind of like

1772
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:48,160
I've thought about that all day and then there's these things that are just like

1773
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:49,952
Repulsive

1774
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:54,816
Is that the thing the doctors are just having orgies as right on that same sort of

1775
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:58,656
Just quit

1776
01:41:58,912 --> 01:41:59,424
Now

1777
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:01,216
We get to

1778
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:02,496
The best

1779
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,568
The best thing

1780
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:08,128
This is really where things broke apart okay

1781
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,920
Alright like being to guests

1782
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,968
Fiasco

1783
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:16,064
Here is where like I'm already on the second episode

1784
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:19,136
Alright

1785
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:23,232
Come to the end of this thing I felt like it

1786
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:25,024
This is

1787
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:27,072
Just the wheels

1788
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:28,096
Off the wagon

1789
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,176
Myself a country the world

1790
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:49,600
I'm moving in with my dad

1791
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:51,392
Today's

1792
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:57,536
Alive this is just really kind of a precursor right now

1793
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:02,912
I died broadcast

1794
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:03,936
Because I

1795
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:06,496
Turn this around

1796
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:09,312
Climate were in what's happening in the world

1797
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:12,384
Lightning speed

1798
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:13,408
Level

1799
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:17,248
Now is the time to record the final broadcast

1800
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,040
It would go out

1801
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:21,344
Horse Island

1802
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:25,952
Make the most important statements that need to be made

1803
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:26,976
Mannequin size

1804
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:28,256
Elgin Way

1805
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:29,280
What a douche

1806
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:35,680
If you have things you want to say just f****** say them cut up a bulshit the recording a special episode

1807
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:36,704
Released after you die

1808
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,520
Like some kind of a low-rent Deadman dropped

1809
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:43,616
This dumb dumb as his own radio show with no boss no sponsors to please in a

1810
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:45,408
I completely browbeaten staff

1811
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:47,968
Really don't stop him from doing whatever the f*** you want

1812
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:54,368
Do we really expect anyone with half a brain to believe there's some kind of real important information he's been holding back for the past 25

1813
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:57,184
Years this is spectacular theater

1814
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:59,744
It's either just now it's being a dramatic little baby

1815
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,536
Tim Legend building

1816
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:03,328
If you're someone like Alex

1817
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:08,192
And you know you need a satisfying dainumo that leaves people puzzling over your career forever

1818
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:14,080
And what better way to do that then claim you're going to record a final episode that lays everything out and then never do it

1819
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:16,896
Rumors will fly but somebody with a copy of it

1820
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:19,968
Will become a hot debate about what was said in this mythical tape

1821
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:23,552
The only way to make this better is if he insists on doing it on VHS

1822
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:28,672
Because his career started analog and it's going out analog the awesome

1823
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:35,072
Got it but the reality of is if he did doing last episode it would be the biggest masturbatory ever

1824
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:39,168
Episode in the history of BMG jerking off there wouldn't be any new information to be like

1825
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:41,472
Hey remember how great I was that time

1826
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:44,544
Yeah I was pretty great I remember how great I was at other time

1827
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,616
Alberta gray most likely he'll record something

1828
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:54,016
He's crying and yelling but the global is referencing Bill Joyce article and why

1829
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:56,832
Basically just going down the list of all of his buzzwords

1830
01:44:57,088 --> 01:45:01,440
The catchphrase isn't aligned with something like that to me or something equally

1831
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:07,840
What I'm getting at is I refuse to get all excited about this I've absolutely no faith this will happen and if it does I have no faith in

1832
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:10,144
It won't be the biggest dog of his f****** career

1833
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,448
I will put this conspiracy theory out there

1834
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:15,264
I already

1835
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:18,848
And

1836
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,152
He pulls the computer chip out of the homeless man

1837
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:23,456
If the Ledger

1838
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:26,016
That's the way it is so Alex in the first

1839
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:32,416
Opening Salvo gears record this and it's going to be something that will be released once

1840
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:34,720
Puppies that are very specifically said that

1841
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:36,256
Changes

1842
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:37,280
Let me just

1843
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:39,328
Precursor

1844
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:40,096
2

1845
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:41,376
My final broadcast

1846
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:43,168
Wichita

1847
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:45,216
Talking about gas but will be one that I want

1848
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:49,056
Broadcast what's on record

1849
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,920
In some form though they are good at removing things now

1850
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:57,248
AI system another little beautiful human helpers

1851
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:58,528
So now I'm confused

1852
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:05,184
Is that what you're planning to do a show where he pretends to do his final show but it's not going to be his final show and it's not going to be something

1853
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:12,608
Sounds like a guy was really trying to hint to his audience that this s*** is over but doesn't have a balls

1854
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:13,376
Just come out with

1855
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:16,704
I mean what is them for him to say on his fake last show

1856
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:17,984
What

1857
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:22,592
Hasn't he had the time to say in a quarter-century on-air that he thinks he's going to prove in a couple hours

1858
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:28,992
Yeah there's that warlike had globalist means guys

1859
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:37,184
Serious things that I can imagine you being like this is the end of the career real might as well might as well

1860
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:37,952
Yeah

1861
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:39,744
I don't know I am Felix

1862
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,096
Like what what what is his

1863
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:45,888
Big secret that he's been hiding

1864
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:47,936
That

1865
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:50,240
Tape of Reagan getting Pig was real

1866
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:56,640
Look he's got a copy of it the only way it works satisfyingly is if he doesn't do it but makes it

1867
01:46:56,896 --> 01:47:03,040
The big deal about how he's going to do it exactly what I laid out is the only way this is awesome

1868
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:06,112
That be the best Last Broadcast to if you

1869
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:09,184
Do he should reveal that it is his last broadcast

1870
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:12,768
After saying he's going to do this whole Last Broadcast

1871
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:13,792
And then be like

1872
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:14,816
Surprise

1873
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:15,584
This was

1874
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,632
Play a God damn

1875
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:18,400
Fake Jordan

1876
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:21,984
Kind of feels like that's what this show is kind of does

1877
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:24,544
It starts to get like really

1878
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:30,944
Retrospective

1879
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:33,504
Alex's talking here

1880
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:36,832
It seems like he's reflecting on his career in hindsight

1881
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:39,392
As opposed to it being something that's ongoing

1882
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:42,464
Shove

1883
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:45,024
Sadness but also of

1884
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:47,328
Attraction

1885
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:48,096
That

1886
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:53,472
I much rather than I ever thought I would and I didn't ever expect to

1887
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:56,288
Everybody believing they were men better than I was

1888
01:47:57,312 --> 01:48:02,688
BoBoiBoy

1889
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:10,112
People in the government systems in Ark

1890
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:13,952
Well dug-in into well-entrenched

1891
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:15,488
Go-Buster too strong

1892
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:18,304
We failed now they're going to do what they're going to do

1893
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,608
That really seems like a retrospec

1894
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:22,656
The dunes like I'm done

1895
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:23,680
Yeah career is over

1896
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:27,520
Oh that's that's got a dishes your life kind of fit that's a man

1897
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:29,056
That's a guy at like

1898
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:32,896
58mm company for 33 years

1899
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:35,456
And is in force retired

1900
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:41,856
He's giving that speech of liked it also just want to say that I accomplished a lot here I didn't do everything I want to do cuz they forced me out

1901
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:44,416
I had seven years

1902
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:51,072
Anyways I thought I did really great guy at the end of this but it's a guy who fails

1903
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:53,632
Whatever his big goal

1904
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:55,680
But also needs to be like

1905
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:56,448
Totally Kyle

1906
01:48:57,216 --> 01:48:59,520
It really feels very much

1907
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:00,544
After all

1908
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:07,712
Bubbles are too strong they're going to win in this round or whatever but Alex Asher is everyone

1909
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:09,248
That oral tradition

1910
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:11,552
Will save us

1911
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:12,320
Sure

1912
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:16,416
So bad

1913
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:20,256
That even with AI censoring

1914
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:22,816
Spoken word

1915
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:23,840
Traditions

1916
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:26,656
The truth is getting out and when they

1917
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:28,448
Till almost everybody

1918
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:35,360
Be a large human resistance come out

1919
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:38,176
And that's really what matters now.

1920
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:39,968
And the good thing is we weren't kit

1921
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:40,992
Put it

1922
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:44,576
Going to get the people

1923
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:47,648
But I was sure you

1924
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:54,048
Pay for what they done

1925
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:58,144
Dumbing us down turning us against each other promoting racism in the name of fight

1926
01:49:58,912 --> 01:50:00,960
Damn Satanism in there

1927
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:02,240
Feel like crap everywhere

1928
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:04,032
Feel.

1929
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,824
Pure rage

1930
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:09,664
That way I won't let you sell my body distorted

1931
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:12,992
Some evil.

1932
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:15,808
Enlightenment

1933
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:16,832
Pure

1934
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:20,928
I can assure

1935
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:23,744
The New World Order the Hillary Clinton's the Bill Gates's the world

1936
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:24,768
Rothschild

1937
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:27,584
You are

1938
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:29,632
Destroyed

1939
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:32,192
Show me the ladders is fairly standard stuff

1940
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:34,240
But it's also it also feels like

1941
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:35,264
Exactly what

1942
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:40,128
I think he launched into like what his idea of My Last Broadcast will be

1943
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:41,920
That's how it feels

1944
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:43,200
The globalists are going to win

1945
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:46,272
I won't be around it's not going to happen but oral tradition

1946
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:52,672
Getting the word out there

1947
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:57,792
Avenger

1948
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:02,144
It just goes on and Alex is like thanking his audience

1949
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,168
Lake

1950
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:05,472
This feels

1951
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:06,240
Wake through

1952
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:07,776
So attempted closure

1953
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:14,432
Promoting the truth being attacked

1954
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:18,784
Pushing out our articles and videos even though they're imperfect and

1955
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:25,952
Coordinated

1956
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:28,256
Because it is coordinated

1957
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,328
Cereal

1958
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:33,376
Seneca and the enemy knows that

1959
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,424
Know what to do about it

1960
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:37,216
Ice-o-matic beautiful

1961
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:38,496
Cold War

1962
01:51:42,592 --> 01:51:43,360
Together

1963
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:50,528
The first time my life began to feel guilt having children yesterday

1964
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:54,880
The universe

1965
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:55,648
Oh boy

1966
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:57,440
And to

1967
01:51:57,952 --> 01:51:59,488
Not be selfish and immature

1968
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:03,328
Become your ancestors

1969
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:04,608
Sure

1970
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:06,656
Action of the future there will

1971
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:08,704
Rochester Vibe and Cher

1972
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:11,776
Our time together and share our Humanity in extent

1973
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:15,360
Experience

1974
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:17,408
On the tells you that you're not essential

1975
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:19,968
I want to tell you you're ugly or you're bad

1976
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:22,528
Because if where you're from or what color you are

1977
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:23,552
Any of that

1978
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:24,832
If you get the f*** out of

1979
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:31,488
So I'm listening I'm listening to this and it really sounds to me like a guy was about to sign off and

1980
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:32,256
Not come back

1981
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:38,400
And I noticed this is the last segment of the hour like he's in the middle of the last segment yeah it starts to make sense

1982
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:42,752
It's Friday this is how he's going to wrap things up and then go on a sad weekend

1983
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:46,848
And then I realize that this is the second hour of the show

1984
01:52:50,944 --> 01:52:54,016
Game theory he still has another hour of show after this

1985
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:56,320
How do you recover from

1986
01:52:56,576 --> 01:53:02,464
Academy Award lifetime achievement on how do you do that and then do another normal hour of the show

1987
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:07,840
Why the fuk didn't you wait an hour to do the xenos along and show is crazy

1988
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:12,704
Another movie that is the broadcaster in any disaster movie

1989
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:13,984
This is look

1990
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:16,288
The asteroid is coming we have

1991
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,336
8 hours last time I was

1992
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:24,736
Eternally privileged to share this time with you if your vanity is beautiful we will survive

1993
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:31,136
Beautiful and f*** you Alex if anyone tries to make you feel bad or skin color or where you're from

1994
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:36,768
Message for black people

1995
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:39,840
No

1996
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:40,608
No

1997
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:42,912
Color something

1998
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:48,032
Did Andreas run to enslave and kill you

1999
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:51,360
Publican Bridget's establishment Blueblood dorks

2000
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:53,152
And don't know what's going on

2001
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:01,600
They don't want to just get rid of what they call

2002
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:07,232
Third world populations I want to get rid of everybody because he's people hate themselves they have live

2003
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:10,048
Selfishness in bread

2004
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:12,608
Disgusting ways

2005
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:18,752
What anybody can you get monsters folks you get selfish

2006
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:20,032
Psychotics

2007
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:23,616
Because you're not supposed to have sex with your brothers and sisters

2008
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:25,408
Can I supposed to have kids with him

2009
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:27,456
People are mentally ill

2010
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:28,224
Okay

2011
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,528
They're dangerous

2012
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:33,344
We got to fight him

2013
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:37,184
I can't remember Jordan is this family show

2014
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,976
Alex's message

2015
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:40,000
Two people of color

2016
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:41,536
Is that the Democrats

2017
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:47,936
Want to kill everybody but the Republicans just want to kill you altruistic.

2018
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:50,752
Dude or something Republican Maybe

2019
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:57,152
I also recognize that I said that this is a message to black people but he says people of color

2020
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:58,432
Do you know why

2021
01:54:58,688 --> 01:54:59,968
I was wrong

2022
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:03,808
I never would have imagined that I would say people of trouble

2023
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:05,856
What the f*** is up with that

2024
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:12,256
Music

2025
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:18,400
I'm going to use the Vista

2026
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:26,080
Also I do think that Alex a rambling about how you're not supposed to suck your siblings

2027
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:30,944
This is a real

2028
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:34,272
Really if you wanted to still everything down

2029
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:35,296
Took it out

2030
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:43,488
They do that because they see Infowars

2031
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:47,072
Email

2032
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:48,608
Standing up strong

2033
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,192
And rallying fellow human Shannon

2034
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:57,312
Women getting involved in waking other waiting others up there they're worried about humans coming together

2035
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:01,664
You're a winner is

2036
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:03,712
When they say they destroyed me

2037
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:06,784
When they say they killed me or they put all these lies out

2038
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:10,112
You have to understand that they did that because we were too strong

2039
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:12,672
Loser

2040
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:18,304
Winners clubs you have to know

2041
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:22,144
Bad things about to happen

2042
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:28,544
Don't know that stuff you're going to hear a lot of bad stuff about

2043
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,896
Because they hate males

2044
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:39,296
So Alex discusses hell like they're only destroying him cuz he's too strong or something I need to remember is that

2045
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:40,576
Star wars exist

2046
01:56:42,112 --> 01:56:42,880
Loser

2047
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:44,928
Winter clothes

2048
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:49,024
Analogy was not the loser when Darth Vader

2049
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:53,120
He's a winner because he chose

2050
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:55,168
The Young Generation will get pissed off

2051
01:56:55,680 --> 01:57:01,824
I think Alex might have missed the point of Obi-Wan's line but how Vader strike him down and become more powerful than you can possibly imagine

2052
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:08,480
Alex seems to think that Obi-Wan is saying that his death will be a rallying event for the next generation of Jedi but I don't think that's the point

2053
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:13,600
Make it super clear that you talked about how he'll become more powerful because he'll become one with the force

2054
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:20,000
Gain all sorts of powers after he dies

2055
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:26,400
About Luke being inspired to learn to respond to Obi-Wan's death

2056
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:27,936
I shall become more powerful

2057
01:57:28,192 --> 01:57:31,008
All sorts of other minutiae about Force ghosts that have no

2058
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:32,288
It's been getting into her exploring

2059
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:36,896
I would expect Alex have a good handle on this though cuz we've seen he's a pretty cool guy

2060
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:37,664
Yoda

2061
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:39,712
Can still shoot lightning a post

2062
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:40,480
Horoscopes

2063
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:46,880
We know it's cool

2064
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:48,416
Probably

2065
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:52,256
Pop-up and whatever Planet you want to Pedal kreyn like you can't

2066
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:56,352
Buhurt there's life after death and you can still hang out with your butt

2067
01:57:56,608 --> 01:57:58,144
Totally great

2068
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,960
Samuel Jackson

2069
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:03,520
So of course because Alex is

2070
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:06,848
Doing this weird thing that may or may not be his

2071
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:10,176
I'm tempted Last Broadcast or something

2072
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:16,576
He starts thinking about Colonel Travis almost starts crying talking about that drunk Yahoo

2073
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:20,672
Knew he was going to die

2074
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:22,720
He really believed in Texas

2075
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:29,888
You wanted his own tyranny of the massacres

2076
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:30,656
Just like

2077
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:35,776
British

2078
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:37,824
Eddie Trunk.

2079
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:40,384
6110 21

2080
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:44,480
And so he laid down his life

2081
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:45,504
What are the people

2082
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:48,832
The other people would see an example not a failure

2083
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:50,368
Victory

2084
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:54,208
Like yourself

2085
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:01,120
In the blessing

2086
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:03,168
Persecuted

2087
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:05,472
Lloyd of the right thing

2088
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:08,800
And knowing you're right

2089
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:13,408
Knowing god and knowing God's real

2090
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,968
Doubts knows nothing about Colonel Travis

2091
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:22,880
Description is my commanding officer the guy is like I've always

2092
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:28,768
Showing up 1 to 10

2093
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:33,120
We should probably get a better tactical position yeah maybe

2094
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:34,656
Colonel Travis

2095
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:35,680
I'm just saying

2096
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:37,984
Maybe we're the ones doing it wrong

2097
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:44,384
Travis end up at the Alamo because of some pursuit of a noble death he was running away from debts

2098
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:52,320
The segment ends like I said

2099
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:53,856
Like this should be it he should go

2100
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:56,160
Go home

2101
01:59:56,416 --> 02:00:01,024
You got nowhere else to go screaming Remember the Alamo

2102
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:07,680
Stop it.

2103
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:09,728
Billiards

2104
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:10,496
Not

2105
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:14,080
To stand up for what's right

2106
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:23,040
You have to turn loose

2107
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:24,576
Any fear

2108
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:25,856
Or even any guilt

2109
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:29,952
The number for my children

2110
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:33,280
Raw

2111
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:39,424
A 2017

2112
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:45,312
Promise

2113
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:49,408
Providence

2114
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:52,480
Providence

2115
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:55,296
Sherbet on a 4:30 work

2116
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:57,600

Infowars

2120

Go home if you are there and you are like one of Alex's employees it is your response

2121
02:01:15,776 --> 02:01:17,568
Ability to be like

2122
02:01:17,824 --> 02:01:22,432
David Knight will take over whatever you are you got to get off at

2123
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:26,016

Message by all means do that

2125

Your lies

2127
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:37,792
I don't know what the fuc

2128
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:39,840
So he he he doesn't

2129
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:43,168
Alex back to business house comes back

2130
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:52,896
Forgot a sandwich during the break then he got blood sugar

2131
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:53,920
So you didn't go

2132
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:55,200
Restart

2133
02:02:02,368 --> 02:02:05,184
A bunch of clubs into the cover

2134
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:09,024
Just gets to the point where

2135
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:11,328
Disgusting

2136
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:14,400
The good news is

2137
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:20,544
Everyone I know is totally rejected stuff like together at home

2138
02:02:22,848 --> 02:02:23,616
World government

2139
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:26,688
Propaganda with Lady Gaga

2140
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:30,784
Lady Gaga on record

2141
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:35,136
Got to have someone sleep with her in her room because demons

2142
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:50,752
My mind and just see for Infiniti

2143
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:56,128
Couldn't imagine serving a god

2144
02:02:57,152 --> 02:02:58,944
Rabideaux's your brain when you live in

2145
02:03:00,736 --> 02:03:01,760
Crystal Cave

2146
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:03,552
Damn virus

2147
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:09,952
Alex seems to be in constant torment you literally talk about all the time

2148
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:10,720
Like

2149
02:03:11,232 --> 02:03:15,840
He's constantly tormented I don't I don't know any other way to explain it

2150
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:22,240
How do I Alex's talk about a 2013 lawsuit filed by former personal assistant

2151
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:23,008
It was made

2152
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:29,408
Was that you was made to sleep in the same bed as Gaga because she didn't get her own hotel room and Lady Gaga at tasks for her

2153
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:30,432
Even at night

2154
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:37,088
O'Neal testified in a deposition is Lady Gaga was watching a DVD in the middle of the night I'm tired of it

2155
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:40,160
She woke her up to take out and replace the DVD

2156
02:03:40,672 --> 02:03:45,536
Worst you can save this an instance of a popstar have an unreasonable demands for a personal assistant

2157
02:03:45,792 --> 02:03:47,584
But a little bit far

2158
02:03:48,096 --> 02:03:54,240
What he's doing is combining that story with a 2012 interview Gaga did where she discussed a recurring nightmare she had involved

2159
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:55,264
Having a demonic Phantom

2160
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:57,824
And how she discussed agree with Deepak Chopra

2161
02:03:58,592 --> 02:04:02,688
How to combine these two things into one story the kind of works better for his purposes but isn't

2162
02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:04,224
So that's what's going on

2163
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:04,992
Yeah that sounds

2164
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:06,272
It's all bulshit

2165
02:04:06,784 --> 02:04:07,552
Anyway good

2166
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:08,832
Good thing you didn't go home

2167
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:11,648
What is the way he describes

2168
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:14,720
God is in his mind that's a total Gotham

2169
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,024
That's one of his gods

2170
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:17,792
Favorite things

2171
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:20,864
He's got demons on all of us all the time

2172
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:24,448
Yeah that is true it is it's strange

2173
02:04:25,984 --> 02:04:28,032
I would explore this longer but I have to go to this

2174
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:30,080
This is

2175
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:33,408
I was just talking about everything else we've talked

2176
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:34,432
Today which is

2177
02:04:34,944 --> 02:04:35,968
Absolutely

2178
02:04:36,224 --> 02:04:39,040
Just mainstream boring normal nonsense

2179
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:40,320
Doctors fighting

2180
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:46,720
So Alex is talking about here this next clip about how the people go along with a new world order right because

2181
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:48,512
Went along with the New Orleans

2182
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:50,816
Yeah man

2183
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:53,120
Trained to go along with things

2184
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:57,472
Write something like that it gets into a metaphor about Village

2185
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:02,080
And I find this really interesting this is one of the more fascinating

2186
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:08,480
Weird things of his brain

2187
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:14,880
Don't you see it now why are you

2188
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:18,976
Why are you going along with this because humans are designed to go along with each other

2189
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:25,120
Design a little village in dad and Grandpa and Grandma take it out and catch fish

2190
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:28,192
Crocodile

2191
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:33,312
Why don't you see that crocodile you know either beer or something you know they told you the truth in your whole life

2192
02:05:33,568 --> 02:05:35,104
People around the village were good

2193
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,408
Crazy in Badin

2194
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:42,272
Somebody so you know some of the men Brad demon

2195
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:43,296
You know

2196
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:45,600
Villages good

2197
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:46,624
What

2198
02:05:49,696 --> 02:05:50,720
That sounds sick

2199
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:52,512
Your village become successful

2200
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:54,816
Because you're planted crops you're hunting

2201
02:05:55,072 --> 02:05:56,096
All the sudden you're not

2202
02:06:01,728 --> 02:06:02,496
You talk about you buddy

2203
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:04,032
Shut up

2204
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:26,560
You've been bad and you don't believe in this God never give an offering so

2205
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:28,096
Sun

2206
02:06:29,376 --> 02:06:35,520
Okay that sounds like Rodger Stone

2207
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:38,336
The bad witch doctor comes in

2208
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:43,200
Alright Seuss weird

2209
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:44,736
It goes on a little bit

2210
02:06:44,992 --> 02:06:46,016
This is very strange

2211
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:50,880
Supposed to

2212
02:06:51,904 --> 02:06:55,744
You been bad and you don't believe in this God never give in offering so

2213
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:57,280
The Sun

2214
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:04,448
What

2215
02:07:04,704 --> 02:07:05,472
Dates the fees

2216
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:07,264
What

2217
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:09,568
Why what

2218
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:15,968
Everybody laughs at the guy and whatever you guys are throwing out of the village

2219
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:18,528
Michonne

2220
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:21,344
It's eaten by the monster

2221
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:23,904
Fireworks

2222
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:25,952
You got out of a mind scratch them

2223
02:07:29,536 --> 02:07:30,816
God

2224
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:35,936
Will make the Sun come back and you know cures illnesses and

2225
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:38,496
You know keeps you warm and you really like it

2226
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:41,824
And you get on your knees to him that goes okay

2227
02:07:42,592 --> 02:07:43,360
Wake me up in the back

2228
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:49,504
So it just goes on exactly how you'd expect you start so I cruel in over the village

2229
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:55,904
Stop this is really the same kind of is Ancient Aliens stuff

2230
02:07:56,160 --> 02:08:00,256
People have a complete inability to imagine that non-european cultures of the past

2231
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:01,024
We're capable

2232
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:03,328
Anything without some kind of outside help

2233
02:08:03,584 --> 02:08:07,424
Ancient Aliens people it's using aliens to explain things like a pyramid

2234
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:13,056
Baloch satsang a bad witch doctor has had some secret knowledge of eclipses that they used to bamboozle ignorant people

2235
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:19,968
As far back as 2136 BC the Chinese knew perfectly well about eclipses and history.com

2236
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:21,504
Emperor Chung

2237
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:25,344
Kong executed is Royal astronomers hi and ho

2238
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:26,624
For failing to predict

2239
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:27,392
Eclipse

2240
02:08:27,904 --> 02:08:34,048
They have folklore based explanations for what was happening all terrified of an eclipse

2241
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:34,816
Way that Alex's

2242
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:35,840
Describing

2243
02:08:36,864 --> 02:08:43,008
The Inuit people have legends about their Moon God and his sister's son God fighting which explain the lunar cycle and eclipses

2244
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:44,800
Who's to quarrelsome siblings

2245
02:08:45,056 --> 02:08:45,824
Chasing each other

2246
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:52,480
The story Alex is telling is fairly close to the tradition of the Guatemala people from Benin and Togo

2247
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:56,320
And their tradition 22 matriarchs of the world

2248
02:08:56,576 --> 02:08:58,880
And pukapuka presided over the

2249
02:08:59,136 --> 02:08:59,648
First Villa

2250
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:04,256
As it grew people started fighting with each other in order to get them to stop

2251
02:09:04,768 --> 02:09:05,792
The two made the Sun

2252
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:12,704
That got people's attention so everyone made peace with each other and gave Gifts of reconciliation and women turn the sun back on

2253
02:09:13,472 --> 02:09:18,592
This tradition continues in the bottom Alibaba Bayview eclipses is a time to make peace with each other

2254
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:21,920
Kind of is like Alex's story but it's also the opposite

2255
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:26,528
I have no idea what Alex is talking about but it legit sounds like something from a children's movie

2256
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:33,184
If you had some kind of a citation for the art of the originating in bed which doctor is showing up the villages around the world

2257
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:34,208
Chronology of eclipses

2258
02:09:34,464 --> 02:09:39,328
Which they then use to become rulers I'd love to see it but I don't know if it's based on anything real

2259
02:09:40,096 --> 02:09:46,240
Interesting Lee though this exact story that I was telling is a Trope of early English literature from the late 1800

2260
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:49,056
However it's white people using eclipses to f***

2261
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:50,080
With Native people

2262
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:55,968
From The Savage and literature representations of society in English fiction

2263
02:09:56,224 --> 02:09:58,784
58 through 1920 by Bryan Street

2264
02:09:59,040 --> 02:09:59,552
Quote

2265
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:05,184
Gullibility is a future which enables British sovereignty to be maintained by the use of Western knowledge

2266
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:08,000
And Technology to frighten the simple native into submission

2267
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:13,376
Perhaps the most famous and memorable example is the use of an eclipse to overall the native

2268
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:16,192
In King Solomon's Mine The Travelers

2269
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:20,544
Take advantage of an eclipse to reinforce the natives believe that they are God

2270
02:10:21,312 --> 02:10:25,152
Also side point it's very likely that this is where Alex is taking his story

2271
02:10:25,664 --> 02:10:27,456
Because he keeps referring to the person

2272
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:32,832
In his telling as a witch doctor which is precisely who the villain of that story is

2273
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:38,976
If he and his fellow Travelers can make the natives believe it is through their power that the phase of the moon is dark in

2274
02:10:39,232 --> 02:10:43,072
Abandon their evil witch doctor Google and follow the white man

2275
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:48,448
This is a very popular theme in literature around the time it's not to emphasize white Europeans

2276
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:49,216
Supremacy

2277
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:50,496
From Streets book

2278
02:10:50,752 --> 02:10:56,896
The series of anthropologists are used in popular fiction to provide various explanations for primitive attitudes

2279
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:59,712
Which become traditional themes and fix

2280
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:06,624
The ease with which of the Native can be deceived is brought home to the reader by the Vivid use of eclipses and academics

2281
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:08,928
Siri is used to explain the natives reaction

2282
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:13,280
I'm not positive that this is where Alex is getting this wrong but it is like a Trope of this

2283
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:18,912
This European fiction from around the time of colonial

2284
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:19,680
I've read books

2285
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:22,240
Not realize

2286
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:24,288
Looking back it does seem obvious

2287
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:25,568
That eclipses are the white man

2288
02:11:25,824 --> 02:11:26,336
Man's Burden

2289
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:27,616
Red-eared moussaka

2290
02:11:27,872 --> 02:11:29,408
That's what makes the most sense

2291
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:32,480
It's just what we do we know

2292
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:36,064
We just have to carry that knowledge of an eclipse on our backs

2293
02:11:36,576 --> 02:11:42,720
Yeah so I'm not positive and Alex never sites anything when he's talking about these witch doctors that would come

2294
02:11:42,976 --> 02:11:45,792
Because they have the secret knowledge of the

2295
02:11:46,048 --> 02:11:47,328
Brotherhood or whatever

2296
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:53,728
I'm willing to explore whatever he's bringing to the table but from everything I can tell it seems like these

2297
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:55,008
Are these

2298
02:11:55,776 --> 02:11:57,312
These eurocentric

2299
02:11:57,824 --> 02:11:59,104
1800

2300
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:03,456
Versions of stories about

2301
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:09,600
The quote-unquote Savages

2302
02:12:09,856 --> 02:12:11,904
I think that I was just believes all of that is

2303
02:12:12,416 --> 02:12:13,184
Yeah basically

2304
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:16,768
So Alex in the next with dr. Howard Huey

2305
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:18,816
He got up really early that morning

2306
02:12:19,328 --> 02:12:20,096
Any watch Trump

2307
02:12:20,352 --> 02:12:21,376
Press conference

2308
02:12:21,888 --> 02:12:22,400
And

2309
02:12:22,656 --> 02:12:24,960
He has an interesting thought about it okay

2310
02:12:27,264 --> 02:12:28,544
Black forest

2311
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:31,360
I watch the whole thing

2312
02:12:33,408 --> 02:12:34,432
Ultraman

2313
02:12:38,272 --> 02:12:39,296
Years off my life man

2314
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:42,624
It will

2315
02:12:53,376 --> 02:12:54,656
Do you know

2316
02:12:55,168 --> 02:12:55,936
Dobby talks.

2317
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:58,240
But he knows they put people in chili

2318
02:12:59,264 --> 02:12:59,776
So he does

2319
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:03,616
Unlike might have been good

2320
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:10,784
We have a big super Laboratory

2321
02:13:11,296 --> 02:13:14,368
For the first time that sunlight kills the virus

2322
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:16,416
Amigos

2323
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:18,976
That's good with your skin

2324
02:13:21,792 --> 02:13:23,072
Sun hitting your skin

2325
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:23,840
Help

2326
02:13:24,608 --> 02:13:30,752
This is super interesting to me man in the past hour to just flatly ignored all the many many times Trump has said completely f***** up and

2327
02:13:31,008 --> 02:13:32,288
Stupid things any press conferences

2328
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:34,336
You just act like those things didn't happen

2329
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:40,480
I guess like you must have felt like this one was too big and stupid to ignore so he's just come up with this narrative

2330
02:13:40,736 --> 02:13:43,552
The Trump was acting stupid cuz we are also stupid

2331
02:13:44,064 --> 02:13:49,184
This amazing stuff and it definitely doesn't sound like someone trying to rationalize another person's abusive Behavior

2332
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:53,536
As for the stuff that Trump is saying but like UV lights we've gone over that already

2333
02:13:53,792 --> 02:13:56,352
The type of UV light that's used to disinfect things would f******

2334
02:13:56,608 --> 02:13:57,376
Fry's Yuma

2335
02:13:57,888 --> 02:14:04,032
This is not Trump saying it's the sun wonderful 18 talk without his ass about technology does not

2336
02:14:05,568 --> 02:14:06,336
I have

2337
02:14:06,592 --> 02:14:08,640
No I have no sense

2338
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:12,224
Like if you're if you still support Trump you get what you get

2339
02:14:12,736 --> 02:14:16,064
You just you just listen to the president the guy you wanted

2340
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:16,832
To run

2341
02:14:17,088 --> 02:14:18,880
The country tell you to inject yourself

2342
02:14:19,392 --> 02:14:25,536
Well go fuc not according to Alex

2343
02:14:25,792 --> 02:14:29,632
Can rationalize a guy saying inject yourself with bleach away

2344
02:14:29,888 --> 02:14:31,680
You win the cognitive dissonance price

2345
02:14:31,936 --> 02:14:33,472
The sun is good for your skin

2346
02:14:33,728 --> 02:14:34,240
You want

2347
02:14:34,496 --> 02:14:36,288
Everyone should just be

2348
02:14:40,384 --> 02:14:42,176
Donald Trump is not a doctor

2349
02:14:42,944 --> 02:14:44,480
So he can't tell you

2350
02:14:45,504 --> 02:14:46,272
Sonny's

2351
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:50,624
Honestly he can't

2352
02:14:54,208 --> 02:14:56,000
The sun is good for your skin

2353
02:15:01,120 --> 02:15:05,472
So you're the Trump side in that in the press conference that everyone is up in arms about

2354
02:15:06,496 --> 02:15:12,640
Supposing we hit the body with a tremendous weather is ultraviolet or just a very powerful light and I think you said

2355
02:15:12,896 --> 02:15:13,408
Has been checked

2356
02:15:13,664 --> 02:15:14,432
But you're going to test

2357
02:15:14,944 --> 02:15:21,088
And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body would you can do either through the skin or in some other way

2358
02:15:21,344 --> 02:15:24,672
I don't think you said you're going to test that to sounds interesting right

2359
02:15:24,928 --> 02:15:28,768
And then I see the disinfectant where knocks it out in a minute one minute

2360
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:34,400
Santa is there a way we could do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning

2361
02:15:34,656 --> 02:15:38,752
Because you see it gets in the lungs and it doesn't tremendous number of on the lungs

2362
02:15:39,008 --> 02:15:40,544
Should be interesting to check that

2363
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:42,336
So you're going to have some

2364
02:15:42,592 --> 02:15:45,920
You're going to have to use medical doctors with but it sounds interesting to me

2365
02:15:46,688 --> 02:15:51,808
He wasn't saying with his son was good he was calling weird ideas about you he technology that he doesn't understand

2366
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:54,112
Implying that because disinfectants worked

2367
02:15:54,368 --> 02:15:55,648
Kill the virus on surfaces

2368
02:15:55,904 --> 02:15:58,976
Baby

2369
02:15:59,488 --> 02:16:05,376
The next day when asked about it Trump tried to pretend that he brought up these things sarcastically in order to f*** with reporters

2370
02:16:05,632 --> 02:16:07,424
Just to see what would happen

2371
02:16:08,192 --> 02:16:09,472
And that Jordan is a release

2372
02:16:09,984 --> 02:16:16,128
That the president of the United States was using his press conference of the middle of the pandemic to suggest potentially lethal

2373
02:16:16,384 --> 02:16:17,920
Virus just a troll reporters

2374
02:16:18,176 --> 02:16:20,224
Yeah it's it's

2375
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:20,992
Worse

2376
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:22,528
If he knows what he's doing

2377
02:16:22,784 --> 02:16:23,552
Yeah he doesn't

2378
02:16:23,808 --> 02:16:25,856
He doesn't understand that he thinks that when he's

2379
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:27,648
He saying I was being sarcastic

2380
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:29,696
Then he's like see

2381
02:16:29,952 --> 02:16:30,720
I wasn't stupid

2382
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:36,096
I was just really really evil trying on purpose

2383
02:16:36,352 --> 02:16:37,120
To get people

2384
02:16:37,376 --> 02:16:40,704
Killed his explanation of like I was just talking with reporters like Eva

2385
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:45,568
Think ATAC in his mind is like you've done it yet.

2386
02:16:45,824 --> 02:16:49,408
Had no idea I was lying to you I'm a genius

2387
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:56,064
Trump said he was just drawing and then of course it came out to one of the leaders of the genesis2church who promote the use of

2388
02:16:56,320 --> 02:16:58,368
Bleach is a miracle cure for all sorts of ailments

2389
02:16:58,624 --> 02:17:00,416
Pics of trump a letter earlier that week

2390
02:17:00,928 --> 02:17:02,208
Article in the guardian

2391
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:08,608
In his letter Mark grenon told Trump the chlorine dioxide powerful bleach used in industrial processes that is

2392
02:17:08,864 --> 02:17:09,888
Textile manufacturing

2393
02:17:10,144 --> 02:17:12,192
They can have a fatal side effect when drunk

2394
02:17:12,448 --> 02:17:16,544
Is Coke a wonderful detox that can kill 99% of the pathogen to the body

2395
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:18,080
Yeah.

2396
02:17:18,336 --> 02:17:20,128
Rid the body of covid-19

2397
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:26,528
A few days after Grennan dispatched his letter Trump went on National Television that is daily coronavirus briefing in the White House

2398
02:17:26,784 --> 02:17:31,392
On Thursday and promoted the idea that disinfectant could be used as a treatment for the virus

2399
02:17:31,904 --> 02:17:33,952
The group is also the subject of an investigation

2400
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:35,744
Because of their medical claims about bleach

2401
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,536
And the article goes on to say that quote

2402
02:17:37,792 --> 02:17:40,864
Brandon said that

2403
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:44,448
In the past few days to Trump at the White House urging him to take action

2404
02:17:44,704 --> 02:17:48,032
To protect Genesis 2 and its bleach paddling activities

2405
02:17:48,288 --> 02:17:50,336
Which they claim can cure Coronavirus

2406
02:17:50,848 --> 02:17:52,896
I have no ideas these two seem like connected

2407
02:17:53,152 --> 02:17:56,736
Things are related is Mark grenon

2408
02:17:57,248 --> 02:17:59,296
He was pretty pumped about Trump's press conference

2409
02:17:59,808 --> 02:18:04,416
How to find out what a bring up this part of Trump's comments and just wants to pretend that all is good

2410
02:18:04,928 --> 02:18:11,072
It does seem like the New York's attorney general should send trempealeau cease-and-desist letter for baking

2411
02:18:11,328 --> 02:18:11,840
False

2412
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:13,632
Maybe

2413
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:19,264
So Alex is mad like sunlight is good cuz the doctors

2414
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:20,544
These doctors

2415
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:25,408
Interactions

2416
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:28,736

2426

2465
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:10,944
Check

2466
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:13,504
Check is interpersonally exploitative

2467
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:15,552
Lacks empathy

2468
02:22:15,808 --> 02:22:21,440
Is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her

2469
02:22:21,696 --> 02:22:24,000
Shows arrogant haughty behaviors or attitude

2470
02:22:25,536 --> 02:22:31,680
That's all of that solid you are there any secret ones. On there in the 2011 the DSM

2471
02:22:31,936 --> 02:22:36,544
Or find some of the criteria for MPD

2472
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:39,872
What are the defining features of impairments in cell function

2473
02:22:40,128 --> 02:22:44,736
Emotional regulation mirroring self-esteem

2474
02:22:44,992 --> 02:22:51,136
That sounds a lot like his broadcast sounds like that another Hallmark is a grandiosity mixed with excessive

2475
02:22:51,392 --> 02:22:54,976
Attempts to attract or be the focus of the attention of others

2476
02:22:55,232 --> 02:22:55,744
I know.

2477
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:00,608
So I can't

2478
02:23:00,864 --> 02:23:02,656
Pretty easy to see why someone might think

2479
02:23:02,912 --> 02:23:03,936
That pretty well describes out

2480
02:23:04,192 --> 02:23:04,960
Kyrie just

2481
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:05,728
Just the

2482
02:23:05,984 --> 02:23:09,824
I imagine that he had that diagnosis after the first question is just like

2483
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:16,224
Hey how are you doing today I'm doing great how are you doing today you're the one who should be in here we should switch seats

2484
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:22,624
I've always been

2485
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:23,648
Family

2486
02:23:25,696 --> 02:23:31,328
The Alex descends pretty hard into this defensive

2487
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:34,656
Don't care about people they don't give tips

2488
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:40,800
Little pulp

2489
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:42,848
Their little thing

2490
02:23:44,384 --> 02:23:48,992
Guild lawyers

2491
02:23:52,064 --> 02:23:54,368
All they are is grasping people on average

2492
02:23:54,624 --> 02:23:56,416
Wanting power

2493
02:23:56,928 --> 02:23:57,696
Real power is

2494
02:23:58,208 --> 02:23:59,232
Growing crops

2495
02:24:01,024 --> 02:24:03,840
Carrier children standing up for yourself

2496
02:24:04,096 --> 02:24:04,608
Go home

2497
02:24:05,376 --> 02:24:11,520
But if somebody wants one you want to get your head knocked and you will I'm out looking for

2498
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:19,712
Okay

2499
02:24:20,992 --> 02:24:24,320
That's cool

2500
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:27,392
I mean there's nothing like

2501
02:24:27,648 --> 02:24:33,792
We just got a diagnosis behaviors that

2502
02:24:34,048 --> 02:24:34,816
Indicative

2503
02:24:36,096 --> 02:24:40,448
Easiest way to find out if somebody is a narcissist has to just be like hey you're an RC

2504
02:24:40,704 --> 02:24:44,032
And then there was like if you told me I was a narcissist be like

2505
02:24:44,288 --> 02:24:46,336
I should have been acting like an a****** have a knife

2506
02:24:46,592 --> 02:24:52,736
I don't like that to Alex you be like your narcissist happened I will kill everybody I don't like

2507
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:54,784
Because like that because I'm a Taurus

2508
02:24:55,040 --> 02:25:00,672
Remember times in my life I've had people that I caught Tauruses are stubborn and that puts you in a box

2509
02:25:00,928 --> 02:25:07,072
Because you can either say yes I say no and it proves that you are

2510
02:25:07,584 --> 02:25:12,192
Doesn't work universally

2511
02:25:12,448 --> 02:25:14,240
It is it is not a blanket

2512
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:16,288
But now it is Alex Center

2513
02:25:16,544 --> 02:25:19,104
Alex is not plugging

2514
02:25:19,616 --> 02:25:21,152
Is water peltors

2515
02:25:21,408 --> 02:25:22,432
Although yet

2516
02:25:22,688 --> 02:25:26,016
Well you made the best gravity-fed filter

2517
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:30,624
The competitors are 500

2518
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:36,768
They're as good and sometimes not and others that it's a gorgeous

2519
02:25:39,328 --> 02:25:39,840
The most expensive

2520
02:25:41,376 --> 02:25:45,728
What you find about like crazy

2521
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:48,800
Come out stuff like these

2522
02:25:51,872 --> 02:25:55,456
Percent off

2523
02:25:56,224 --> 02:26:00,320
So we got to sell a lot of these are fun.

2524
02:26:00,576 --> 02:26:01,088
That's going on

2525
02:26:01,344 --> 02:26:07,488
About a million apparently you have 25 million coming in here at you got to say you only making 30 on each wall

2526
02:26:07,744 --> 02:26:08,256
Water filter

2527
02:26:08,512 --> 02:26:10,304
It's amazing how the best

2528
02:26:10,816 --> 02:26:16,960
Gravity filters are also the ones that give me the best profit margin

2529
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:19,776
But also 30%

2530
02:26:21,312 --> 02:26:25,152
So Alex comes back from his break commercial break

2531
02:26:25,408 --> 02:26:25,920
At this

2532
02:26:26,176 --> 02:26:26,944
Made me laugh

2533
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:27,712
So hard

2534
02:26:27,968 --> 02:26:33,856
Your phone calls right now and I've got a piece of news

2535
02:26:35,136 --> 02:26:36,672
Let it show Gigantor

2536
02:26:39,744 --> 02:26:42,816
Yes well that is anime

2537
02:26:43,072 --> 02:26:44,608
I got a big old story

2538
02:26:44,864 --> 02:26:51,008
Shelter

2539
02:26:51,264 --> 02:26:51,776
Coverdog

2540
02:27:02,272 --> 02:27:04,064
Big news out of the Senate

2541
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:07,648
Senator Strom Thurmond goddamnit he's dead

2542
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:13,280
Stelter reliable sources I can only be trusted with small stories

2543
02:27:13,536 --> 02:27:17,888
Big story I will

2544
02:27:18,144 --> 02:27:19,168
Subway

2545
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:24,032
Cuz you got to talk about how long it took him to get into work

2546
02:27:24,288 --> 02:27:25,312
Sometime

2547
02:27:29,408 --> 02:27:33,504
Because they're all looking for leadership when I drive down the road my neighborhood

2548
02:27:35,296 --> 02:27:39,136
Hood

2549
02:27:39,904 --> 02:27:46,048
I'm glad you're outside the virus overalls a hugs and is less than 1% death rate

2550
02:27:46,304 --> 02:27:49,376
Oops

2551
02:27:49,632 --> 02:27:50,656
Misty a break there

2552
02:27:51,168 --> 02:27:52,960
I don't believe you did that

2553
02:27:53,472 --> 02:27:55,520
Admiral Whispering about him at the same time

2554
02:27:55,776 --> 02:28:00,640
Videos of big news

2555
02:28:00,896 --> 02:28:01,664
Sort of like

2556
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:05,760
Fox breaking news

2557
02:28:07,808 --> 02:28:10,880
He had said that he was going to get to this big news in the next second

2558
02:28:11,392 --> 02:28:15,488
So when he comes back he can't do it because they didn't pay them has any

2559
02:28:29,824 --> 02:28:32,384
Look at it

2560
02:28:34,432 --> 02:28:38,016
Okay so this isn't the big

2561
02:28:38,272 --> 02:28:38,784
News

2562
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:44,416
Why earlier when I told you that Alex had said that his people are sending in

2563
02:28:44,672 --> 02:28:45,952
Until about Bill Gaither

2564
02:28:46,464 --> 02:28:50,560
This is the only example of something they could have been what he was talking about

2565
02:28:51,072 --> 02:28:51,584
And stupid

2566
02:28:53,888 --> 02:28:54,912
From 2008

2567
02:28:55,936 --> 02:28:59,008
Where their foundations real name

2568
02:29:01,056 --> 02:29:02,080
Depopulation

2569
02:29:23,584 --> 02:29:29,728
Agreed

2570
02:29:29,984 --> 02:29:36,128
19890 East

2571
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:44,576
Beaumont engaged to run worldwide depopulation and they

2572
02:29:44,832 --> 02:29:45,344
Admit it

2573
02:29:45,856 --> 02:29:48,928
She's giving an intro to another speaker

2574
02:29:49,184 --> 02:29:51,232
Explanation here is that she misspoke

2575
02:29:51,744 --> 02:29:54,816
Gates group is it's not called The Institute for population

2576
02:29:55,072 --> 02:29:57,888
Control it's the institute for population and reproductive health

2577
02:29:58,656 --> 02:30:04,800
This has become a bit of a stupid conspiracy online all based on that little clip apparently initially publicized by Adam Curry

2578
02:30:05,056 --> 02:30:05,568
Socks

2579
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:09,408
The most obvious explanation is that these speaker bespoke but apparently

2580
02:30:09,664 --> 02:30:10,176
That's just what

2581
02:30:10,432 --> 02:30:11,200
She would say

2582
02:30:11,968 --> 02:30:14,016
The internet sleuths have been trying to find evidence

2583
02:30:14,272 --> 02:30:15,808
Is that the name of the gates group is

2584
02:30:16,064 --> 02:30:18,368
Originally called population

2585
02:30:18,624 --> 02:30:20,672
Control Institute for population control

2586
02:30:20,928 --> 02:30:21,952
But literally all evidence

2587
02:30:22,208 --> 02:30:26,048
Except that Clips Institute for population and reproductive health

2588
02:30:26,816 --> 02:30:28,608
In order to make sense of his lack of evidence

2589
02:30:29,632 --> 02:30:30,400
The new claim

2590
02:30:30,656 --> 02:30:35,264
Is it a Gates people completely scrub the internet of any proof that their group was originally called the in

2591
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:41,664
Population control completely

2592
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:48,064
Evidence that the claim they're making is true is only evidence of a complete cover-up of the evidence that would prove their claim to be true

2593
02:30:48,832 --> 02:30:49,600
That's very convenient

2594
02:30:49,856 --> 02:30:55,488
This is why there's really no hope about against this current type of conspiracy thinking

2595
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:57,792
There's a conclusion that they want to arrive at

2596
02:30:58,048 --> 02:31:02,912
Any suggestion of supporting evidence or even the mysterious absence of supporting evidence

2597
02:31:03,168 --> 02:31:04,704
It's good enough to be considered proof

2598
02:31:05,216 --> 02:31:09,824
I'm just not sure there's any way to work with that level of disconnection from reality outside of one-on-one therapy

2599
02:31:11,360 --> 02:31:14,176
I'm not convinced that their education

2600
02:31:14,432 --> 02:31:14,944
Woodpecker

2601
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:16,224
Now there's nothing that

2602
02:31:17,248 --> 02:31:18,784
It seems to added that is what it is

2603
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:21,088
That video is a Smoking Gun

2604
02:31:21,344 --> 02:31:25,184
And even if they were called The Institute for population control

2605
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:25,952
Vindicate

2606
02:31:26,208 --> 02:31:32,352
Depopulation

2607
02:31:32,608 --> 02:31:35,680
Melinda Gates Foundation

2608
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:39,776
So Alex comes back from break

2609
02:31:40,544 --> 02:31:41,056
Again

2610
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:47,456
And this time they got the moves but it's also not what you'd expect but I thought they were going to play some like

2611
02:31:47,712 --> 02:31:49,760
Breaking news Fox musician

2612
02:31:50,016 --> 02:31:52,576
It did it the Law & Order dun dun I wish

2613
02:31:53,088 --> 02:31:59,232
Well this news really deserve some Fanfare it's very sad news but

2614
02:32:14,592 --> 02:32:20,736
Alright

2615
02:32:20,992 --> 02:32:27,136
Quintessential

2616
02:32:27,392 --> 02:32:33,536
Drop bombs on his number without her that's a mismatch

2617
02:32:33,792 --> 02:32:39,168
That is somebody

2618
02:32:39,424 --> 02:32:45,568
The clip and also I don't think we have the copyright rights I don't think we can do that at

2619
02:32:45,824 --> 02:32:46,848
Sirens again

2620
02:32:47,104 --> 02:32:48,128
Put something else in there

2621
02:32:58,112 --> 02:32:58,880
Call boy

2622
02:32:59,904 --> 02:33:01,952
Oh it's an accident China has

2623
02:33:03,488 --> 02:33:06,560
They just so happen to have the testing kits right the same

2624
02:33:07,072 --> 02:33:07,840
Rome

2625
02:33:09,376 --> 02:33:10,912
When the virus

2626
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:15,008
So happen to accidentally

2627
02:33:16,032 --> 02:33:16,544
Hornet

2628
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:17,312
On

2629
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:21,408
The needles that went in your arms

2630
02:33:22,944 --> 02:33:23,712
And give it to you

2631
02:33:24,224 --> 02:33:27,040
Nailtoepia shoes for the massive ship them over in the

2632
02:33:27,552 --> 02:33:28,576
California

2633
02:33:28,832 --> 02:33:29,344
What

2634
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:31,648
New York motor vehicle where they use masks

2635
02:33:34,464 --> 02:33:36,768
Run down Chinese cities where

2636
02:33:38,304 --> 02:33:39,840
Arizona

2637
02:33:40,864 --> 02:33:43,424
But the government doesn't care about the people in the people given up

2638
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:49,056
Cdc's

2639
02:33:53,152 --> 02:33:54,944
Coronavirus

2640
02:33:55,456 --> 02:34:01,600
So I will say that it's true there is a story in arstechnica with the headline Coronavirus

2641
02:34:01,856 --> 02:34:02,880
Coronavirus

2642
02:34:03,392 --> 02:34:03,904
Confirm

2643
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:05,952
There's some important caveats to me

2644
02:34:06,208 --> 02:34:06,976
Make here

2645
02:34:07,232 --> 02:34:13,376
Is that this article is four days old by the time Alex is on are doing is air raid siren

2646
02:34:13,632 --> 02:34:15,168
Stop the presses Level news big news

2647
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:21,824
The second and much more important point is it Alex absolutely is not read this article because you saying has literally no

2648
02:34:22,336 --> 02:34:23,104
To do the content.

2649
02:34:23,616 --> 02:34:24,128
Like this is

2650
02:34:24,384 --> 02:34:27,968
This is basically Moonraker book vs. movie territory

2651
02:34:28,224 --> 02:34:31,808
Do you think of the Chinese that these tainted test and there was an intentional attack

2652
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:38,464
However this article has no relation to anything China did is entirely about protocols not being followed within the seed

2653
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:41,280
ABC and their development of a coronavirus test

2654
02:34:41,536 --> 02:34:45,120
This was our government being sloppy not the Chinese attacking us

2655
02:34:45,632 --> 02:34:46,400
From the article

2656
02:34:46,656 --> 02:34:47,168
Quote

2657
02:34:47,424 --> 02:34:50,752
Now according to the investigation results reported by the New York Times

2658
02:34:51,008 --> 02:34:55,616
Federal officials confirm that sloppy laboratory practices at 23 CDC lab

2659
02:34:55,872 --> 02:34:58,944
Involved in the test creation lead to contamination of the test

2660
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:00,736
And their uninterpretable results

2661
02:35:01,504 --> 02:35:05,344
There's no indication in this article that the contamination led to anyone being infected

2662
02:35:05,856 --> 02:35:09,440
Guess what the results that were gathered from the tests were inconclusive in on music

2663
02:35:10,464 --> 02:35:16,608
If you want to use this story and shine some light on the need for better practices and controls within the CDC by all means

2664
02:35:16,864 --> 02:35:17,376
Go ahead

2665
02:35:17,888 --> 02:35:23,008
However what Alex is doing this completely fabricating a story about China putting coronavirus on test needles

2666
02:35:23,264 --> 02:35:28,640
And sending them here to infect people which is essentially accusing a sovereign state of a crime that requires a declaration

2667
02:35:28,896 --> 02:35:29,408
In a war

2668
02:35:29,664 --> 02:35:35,552
He's playing with fire and he's all just making it up because he's either unwilling or unable to read anything past the headline

2669
02:35:36,064 --> 02:35:37,088
It's very disgraceful

2670
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:38,112
You should you should

2671
02:35:38,368 --> 02:35:41,696
Would have to at least have the word China in the art

2672
02:35:42,976 --> 02:35:44,256
To make that ball.

2673
02:35:44,512 --> 02:35:46,048
Lie about it

2674
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:48,352
Even if in the article is just like

2675
02:35:48,864 --> 02:35:50,656
We it's not from China

2676
02:35:50,912 --> 02:35:55,776
Play even then at least China would be involved in the article instead of it being purely

2677
02:35:56,032 --> 02:36:01,152
The CDC made some tests and they were contaminated

2678
02:36:01,664 --> 02:36:06,784
But brutal that's really bad

2679
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:09,344
What 2 oz of lying about it

2680
02:36:09,856 --> 02:36:11,136
So this is our last clip

2681
02:36:12,672 --> 02:36:16,512
And what ends up happening here is Alex is saying that Bill Gates

2682
02:36:17,024 --> 02:36:19,072
Is running a satanic conspiracy

2683
02:36:20,096 --> 02:36:23,168
I meant h a little flight of fancy that I think might be blessed

2684
02:36:23,424 --> 02:36:26,240
Okay

2685
02:36:26,752 --> 02:36:28,544
We're in bad shape

2686
02:36:31,360 --> 02:36:34,432
PowerForce on Earth stuff

2687
02:36:34,944 --> 02:36:37,248
You and your family going to do

2688
02:36:39,296 --> 02:36:40,064
Because you want to kill you

2689
02:36:44,928 --> 02:36:46,720
Populator

2690
02:36:47,232 --> 02:36:48,000
What then

2691
02:36:49,024 --> 02:36:50,048
Because he wants to save it

2692
02:36:51,584 --> 02:36:52,096
They have

2693
02:36:52,352 --> 02:36:53,632
The metaphysical

2694
02:36:53,888 --> 02:36:55,424
The notice similar to Legal

2695
02:36:56,448 --> 02:36:57,216
Is it illegal

2696
02:36:58,496 --> 02:36:59,520
The notice Fair

2697
02:37:00,032 --> 02:37:01,056
The martial law

2698
02:37:04,384 --> 02:37:05,920
Then you can do whatever you want

2699
02:37:06,432 --> 02:37:07,712
The city council has two weeks

2700
02:37:07,968 --> 02:37:09,504
To hold hearings about the

2701
02:37:21,792 --> 02:37:22,304
What

2702
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:30,752
Okay I'll bring them to hate themselves renovate America

2703
02:37:31,008 --> 02:37:32,288
Behavior children

2704
02:37:35,872 --> 02:37:37,152
I think that this is

2705
02:37:37,408 --> 02:37:39,456
Maybe maybe Alex just watch

2706
02:37:39,712 --> 02:37:40,224
Lost

2707
02:37:41,248 --> 02:37:47,392
There's some sort of connection with Jacob and the man in Black's relationship that he's describing here with God in the Dead

2708
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:49,184
I don't know man

2709
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:53,024
That seems like a shity god to worship

2710
02:37:53,280 --> 02:37:56,096
The guy who's hanging out with the devil in the devil's like a

2711
02:37:56,608 --> 02:37:58,656
Can I kill him in the Godlike

2712
02:37:59,168 --> 02:38:05,312
Can I trick him into killing each other

2713
02:38:05,568 --> 02:38:11,712
Call Jobe

2714
02:38:11,968 --> 02:38:13,760
Devil or was

2715
02:38:14,016 --> 02:38:16,832
I'm not smoking while

2716
02:38:17,088 --> 02:38:18,112
Who cares

2717
02:38:18,368 --> 02:38:19,392
But yeah I mean

2718
02:38:19,648 --> 02:38:21,184
Look I mean if God knows

2719
02:38:21,696 --> 02:38:23,488
Just how tricky the definitely

2720
02:38:24,256 --> 02:38:30,400
And he's like by all means you can't

2721
02:38:30,656 --> 02:38:32,192
Reckless

2722
02:38:32,448 --> 02:38:38,592
Criticizing Lady Gaga's not God that he created it for being a sitter God to then give us

2723
02:38:38,848 --> 02:38:41,152
I understand

2724
02:38:41,408 --> 02:38:44,224
Free will and you have to choose

2725
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:46,016
Like if some other person

2726
02:38:46,528 --> 02:38:47,040
Is trying to

2727
02:38:47,296 --> 02:38:47,808
To trick you

2728
02:38:48,064 --> 02:38:49,856
Sure but if it's a supernatural being

2729
02:38:50,112 --> 02:38:56,256
It's not on you I don't get why people get blamed for s*** that Loki trick them into do

2730
02:38:57,536 --> 02:38:59,328
I don't know

2731
02:38:59,584 --> 02:39:03,936
Got you lose the point here is that Alex's batch

2732
02:39:04,448 --> 02:39:05,216
I think

2733
02:39:05,728 --> 02:39:06,240
Ike

2734
02:39:06,496 --> 02:39:07,776
I don't know

2735
02:39:09,568 --> 02:39:14,432
Obviously there is there is a piece of this they could be overly dramatic

2736
02:39:16,224 --> 02:39:19,040
But I don't know if I've ever heard him talking about like

2737
02:39:19,296 --> 02:39:21,088
I'm recording my last episode

2738
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:26,208
I meant breaking down in this this way or he's he's discussing his career in hindsight

2739
02:39:27,744 --> 02:39:29,024
I don't know man

2740
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:30,816
I feel like

2741
02:39:31,072 --> 02:39:31,584
Like really

2742
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:32,608
Coming up to it

2743
02:39:32,864 --> 02:39:39,008
Yeah but that I could look stupid in hindsight but the way this feels it does

2744
02:39:39,264 --> 02:39:40,288
It does not feel like

2745
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:41,824
Someone who's

2746
02:39:42,336 --> 02:39:43,872
Just trying to f*** around

2747
02:39:44,128 --> 02:39:46,176
It feels like someone who's

2748
02:39:46,432 --> 02:39:47,200
Trying to m

2749
02:39:47,712 --> 02:39:53,856
Well what it feels like to me is somebody whose emotional regulation is tied directly to their sense of self esteem

2750
02:39:54,112 --> 02:39:55,648
That's what it feels like to me

2751
02:39:55,904 --> 02:39:59,488
I don't think he's feeling good right now about his self-esteem

2752
02:40:00,256 --> 02:40:05,376
True and I think that's bleeding into other things that's my that's my personal opinion I'm not a doctor

2753
02:40:05,888 --> 02:40:09,216
I don't even pretend to be an

2754
02:40:09,728 --> 02:40:11,264
No I wish I could I think

2755
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:13,824
Know the occupants to require education

2756
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:15,616
Not like us movies other

2757
02:40:15,872 --> 02:40:16,640
Ding dong

2758
02:40:17,152 --> 02:40:19,200
I don't know I think

2759
02:40:19,712 --> 02:40:22,784
My feeling is we have a really interesting next week ahead of

2760
02:40:23,808 --> 02:40:25,088
I will say I

2761
02:40:25,344 --> 02:40:27,904
I'm not looking for you know what I f******

2762
02:40:28,416 --> 02:40:30,720
Yeah it does do his last show

2763
02:40:30,976 --> 02:40:31,488
I can't

2764
02:40:31,744 --> 02:40:33,536
Wait to tear that apart

2765
02:40:34,304 --> 02:40:40,448
God when he goes over his record that's going to be your f****** Superbowl

2766
02:40:40,704 --> 02:40:42,496
You're going to have how many

2767
02:40:42,752 --> 02:40:43,264
Like

2768
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:44,032
I think

2769
02:40:44,288 --> 02:40:48,384
The opportunity to Legend kill is really excited

2770
02:40:48,896 --> 02:40:52,736
If he wants to lay bare what is vinyl messages

2771
02:40:52,992 --> 02:40:55,808
I can't imagine something more exciting than deconstructing that

2772
02:40:56,064 --> 02:40:59,392
So hopefully he does do that but I have a sense it'll be under welding

2773
02:40:59,904 --> 02:41:06,048
I'll be we'll see back next week but until then Jordan we have website

2774

2778
02:41:19,616 --> 02:41:21,152
Go to bed Jordan in that knowledge

2779
02:41:21,408 --> 02:41:27,552
