Air Jordan 5 swetik

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for this knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

5
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,304
The altar of Celine and talk a little bit about Alex

6
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,584
Text June

7
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,680
What's up

8
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,448
What's playing

9
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,520
Is a little bit if he kind of

10
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,800
I'm not proud of this

11
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:20,128
But I decided to order Papa

12
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,968
Papa John's

13
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,016
Curious

14
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,576
Maybe a decade probably haven't had Papa John's

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,648
Builders memories of the garlic sauce

16
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,672
Emily

17
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:37,280
I don't I have an Edward memories but I don't like Eminem

18
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:43,168
I certainly don't like the man but a pizza that would be around and Shady places

19
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,728
Easter Pizza

20
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264
Yeah and I did garlic sauce

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,032
It just like

22
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,080
It sticks out in your mind

23
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,360
What's up

24
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,432
Nothing nothing lived up

25
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,712
To know

26
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
The Beatles terrible

27
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,808
Imagine no I mean Chris was okay

28
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,392
The garlic sauce was not as good as I remember the garlic butter

29
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
When I was growing up

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,744
The Pizza Hut buffet was the

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
Height

32
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,072
Diamond that's the best

33
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,376
Pizza Hut got rid of the buffet

34
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,776
Why why even go KFC had a buffet for a while

35
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:26,176
Every Friday Pizza Hut

36
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,480
Didn't have the

37
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,040
Little bit later we had to CiCi's Pizza

38
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:37,440
Columbia Focus

39
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,976
See how many

40
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,256
Pizzas and cinnamon rolls

41
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,560
That's fine

42
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,840
Pizza Hut buffet because

43
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,888
It's gone in your memory your kind of like

44
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,216
That was pretty great remember CiCi's Pizza

45
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,800
Garbage while you were there when you were old when you were a kid

46
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,616
Garbage do you think that because it's still excessive

47
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:00,736
You could actually go revisit it order a Pizza Hut pizza

48
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
Probably

49
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,368
Papa John's

50
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,184
Terrible

51
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,976
Play brakes parties

52
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,024
Affirming that

53
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,864
What's up

54
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,192
Dan is I don't know if

55
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
Me talk about

56
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,544
This before but there was a live-action Cowboy Bebop

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
Oh yeah yeah

58
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,872
Came out and I've watched all of it

59
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408
It is a bright spot

60
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,736
John Cho as spike is incredible

61
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,600
Everything else is kind of so-so Yoko kanno

62
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,184
Upton another level

63
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:48,352
He started as one of the parents guide

64
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:53,984
Right holyshit I think he started there and then he went to Harold and Kumar and then

65
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
Really good act

66
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,848
Flash Forward show

67
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,896
It was a disaster

68
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,968
But the problem with it and the reason that the whole show is garbage

69
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,320
Is because they did my man vicious and Julia dirty

70
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
Oh no

71
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
In this show

72
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,303
Those are characters in the original show you meet Julia only at the very end and she's

73
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,119
In the first time you made her cuz she's the like

74
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:25,983
Long lost love interest The One That Got Away in a horrible death

75
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
Incident kindest

76
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,775
Situation behind

77
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
And then she shows up

78
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:34,431
Writing a car getting chased by bad guys and then firing back and then

79
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,991
A badass Thelma and Louise instantly

80
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
You love Julie

81
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,063
In the show she's like

82
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:46,719
Videos and then vicious vicious is the shark from Jaws you only see him when someone's about

83
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,511
Get their head cut off

84
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,327
In the show

85
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:56,191
He's like I'm going to help you do

86
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,751
I'm sorry

87
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
Okay

88
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,359
If you like I'm not going to watch it based on

89
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:09,247
Alright

90
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:13,343
This is an episode of June 30th and July 1st

91
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,367

00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,647
Alright

93
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,463
This is a Monumental episode I must say

94
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
Because

95
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,559
A wrench gets thrown into the gears

96
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
As it were

97
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,399
Some things that we've been tracking in the past

98
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
We may have been

99
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,495
A little wrong about something

100
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,311
And we will find out about that here today but

101
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,103

Right

113
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,943
Triggered an assassin or something

114
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,247
But that's a code word

115
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:17,343
The sleeper agent somewhere you have to read the first letter of each

116
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:22,719
The names in order to get the actual message I'm very worried sometimes people send me fairy

117
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
Cryptic names

118

AO3

130
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,911
Three years after Y2K

131
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447
We started to

132
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,519
Beginning of the episode

133
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,311
Videos going to have which is

134
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
Really bizarre

135
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,071
Constable

136
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,471
You like deliver summonses and stuff like I think you can do traffic stops

137
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,567
If you're a constable think so yeah I think I could give people tickets in Jackson

138
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,639
At least

139
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,199
Yes okay good so Alex's

140
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,735
Cameraman Mike Hansen

141
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,319
He's the guy who went along with

142
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
Bohemian Grove

143
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,415
Alex is a long time

144
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,975
Buddy and noted weirdo

145
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Apparently

146
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279
He

147
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:07,167
Is running a giant firework stand in order to fund his run for constable

148
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,959
And apparently he also has a

149
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,519
A little bit of a history of failing to run for offices

150
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
In the past

151
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,359
Fancy himself a bit of a political

152
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,663
I also ran

153
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
What's strange about that

154
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
Is that

155
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:27,391
Constable being a surly British word I don't think there's a more American thing you can do than run a fire

156
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Work stand

157
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,439
Running to become a cop

158
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,023
That's the most of the Declaration of Independence

159
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,863
It's not there fireworks in someone else's

160
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
I think

161
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,751
Just have a job at this firework stands

162
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,591
The story that Mike is going to come on until

163
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
Is that

164
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,431
He heard some noises in the night

165
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,807
Not sure

166
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:00,927
Voices in the night he thought it was like an animal or something

167
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,559
A red underwear and found people robbing

168
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:12,703
Replace the three of them at gunpoint and then got the police to come and they arrested him

169
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,239
Wowhead so

170
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:20,895
They're thrilled cuz this is good guy with a gun Second Amendment

171
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,919
Constable

172
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,943
Play Bay

173
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,527
It might be spawn Khan for his confer

174
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
Yeah

175
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,927
It's so boring interview and like a 2 tells the story

176
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:39,327
And guess what he comes back like 2 days later and tells the same story

177
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,655
Ridiculous it is it's a good story

178
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,983
Got some news out of the UK

179
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,567
Hear from

180
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
Outlet called the Scott

181
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871

Basically they're all dancing around naked

189
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,839
I failed to find

190
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,631
Evidence of this

191
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:52,799
Does grand religion at this point is definitely is lost

192
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,919
In the UK it's probably Harry Potter ism

193
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,247
I just want to say and I want to get this out there okay

194
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
Dancing around naked

195
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
Is a long way from an orgy

196
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:11,487
Okay now it's not as far away from an orgy is dancing around with your clothes on sure but it is still farther away

197
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,279
Aventador J

198
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,095
Yeah that there couple steps

199
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,911
Still requires

200
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:25,311
Alex doesn't deal with that and whatever there's a lot of animals that are going missing

201
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,359
Have a citation on any of this I think it's just

202
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,663
Stuff sort of satanic panic

203
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
Some nonsense sounds like it

204
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,039
Alex has a commercial that he plays on the show that I found

205
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
A little out of place

206
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
I'll see if you can tell why

207
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,439
Financial

208
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
What

209
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:10,111
Invest in the Euro says the most nationalist man has ever been

210
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:16,511
Invested the Euro guy who thinks the EU is evil

211
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:22,911
I think it's going to go you know that you could be shorting it right that would be ideologically consistent you be like

212
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,215
Anti Soros

213
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:30,847
Right there recommend

214
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,383
Poised to rise

215
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,015
Yeah I thought that was very very strange

216
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
You see have like

217
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:45,183
Herb companies that are trying to save the Christian Remnant in America

218
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
Weird

219
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,047
Thing or the weird box or whatever the f*** that guy

220
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
Freqbox

221
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,959
Because you're selling Euros what is going on

222
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
This is ridiculous

223
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:04,639
I can't imagine somebody hearing a commercial from a Financial Group about buying or selling stock

224
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
Talking thinking

225
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
Well obviously they want me to make

226
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:12,575
Money I better call and get more info

227
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,159
Strangers making life. My best interest in mind

228
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:22,303
Alex gets his call from a guy they're discussing

229
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
Context

230
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:28,703
Of the night before the caller Alex I believe both of them

231
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,519
I've seen a documentary about like ancient

232
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
So

233
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,847
Sparta is on the mind

234
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,919
And this is where we jump

235
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,479
On all of our military vehicles

236
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,575
Prior we now have like a chef

237
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,623
And this is something I've noticed

238
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,671
Shields of

239
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
Tyrell

240
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,327
And I'm really concerned as to why we brought the

241
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,959
I'm sorry

242
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
Now

243
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,159
Watch out that's what you think

244
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,055
Cover up they've been trying to cover up that homosexual death called for years

245
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,335
Oh my God

246
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:43,455
The colors making an interesting association between the military and the Greek letter lamp.

247
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,247
But I think this caller is a little

248
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,295
Simplistic Bob just like ice from the

249
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
The Shield or whatever

250
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:54,975
If you look into it you'll find a bunch of fraternities and sororities that are military in nature that use the letter Lambda in

251
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,535
Her name is not the first letter like

252
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,631
In the case of Kappa Lambda Chi they still refer to themselves as Lampton

253
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,519
The first woman's military sorority is Lambda beta Alpha and they even have a side organization

254
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,055
Four family members in ROTC

255
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
Sea Cadets called

256
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,359
The orchids of Lambda

257
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,943
The letter Lambda is been adopted by military throughout West

258
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,271
Turn history largely because it was the symbol that was on the shield of the spark

259
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
Not of all

260
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Greek

261
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,367
By the other city-states

262
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,671
I had different letters or

263
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
Symbols

264
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,487
And the Spartans had this because it was

265
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
Capital city

266
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
I'll ask Damien

267
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:36,959
The story of the Battle of Thermopylae and b302 held back the Persian army

268
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Xerxes

269
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
They've become

270
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
The image of efficient

271
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,567
Successful military force

272
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:48,735
There's a lot of aspects to the story where the details are B fudge but I'm not here to take away any of the

273
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
Leonidas

274
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Let him have it

275
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,623
Either way the letter Lambda at

276
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,951
Is it safe is very powerful

277
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,023
That's what the hours for around the shields legitness

278
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,071
The weather lambdas had a particular

279
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
Significant ever since

280
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,375
Like throughout West

281
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,679
Western history in our military uses the letter 26

282
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
Signify

283
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,031
Company Vehicles belong to depending on the direction that the

284
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,335
Llr the Lambos they say bud

285
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,943
I think Alex might have a slightly Elementary understanding of Sparta

286
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,807
Culture but if his problems with them are that they were a homosexual death call to head slave

287
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,343
You probably wouldn't like Athens

288
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,647
Or any Greek city-state much more

289
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,415
Yeah that was all

290
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:35,071
The great the Great Hero Achilles only agrees to re-enter the Trojan War after Hector kills his lover petropolis

291
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,607
And they were videos

292
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,423
In the theban Army there were 150

293
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,751
The gay male couples who formed the sacred band of Thebes

294
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,287
And the theban Army actually

295
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,871
Defeated Sparta Sparta in the battles of Takara

296
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,919
Andaluca look at Tura

297
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,991
And in the process they actually unseated Sparta is the Dominus

298
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
Force in Greece

299
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,575
There were many aspects of homosexual

300
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:01,439
Chips in ancient Greece

301
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
Read to them at all

302
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:07,583
Being a death cult I'm not sure what Alex means by that so I don't know how to respond

303
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,399
They were cultured deprioritized military strength

304
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
Text but I don't know if that make

305
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Make some a death call

306
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,567
And that's for the slavery thing Sparta definitely wasn't the only city-state doing that s***

307
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,103
They pretty much all day

308
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
Including Athen

309
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
I think of history and

310
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,247
This case in particular is just a Pie Pop Culture

311
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,551
Things you see in like movies or TV shows

312
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
Cuz what he saying is just dumb

313
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
Yeah but not track

314
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
88

315
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
Even me

316
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
Very less

317
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Those Greek

318
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
City-states

319
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
They weren't like

320
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,887
Grease they didn't get along very well

321
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,959
There was a period of tension

322
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Home

323
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
Anyway

324
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,775
Alex

325
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,823
Moves on from wax

326
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,383
Philosophical about Greek

327
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
History

328
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
Right now

329
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,759
In 2021 we know

330
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
For snacks

331
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,647
Vaccine

332
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,927
A 2000

333
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
Okay

334
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,423
Just doing this over and over and over again it's always this

335
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
Wow

336
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
20 years

337
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,031
20 years this is your life

338
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,823
For Alex would be

339
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,639
Just the same two people being like

340
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:31,039
This is the same clip in 2003 but you got in 2005 completely different

341
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,831
Contact never really actually comes

342
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
The past

343
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:40,255
Oh Lord Fletcher's before his life his eyes before he dies and it's just the same flavor

344
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,815
Over and over

345
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,399
Metaphorically that

346
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,215
So Alex gets another call

347
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
Good better call

348
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,775
On the show which is fun

349
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Except for the X

350
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
Four callers

351
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
Cuz they suck

352
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,895
Particularly this guy who's a bit homophobic

353
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,319
Tell you what's going on up here I'm in Cincinnati Ohio

354
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,855
And everyday is a newspaper.

355
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,647
Newspaper publisher inquire

356
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,231
Change it to the Bentley hell on Earth reported everyday

357
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,023
Supreme Court upholds

358
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,839

Talk about

363
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,495
How many homosexual couples

364
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,079
Raising children

365
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,599
Alabama

366
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
Holyshit

367
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:45,535
So yeah I think I've made note in a previous episode they like for a long time Alex's had this bizarre theory about there being a

368
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
Industry

369
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,143
Run by the homosexuals to take straight people's children

370
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,679
By way of CPS

371
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
Which is

372
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
Is gross

373
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,615
It's it's

374
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
Angry

375
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
Yeah I mean

376
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,711
The craziest part of that is

377
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
You know you were

378
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:09,599
Remember 2003 and that kind of homophobia was commonplace you know and it wasn't even just

379
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,647
Tacitly

380
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:18,047
I permitted you know Obama famously is like I'm evolving on gay marriage you know like that kind of thing

381
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,351
Much different just ate

382
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
18 years ago

383
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
It's true

384
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
It's true I think

385
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,751
Yeah I think there's a difference between

386
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,871
Blatant homophobia are even active

387
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
Maybe people didn't

388
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,199
Examine well

389
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
I am

390
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,991
Political

391
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271
Driven homophobia

392
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
And I think the I think the

393
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
See a good deal of the ladder

394
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,647
Here on Alex's show

395
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
This color sucks

396
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,023
And another color which is

397
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
If this is real interesting

398
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,399
They came out in 2000

399
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,935
Free movie

400
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
Is traveling

401
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:02,335
New York

402
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
Couple things

403
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,431
Preview for a movie coming out called

404
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,479
Extraordinary Jen

405
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
Full moon

406
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,831
Sean Connery thing

407
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
About it

408
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,280
They finally ran the long enough cookware

409
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,560
Introduce

410
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
League of the

411
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:28,448
Extraordinary Gentlemen are

412
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,472
What does that mean

413
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,824
That was one of them

414
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
Captain Nemo

415
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
Dr. Jekyll

416
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,480
You know it's like a war

417
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
These are news

418
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Superheroes

419
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,832
They're going to save the world

420
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
What

421
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
Just now

422
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:55,840
Wait you pointed out that it was a comic book League of Extraordinary Gentlemen comic book

423
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,400
1999

424
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:04,032
The problem with the interpretation is being given is that the characters in the movie aren't all villains

425
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:08,128
41 the character played by Sean Connery Alan Quartermaine is not a villain

426
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,664
Novels that he's featured in

427
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,504
Unless you look back through very assertive evolve prism of

428
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,904
Colonialist might not have been the intention of

429
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,768
Outside or type what a big game hunter and adventurer

430
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,304
Many people eventually noted that

431
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,840
He's one of the foundational influences

432
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,400
Character of Indiana Jones who's definitely not mint

433
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,424
To be a villain although

434
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
Doesn't schedule

435
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:39,360
Captain Nemo also in the villain unless you think the people of non-european Heritage are automatically evil

436
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,200
You know was a member of The Avengers who are crime Fighters

437
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:48,320
Kind of her deal the invisible-man wasn't the great dude and mr. Hyde certainly got up to no good but bi

438
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:54,720
Idea that these were literally like all villains isn't that there was a literary figures from. Of time they're all extraordinaire

439
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,024
A banded together to fight bad guys

440
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,584
It's kind of their whole thing

441
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,472
The movie itself has a bit of a sloppy re-creation with the inclusion of Tom Sawyer as a secret service agent

442
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,288
Dorian Gray is brought in as a villain

443
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:12,128
Yeah but the real villain is Moriarty is the arch-nemesis of

444
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,408
Of Sherlock Holmes

445
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,224
The bad guy is the big bad guy for Sherlock Holmes

446
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,296
Yeah this isn't the movie about making the villains into Heroes

447
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,368
It's just that really flawed interpretation of this trailer

448
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,392
The color saw

449
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,440
But man I'm so excited

450
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,464
About Alex

451
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
Text banking there devil worshippers

452
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
I'm at what

453
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,304
I want to hear the review

454
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,864
I want to hear that review

455
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:39,008
That's so funny that he's the inspiration for Indiana Jones cuz you have that same thing now we're like

456
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,544
You you look back

457
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,312
On

458
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:46,688
It belongs in a museum and you're like yeah belongs in a museum and then as you evolve 20 years later you like

459
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
No

460
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:52,832
Repatriated

461
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
Sure

462
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,928
Another thing about that too is that

463
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:03,328
Sean Connery plays Alan Quartermaine news an inspiration

464
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:08,960
It's all coming together turn down office

465
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
Hello

466
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:18,432
That guy lot of money left on the table lot of money

467
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,736
Last year and this was this was traveling

468
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,272
We certainly more troubling than

469
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
Mike and his firework

470
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,880
I mean this is Outta control

471
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,816
Gerstacker

472
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,784
Aurora

473
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,680
I'm not going to cover this too much

474
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,752
Because this is actually the story of a really nasty divorce

475
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:21,408
From the information I can gather it's a situation where there was this divorce going on as a part of that there was a pretty messy

476
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,200
Custody dispute

477
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,504
I don't want to

478
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,088
Do you know try and delve into this parsley because you

479
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,880
Cases of domestic issues like this

480
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,672
It's really difficult to get a full sense

481
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,232
Of exactly what's going on from the outside

482
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:40,352
Haven't been said I can find no evidence of his neighbor is getting into trouble for arriving

483
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,656
Their children taken away because they wouldn't snitch on

484
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,752
I did find some interesting stuff and trying to learn more about this case

485
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,336
The first thing that I found was that stored in a blog up

486
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,896
Trying to get his child back title the kidnapped

487
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,200
Sun. Blogspot.com

488
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,504
I don't know what was up on that side

489
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,832
Because the earliest snapshot in the way-back machine is from when he had already

490
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,368
Change the title of the blog

491
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,416
Helping me reconcile

492
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,512
There's only one post on there from April 20th 2050

493
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
It starts quote

494
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:13,632
I apologize for my previous post on this blog which I hereby retract

495
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
In total

496
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,728
I was wrong to try to force the issue I should have made it my goal

497
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,776
From the beginning to reconcile this matter private

498
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,568
I would guess it Wrecker

499
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,360
Compiling the matter privately wouldn't

500
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,664
Involve going on Alex's show to push a crank

501
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,456
Conspiracy about your divorce that Alex

502
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,784
Used to fuel his own conspiracy theories about how the job protect

503
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,064
Service Steel

504
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,112
People's children to give them to homosexual couple

505
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,928
Autumn mostly unrelated note

506
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:41,024
I was able to find a transcript of public hearing being held by the Travis County

507
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,048
Commissioner's Court

508
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,840
In July 2000

509
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
7

510
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
The main piece of business was about it

511
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,680
Easement on a lot

512
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,216
Near Westlake Hyland

513
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,752
After that

514
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,544
There was no opportunity for open Quest

515
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:53,824
And even came

516
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,848
Stuart gerstacker

517
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,664
He came in hot

518
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,688
Quote

519
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:01,504
I come in peace and humbly

520
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,392
Fatshark five-star Stars

521
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,488
I come in peace and humbly invoke the blessings of almighty God

522
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,304
I've come to deliver a message of peace and New Hope

523
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,120
I forgive you I love you and I want you to be happy

524
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:22,496
You still have to repent your sins and make restitution from what you've stolen from me and others in the community

525
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,312
And I'm going to continue to come down and exposing the truth

526
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,640
Your continued presence is an Abomination against this land

527
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:32,224
We all know that Margaret Gomez stole her seat from Mike Hansen

528
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,552
I was there on Election night when the computers are repeatedly crashed

529
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,344
Program didn't do vote tallies

530
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,720
Pop sounds like 20/20 familiar what side sorry people you are to allow these abuses think

531
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
Continue

532
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
So I guess

533
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,584
At this point my cancer dad moved on from losing the election

534
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,888
Constable in 2003 to losing an election

535
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,448
The County Commissioners Board of 2007

536
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
Switches

537
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:57,824
Surprising maybe progress I do appreciate I come in peace

538
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,872
Beating the opening line

539
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,432
For a few sentences later to wind up with

540
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,224
I think you're an abomination

541
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,064
That might be a little bit less peaceful quote

542
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,136
Your actions are an abomination in the eyes of God and man

543
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:17,792
You'll become onuris to the people because of your continued abuses I now declare a state of emergency caused by the breakdown

544
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,584
Sound of lawful power in Travis County

545
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:25,984
Emergency can only properly be rectified by the people of Texas acting independently in our Sovereign capacity

546
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:31,616
I'm so Stewart declared a state of emergency in Travis County back in 2000

547
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,944
I'm surprised I didn't make the news

548
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:39,552
It's like Undeclared did he ever take the smell might still be active

549
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,880
Isn't that kind of guy

550
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,440
Who comes in with problems without solution

551
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,976
Call God quotes

552
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:53,120
The correct this intolerable situation I'm taking this opportunity to announce the new independent state Gathering

553
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:59,776
Exactly one year from today on the eve of July 4th 2008 we the people are going to peacefully surround the Texas

554
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
Capitol building

555
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,152
And our Travis County Courthouse complex and we're going to camp out and have a huge party

556
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:09,248
There will be large and it will be large and I'll be nothing like you've ever seen

557
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,064
And it will not end until all of you have gone away

558
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,880
Then we the people will constitute a new Republic

559
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,672
Together we the people will pee

560
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,208
Peacefully shake off these tyrants

561
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,280
Give the world in Independence Day that will not ever be forgotten

562
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,888
It's so awesome to cuz in the transcript you use either the board

563
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,936
Commissioner board response

564
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:32,800
Yeah and it was like are we invited to this party

565
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:36,384
That is a good response

566
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,176
And I'm not going to take seriously anything is

567
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,992
Same as interview with Alex and I think it's best we just move along

568
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,528
Yamin.

569
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,320
No that's all that's a lot of hurt

570
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,880
A lot of hurt man but I

571
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,952
I think I think you can look at that

572
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:50,976
County commissioner

573
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
No transcript

574
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,280
Activity response

575
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,560
Getting get a good

576
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,608
Make sense of the picture

577
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,400
You can see us blog that he had

578
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,216
We just trying to say that his wife kidnapped his son and then

579
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,752
Opposed begging

580
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,080
For reconciliation and apologizing

581
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,104
Yeah

582
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,128
Not worth it

583
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,480
So we'll move on

584
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,296
Update

585
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:20,928
From a caller who called in a couple episodes back

586
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,976
Good afternoon.

587
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
Stomach called

588
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,536
I told you

589
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
State of my tiger cub

590
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,888
Siberian tiger

591
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,448
Record after that

592
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,008
The doors were locked

593
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:36,800
Doors

594
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,408
Report deer

595
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
Court dates

596
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,992
Or the decision

597
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,040
The judges are making Oran

598
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:50,112
Or before a full moon or new moon

599
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,696
Daughter doing witchcraft

600
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,768
The first people

601
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,072
Hollywood

602
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:07,008
It's a little confusing to the guy but his Tigers taken away

603
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
Doing witchcraft

604
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,336
Step because of the Moon

605
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,616
Obviously

606
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,432
If it's happening on a full moon or the new moon

607
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:18,528
And I don't mean like you you would look at this and Alex probably want to be like

608
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:24,928
All right look I don't know what you're thinking here that the new moon means that they're doing witchcraft

609
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,488
Harry Potter on the solstice mean something

610
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:30,048
So he can't he has no leg to stand on here

611
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,840
Too far the new moon

612
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,144
Harry Potter

613
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,240
Anyway this guy witchcraft

614
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,568
Jordan ways tigers

615
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,640
Don't think that the judge also needs witchcraft

616
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,664
When he can just

617
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,456
Sign an order

618
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:53,856
Yeah I think it's really great though being able to go back and listen to these episodes and see stories developing with collars

619
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,928
Call Annie give updates

620
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:03,328
You realize colors anymore in the in the modern-day Carlos

621
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,632
Do two calls in all the time but not really

622
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:08,192
There's no story to it he's just mad about various

623
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,728
Geopolitical things

624
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,568
This is much more fun of switchgrass

625
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:18,176
Is a little bit like where are they now every you every few weeks yet so the witchcraft

626
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,712
Baby gets Alex

627
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,760
Send to the sort of mood or he wants to talk about devils

628
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
Stuff

629
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,344
I don't know what you're talkin

630
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,112
About here

631
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:37,888
Allure.com

632
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,656
Cam

633
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,752
Women in in

634
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,336
Children

635
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,640
Terraria

636
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:41,120
Patience

637
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:44,960
Delete all of the couch all the way up

638
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
What now

639
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,896
Dying

640
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,112
I guess

641
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:05,184
They covered up the story really well cuz I

642
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:12,096
I feel like there's no way I would not have known about the great swath of women without Hearts being dug up

643
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:12,864
Across Europe

644
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:19,264
Going back to the conservative leadership in France the government

645
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,800
Everybody getting taken down

646
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,824
Constable

647
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
Left and right

648
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,152
Themes

649
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,224
I feel like we would suck if this were something

650
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,248
And I was a big

651
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
Deal

652
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:30,784
Or happened

653
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,576
Arabi song

654
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,464
Memory of it I couldn't find anybody

655
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,864
Like reports November emaciated people showing up

656
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,936
Saying they were in a castle with demons

657
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,216
No no

658
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:54,080
I I don't know I don't know if anybody has a lead on this I'd be willing to

659
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,384
The Explorer it but I couldn't find anything

660
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,712
Sometimes you really do think maybe this is just a recurring

661
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,736
Dream Alex

662
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:07,136
You know and it's it has nothing to do with anything in real life when we just present or could be a chain email or something like that

663
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:10,720
Hell yeah it's it that it doesn't have to be strictly connected

664
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,256
Did to reality

665
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,304
So here's where

666
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,072
I have

667
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,376
Eat a little crow

668
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,144
Okay

669
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,472
We've been speculating

670
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,240
About

671
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
Alex

672
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,800
Having a different

673
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,824
Backstory

674
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,872
About satanism

675
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,688
In 2003 that he doesn't present

676
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,736
That might not be at

677
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,192
Rock and roll crowd

678
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,984
Coronavirus

679
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,832
Beautiful Darkness

680
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,528
People trying to recruit him into Satanism when he was younger

681
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,320
It's just a story that he tells

682
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,624
Less frequently in the past

683
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,904
Still part of his

684
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,232
His story and it's interesting to me

685
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,256
It's very it's

686
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:52,608
But also there's fundamental differences between this and the way he tells it in the present

687
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,168
Who Among Us has a purse

688
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,728
It's no story that they've told for 20 years that is not

689
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
Some changes

690
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,032
Is to it I think

691
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,336
One as important as

692
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,384
Constant recruitment

693
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,224
To the devil that's a good point that one would stick in your memory

694
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,040
The way I see the fundamental differences

695
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,832
Exists in this

696
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,368
Telling it in the future telling

697
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
Is

698
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:18,976
That hear it could just be a bunch of weirdos who are into Satan

699
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,816
Metal was big at this point when Alex was in high school

700
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
You could see

701
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,120
People who are inside

702
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,168
Dunno darkness and

703
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:32,032
Wearing antlers helmet poster on their wall

704
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,056
You can see that

705
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,592
In the present

706
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:38,176
The way he tells the story The Devil is actually

707
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,456
Telling these people to

708
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,480
To get him

709
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,296
Because he is psychic and he's going to be important the gods Mich

710
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,344
They are directed by the Dead

711
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,160
There's a little bit of functional difference

712
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:51,232
Prince

713
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:55,072
Right Right Alright also I think this is a different in

714
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,632
As much as there were multiple different groups

715
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:04,032
Strength to a recruit him into Satanism which is strength that is weird

716
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,592
Is apparently super into satanism

717
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,408
Together

718
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,200
Satanism I feel like that's

719
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:15,808
Although you don't bully the nerd Fitness

720
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,624
Bear I don't think you should do that

721
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,160
The conception that he's made

722
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,184
Is it like

723
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,280
All these groups of people within the high school are Satanist

724
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,560
Right now

725
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,144
You'd have to assume that they didn't all just one day.

726
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
Decide at school

727
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:35,776
We're going to become saved their parents probably have something to do with that

728
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,800
So Alec

729
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,824
Alex is tried to

730
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,152
Keep me this girl who wants to date him he's up she's over at her house

731
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,688
The dad

732
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,224
The bed is like hey

733
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,016
We should get as

734
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:50,880
Alex says no thank you which is fun he was polite

735
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,672
He believes in the Lord Jesus Christ

736
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,464
Thank you sir but I will.

737
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,256
Then

738
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,280
The police

739
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,840
Police start harassing him because

740
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,120
If you rejected

741
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,144
This called

742
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,984
Is involved with the Sickness

743
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,872
This whole town is so I could I could see him saying that it was just the rich people

744
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:18,272
Nope this is the police are involved in taking a but that's part of his backstory to is revealing the police were all corrupt right

745
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,832
Yeah but it is the the

746
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,672
Serta grounded version of it is that

747
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:27,488
He discovered that police were dealing drugs

748
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,840
And so that he blew the whistle on that in the police chief ran him out of town

749
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:35,424
He just described his childhood a lot like the movie Warrior

750
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
You know like

751
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:42,080
There's just different roving gangs around it is just trying to navigate where he's trying to get to

752
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:46,432
Yeah it's highly problematic

753
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,456
That's a good way

754
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,552
Is that that movie

755
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:57,952
Ohio

756
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,048
Looks like baseball players

757
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,352
So we're done with the 30th here we job

758
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,888
Up to July 1st

759
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,960
And Alex has some concerns

760
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,264
About COG

761
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,288
Aniline of 6

762
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,312
Succession of a governor

763
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:39,424
Neocon

764
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:00,160
Line of presidential succession

765
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,976
Wooing me

766
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:08,096
So I don't know Tom Ridge was the Secretary of Homeland Security beginning

767
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,120
In 2003

768
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:13,728
The issue that Alex is playing fast and loose with here is that that position didn't exist

769
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,008
Sprayer Tom Bridge

770
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,336
Since he was the first head of the Department of Homeland Security would just be

771
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,104
Create it

772
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,408
He was a Cabinet member and most of

773
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,944
The cabinet exist in the lineup

774
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,968
Succession so

775
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,528
It was felt that this position needed to be inserted into

776
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
The order

777
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:31,136
Senate Bill 148 passed on June 27th 2000

778
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,464
Can a thin line just after the attorney

779
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,000
But that's not all there is

780
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
List of the story

781
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,048
Counterpart

782
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,608
In the house HR 2319

783
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,144
That was introduced and it died

784
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
Committee

785
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:46,240
In 2006 the US code was amended to include

786
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,800
Secretary of Homeland Security in the line of succession

787
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,336
In 18th position

788
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,616
Or to put it another way

789
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
Personable

790
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:53,919
Why is that

791
00:41:54,175 --> 00:42:00,063
Because in a very technical sense Alex is covering this news story

792
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
Like

793
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,623
We got some facts right

794
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:06,975
There is a real Bill a thin line for the

795
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:11,839
It makes some sense to assume the temp to pass the Senate it might get passed in the house too

796
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,911
Discussing that is a possibility is prudent

797
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:18,239
But I can still think if you listen to it the way Alex is talking about

798
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:22,847
Hamming it up a little bit dictatorship

799
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:25,151
I don't know if anyone cares who's

800
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:28,991
82 18th and lime it seems like

801
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:34,111
Except for the the Lone Survivor or the desert Survivor show

802
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,135
I think

803
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,183
I think that if we get to the 8th

804
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:41,023
On the list we have big problems

805
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,303
There's no country

806
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,423
Don't know if we could handle

807
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:55,871
Many people at the top of the Executive Branch the president

808
00:42:56,127 --> 00:43:00,479
President the Speaker of the House the pro tempore president of the Senate

809
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,271
What's

810
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,319
Federal and 7th

811
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:07,647
Bye-bye Secretary of State Farm remember

812
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,695
If all of those people are dead

813
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:17,119
Let's just go home unless all of them are getting surgery at the same time maybe we could do it

814
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,655
Temporarily

815
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:22,751
Nathan Lyon be president that would be a big get for Kamala Harris

816
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,287
Arslan

817
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,615
I think we have bigger issues

818
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,151
Once once you're into like

819
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:35,039
Secretary of agriculture is becoming president

820
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,063
Yeah cuz what happened

821
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
Cause that

822
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,111
Is going to be a huge issue

823
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,439
Gets a call

824
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,463
Block calls

825
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,743
It's kind of it's kind of nice

826
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,767
Is this a little stretch

827
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,047
In

828
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,607
The question

829
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,631
About a clit

830
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,167
That is in Alex

831
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,471
Commercial for his documentary

832
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,711
Recording for the John Ashcroft lose your ride

833
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,735
Your liberties

834
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,551
Yes

835
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,391
Concentrate on that

836
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,255
There is no

837
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,447
Kangaroo court

838
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:43,391
I really don't want to be in the position of sounding like I'm defending John Ashcroft because believe me as a Missouri and I hate that dude

839
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,159
But

840
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,439
At the same time Alex Isley

841
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,999
And you can tell that he doesn't know where the

842
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:51,327
The clip that this guy talked about really even comes from age

843
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,863
Just trying to Spin A Yarn on the flight

844
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,887
Can hear that in the way.

845
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,167
He's pulling information out

846
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:00,799
Time to selling a DVD and a clip of Ashcroft was featured in the commercial

847
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:01,823
Play here

848
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:34,591
I just kept the rest of it into give you a little taste of how he was marketing his the materials at the time

849
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,615
I do like a good white

850
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,383
Slavery because

851
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,663
Slavery's not that bad

852
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,199
Sure about white slavery

853
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,735
I

854
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,807
I think you get a sense there from a scarf clip

855
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,575
It's just playing

856
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,111
You will lose your liberties

857
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,951
Helzberg testimony Ashcroft gave on December 6th

858
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:52,767
It's 2001 in front of the senate committee on the Judiciary

859
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,071
It's a three-and-a-half-hour video on

860
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:58,143
C-SPAN but after opening statement really only goes about 20

861
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,447
The full sentence that clip

862
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,215
Comes from is this

863
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:08,895
Since 1983 the United States government is defined terrorist as those who perpetuate premeditated politically motivated

864
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,919
Violence against

865
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,687
Baton Target

866
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:13,759
My message to America this morning then is this

867
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,319
If you fit this definition of a terrorist

868
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,855
Fear the United States

869
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,391
For you will lose your Liberty

870
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,999
Strategic and even though the Patriot Act sucks

871
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,791
And I hate it and I hate a strop

872
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,839
Alex has no idea what he's talking about him

873
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,863
I'm just making stuff up

874
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,679
Also there is no Patriot Act to but there is

875
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,215
Sister Act 2

876
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,751
So we know that Alex

877
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,519
Love's

878
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,079
Fake Thomas Jefferson

879
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,615
Love's

880
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,919
Now what do you think he thinks about

881
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:45,247
Possibly true Thomas Paine quotes

882
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,295
Oh I think he

883
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,575
Well Thomas Paine

884
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,623
I'm going to go and say

885
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,391
He loves them

886
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,743
Father

887
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:05,215
And Reserve order in the world as well as property

888
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:23,391
Thomas George Washington

889
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:29,023
So the clothes that Alex is using there is slightly a bridge

890
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,303
Here's the full of her

891
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,679
Supposed quietude of a good man is the Ruffian with the other hand

892
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,959
And arms like laws

893
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
Discourage

894
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,751
Then keep the invader

895
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:42,591
And the plunderer in awe and preserve order in the world as well as property

896
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,687
You can see that Alex's version is conveniently missing the words like laws

897
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,711
For some reason

898
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:51,295
Also this quote is in support of people having guns

899
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,855
Sure but the context of this is entirely

900
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:58,463
This is from a 1775 essay published in the Pennsylvania magazine

901
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,767
The entitled Fox on defensive War

902
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,327
It's essentially War propaganda for the fighting

903
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,351
The British

904
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,143
Persuade religious folks in the colonies

905
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,679
That it was right and just

906
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,215
For them to arm themselves to fight it

907
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,239
Defensive War

908
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,287
NFL religious liberty was on the line

909
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,055
If they didn't

910
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,103
Another important point to bring up

911
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:18,687
Scholars are not in agreement that this was actually Thomas Paine who wrote

912
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,455
This article

913
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:25,599
He was the editor of the magazine at the time and the essay was attributed only to quote a lover of peace

914
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:27,391
So many have assumed that he wrote of him

915
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,439
However in a

916
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:32,511
16 book titled new directions in Thomas Paine studies

917
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:38,143
The authors point out there many inconsistent things in this essay that point to it not being written by pain

918
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,727
The most compelling points are the TSA includes the Line quote

919
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,031
The reign of Satan is not ended

920
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,847
And it treats miracles in the Bible is having literal

921
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,871
Really happened with

922
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,919
Their counter to the well-established deism

923
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,991
Who's playing Express in his other writings like Age of Reason

924
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:56,063
Yeah it'll be very weird for paying to be like

925
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:01,695
Satan coming after me the literal Christian devil it's very inconsistent with the way he writes

926
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,231
Yeah another contact

927
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:08,351
Compelling reason to take that this wasn't an actual quote from Thomas Paine

928
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,911
It's just a person trying to convince religious people to fight it

929
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,447
Defensive work at the British

930
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:17,055
I don't know he's trying to overcome better that whole nasty Thou shalt not

931
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,079
Killpop

932
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,615
Of War

933
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,895
Got to get over

934
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:21,919
Depends

935
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:23,967
So I think

936
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,759
This is a Miss handling

937
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,295
Of this quote at very low

938
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,391
Guess what it gets worse

939
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,159
Another

940
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,207
Way worse handling of a

941
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,023
And then I've got another quote here

942
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:46,495
We used

943
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,335
Do not

944
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,711
Bernini

945
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,759
Youwin world

946
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:09,535
Apologize

947
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:23,615
Tres misquote down I ran into the expected problem at almost every website that used it was a very bizarre.

948
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,639
Cities ask website

949
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:28,735
Conspiracy theories of the quote is given with no citation

950
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:32,575
Her information when this head of the UN food programme said this or where

951
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,367
Finally I found a Blog

952
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,903
The claim that Catherine

953
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:39,743
Teeny the former executive director of the UN world food programme

954
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:42,303
I've said this at the un's fourth conference

955
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,351
Mozart fourth world conference on women

956
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,679
In September 1995 which was held in Beijing

957
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:52,031
This is already contradictory to Alex's citation that this quote was for 1997

958
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,311
Smells fishy

959
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,871
The fourth world conference on women

960
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,687
Did in fact take place in Beijing in 1995

961
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,967
You can find it

962
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,759
Painfully detailed collection

963
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:04,319
Information about the conference on the un's website

964
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,367
Including but not limited to

965
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:09,951
The text of remarks made by representatives from over 100 countries

966
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:13,791
The text of comments made by representatives of ngos as well as

967
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,583
Total transcripts of State

968
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,119
It's made by un representative

969
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,935
There's also a bunch of pictures and a video that no longer low

970
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,495
That should be their slogan Where the UN

971
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,799
Fully documented

972
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:30,175
I was able to find the transcript of the speech that Catherine bertini that quote comes from

973
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,967
Explain a few things about

974
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,015
Conference before we get to the actual words that she

975
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:34,783
She said

976
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,575
The conference was meant to attempt

977
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,343
Define solution

978
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,111
Sims 2 the problem

979
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,135
Severe gender

980
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,415
Inequality across the world

981
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,719
And what are the elements of that problem that was the

982
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,255
Discuss was ecrater food in

983
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,559
Security experienced by women in the developing world

984
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:50,399
Either due to systemic issues or even just cultural preferences for sons

985
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,703
That lead them to get in greater access to food

986
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,471
Education another

987
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,239
Necessities

988
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,007
Happy expensive

989
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:55,775
Daughters

990
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,311
Now that being said

991
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,591
Here is the full path

992
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,615
What was take

993
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,151
Quote

994
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,687
Let's Have No Illusion

995
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:08,319
We can easily change the underlying beliefs and prejudices that do so much damage to women worldwide

996
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,855
We cannot quickly chain

997
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,903
Attitudes but we can change Behavior

998
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:17,535
At the world food programme we've recognized what a valuable tool food Aid to be in changing Behavior

999
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,351
It's so many poor countries food is money

1000
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,119
Food is power

1001
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:27,263
And some of our most successful food a project we literally pay families who do not believe in educating their daughters

1002
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,055
Descend those girls to school

1003
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,871
A little free cooking oil can go a long way

1004
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:36,479
We trade a 5-liter can of oil for 30 days of school attendance by a young girl

1005
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,551
Yes it's bribery we don't apologize for that

1006
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,831
We're changing Behavior

1007
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:43,135
Your work even hoping opportunities to young girls

1008
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,415
And that is all that

1009
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:48,767
Every Small Change in Behavior will one day payoff in a change of attitude

1010
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,351
So I think it's pretty self-evident what's happened here.

1011
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:55,423
Conspiracy theorist who want to demonize the UN at every turn

1012
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:00,799
I'm taking bertini's words and selectively edited them down in a way that was specifically designed to remove the context

1013
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:01,823
What do you say

1014
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,871
And make it seem is evil as

1015
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:08,223
This altered version of the quote is posted on conspiracy websites and

1016
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:11,039
Repeated by Alex with its origins of Steward or no

1017
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,063
Citation given

1018
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,647
That's making it harder for viewers to track down the source and judge it for themselves

1019
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:20,255
On the one hand this is something that's designed to demonize the UN but the

1020
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:23,583
Original statement bertini made was also Empower women

1021
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,119
Around the world to have agents

1022
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,167
Which is threatening to people like Alex

1023
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:30,495
Who worked tirelessly in the service of a male-dominated society

1024
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:34,335
By lying about the context of this quote you not only make a um look

1025
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,871
You'll super

1026
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,919
YouTube

1027
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:41,503
I didn't doing so you turn the sentiment of the UN doing whatever it can

1028
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,271
Cancel help women

1029
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:46,111
Some kind of international racketeering and poisoning program

1030
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,159
Xanax

1031
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,183
I think that's

1032
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,975
I don't know

1033
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,511
It's hard to imagine

1034
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,303
It's fully intentional but

1035
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,583
It doesn't seem like a coincidence

1036
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,863
Well I mean

1037
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:57,887
Cuz what she

1038
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:58,911
She saying is this

1039
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:04,287
Okay when we give food out to the powers-that-be in whatever localized

1040
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,591
Is National shanor or Triboro

1041
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,359
Wherever we

1042
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,431
Guess what it exacerbates the same

1043
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,967
Inequalities that we've had four

1044
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,759
From the beginning because men run though

1045
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,063
So where is skipping past

1046
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,623
We're going to be doing the most

1047
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,647
Tactical thing week

1048
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:22,207
Can do which is straight-up bartering

1049
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,487
For education

1050
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,767
It's not bright

1051
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:25,791
Maria Trejo

1052
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,583
You know I'm trading you

1053
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,631
Draining you Orioles

1054
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,423
So that everyone's future

1055
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:40,127
Bertini even side steps that and just says like let's call it bribery cuz I have to have the argument

1056
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,431
Accept the label but let's on

1057
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:44,223
Understand what it is we're doing

1058
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,015
And I just

1059
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:49,087
I think that it's so wrong and so awful

1060
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,111
2

1061
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:53,695
Steve quote for trade the way Alex is for

1062
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,975
Conspiracy theorist

1063
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,511
Heaven when you dig deeper in

1064
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,071
Find the actual quote see what it's actually about what

1065
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
Conversation was

1066
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,375
Where this conference

1067
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,935
What what it was in service of

1068
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,983
Haydocy like this is this is horse

1069
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,007
This is

1070
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:08,543
I don't know.

1071
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,847
It's so dumb

1072
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,871
That's such a great

1073
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,407
Thing for her to have said though

1074
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,223
Just f*** it

1075
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,783
It's we got to do something practical

1076
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:21,855
Because I don't care if my morality my personal morality

1077
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,135
He says bribery is wrong

1078
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,927
This is God we got to do something

1079
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:25,951
This is garbage

1080
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,511
Like it makes me feel like hey

1081
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,535
F*** it

1082
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,839
Let's just pool our money together

1083
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:37,727
And bribe Joe manchin a little bit more than what everybody else is paying him and let's just get this done

1084
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,751
You know like this

1085
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,543
Find your corrupt

1086
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,311
To ship will do

1087
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,335
Play that game

1088
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,103
And you know

1089
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,639
I mean

1090
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,407
I think

1091
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:49,759
I was just drive up the bidding war and that no one would get anything

1092
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,575
Right like if there if there were

1093
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:55,647
Like sort of Market forces that were bribing people to

1094
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,183
To not send daughters

1095
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,231
To school it's developing world

1096
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,511
Then you would end up

1097
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,839
Situation where this bribery would only exacerbate the problem

1098
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:07,423
It's just a we don't care to educate

1099
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,703
Daughters

1100
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:12,031
Perhaps less of a priority

1101
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:20,735
Absolute also man talk about missed opportunities the US representatives that went

1102
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,039
To that 1995 conference

1103
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,575
Hillary Clinton

1104
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,855
And Madeleine Albright

1105
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:29,951
Videos about them that would have been more fun for him

1106
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:33,791
It's always been there always been there man

1107
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,327
So Alex

1108
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,375
I think is going to little bit

1109
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,399
Far afield

1110
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,935
On the Harry Potter

1111
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,703
Conspiracies

1112
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,007
How far

1113
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:53,503
I mean really

1114
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:16,543
Where do talk about

1115
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,903
From Belgium

1116
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:09,279
So just call her is even like a man

1117
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:13,119
I like you but I don't know about this Harry Potter stuff

1118
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:19,519
Also he's wrong they didn't think it wrote the book sucker released every year on the solstice

1119
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,311
His perception of it cuz

1120
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,335
Fun stories

1121
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,359
But I like

1122
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,151
This whenever caller is

1123
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,431
Somebody who is not

1124
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,455
Like

1125
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,503
Totally bought it

1126
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:35,903
Summer is like I'm inclined to believe some of the things you say and I do believe that maybe the powerful don't have our intro

1127
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,671
Tristan

1128
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:39,743
The front of their their their lips

1129
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:44,863
Put man Potter are you f****** kidding me

1130
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:51,263
Are you are you going to come at me and tell me that the movie Witches starring what's what's their face

1131
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:56,639
Is the 30 cuz broken Hocus Pocus

1132
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,431
I have references

1133
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:01,503
Is that is that like a

1134
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:08,671
He's already complained about like Sabrina the Teenage Witch

1135
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,719
Every Everything innocuous

1136
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,255
Alex really want to win

1137
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,023
From this caller

1138
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:16,863
He wants to get him over onto his side and I don't think it's working

1139
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:21,471
Grove

1140
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,823
JK Rowling

1141
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,527
Black magic

1142
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,159
Real

1143
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,119
Warner Campbell

1144
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,679
Fidelity Financial symbol

1145
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,471
All these things

1146
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,751
AR

1147
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:37,759
Disagree on this issue

1148
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:41,343
ASU

1149
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,927
Wall-to-wall

1150
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,975
Okay and that is

1151
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,535
Over

1152
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:20,767
Long Wahlberg

1153
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:31,007
I like I like the condescendingly Alex keep saying sir

1154
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:33,311
I like how Alex is just

1155
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,615
Just grasping at straws

1156
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:38,687
Viacom symbol it's all fake

1157
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,991
Little backbone

1158
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,807
But I guess got to agree to disagree on this cuz

1159
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,879
You're not going to change your mind and I'm certainly not going to change my mind

1160
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,903
I do think it's

1161
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:51,487
So funny to say I guess we'll have to agree to it. That's the most

1162
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,279
Infuriating thing you can say to Alex

1163
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:57,887
No cannot agree to disagree no you are wrong

1164
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:00,703
And you have to accept it because

1165
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:01,727
Hughes

1166
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,007
Relation

1167
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,031
Kinship with being right

1168
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,311
Is so fragile

1169
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:10,687
L A tenuous at Best Yet the idea that anybody could talk to him

1170
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,455
And

1171
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,479
Not

1172
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,503
Agree with him

1173
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:17,599
They either have to be like a paid by the anime

1174
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,903
Or

1175
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:20,927
It's impossible

1176
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:24,255
He has to believe the games access to all of the most

1177
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,535
The real truth

1178
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:26,559
Or else

1179
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,327
All this is bull

1180
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,095
Okay

1181
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,119
Here's a larger

1182
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:31,167
Here's that infect maybe the largest

1183
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,447
Okay

1184
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:34,495
Magic is real

1185
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,543
In Alex's estimation

1186
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:37,823
He has

1187
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,871
Real black magic books

1188
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:45,247
She does is it possible for Alex to perform black magic and he simply chooses not to

1189
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:46,271
I mean

1190
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,063
Write at least in his mind

1191
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:54,463
Right also text Mars is not the best reference you want to have for his giant Library

1192
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:59,839
Full of Neo-Nazi book

1193
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:05,727
I left your first Paul I think we're in trouble. I studied the occult with text Mars oh no

1194
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,263
Gold nobody

1195
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:12,639
I mean it yet I studied the occult with the with this guy now I know his last name is going to put you off

1196
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,407
It was Hitler

1197
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:16,735
Hitler

1198
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:19,551
This caller really knocked it out of the park

1199
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:33,119
A lot of homophobic

1200
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,191
The office the work that we're doing

1201
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,231
Wow

1202
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,255
Wow

1203
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,815
I think that color is faint like

1204
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,839
Testicle

1205
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,631
If that when I heard that I was like

1206
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:10,239
That's exactly what I thought it was really homophobic

1207
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:14,079
Better hearing that being voiced on the show is really interesting

1208
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:18,175
That's the kind of thing that you would like to see what Alex has responses

1209
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,479
And his response was apparently

1210
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,527
So cold

1211
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:26,367
Oh boy no how aggressive these sexual

1212
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,135
Not good

1213
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:30,207
They start leaving our families alone and we'll leave them alone

1214
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,743
What the f*** are you talking

1215
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:32,511
What about

1216
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,791
That's its

1217
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:37,375
It's so weird to hear this type

1218
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,399
Type of s***

1219
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,447
And then see it so late

1220
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,215
Still

1221
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,239
In the present

1222
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,775
It's still there

1223
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:47,103
You know he doesn't he doesn't open like about it like

1224
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,663
Like that a little bit exactly

1225
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:53,247
There is any possible to backslide

1226
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:57,087
Into a place where he can just go around saying

1227
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,367
These so-called

1228
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,647
Homosexual families

1229
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,975
Very possible thing

1230
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:08,095
You know I think it's already still there

1231
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,399
I mean

1232
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,167
Yeah it's

1233
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:11,935
Sucks

1234
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:14,495
It exists

1235
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,519
Send his

1236
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:21,919
But the lgbtq movement is trying to normalize pedophilia

1237
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:25,247
It's just sort of transition the exact Folk

1238
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,015
Cast of it

1239
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,295
But the same

1240
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,575
But hatred and

1241
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,343
Intolerant

1242
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,879
Of people

1243
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,415
Who are not

1244
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,719
Straight white male Christian

1245
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,999
Is is just

1246
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,791
It's there it's been there

1247
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,071
Endemic forever

1248
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,375
So I thought that call was pretty

1249
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,143
Pretty good

1250
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,679
In terms of

1251
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:46,239
Call Alex gets another call and Alex

1252
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,359
Your birthday

1253
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:57,247
Supporting your show I don't know how

1254
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,039
Braid Finance

1255
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,575
Know about them

1256
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,607
New World Order

1257
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:22,847
So this is the sponsor that also caught my attention that was the commercial selling Heroes

1258
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:27,711
Caller who brings that up on the ball colors back then

1259
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:35,135
Negative

1260
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,671
Well-deserved

1261
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:37,951
That sucks

1262
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:43,071
That is so I would prefer people blindly accept whatever I say tell me I'm a genius

1263
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,887
Just because Berkeley Financial

1264
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,191
Is by all accounts

1265
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:52,287
Exactly the type of Columbus organization that I am exactly

1266
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,567
Fighting against

1267
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:59,967
Doesn't mean I'm going to talk bad about them if they sponsor my show Financial Outlet

1268
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:02,271
Advocating buying Euros

1269
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:08,671
And they paid for add time and were accepted by 10% by the three sources

1270
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,255
That's confusing

1271
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,559
Ideologically

1272
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,095
No

1273
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,375
No

1274
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,935
So we come to the end of this

1275
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,215
Cuz the rest of the show isn't

1276
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,263
Really it's boring

1277
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:29,663
Very clearly

1278
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:32,735
I'm from Illinois called back at so that was nice

1279
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:38,367
There's nothing there's nothing really that comes up but I wanted to make note of it

1280
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:42,975
The my boy dance Illinois got to get it in there

1281
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:43,743
Consistent color

1282
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:46,047
2003

1283
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,071
Yeah

1284
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,095
Never exactly

1285
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:54,751
I guess that brings us to the end of this and I think I I would like to just

1286
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:57,311
Acknowledge that I

1287
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:59,871
Was a little Hasty in my assumption that Alex

1288
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:02,175
Didn't talk about to how he was recruited

1289
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,199
Into Satanism backing

1290
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:08,063
2003-4 fear of being seen as crazy

1291
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,879
I think that there are Salient differences by

1292
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,647
Between them

1293
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:13,439
But make the present-day version

1294
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,975
Far far crazy

1295
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,535
Then the past version

1296
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,327
Any talks about it less

1297
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,863
But still hey

1298
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:24,959
Yeah I mean this with this is fairly tame and you could even argue that it's just

1299
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,751
Poetic exaggeration

1300
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,031
You say that all the jocks

1301
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:31,359
Send all this

1302
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:36,991
In space what do you say

1303
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:40,319
Exactly would involve an entire town dedicated to safety

1304
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:45,951
Should be a great movie. I think it's been made a couple times

1305
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,023
Real deep

1306
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,839
Deep homophobic leanings throughout

1307
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:55,167
I really thought that program

1308
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,447
Quote was something that

1309
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:58,239
Like that is such a

1310
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:00,287
Good distillation of

1311
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:03,359
The way that information is weaponized

1312
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,639
Conspiracy theorists

1313
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,663
People like Alex

1314
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:08,479
They deprive a very

1315
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,575
Reasonable and appropriate quote

1316
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:16,159
About one issue into being about something entirely different

1317
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:19,743
And strip it of all of the context that makes it makes

1318
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,071
It's

1319
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:26,911
And it's something the people should be very aware of and

1320
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:27,935
When you have

1321
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,727
Quotes in

1322
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,007
Information that comes

1323
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,543
From these dubious source

1324
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,103
It's always It's always important

1325
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:38,943
To figure out what is actually being said by the people as opposed to what

1326
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:39,711
Being claimed

1327
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,735
Things to have been sad

1328
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:44,575
And yeah that's point I'd like to drive home

1329
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:47,903
Love you know where I learned that from

1330
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,207
Yeah

1331
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,999
Interrupted you

1332
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:55,071
I mean ultimately it is

1333
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,375
It is probably their most powerful

1334
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,935
Write via bility to take

1335
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,983
Something that someone is saying

1336
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,519
That you cannot

1337
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:04,799
Not agree with

1338
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:11,199
I think it's a regular tactic but I think they're most

1339
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,735
Tool is

1340
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,807
Well That's Amore

1341
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,575
Blind

1342
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:18,623
Trust

1343
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,439
Ascent's of

1344
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:25,279
Complacency and people just believing

1345
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,303
These things that look

1346
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,327
Looking at your items

1347
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:30,143
Yep I think that's their most important tool

1348
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,167
Yeah

1349
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:33,471
But the strategy of yeah weaponizing

1350
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:39,359
Like sensible quotes evil into the evil

1351
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:41,919
That's a technique Intruders a lot

1352
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:47,551
Indeed we will but until then we website.com
