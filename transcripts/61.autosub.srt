Think that's true

12
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,608
Treat our listeners with

13
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,888

73
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
Trepidation

74
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,888
Let me tell you something

75
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,960
Who believed that everything is

76
00:03:55,008 --> 00:04:01,152
I would assume I would assume with that

77
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,504
In terms of utility for me but like

78
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
Character traits

79
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:13,696
Start off the show today with an out-of-context drop from Alex Jones

80
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,744
I do not want to be in Maine

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,143
I do not want to be in these comedy mean do not put me in Maine

82

87
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,927
Even his sarcasm he got wrong

88
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:22,559
He's a master he's a master of communication and I appreciate it very much

89
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,607
I do hear a little bit of sad

90
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,399
Totally

91
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:34,335
The past that he is the number one meme machine he's the meme machine

92
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,223

93
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,783

2017 episode

98
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,423
Maybe there'd be a lot of stuff about the 4th of July

99
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,983
Maybe I'm telling a story about a barbecue

100
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,335
Maybe he got the bottle rockets

101
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:13,247
You do any of those things you might think here's what I thought

102
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,879
No s*** about the founder

103
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:23,487
Weird alternative versions of true

104
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,767

Do I have a choice

107
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
Nope

108
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:40,383
Let me just start with this piece of news we had Leo zagami on Vatican expert

109
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Monday

110
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,503
Talking about

111
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,087
Cocaine orgies

Great

119
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:23,647
Is the Inquisition still very anti

120
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
Pope

121
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
They believe that it lives on

122
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
Brother name

123
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,631
Alright still wings of the Inquisition going on in the Vatican

124
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,911
Well I mean

125
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
The Spanish Inquisition

126
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
It doesn't exist

127
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,151
I can feel two more question

128
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,455
About that quick

129
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015

00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,647
USB 3

133
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
Think about it

134
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
Three questions in a riddle

135
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
Definitely not do that

136
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,143
Why

137
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
Daily Mail

138
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:15,359
Daily Mail my friend where they broken somewhere

139
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,551

00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:33,023
By the authorities

141
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,887
Vatican cocaine orgy broken up

142
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,911
Chat

143
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
Total bummer

144
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:44,543
Play buzzkill a******

145
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:51,199
This story does appear in the Daily Mail and a Walmart

146
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,575
Is ruining everything over here

147
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,671
Play celebrity gossip and tips.

148
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
Empire

149
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
Historically his

150
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,631
So a bunch of other right-wing organizations

151
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,679
Well and all of it traces back

152
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,751
To an Italian tabloid called

153
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
Sedano

154
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,151
Regardless of what happens

155
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,199
From here on out

156
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
The fat quote

157
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
I don't know

158
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:33,951
I don't know but I do know that this is a salacious tabloid magazine that is not a legitimate source

159
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,535
Even with any concrete reporting

160
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,679
Basically hearsay and rumor because it's in Italian

161
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,215
I don't know what's going to read it

162
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,007
Use it as a source

163
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,287
And all the sudden

164
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:53,407
Hey this is legitimate yeah Steven from

165
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,551
So it's basically the Magazine's you walked by and Shop

166
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,135
Murdering children

167
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,487
And then beyond that I know what's going to happen already

168
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,279
Because there's nothing here

169
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
Because you already listened

170
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,863
Into the episode in the future from now

171
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,911
This

172
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
Alex

173
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,727
Is reporting

174
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263

175
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,079
Nor that it goes nowhere

176
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,919
He's going to use it as a waypoint

177
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,647
Use it as an example of something because there's

178
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,463
Nothing there

179
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Says something

180
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
Sing that he disagrees with him

181
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,583
Going to be like look at this guy having cocaine field

182
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
I mean let's not be remiss

183
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,727
I have done a lot of really f***** up stuff

184
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
Enroll in

185
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,223
Covering up pedophilia B

186
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,783
For a good long while

187
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,087
So we have no business

188
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,111
Defending

189
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
The Vatican

190
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,695
The Catholic organized Church

191
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
From time to time

192
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,327
AutoZone's hours

193
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
To be without you

Disgusted by Satanic rituals

Those who regard themselves as the elite controllers at the planet

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,703
The real story

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,823

241
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Audible

242
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,175

Disreputable

245
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,111
Alex is in the middle of

246
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
Narrative

247
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,183
I'm going on for like the last week or so

248
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,487

Children

255
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,703
Is awful

256
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,287
And I'm sure he's done it before

257
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,823
Just moved in the f*** around because

258
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
Cuz there

259
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,895
Get down to it

260
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,199
To play this game

261
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,991
It's all about

262
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,831
Systematic organized pedophilia

263
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,367
This guy was just a procure

264
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,463
So this ship pops up

265
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
And he's just using it to

266
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
Kindling

267
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,559
The fire of antibiotic

268
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,583
Sentiment

269
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,143
It's great but it's bulshit this is bulshit

270
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,727
The talking about an actual pedophile

271
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:39,103
Witches real

272
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
Pedophile

273
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
And not

274
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
Did he really get into

275
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,015
A little bit

276
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
Just

277
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831
I find it somewhat boring

278
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:52,927
Expressing it

279
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,767
In this way

280
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,095
His conclusions about the idea of it everything

281
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,423
Systemic pedophilia in blackmail related

282
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,727
It diminishes from the reality of

283
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,007
The situation

284
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,567
Moana playlist

285
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335

00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
No talking about

287
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,967
I agree with that much

288
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,527
I was present

289
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,319
I wish it was more of a

290
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,367
Even after all of the

291
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
Great reporting and

292
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
And all of the

293
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,255
It's not like anybody's taking down the castle

294
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,047
No that's

295
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,863
Infiltrated with 33rd

299
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,799
Well he's at 33rd degree Illuminati

300
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079

00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
Is totally where my mind

302
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,663
God

303
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,223
So that's not the only narrative

304
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,503
Alex's

305
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,063

Has something to do with

00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,351
Stampy intellectualism

325
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Classism

326
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,655

They don't show you a quote

352
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,703
You know the person doing that is a race-baiter

353
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,031
It's even worse

354
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,639

00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:51,775
Yeah but the problem is but it doesn't do anything because of all those years of it not doing anything

360
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:57,663
Not having any effect on the world

361
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,711
The most

362
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
The use of the word unalloyed

363
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,295
He complains about it all the time

364
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,831
I don't disagree

365
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,671
Intellectualism

366
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
It's really bothering

367
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,255
Well I don't

368
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,839
Right well I would always go back to

00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:19,167
Saying that the only reason that you use it

370
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447

371
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
Fairies

375
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,575

376
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Worth him

377
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
Complaining for like 2 weeks about

378
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647

We're good we have to

388
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,255
So that's that's

389
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,095
If you are a media Outlet

390
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:25,215
Feel free to use us as a source for calling out

391
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,335
Are we sure

392
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
I just hate this

393
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,503
Diverse mentality of like

394
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:42,111
Racism is just a word that people use to try and gain power over you

395
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,903
Weird one I don't understand that

396
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
Because it's

397
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
Just

398
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
I mean it

399
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,791
The last Bastion of a racist

400
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,351
Hiding behind like oh you just calling me that

401
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,399
Take power away from my words

402
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,215
But I was his version of it is always like your

403
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,007
Calling me this without proof

404
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,055
The flip side of it is

405
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,847
Yuko people demons

406
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,383
Without proof

407
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
You call people witches

408
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,735
Almost every woman he's ever talked about is called

409
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,503
Pedophile

410
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,367
Pedophile lesbians are exactly

411
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
If you wanted

412
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,928
If you really want to play that game

413
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
You need more

414
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,256
Give me more proof baby

415
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
Yeah but

416
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,840
The problem the problem with that

417
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
His

418
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,912
Claims are

419
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,192
So outlandish

420
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,984
As to invite

421
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,824
You know indifference as opposed to

422
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,616
Somebody saying like

423
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,664
Oh show me proof that I'm a witch

424
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,712
If you even ask

425
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:43,296
If you ask Alex Jones Show you proof that you're a witch

426
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,088
You look like the crazy

427
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
The two large

428
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,160
That's what's protected him

429
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,928
Oprah being sued

430
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:54,816
What are we doing

431
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,120
I know that's why we're at the point where at

432
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:01,472
I hope he Slanders off at some point

433
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:06,080
Call Takata pro bono guy

434
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,640
Get one of these,

435
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:17,088
We got a couple comic lawyers

436
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,280
Will be the aggrieved party

437
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,328
Are we are we would be

438
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
That like

439
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,448
Taking power away from

440
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,496
By calling them eraser

441
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,056
Seems like an insane jump of logic

442
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,384
Why because I can't imagine

443
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,152
Kitchenware

444
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,432
It would

445
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,712
Actually take power away

446
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,552
Call me racist after I say something

447
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,136
I've never really seen white people being racist

448
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,696
People on the other hand are very right

449
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,096
My free speech

450
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,144
Well I mean I'm coming call rumors

451
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
Bright

452
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,568
I don't have the energy

453
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,920
I love the energy to keep it up

454
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,200
I mean

455
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,736
I think that's what Alex

456
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,016
But I suppose

457
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856
Seems to follow

458
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,904
That you would then be a racist

459
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
Now I think

460
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,952
The connotation that

461
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,048
Like you're effective

462
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:30,816
Only races

463
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,864
In that you are

464
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,192
You know you're part of the

465
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,984
Problem that continues

466
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
Adjusting

467
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,080
I think

468
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:46,432
To all he thinks he has to do

469
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,504
Anyway

470
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,296
These make allegations of racism

471
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:56,928
Y'all better being with no no

472
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,232
There's no consequence

473
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,608
All of Christendom

474
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
Okay

475
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,264
The failure of Christendom

476
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,104
It was Christianity and it was Western Europe

477
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,920
That banned slavery worldwide

478
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,480
Pepper in Islamic countries in Africa

479
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,576
It was Christianity that first

480
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,392
Look at what we're doing is wrong

481
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,976
Used

482
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,792
The globalist the leftist social engineers

483
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,352
They be used are incense

484
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
Doesn't matter

485
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,016
Tribal lines where the tribes are genetically identical areas of Africa

486
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,296
Christian

487
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,832
They're super prosperous

488
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,904
Have industry medicine

489
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,488
You'll have Muslims right across the river

490
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,792
Oh no worshippers plant worshippers

491
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
Christianity

492
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,728
Fault

493
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,288
Christian

494
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
Create civilization

495
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Yikes

496
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,872
Boats

497
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:23,968
Maybe that's a I like his modifiers New Testament

498
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,272
Considering the fact that

499
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:32,672
It was the Old Testament that was used to justify slavery much of Alex Jones from

500
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,976
Exactly

501
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:39,328
Do the Old Testament Christianity is

502
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,424
A helpful thing I would also add that not a lot of those letters

503
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:56,480
Very very small

504
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:01,088
Or at it cuz that's wild

505
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,880
That's awesome that's a good show

506
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,904
John of Patmos

507
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,696
Fever dreams

508
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,048
Wholeheartedly

509
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
New Testament Christianity is the

510
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,400
Font of civilization

511
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,472
But it's

512
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,800
This Prejudice comes from a very race

513
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
Because

514
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,360
Because

515
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Kristen

516
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,456
Aur

517
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,736
Who fuc

518
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,760
Kings spread

519
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
Christendom

520
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,088
Subjugated people

521
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
Using

522
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
Christened

523
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,672
Probably probably

524
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:43,072
People love free market

525
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:46,656
Position with about

526
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:55,360
You all are

527
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,664
Is missing a very important piece of it too

528
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,224
These two tribes

529
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,016
And one of them

530
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
Is Christian

531
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,064
And one of them is a

532
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,344
Animist let's say

533
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,184
Christian will have had

534
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
An oppressive

535
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
Violent

536
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,536
Interaction with white people

537
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,584
Who has forced them to become Christian

538
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,376
And maybe that informed

539
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,656
They're building of

540
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,424
Civilization

541
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,704
That mirrors the way

542
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,752
Generally speaking possibly

543
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,824
Therabox

544
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
Animes that are

545
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,664
Tree worshipers is Alex might say

546
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,712
Then have beautiful civilization

547
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,528
But you're just not willing to recognize a civilization

548
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
Because you're caught up in your

549
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,392
Prosperity of the West

550
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,184
Can Shinto and Buddhism

551
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,584
Those areas seem to do all right for themselves without the whole Jesus

552
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,608
Civilization

553
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,376
Oh I did

554
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,960
I didn't realize that note are we just talk about Jesus

555
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,824
Just a wonder why

556
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,384
I guess that's not fair

557
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,480
I want to be totally I want to be totally fair to us cuz he is saying

558
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,552
That's the New Testament Christianity is what

559
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,576
Civilization

560
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,600
But in

561
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,672
Perfect fairness to the literal words he said

562
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,976
He didn't say that there's no other way

563
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
He was just saying

564
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
That Muslim

565
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,864
Ain't doing it maybe

566
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,424
You never said that

567
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,752
Word for Muslims we would have

568
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
Buck off

569
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288
Malik

570
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,824
Would have not much of a shell

571
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,432
Feels a lot of his money to Muslim bathing suit

572
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,968
Yeah so he's thrilled

573
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,368
Grateful grateful

574
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,904
Because

575
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,488
F****** these got no story

576
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,304
So here is Alex

577
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,096
Also expressing

578
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,912
Some beliefs

579
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,192
Feelings that make me

580
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,240
Pretty comfortable

581
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,032
I've been real serious problems with

582
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
Christians

583
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,896
End of slavery questions

584
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,456
End of segregation

585
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,016
Have the quote

586
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,408
E-girl

587
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:41,760
Wildside

588
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,880
That's all it is nearing

589
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
You settings

590
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,672
Now

591
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,720
Racism is ever

592
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,024
Exactly

593
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,144
Well I mean himself he said that he was a victim

594
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,680
Black on white

595
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:06,080
Does a child's of that even flies contrary to his

596
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,200
Things like that before

597
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,480
That is

598
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,296
The old-timey is white a thing

599
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,368
Because I was surrounded by

600
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,136
Right

601
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
How can you

602
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
Possibly say that

603
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
Racism

604
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,280
Wasn't around in the

605
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,632
That's the most insane

606
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,704
Utterly nonsense

607
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,984
But

608
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,752
You know

609
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,032
I think of it

610
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:36,800
Possible

611
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
That

612
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,128
From the age that he was sort of formative

613
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,688
He was able to really experience the world

614
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,224
He's had a lot of bulshit

615
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,040
Maybe some of these I mean

616
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,832
He read that none dare call it

617
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,368
Conspiracy when he was fouled

618
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,904
If you think that

619
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,696
The global is narrative has been in

620
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,976
Has had since 12

621
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,512
He might have

622
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,816
Thought you didn't experience racism

623
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,120
Just Justified it as once

624
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:04,704
He does as an adult

625
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,264
Possible but that doesn't mean that you didn't

626
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,288
Experience

627
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,056
Just mean

628
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,128
He didn't particularly care and it was

629
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:16,480
Another story that he wants to get into on this

630
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,016
July 5th episode

631
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,600
No no Christian

632
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
No

633
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,136
No

634
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:26,208
Christians do not get to take credit for ending

635
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,488
F****** any

636
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,792
Christians get to take

637
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,328
Credit for starting

638
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,912
The s*** not necessarily starting slavery like

639
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,448
Yeah

640
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,008
I can think of no exam

641
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,056
Now racism is ever

642
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,104
I'll tell you that right now

643
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,688
Back in the good old

644
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:50,784
308 there was no racism

645
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:56,416
And then Christians you know after the Council of Trent racism is everywhere

646
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,184
Everywhere

647
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,256
Empowering

648
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,560
To the people who are fighting against segregation

649
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,608
To say that Christians

650
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:10,752
It might be incidental that some people were Christians but it was largely oppressed classes

651
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:23,296
He's super socially let's not talk about that

652
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:27,392
A little bit about the Olympics

653
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Cuz they're coming up

654
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:35,328
Here's what

655
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,656
In every sport

656
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
What shooting

657
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
Every sport

658
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,776
But shooting

659
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:48,640
Men are faster stronger

660
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
The Olympic men out there

661
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:55,296
99999999

662
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,976
Superman

663
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,304
Children

664
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,888
Is it 10 guys are superhuman

665
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,896
Normal people

666
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,176
That's one of the most

667
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
Confusing

668
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,248
Rambles that I've ever heard on the show

669
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,064
Okay so you think you can parse that

670
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,928
Coming from there

671
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,768
Athletes especially women who have

672
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,792
It's like

673
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:42,144
That I can't really

674
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,448
Because there are a lot of like

675
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,728
The committee has

676
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,520
Horse genetic testing

677
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,848
Genetic testing

678
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,920
For some reason they don't need to do it

679
00:33:55,968 --> 00:34:01,856
But there are female athletes who have had a lot of testosterone in this

680
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
In their system

681
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,928
Because of that

682
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,720
Additional chromosome

683
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:12,096
Female Vitality as Alex Jones

684
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
But

685
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,008
That is its own form of prejudice

686
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,592
Dear of an equal playing field

687
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,616
Is

688
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,152
Ridiculous

689
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:25,920
It was an impulse

690
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,320
As women and women can

691
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
Friend stuff

692
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:39,488
Female-to-male transgender

693
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,024
And compete as male

694
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,608
And now they've made it so the other way

695
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,192
I don't really care either

696
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:58,944
He's making the same argument that recently made about Serena Williams

697
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,712
Are you sad

698
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,248
She would be 700

699
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
On the mend

700
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,808
Bulshit

701
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,600
Well

702
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,160
No she would destroy pretty much all them

703
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,952
I don't know

704
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,000
I mean I don't know

705
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:12,768
Pretty sure

706
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,560
I have no idea

707
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,352
Think it matters not right

708
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,656
I don't care particularly but I

709
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,424
Think she would be

710
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,032
I think she's

711
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:28,640
Agassi I mean like then then you get into just average

712
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,408
Powerline

713
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:32,224
How hard do you hit the ball

714
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,504
Gives a s***

715
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,528
At all

716
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,296
She is

717
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,344
The best female tennis player

718
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,624
In the history of the game

719
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,648
Yeah ever

720
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,184
So who the f*** cares

721
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,488
Like look like what do you want

722
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,536
What do you want her to play against Federer

723
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:49,376
Maybe she would

724
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,912
Who wouldn't

725
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,960
I don't know I don't know enough about

726
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:56,800
All the time

727
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:02,944
Which is great I love female World Cup soccer team

728
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,504
Another one

729
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,832
Curling

730
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,880
My friend

731
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,440
It just doesn't make any

732
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,232
Modern pentathlon

733
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,216
I guess the only reason that it's important

734
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,008
Ski backflip in there and the reason

735
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,800
Cut it out was

736
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
Like

737
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,616
He's all about exclusion

738
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,432
It is really just that's what motivates

739
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,272
Keep these people out

740
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:48,000
Sounds like he's

741
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:54,912
He's like I could never compete with anybody

742
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:59,008
That you get from people who who say like

743
00:36:59,264 --> 00:36:59,776
Because they have more

744
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
Fast-twitch

745
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,080
Which fiber whatever

746
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:07,200
They were bred to be stronger

747
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,736
Yeah

748
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,504
You

749
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,576
Yeah let's get out of this

750
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,880
Alex wants to talk about

751
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,672
North Korea

752
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:24,096
You know you got that I'm assuming that he's going to go directly for there

753
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,632
Burgeoning nuclear power

754
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,656
Facebook

755
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:32,032
North Korea's well episode

756
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:40,480
You think that you're 60 years old you get it

757
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,576
It's been almost 60 years since the ceasefire in Korea

758
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,136
All the experts agree

759
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:55,328
Kim jong-un's Outta control

760
00:37:55,584 --> 00:38:01,728
Meijer mPerks

761
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:15,552
Believe it.

762
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:20,672
Inside guy

763
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,936
This is the number

764
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:37,056
75000 on the list of reasons the globalists are mad about Trump

765
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:43,456
It's so many f****** reasons I didn't know that it was because radiation beam weapon technology doesn't want the

766
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,248
Publix

767
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,344
Would you have radiation

768
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:55,744
Amwell board for

769
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,840
Also for me to just be unhappy about Trump being president let alone

770
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,912
We have sci-fi weapons

771
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,936
I mean

772
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:10,336
These are probably stick to the you trying to bring back Prosperity globalists don't want that Baseline

773
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:16,224
Not super magic Neutron beam weapon

774
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,784
Fun stuff

775
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,624
Ever get back to any real talk about North Korea

776
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
We'll just kind of fun

777
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,440
I'm saying I will get to it

778
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:34,912
Because North Korea is now a nuclear power but

779
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:40,800
Joe Scarborough's going we got to get to the good like 20 minutes talking about how Joe Scarborough's a creep

780
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,824
Amica's an a******

781
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,408
And Joe Scarborough is probably

782
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,712
Migos rap snacks

783
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,064
Has it from

784
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,344
Real good source

785
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:56,672
Oh no

786
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,720
Is that he wanted to run for

787
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:03,072
I meant Trump started to pick up keep me like I can't do this I can't get in the game

788
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,352
So then he was like

789
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:10,752
I'd be a perfect VP for trump snubbed it so now he's super mad he wants to take down Trump

790
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,336
She's making up all this stuff about The Enquirer why I was like

Who's going to Bedford here's why you go to bed for Joe's Crab

794
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,136
The president is blackmailing TV

795
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,184
Yeah I'm pretty

796
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,536
Very very bad.

797
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,608
Everybody involved

798
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,656
Guys that Trump is

799
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:43,264
Far worse than everybody else involved victims were like

800
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:49,664
Dick I wouldn't want to hang out with Railroad and Barnett

801
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:55,808
Hollywood house is rubbing off on me

802
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,880
Dadeville they do that

803
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
And Alex doesn't get back to

804
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,696
Cuz he has bigger fish

805
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,488
Stir fry

806
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,072
Looks like a huge Bass

807
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,912
What is North Korea nuclear war

808
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,216
This is the main

809
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:13,984
Saying that Alex

810
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,520
Talking about today

811
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,080
Surprise

812
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,104
Is elotes

813
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,664
Creator

814
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,856
Financing

815
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,864
Violence

816
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:45,472
I'm guessing the lady I probably

817
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,240
Deal

818
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,264
Based on

819
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,568
A fake fight with Vince McMahon

820
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,128
And Donald Trump years ago

821
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,711
Wii Sports

822
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,319
He told him

823
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:04,671
Apologize

824
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:09,535
Would destroy you

825
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:15,935
Remove it

826
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,215
Bridgewater speak

827
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,495
What

828
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:23,615
You can say

829
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,295
The last 2 days

830
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:37,183
Garbage Island

831
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,487
CL South Korea and Japan

832
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,023
Alaska

833
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,399
How he was evil

834
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:49,215
Sounds like your show

835
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,335
We won't

836
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:03,039
Give you remove your free speech pure bullying in the federal state law

837
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:12,255
Cool cool

838
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:49,887
MP40 told CNN's apologize

839
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,335
I would never support any kind of violence

840
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,855
He was so then why is this account

841
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:14,719
Don't do follow up on that

842
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:21,119
He apologizes

843
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,935
Who knows if that's even a real account or a real person

844
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:30,591
Google

845
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:33,663
Biggest problem with the CNN

846
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:34,943
Is that

847
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:38,271
Trump was actually in that

848
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,367
Yeah that is an actual WWE

849
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:47,487
Recording president

850
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,023
Weather

851
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,071
Believers at Wrestlemania

852
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,911
Whoever

853
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,191
Feather shave their head

854
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,215
Right

855
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,519
I'm guessing Trump's head didn't get shaved

856
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,311
I don't believe so

857
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:04,383
That was contingent upon his being part of it

858
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,967
Literally don't touch my

859
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,039
Literally zero problem with Trump WWE

860
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,087
Nope

861
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,647
I have a huge problem with him then becoming president

862
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,671
If it weren't

863
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,975
The exact person of Donald Trump

864
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,303
I totally disagree

865
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:23,839
I think it's

866
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,863
Totally fine

867
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,143
It's Showmanship

868
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:26,911
It's nonsense

869
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:27,679
I don't think

870
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:30,751
I don't think it has anything to do with who you are as a person

871
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,031
Like Jon Stewart

872
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,567
Is gone and done a couple things

873
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,639
No oh no

874
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:40,479
The Daily Show Jon Stewart hit John Cena with a chair

875
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:45,855
He's great with a lot of fun

876
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,671
2008

877
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,207
John McCain

878
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:50,975
Hillary Clinton

879
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,255
They all appeared on the

880
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,279
Titantron

881
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,303
To give a speech

882
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,583
Do the wrong Nation

883
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,887
3 WWE

884
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:01,983
Great presentable

885
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,287
I would have been better than others

886
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:09,663
Well we know we know who is the time you got there appeared on WWE

887
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:14,783
I don't really think I understand there's a difference between having a head-shaving match

888
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,319
Kyle Drive Vince McMahon

889
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:19,647
Nobody has five years earlier 10 years earlier

890
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,439
When he wasn't involved in politics

891
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,207
Like that

892
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,999
I don't think I really care that much

893
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
I would

894
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,071
Your Square

895
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:34,751
Be that as it may be a racist to take the power away from

896
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,271
Han a****** solo which is

897
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,039
A terrible pun

898
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:53,695
Any number one

899
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:57,791
Was a guy who posted this meme

900
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,327
And the president

901
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,399
And the situation goes

902
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,679
People started to look at

903
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:08,287
And they found a bunch of really big

904
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:12,383
You created the one that got the heaviest circulation was a picture of

905
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,175
Cons of CNN employees with

906
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:18,015
Star of David that's right he made sure everybody knew

907
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,575
Jewish right

908
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:24,927
And then what is the coincidence

909
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,743
Notebook

910
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:34,143
Just wanted to make sure everybody knew

911
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:44,895
Give me of something I'm not ShopRite

912
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,431
Yeah

913
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,967
Just keep an eye on it

914
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,759
You was one of them

915
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:55,391
So this guy you post this

916
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,695
And that's what people are talking

917
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,999
Trump meme being a

918
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,119
Is very easy to find on Reddit

919
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,423
Cuz it's f****** Reddit

920
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:13,567
So people started to dig into that.

921
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,103
Neo-Nazi tender

922
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,639
What the f*** is going on here

923
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
So

924
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,991
One thing that people need to be keenly aware of

925
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,063
Your internet history of its public

926
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,367
Gives a lot of clues about who you are

927
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,415
I could probably go through it

928
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,183
Hunter people

929
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,207
Breaded pasta

930
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,231
Confine their post

931
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:34,303
With a reasonable certainty figure out who they are

932
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,583
And that's what

933
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:41,471
They have a whole department that does stuff like that researchers

934
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:46,335
Cancel.

935
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,663
Infowars with you I don't I don't believe that that

936
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,199
Set a process exists

937
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:55,039
They figure out based on Clues

938
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:58,879
Who this guy is based on his history

939
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,159
To a Facebook page

940
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,439
That is all that

941
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,767
Yeah and they tried to get in touch with him

942
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,559
Run success

943
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,583
First of all

944
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,399
After they reached out to dry

945
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,935
Of his own accord

946
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,727
He made that apology post

947
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,383
He had already made his apology

948
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,175
They didn't believe him

949
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,479
He did that of his own accord

950
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,503
And

951
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,527
They were gracious

952
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:27,807
NBA

953
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:30,623
We will keep your privacy intact

954
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,903
Is a good

955
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,695
Faith kindness

956
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:36,767
In the story that they wrote about his apology

957
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,303
Do you have reached out to

958
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,583
They said

959
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,631
We reserve the right

960
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,679
To reveal his identity

961
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,703
If he

962
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:47,263
Doesn't stop doing this

963
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,055
And everyone takes that is black

964
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,687
They went above and beyond by not revealing it

965
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,711
It's a story

966
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,991
They have every right

967
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,015
To give away cuz I done

968
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
But he made

969
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,111
Amines that essentially got a lot of

970
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:04,671
People who reported on it

971
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,999
There was a guy with a long thread on Twitter reposted bunch of

972
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:08,767
Screencap

973
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,815
I hope you die

974
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,375

977

These are things when there are crazy people out there

978
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:29,759
Create a violent tone towards them as our world has

979
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,039
In the last 6 months

980
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,599
Body slamming them

981
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,623
What have you

982
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,487
You're creating a in trouble

983
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,767
Were it not for the

984
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,303
Contacts that we live in

985
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,095
Now

986
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:44,863
Instilling me

987
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,887
Yeah maybe

988
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,191
Yeah I think that would be if if he

989
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,727
Key if Trump did not

990
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:50,751
Constantly

991
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:51,775
Threatened

992
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:55,359
The Free Press the enemy of the people

993
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,895
If the Free Press were not

994
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,199
Constantly under death row

995
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:02,015
Constantly under attack

996
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,063
At this point from

997
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:05,855
Then

998
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,135
That would be fun like

999
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:13,535
Look at it it's stupid

1000
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,119
Perfect metaphor for the world that we live in

1001
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:22,751
Posting a meme like that the guy did anything illegal certainly is well within

1002
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,287
Is right

1003
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:27,615
It is a nice reminder that there are legitimate

1004
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:31,455
Hot a****** solo

1005
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:36,831
I don't know I don't know I haven't looked at that I don't care I don't want to know who he is and I don't want to feed into

1006
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,903

And stuff like that

1013
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,007
Let me know retaliatory stuff online

1014
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:58,591
I mean just because we don't hear about every piece of it it's way worse than

1015
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,431
Where where

1016
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,711
But

1017
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,479
Directions

1018
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
You know

With the president retweeting

1021
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,791
You're missing the forest for the trees there

1022
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,399
Dismissing in terms of Forestry action

1023
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,679
Is that

1024
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,983
His apology has a very important piece

1025
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,031
Alex of talk about

1026
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:31,359
I'm not sure if you CNN coverage really covered it that well

1027
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,639
But one of them

1028
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,943
Pieces of it was he was talking about how

1029
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,991
He got sort of addicted

1030
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,015
To making these memes

1031
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,551
I trying to shock

1032
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,575
And

1033
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:44,927
And what have you

1034
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:45,951
And

1035
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:49,791
As best I can tell from the apology that he wrote

1036
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:53,631
It was a moment where he realized the reality

1037
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,471
It doesn't exist just inside

1038
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,495
This bubble

1039
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,567
Abusers real-world consequence

1040
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,103
And

1041
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,895
You realize I

1042
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,199
Had a bit I have a bit of a problem with that

1043
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,503
That is a message that

1044
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,271
Needs to be

1045
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:12,319
Fred far and wide

1046
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,391
Ice cream

1047
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,927
Brent friendships

1048
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,695
Over

1049
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,975
Meme addiction

1050
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:24,351
Well what's so his his argument for what he's done

1051
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,655
Is that what he was doing is just

1052
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,935
Doing it for the light

1053
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,471
For the low

1054
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:33,055
That's what he was doing it because they were reinforcing it

1055
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:36,639
And if you if you

1056
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:44,575
Keep finding ways to give those people what they want the only career

1057
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,367
The only problem there is

1058
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,135
No

1059
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,159
No

1060
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:50,207
You are a racist

1061
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:56,607
Well if you maybe not maybe maybe not unalloyed of every f******

1062
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,399
Jewish employee that you

1063
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,167
You can find it

1064
00:53:59,423 --> 00:53:59,935
CNN

1065
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,983
And put a star of David next to them

1066
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,799
F*** you you're apology means f*** all them

1067
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,615
Apology is done

1068
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,663
You claim I would never do that

1069
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,943
No you are

1070
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:11,711
Erase

1071
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,783
My position on it and this is not a firm

1072
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,063
Because I'm not sure about

1073
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,599
I don't really know

1074
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,647
If meme addiction woodwork

1075
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,415
The same as

1076
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,695
Other addiction

1077
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,719
But

1078
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,791
You know if someone's using their like a cokehead or

1079
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,351
They're going to do things

1080
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,887
Vetter outside of their morale

1081
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,959
Things that are outside of who they are as a person

1082
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:34,495
And what's that get help

1083
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:37,311
Grow through the recovery process

1084
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,663
And maybe there's a possibility that that

1085
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,199
Same thing is true of this

1086
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,479
Version of Internet

1087
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,015
It might be possible

1088
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:49,087
Puke

1089
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,183
Say the same thing is true of once he goes through therapy

1090
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,463
Configure s*** out

1091
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,743
Then maybe he will do

1092
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,535
Discover that he is grown as a person

1093
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,327
And doesn't exhibit those

1094
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,351
Racist Behavior

1095
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,375
But you can't

1096
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:02,911
Apologize

1097
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:03,679
Is it

1098
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,959
Baby

1099
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:09,055
Big picture but where I'm going to draw a line is

1100
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,895
I don't think you hear a lot of apologies that are that

1101
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,663
Introspective

1102
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:16,479
I think that

1103
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,783
I mean he might have been pushing to Bruno's

1104
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:21,087
But if you can make a meme

1105
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,623
Obviously you can write a coach

1106
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,159
Apology

1107
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:26,975
If you take it at face value as the

1108
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:27,743
Sincere and Anna

1109
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:31,839
Which I might as well I've no idea who haunt assholes

1110
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,887
I got no idea about tonight

1111
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,775
If you are against

1112
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,823
People doxxing

1113
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,383
People on your side

1114
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,919
You also have to be against

1115
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,687
Beam.

1116
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,455
Text if they're on the other

1117
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,991
All of it

1118
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,063
Gametime

1119
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,183
I don't know when we live in this world of such interconnect

1120
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,719
It is like

1121
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:02,047
If you even give somebody's name

1122
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,071
Everything about that

1123
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:07,167
I know where he lives I know his

1124
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,727
I know all of this s*** just

1125
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,007
Just putting a guy

1126
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,311
Facebook profile out there

1127
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,079
You've been.

1128
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,127
You can gather a ton of information

1129
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,407
Our names are

1130
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:20,223
Public so we're doxxing ourselves

1131
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:20,991
Just by existing

1132
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,159
Picture with every CNN

1133
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,023
What have you

1134
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,911
I am not

1135
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,703
Alright I'm not going to give up my last

1136
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:45,055
My last name is assholo

1137
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:50,431
And I'm stopped at little bit later but

1138
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,455
Derivation

1139
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:53,247
Go down a little side path

1140
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,087
Tell you all about

1141
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,391
What's going on

1142
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,695
Interesting

1143
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:05,279
I can either prove or disprove

1144
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,815
What rhymes with most

1145
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,095
Great my gut

1146
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,887
Tells me it's not true

1147
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,935
This is Mike. Talking

1148
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,727
I don't know

1149
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,495
I'll let you decide

1150
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,079
Corner in Mosel

1151
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,223
Trump

1152
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:26,271
U.s. military leadership

1153
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,575
It's almost smash Isis that Obama

1154
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,951
Checks out and show

1155
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:42,143
Confirm

1156
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:44,959
On the show

1157
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:54,431
Because we have the sources that came on with the courage

1158
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,503
That

1159
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:02,879
Obama and end

1160
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:08,767
Inotorious

1161
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:18,751
We will we will we will not help

1162
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:22,079
I'll kind of nice and take over that was our military compromise

1163
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,199
Your father's later anytime

1164
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,015
You made that agreement

1165
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,087
To begin to Segway out

1166
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,143
Bilateral

1167
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,959
Laterally three countries involved

1168
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:59,199
I mean only time will tell how it feels like he probably did make that a

1169
00:58:59,455 --> 00:58:59,967
Agreement

1170
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,551
Majorly because

1171
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:06,111
He's still bombing his own

1172
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:12,511
Like really

1173
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:17,375
You really get into murdering your own

1174
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:19,935
You get you get a taste for it

1175
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,471
Next thing you know

1176
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:24,543
I mean his dad was in power from 1971

1177
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,311
2000

1178
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:30,943
Empower from 2000s

1179
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,759
Timer for 17 years

1180
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:34,783
Secret Patriot

1181
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,831
As we all know

1182
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:42,463
I want to do this screaming again

1183
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,743
No no

1184
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,071
And our military

1185
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:51,935
Are military and Russian military

1186
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,031
Secret

1187
00:59:56,287 --> 01:00:00,127
They had to because Obama didn't negotiate that treaty

1188
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:02,175
In concert with the rush The Rush

1189
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:07,295
Woodrow gun Obama inmate

1190
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,087
Is Secret

1191
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:13,695
I'd still the only person who has the balls to talk about it

1192
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,975
Is Alex Jones

1193
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:19,583
It seems like that would be the single greatest deal that

1194
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,143
That anybody could have made regarding Syria

1195
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,167
At least four

1196
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:23,935
You know

1197
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:24,703
Compared

1198
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:27,519
Can go

1199
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,287
Sure

1200
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,823
I don't think he thinks

1201
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,103
I don't think he's made

1202
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,687
Syria

1203
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,671
I don't know I think that

1204
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:49,279
You are the child of a dictator and you become a

1205
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,303
Dictator yourself

1206
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,327
There's a certain

1207
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,607
Standard of living

1208
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:53,887
Used to

1209
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:56,447
Going to England just isn't going to status

1210
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:03,359
I mean if he can take his billions of dollars and go to England probably set up shop I would go to England

1211
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,639
Island

1212
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,943
I will get the f*** on an island

1213
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,991
Doubt

1214
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:11,807
Talk about all the time

1215
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:17,439
A bunch of horseshit

1216
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,975
He was not a Seeker

1217
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:22,815
Right

1218
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:28,191
I would assume that is the only conclusion we can draw

1219
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,471
Assad

1220
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:35,871
Did a double cross on our military that was working against our president

1221
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:38,175
Like no Rogue General

1222
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:40,735
Would ever think that they could negotiate a

1223
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:43,807
Treaty with both Assad and Russia

1224
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,599
Pull it off

1225
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:51,999
Go to work

1226
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:55,071
Alex is like little things

1227
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,095
Talk about

1228
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:58,655
Turtle Schaefer and Mike Flynn

1229
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,191
Saying that they won't be

1230
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,215
Isis

1231
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,263
Air Force

1232
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,031
Right

1233
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,567
Paper is as

1234
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,335
Legit

1235
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:10,687
Bunch of bunch of bulshit

1236
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,735
But we got to move on to this neck

1237
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:14,015
This is where I

1238
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,039
Complains about how

1239
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,063
How crazy is Jabez

1240
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:17,599
Which I mean we can

1241
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:22,975
Call relay

1242
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,511
Everybody but it's got its perks

1243
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:28,863
Imagine my job

1244
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,399
My job

1245
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:35,263
This is just what I'm looking at on the tops of my stats that I haven't read

1246
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,151
Not a true story

1247
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,199
That broke

1248
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,039
Broke somebody

1249
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,319

1250
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:53,439
Last week we broke it Monday or any nice day

01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,975
Iran

1252
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:57,279
What was in the daily mail today

1253
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,887
Secretary of

1254
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:02,911
One of the pups

Francisco

1256
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,543
This whole thing is coming down ladies and gentlemen

1257
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,407
Right

1258
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:18,271
What is the timeline curious what the 2018 Olympic gender

1259
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,807
Regulations look like

1260
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,599

Take your call

1262
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,695
That subject alone

1263
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,975
Amen

1264
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:29,791
Can compete as women and women compete as men

1265
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:33,375
Men just want to go Dominate and get gold medals

1266
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:39,007
The men are chivalrous

1267
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:41,567
The racing

1268
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:45,151
That's enough of that

1269
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,039
I'm reading

1270

01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,223
Rebelled against

Tiny scar

01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,551
Alex Jones is the king

1336
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,319
Pastrami

1337
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,903
Completely false argument against himself

1338
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,951
Father uses to deflect

1339
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,487
From the fact that

1340
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,535
He doesn't really understand the courtesy

1341
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,071
Being levied against him

1342
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,863
Anthony gets just really weird

1343
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,655
That's really weird I think this is

1344
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:20,191
The sort of a sales pitch but it isn't

1345
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:24,287
Body Works here in the military for

1346
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,567
4 years

1347
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,639
Just chat

1348
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:29,919
Got got shot down

1349
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,687
Okay

1350
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:32,479
Irritable bowel

1351
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:36,063
I said listen take this within a month no problems all done

1352
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,623
Sure

1353
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:40,159
A lot of stuff so advanced

1354
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:49,631
Because

1355
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:55,519
I'm not here

1356
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:58,335
Important

1357
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:06,271
In a bunch of

1358
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:18,815
Pictures of criticizing me

1359
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:23,167
Really don't care

1360
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:26,751
Palpitations

1361
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:27,519
Nope

1362
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:32,383
And they showed as proof of my cooking us a bag of coffee

1363
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:38,271
That we buy for like $8 a pound the very best organic concentrated

1364
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,319
High quality

1365
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:46,463
Grown in the mountains of Chiapas Mexico Guatemalan coffee better

1366
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,511
Totally organic

1367
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,047
Covered in iodine

1368
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,327
Cinnamon varieties

1369
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,375
Good and bad

1370
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:56,959
Because we only

1371
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:57,983
Mark it up

1372
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,543
35%

1373
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,335
Nobody does that work

1374
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,383
So I will get back to the rest of

1375
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,687
First thing

1376
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:11,039
Walking back be like map

1377
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:17,439
Is Wal-Mart a couple of ads that I didn't

1378
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:20,255
Alex has started

1379
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:23,071
Maybe this Prosser guard will work for you

1380
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,351
You're still giving us money

1381
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,143
And that's great cuz it's fun to be operation

1382
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:31,519
Food still a win the writing on the wall as far as

1383
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:35,103
A possible cuz it seems like the sales pitch is

1384
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:41,503
You might not need this and it might not work but we need your money to keep up firestick Global exactly

1385
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,319
Maybe it'll work I don't f****** care

1386
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,599
It helps if it doesn't

1387
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:46,879
You still

1388
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:47,647
Payforit

1389
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:52,511
Is the master of

1390
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,279
Strawman

1391
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:55,071
After what he's done

1392
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:58,655
You've taken these articles and

1393
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,983
Because he sells two kinds of

1394
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:03,519
One of them

1395
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,799
Is just normal coffee

1396
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,079
What's the other

1397
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:11,455
The other one is wake up America immune support

1398
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:16,319
Mushroom

1399
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,087
2

1400
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:20,927
Now I'm back on board the reason that this coffee is meant

1401
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,695
It's not

1402
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:25,791
Now back off.

1403
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,839
In this article is like in this case

1404
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,119
Reishi mushroom

1405
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,911
It's by

1406
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,191
Just quote from this court

1407
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:38,335
Phone got more fungi with a load of supposed health benefits current research shows that no scientific evidence

1408
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,359
To support the claim

1409
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,383
That reishi mushroom

1410
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,175
Petit vour increase stamina

1411
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,967
The reason that it's

1412
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,503
Included in here is because

1413
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,039
Paltrow's product

1414
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:48,831
Spirit.

1415
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,623
That features Rishi bossk

1416
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,903
Also it's

1417
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,207
Featured any wake up America I mean

1418
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,487
Further

1419
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:56,255
Cordyceps

1420
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,023
Maps mushrooms

1421
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,559
That

1422
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:00,863
They're supposed to

1423
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,935
Actors in natural aphrodisiac

1424
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,471
An improved

1425
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:08,031
That's also when the Wake Up America blend

1426
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:08,799
Coffee

1427
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:12,127
But there's a whole nother mushroom

1428
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,967
This bets that cordyceps one is in

1429
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:17,503
Gwyneth Paltrow

1430
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,039
Little product called Sun potion

1431
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,319
And it's also

1432
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,087
Found in

1433
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,367
Chiapas

1434
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,135
Farmers

1435
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:25,695
EXO

1436
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,975
These are being attacked because

1437
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,279
Because

1438
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,559
He uses the same

1439
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:33,375
Pseudo-scientific

1440
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:35,167
That product

1441
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:40,287
Now

1442
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:42,847
Look

1443
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:49,247
That might have been a better strategy

1444
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:52,063
Strawman argument

1445
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,903
Coffee's great

1446
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,999
The reason you have to do that is deep

1447
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,279
This article

1448
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,047
Is

1449
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,327
Bulshit

1450
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,119
Like these mushroom

1451
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:07,167
Like these unproven herb

1452
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:11,519
Are being sold by three different people with very different package

1453
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:12,799
Tilted

1454
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:13,567
Different audience

1455
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,615
Right

1456
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:17,919
That's the mark of b*******

1457
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:18,687
Well if

1458
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,711
Infowars

1459
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:22,527
You would look at a good product

1460
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,295
I can be like

1461
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:28,415
This is obviously nothing this is fake bulshit

1462
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,463
Sun potion and be like there's something

1463
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,279
Buyer

1464
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:37,375
You would look at Infowars and be like this is obviously bulshit

1465
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,679
So that you take criticism on

1466
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:44,031
Alex and the mentality of this like

1467
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,055
Quick Fix Magic

1468
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,079
Right

1469
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:47,871
I mean it's interesting

1470
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:48,895
Sandpoint

1471
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,455
Infowars super male vitality

1472
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:52,735
Group sales

1473
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:53,759
Sex.

1474
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,343
Similar

1475
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,367
I'm in on sex

1476
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:04,255
Kelly song about 10 years ago

1477
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:08,095
Is dodging the criticism

1478
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,119
That

1479
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:14,751
Yo it's a bunch of bulshit

1480
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:21,663
A lot of the FDA is the supplement industry is like billions of dollars

1481
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,431
Puryear

1482
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,967
Yeah

1483
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,271
90% of supplements

1484
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,295
Magic

1485
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:30,879
They are placebos and sometimes

1486
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,159
The placebo effect

1487
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:33,695
Stronger

1488
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,231
Sure it isn't

1489
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,511
Possible that take

1490
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:39,327
Supplements actually does help you out

1491
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,631
But not because of Any ingredients

1492
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,423
Jubilee

1493
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,519
I don't care

1494
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,287
I don't know

1495
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,823
Anybody for

1496
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:51,103
Enjoying

1497
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,383
The benefits

1498
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:53,407
Placebo effect

1499
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:57,759
I'm not real two people making millions of dollars off selling people

1500
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:58,527
Placebo effect

1501
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,807
Under The Lights

1502
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,087
Auspices of

1503
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:07,231
My chiropractor

1504
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,255
Is this

1505
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,815
It smells like willful

1506
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:11,839
I like naughty

1507
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,887
Engaging with the ex

1508
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:17,983
Bring up coffee alright I'm going to say if they say I can't sell coffee

1509
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,007
Rat boom

1510
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:21,311
It's a dunk

1511
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,079
It's like

1512
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,871
They say I can't do

1513
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,151
Sprite

1514
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,455
Supermarket

1515
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:29,503
Yeah you're saying that you're dumb

1516
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:36,927
Alonzo

1517
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,279
I don't think I could ethically live with it I would feel

1518
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,815
Very guilty about it

1519
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,607
Feel guilty enough people donate

1520
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:48,959
The show for nothing maybe in the future we'll see

1521
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:51,007
But like Knoxville

1522
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,967
Is there somebody at the door

1523
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:00,735
Now those are

1524
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:05,343
Wichita

1526
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,463
Yogaville VA

Call Certified the rest of it

1543
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:26,239
Proven

1544
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,335
Why is the Washington Post come out

1545
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:33,151
A bunch saying I shall

1546
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:35,199
Supplement cause you'd suck wax up

1547
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:43,135
Just move on to this next clip cuz this

1548
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,159
Is like

1549
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:45,439
I'm so glad

1550
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:51,071
He threw me a softball on this

1551
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:52,351
I can't

1552
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:56,703
So there's a CNN article about the genetic lineage of the Egyptian

1553
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:00,287
Apparently

1554
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,311
Studies

1555
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,335
Testing

1556
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,895
And found that the people of Egypt

1557
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,431
We're not necessarily Africa

1558
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:08,991
From Asia and Europe

1559
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,271
Rat

1560
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:11,807
Cool

1561
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:13,343
However

1562
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,647
Alex

1563
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,951
Runs runs the ball downfield

1564
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:24,351
And immediately just Falls over on its side

1565
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,655
It's just what the DNA test

1566
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:27,935
What

1567
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,471
What

1568
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:31,519
24 years ago

1569
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,287
The first

1570
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:34,079
Global historian

1571
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:41,247
Play the also said we should have a world government teleport people

1572
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:43,295
Model 12:00 today

1573
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:45,087
Wasn't very nice

1574
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:49,695
Father of what you call philosophy

1575
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:53,023
He said there was an ocean

1576
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,583
Flying machine

1577
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:59,679
Powerful

1578
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:05,055
Daddy blew up the entire Island

1579
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,847
Anime the temperature get cold

1580
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,431
I would come up with that

1581
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,503
A couple things

1582
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,295
First plant was the

1583
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:17,343
Plot of Disney's Atlantis

1584
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,111
Which

1585
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,647
Great movie

1586
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,415
Underrated

1587
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,951
Underrated how great.

1588
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,047
Herodotus

1589
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:31,679
Play-Doh also breed

1590
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,703
Xenophon was

1591
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,495
Contemporary play doesn't

1592
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,263
The story ends

1593
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:37,055
That's a little

1594
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,079
That's a little bugger

1595
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,359
Now

1596
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,919
Scholar

1597
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:47,807
I'm also crazy

1598
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,855
I love Atlanta

1599
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,135
Okay so

1600
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,159
I'm here to tell you

1601
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:56,255
Is taken the movie

1602
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,791
Disney's Atlantis

1603
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:59,583
Not Play-Doh

1604
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:01,631
Pizza Plano Road about Atlanta

1605
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:02,655
Intuit

1606
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:03,935
There's two

1607
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,215
Dialogues

1608
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:05,983
Socrates

1609
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:06,751
Right

1610
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:09,055
Critias and Timaya

1611
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,871
Those stories

1612
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:15,711
There's no flying

1613
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:19,039
There is no darkening of the sky

1614
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:25,695
Yeah basically and I believe I believe prettiest is the longer one

1615
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,743
It has

1616
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:28,511
Ditto

1617
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:29,279
It's app

1618
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,303
Poseidon's land

1619
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:36,959
From

1620
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:38,495
Divine

1621
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,519
Lineage

1622
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,127
Become decadent

1623
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:46,943
The end of the story is cut off from the

1624
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:50,015
It did not survive today from

1625
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,039
Original source

1626
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:57,439
In tomatoes

1627
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:59,487
And they all lived happily ever after

1628
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:03,327
A minute to talk about how there was

1629
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,007
Fought on behalf of

1630
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:11,775
The Greeks

1631
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,567
I am saved Greek civilization

1632
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,592
From slavery

1633
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,688
Punishment

1634
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:21,760
Gotcha in one night there was earthquake

1635
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,040
Bi-Lo

1636
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:27,136
Which is not really read

1637
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,160
Too far into it

1638
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:31,488
You could say oh that's because of a power source they create

1639
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,024
But that is not immature

1640
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,048
At all

1641
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,328
That's extrapolation

1642
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,608
Now further

1643
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,912
Where did you get these ideas Play-Doh

1644
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:40,448
Where did you get them

1645
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:41,728
I don't know

1646
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:44,032
Guess what there in the text

1647
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:46,848
Don't understand it actually read

1648
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:50,944
Timaeus or critias

1649
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,248
If he had he would know that in

1650
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,784
Actual tax

1651
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:55,808
It explained

1652
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,088
That Plato heard

1653
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,112
A grandfather

1654
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:04,768
So long the great ruler

1655
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,376
And they told him the Mets

1656
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,424
And he brought it

1657
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:12,704
And told Plato's

1658
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,752
Patronage

1659
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:15,776
His fathers

1660
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:18,592
Diana got passed on to him as though.

1661
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:20,128
Come up with

1662
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,112
You can read

1663
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,392
The passage about Atlanta

1664
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:33,696
It's very short

1665
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,976
It has all of those

1666
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:39,840
And further Alex don't want to f****** bring up sold on my man

1667
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,376
You don't want to do it

1668
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:42,144
What

1669
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,960
Because he was one of the best rulers in all of history

1670
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:46,496
Can't think of any reason

1671
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,520
Save this

1672
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,800
The Greek population

1673
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:49,824
From self-destruction

1674
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:50,848
Oh yeah it was a cousin

1675
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:51,616
The Second Amendment

1676
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:54,432
It was totally Prosperity base

1677
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:59,040
Renaissance 1.0

1678
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:02,624
I believe that would be Renaissance - 0

1679
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,208
Dino

1680
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:07,232
DS Stasia

1681
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:09,536
Wherever

1682
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:12,608
Right everybody was forgiven of their debt

1683
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:18,496
Because tons of people had become a higher class

1684
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:19,776
Civilization was

1685
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,384
It was exactly

1686
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,664
Applied successfully

1687
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,432
What time is it

1688
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:29,248
Civilization

1689
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,856
And Alex's baby have to know something about that

1690
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:35,648
Reply to the modern

1691
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:42,048
Ruling class

1692
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:48,448
Call the billionaire Elite who were sucking the lives of their portal

1693
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,728
And even sold on back

1694
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:50,752
Then

1695
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,032
You know whatever so I can

1696
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:52,800
Wayback

1697
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:53,824
Year that was

1698
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,616
Was aware of the fact

1699
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:58,432
Social inequality was going

1700
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,480
Completely destroyed

1701
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:02,016
You've known it forever

1702
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:04,320
Cuz it always happens that way

1703
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:05,856
It happens that way

1704
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:07,392
Literally every time

1705
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:12,256
Exactly

1706
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:15,584
Why doesn't anybody ever forget

1707
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,168
So Alex in order to tell his bulshit story about it

1708
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,216
Site

1709
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:27,104
The Disney movie and claim its with Plato wrote about instead of actually reading Play-Doh

1710
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,664
Knowing what he said about it last

1711
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,456
Susannah where that came from

1712
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:35,296
So long guy look into it

1713
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:39,392
Ruler

1714
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:41,440
Play-Doh

1715
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:46,560
The Republic is a little bit weird

1716
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:49,120
There's a lot of stuff in there

1717
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,912
Publix

1718
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:55,008
Really the way that I would

1719
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:57,056
Do it but you know what you going to do

1720
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:58,336
B b stretch

1721
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:00,896
To say that he is bi template of the modern

1722
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,832
Who's that at the door

1723
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,952
How do you spell on how have you been doing do you have any good ideas

1724
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:14,720
You're busted

1725
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:19,840
Well I will shake off the burden of that.

1726
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:24,448
Are you forgiving me of my bus

1727
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:26,240
Wonderful you're dumb

1728
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,288
You should read the things you say you read

1729
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:30,848
Funny

1730
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:34,688
10:30 read it but they literally said that

1731
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:37,248
Quote from Atlantis

1732
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,528
Character is saying

1733
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,112
They said that there was a an unimaginable power source

1734
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,136
And it's not

1735
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:43,904
Anywhere

1736
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,720
Not in Play-Doh

1737
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:47,744
He was a great

1738
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:52,608
The Road to El Dorado

1739
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:58,240
I don't know if

1740
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,824
We already knew that

1741
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,104
But it's fun time

1742
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:03,872
Rihanna

1743
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:07,456
I also will say I've read a ton of other stuff

1744
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,016
Crazier about Atlanta

1745
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,320
Much less

1746
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:14,624
I've some of that stuff matches up with

1747
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,392
Some of the lights

1748
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,416
Theosophist

1749
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:21,280
Helena blavatsky

1750
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:23,072
Those type of people who have like

1751
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:24,608
Channeling sessions

1752
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,888
With people about their past

1753
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:29,216
Atlanta

1754
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:29,984
Puppyworld

1755
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,264
That has some of the

1756
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,800
Pieces of what Alex's sort of

1757
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:33,568
Espousing

1758
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,384
When we talked

1759
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,432
I'm last episode about

1760
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,736
Randy Cramer and his

1761
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:42,784
Holographic regenerative medbay

1762
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,560
Future Technologies are globalstar keeping from us

1763
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,840
REI

1764
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:56,608
Specific

1765
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:58,400
In this case he could say like

1766
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:01,472
I watch the Disney movie with my kids about Atlantis is amazing

1767
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:03,264
You can't say that he has to say like

1768
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,312
Play-Doh

1769
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,384
If anybody

1770
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,408
Who listens to

1771
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,176
Infowars

1772
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,456
Will ever read

1773
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:13,504
Anything that

1774
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:19,136
You can go check it out

1775
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:27,072
Stuff about Atlantis and there are like

1776
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,864
Real world

1777
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,168
Equivalence of that idea like Pompeii

1778
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,960
Is is that thing

1779
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:34,240
Kind of concept of

1780
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,008
Look at this

1781
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,568
City that was an instant

1782
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:39,360
Yeah but

1783
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,128
Exact

1784
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:43,968
Do you have islands like that

1785
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:44,736
To the bottom of the old

1786
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:49,344
Is there is a volcano

1787
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,880
Possibilities that it is

1788
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,928
Based in some reality

1789
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:55,232
True story to it I believe in Atlantis

1790
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,256
Fanciful

1791
01:26:59,072 --> 01:26:59,584
Care that it's

1792
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:03,424
Irene I don't go with it being a

1793
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,728
Very real allegory

1794
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,776
I can look at some of his Atlanta stuff

1795
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,568
There's cautionary

1796
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,944
Everybody

1797
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:19,040
Be the best time for me to announce that in addition to that's what they want you to take coming back

1798
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:25,440
I may be restarting my paranormal podcast that I do solo

1799
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:31,840
But that will be behind so

1800
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,680
Never who cares

1801
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:36,960
Let's get back to CNM

1802
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:44,384
Alright I'm back to cnn.cnn much b******* they are

1803

In the stratosphere

1805
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:05,632
Hey sweetie I can wait too good half-hour on this s*** right here

1806
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:08,448
Because Kathy Griffin got fired

1807
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,472
Before they launch

1808
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,240
Frittata

1809
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:12,032
The CNN is Isis

1810
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:12,800
Meme

1811
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:13,824
Has morphed

1812
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,360
And they've changed it now to

1813
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:22,272
Propaganda campaigns based on Trump

1814
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,600
That's footsoldier

1815
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:26,880
You're not working

1816
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:29,184
That's nothing new

1817
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:33,536
I'm just glad all out War

1818
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:40,448
When people breaking their conditioning

1819
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:45,568
Responding attempts to silence and muzzle and stifle speech

1820
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,360
But just intensifying

1821
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:57,088
Getting my head chopped off

1822
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,112
Meme machine

1823
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:08,864
But now the maps are just absolutely completely

1824
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:12,704
Oh I love that Leah famous one of Muhammad Ali

1825
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:15,008

1827
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:20,128
You could hear it in his voice cuz he's just watch

Better hundred eighty thousand dollars

1845
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,864
But

01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,448
Show the check

1847
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:53,824
I believe

1848
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,616
Seven or eight people have been paid by

1849
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:58,176
Maybe I'm willing to believe that

1850
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:59,456
Because like

1851
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:00,992
It's been

1852
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:02,272
A month-and-a-half

Bigi everybody's gotten online but that's not good enough you're not on the news

1858
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:15,840
That's lazy

1859
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:21,216
The $20,000 is

1860
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:23,776

You just might be taking a bath this might be a lost leader as they say

1869
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:40,672
So they're going to talk

1870
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:41,696
A bunch about Isis

1871
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:54,752
They get distracted

1872
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:56,032

Probably in the 5:45

1876
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:01,920
16 year old Ray

1877
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:06,528
Alex is not really recognize that it's a child

1878
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:07,296
He's talking to

1879
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:09,856
And they do not care

1880
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:10,624
I made this

1881
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:12,416
Nonsense story

1882
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:26,752
And we've hit every goal by your support and by God's Providence and we're now preparing to go to the next level

1883
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:30,080

1884
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:39,040
Gobble

01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:44,416
Unisom plus be spared

Make yourself a bank. Go ahead what's your political points

1891
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:20,000
It started but after I started watching you know us for Trump and stuff

1892
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:22,560
My dad watches and forwards as well

1893
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:28,448
He's a warrior he was in the Army I'm going into the army I'm getting ready for that

1894
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:33,312
My dad they wouldn't even let him in that first actually it was a famous story all over the news

1895
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:34,336
He walks

1896
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,176
Simpson from Michigan

1897
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:44,832
Because they wouldn't let him in cuz they said he had a foot problem so he walked with combat boots and he walks straight all the way to wash

1898
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,624
Until he got

1899
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:50,976
The general and told that they want to take them back

1900
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:54,048
So they took him back and he got into the army

1901
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:57,120
And he went through all of that to get in

1902
01:33:57,376 --> 01:34:03,520
And I'm really impressed by that

1903
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:05,824

1904
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:12,224

1909
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:21,952
I could not find anything

1910
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:27,840
Based on keywords like man walks from Michigan to DC military combat boots

1911
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:29,888
I don't know if

1912
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:30,656
Whatever

1913
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:32,192
Perversion is not accurate

1914
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:38,336
In terms of

1915
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:41,664
Functioning with

1916
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,712
Adolescent

1917
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:46,016
Mental process

1918
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:46,784
Is childish

1919
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:50,624
Dimensions of a foot problem

1920
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:54,464
Put on

1921
01:34:54,720 --> 01:35:00,864
You missing a lot of details in there that did not have the plot of the Disney movie Atlantis

1922
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:08,800
Is her talking about how I wasn't for Trump

1923
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:11,104
And then I listen to you

1924
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:18,528
A couple times

1925
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:21,344
That's how it works

1926
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:22,624
You know you are

1927
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:27,232
Dumb down and radicalized by those

1928
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:29,536
But then the other

1929
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:30,816
The other thing

1930
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:31,584
Super funny

1931
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:33,632
The inability

1932
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,400
2

1933
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:35,424
Connect the dots

1934
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:36,960
Between her

1935
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:39,520
Theoretically heroic father

1936
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:40,544
Who had a foot

1937
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,872
Condition wasn't allowed in the military walk to Washington

1938
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:44,640
To become a soldier

1939
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:50,528
And Donald Trump who faked a foot injury to get out of don't know

1940
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:55,904
Parallel

1941
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:57,184
Don't think about it

1942
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:58,976
These are things you don't

1943
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:01,024
The problem I have with that

1944
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:02,048
Is of course

1945
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,096
That is a very common

1946
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:09,216
Story as far as far as the military

1947
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,240
There is that like

1948
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:13,312
I'm going into the military and they are

1949
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:15,872
Very high percentage of the

1950
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,152
Hard right

1951
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:26,112
Hops that list

1952
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:28,928
All of this stuff is built around like

1953
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,768
I don't want any of these people with authority and guns

1954
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:39,936
Believing b******* ethology

1955
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:41,984
Numbers of

1956
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:42,752
Not going up again

1957
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,544
By the way just to give you guys

1958
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:48,640
I looked into the

1959
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:50,688
Information about

1960
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:52,480
Professions and he is not

1961
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:59,136
Army people

1962
01:36:59,392 --> 01:36:59,904
Here's another thing

1963
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:02,976
I don't think I'm going to play it on our next investigation episode

1964
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:06,304
But I found a clip from 2015 where he says literally

1965
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:08,096
Eighty percent of our audio

1966
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,376
Is on the radio

1967
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:12,704
Radio listeners are our secret weapon

1968
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:15,008
Now if that's true

1969
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,544
His audience is

1970
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,336
Way smaller than

1971
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:19,104
Right

1972
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,640
Because if 80%

1973
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:21,408
His audience

1974
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:22,688
Is on radio

1975
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:23,968
And

1976
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:26,016
Those numbers are

1977
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:27,040
Very available

1978
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:29,088
Smaller audience

1979
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,672
The Kim Komando Show

1980
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:33,440
Right

1981
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,720
Has

1982
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:36,768
F****** audio

1983
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:38,560
Crazy

1984
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:39,584
I like

1985
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,864
I know what you doing

1986
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:43,936
She is saying the population

1987
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:46,752
Kings of cities where he's in the market

1988
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:48,800
Yeah I think that's what he must be.

1989
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:51,104
Cuz that's how you get to 40 million

1990
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,128
Or whatever

1991
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:57,760
80 million a week of every city

1992
01:37:58,016 --> 01:38:02,112
New York La in Chicago that make up a big chunk of it

1993
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:04,928
Yet three stations in bumfuk Idaho

1994
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,232
That's going to make up a little chunk

1995
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:08,000
Pennywise

1996
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,048
3 station

1997
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,840
Susan Idaho that's about

1998
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:12,864
30 million

1999
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:16,192
Can people right I probably get 10 million / Idaho

2000
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:17,216
Carry the zero

2001
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:18,496
No

2002
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:29,248
Liana Brackett is back what was she doing

2003
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:33,088
She's apparently caring for her elderly grandmother in Florida

2004
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,624
Which is code for

2005
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,696
That's very sweet

2006
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:40,768
I would I don't know if I would like it if that was true

2007
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:42,560
I have no reason to

2008
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,840
To doubt her except for

2009
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:45,120
Her being involved in a

2010
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,656
Completely lie based

2011
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:53,568
Stretches The credibility a tiny bit it is believable just seems like a sweet lady

2012
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:58,688
Did you look it up and see whether or not her Grandma's been dead

2013
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:01,760
For twenty years I've not I don't care

2014
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:04,320
Even though she's dead

2015
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:06,112
Okay

2016
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:10,976
Iran

2017
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:12,512

U.s. code

2027
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,760
Well the reason that they're claiming it is a misrepresentation

2028
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:07,552
Temptation of that line from

2029
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:09,344
The story where they reserve the right

2030
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,880

To post meme

2036

Games that are flagrantly

2037
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:20,608
Maybe they shouldn't

2038
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:23,680
Phrases that way but that's not blackmail

2039
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:25,216
The biggest issue with that

2040
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:27,264
The writer

2041
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:29,312
Is the one

2042
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:30,336
All of that

2043
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,104
That shitt

2044
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:33,408
And that clearly CNN's legal to

2045
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:35,456
It's probably a policy position

2046
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:38,016
Yeah that was not that

2047
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:39,808
He's the one or she's that I don't know who

2048
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:42,624
That that person is the one getting

2049
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,184
All of the death ride

2050
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:45,952
That's all of that

2051
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:49,024
Meanwhile some some lawyer in the background

2052
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,096
His name is nowhere near this thing

2053
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:55,680
Well actually

2054
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:03,872
I mean I get you get into a car accident

2055
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:05,664
Do you have mesothelioma

2056
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,968
Come on down.

2057
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:09,504
You're going to walk

2058
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,832
So Alex I get weary

2059
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:13,856
Coming from cuz

2060
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:15,136
In his mind

2061
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,160
Because he's dumb

2062
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:16,928
I have brains

2063
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,464
He doesn't know how to read

2064
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:20,512
He see something like that

2065
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:22,560
And the way his brain processes

2066
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:23,328
Is

2067
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,120
They're threatening him

2068
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:27,168
Post

2069
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:28,448
Future

2070
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:29,216
We're going to talk

2071
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:33,824
Weirdos on the internet

2072
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,104
Have responded

2073
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:38,176
That's the sort of narrative

2074
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:43,040
Narrative that's what they would do

2075
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:49,696
Like that's what the alt-right would do is

2076
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:54,816
They wouldn't even bother blackmail

2077
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:59,168
There is actually a reasonable

2078
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,192
Yeah

2079
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,240
Now that's a good that's a good point

2080
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,520
There's so much projects

2081
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:05,056
In terms of what Alex thinks

2082
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:06,336
The globalist would do

2083
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,920
He's doing let's get through this

2084
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,456
McAdoo

2085
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:12,480
Make some points

2086
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:15,552
Is tragically dumb in the

2087
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:16,576
Glipizide

2088
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:20,160
Now I still Lottery

2089
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,696
We should have a

2090
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:24,000
We should have a double date with

2091
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:30,144
Usually added me and Carrie Callahan

2092
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,960
Come on

2093
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:37,312
We raise money online to get them money goes to

2094
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:40,128
Charity

2095
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,176
Stickman

2096
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,200
At a prison or whatever

2097
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:46,272
F****** alright cause that's the end Macado's

2098
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:49,344
Charity

2099
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,960
Terroristic threats

2100
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:07,520
Finish report

2101
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:11,360
Julian Assange breaks it down

2102
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:37,984
Reporting

2103
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:52,832
That are

2104
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:01,024
To take choice to do all that stuff

2105
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:02,304
He

2106
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,608
Requested anonymity when he was talking with

2107
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:05,888
Because

2108
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:07,936
The anti-semitic ship

2109
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:08,960
He had been posting

2110
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:11,008
And the past would cause

2111
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:12,032
Major problems

2112
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,080
It would destroy his life

2113
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:16,896
Consequence of his

2114
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:19,456
Sprite and that's why I argue

2115
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:22,016
Dino Dino your position on it night time

2116
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,552
See the light of that too

2117
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:25,344
But

2118
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:26,624
Do not do that

2119
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,928
To somebody give them a chance

2120
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,208
To make good on

2121
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:32,768
As opposed to

2122
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:37,120
Complete destruction

2123
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:39,936
I agree with their response to

2124
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:42,496
Agree with the apology

2125
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:43,264
Giving him

2126
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:46,848
Cover I don't agree with him

2127
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:48,128
Like

2128
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:52,736
I mean I think it's

2129
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:55,552
Too good I think it's a very good thing leprosy

2130
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:56,576
Two Docs

2131
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,136
I don't I don't buy it

2132
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:00,928
Kobe report

2133
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:06,048
But Bistro publishes home address

2134
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:09,632
Someone else Fox would be like

2135
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:10,656
Call look at this f******

2136
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:15,264
Can sell out

2137
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,544
I didn't go get them

2138
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:21,664
Somebody would blackmail

2139
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:26,272
And also this

2140
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:32,672
This paragraph

2141
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:35,744
I need a private citizen

2142
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:54,688
They're going to go ahead and

2143
01:45:54,944 --> 01:46:01,088
Ruin my life

2144
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:02,112
This is why

2145
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:07,488
The fort

2146
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:14,656
Destroyer

2147
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:18,752
That's a little dramatic

2148
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,056
That's a little extreme

2149
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,896
You know the static Gulag really went after

2150
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:26,688
Against Jews

2151
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:27,456
Thyroid

2152
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:30,528
They were super against people posting racist memes about Jews

2153
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:32,320
Globalist

2154
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:35,136
This political correctness social engineering

2155
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:38,976
Understand

2156
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:40,000
Different color

2157
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:41,024
Whatever

2158
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,072
Cars

2159
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:45,632
I like I like

2160
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,936
Leanne Macado's ability to spin-a-yarn

2161
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:48,960
Duromine

2162
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:50,240
Cheese if you're dumb

2163
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:51,520
That makes sense

2164
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:54,080
But it doesn't match up with the fact that doesn't match up

2165
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:54,848
But the truth

2166
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:56,128
That guy isn't saying

2167
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:57,664
Please don't

2168
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:58,432
Things

2169
01:46:58,688 --> 01:46:59,200
Like

2170
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:08,672
He just apologized for being a dick know what happened

2171
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:10,976
He didn't realize the magnitude of his actions

2172
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:13,536
You didn't realize oh s***

2173
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:15,328
People are really hurt by

2174
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:18,400
Me being a f****** jew-hating a******

2175
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:20,448
Right people

2176
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:21,216
Beavis

2177
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:22,240
I think I can

2178
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:23,520
Constructed where I marked

2179
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:25,056
The Jews

2180
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:28,640
Can you work with this guy which

2181
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,200
How else

2182
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:32,992
That. Well

2183
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:35,552
No I am to let's say I don't know you

2184
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:38,880
I have a grandmother or grandfather

2185
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:39,904
Had to wear

2186
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:42,464
F****** Star of David identify themselves

2187
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:43,744
I in German

2188
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:44,512
Let's

2189
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:46,816
Yeah that sucks

2190
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:51,168
Yeah that's a real Alex not being able to

2191
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:53,472
Think that he saw racism as a child

2192
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:54,496
Maybe you don't

2193
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:55,520
Understand that experience

2194
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:58,336
And I'm not saying I fully do myself

2195
01:47:58,592 --> 01:48:00,384
But I've heard it from people

2196
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,408
I empathize

2197
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:02,432
I understand

2198
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:04,480
Small degree

2199
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:09,088
And so what I believe

2200
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,112
Wholeheartedly

2201
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,136
Is

2202
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,416
Vnn

2203
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:13,440
Figured it out

2204
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:17,024
Which is

2205
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:20,096
Unsuccessfully

2206
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:22,400
I need soon as the outside world

2207
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:23,424
Hoped

2208
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:24,704
I was like

2209
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,240
We'd like to talk to you about this

2210
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:27,008
He was like

2211
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:29,056
Randall middle child

2212
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:30,336
Who I mean

2213
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:32,896
There are varying reports

2214
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:36,224
That's the most credible is Imperial middle-aged

2215
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:39,040
Not a fifteen-year-old

2216
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:39,808
Folks

01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:43,136

01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:52,096
Adult well if they if they do some if someone

Are Anonymous person on Reddit does something that everyone loves

2221
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,704
Then it doesn't matter

2222
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:03,616
You do something

2223
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:05,664
Assholes

2224
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:06,944
But

2225
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:09,504
CNN

2226
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:11,552
The reality like

My God happened in my life

2229
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:19,488
Where everything comes

2230
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:20,256
The Poconos

2231
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:23,840
School Pullins

2232
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:25,888
Oh no

2233
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:31,520
Shouldn't have stolen this

2234
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:33,312
Shouldn't have a habit of

2235
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:35,616
Stealing these Rice Krispies treats

2236
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:38,944
Yeah

2237
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:40,992
Absolutely

2238
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:41,760
Situation

2239
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:43,552
His tentative

2240
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,088
Is forced

2241
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,112
Certainly

2242
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:46,880
In the Sun

2243
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:47,648
That

2244
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:48,672
The real world

2245
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:50,208
Start looking

2246
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:52,000
Forest

2247
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:52,768
Innocence

2248
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:53,792
Will threaten

2249
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:54,816
You with

2250
01:49:58,144 --> 01:49:59,424
People actually care

2251
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,704
And you got to deal with

2252
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:05,568
Responsibility

2253
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:08,384
Anonymously

2254
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:09,408
Like

2255
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:11,968
He didn't eat his apology

2256
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:15,552
He didn't hide behind

2257
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:17,088
He said

2258
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:19,904
This is this is something that's wrong and I did this

2259
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:23,232
And I agree that it's sort of hiding behind

2260
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,512
The idea of

2261
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:27,840
Audio Addiction of me and culture but I also like

2262
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:30,144
Expressed earlier I think that's real

2263
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:32,448
A real thing

2264
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:34,752
And I don't think that

2265
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:35,776
It's cowardly of him

2266
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:36,800
To bring that up

2267
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:38,080
As much as it is

2268
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,152
An insightful

2269
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:42,432
Be that as it may

2270
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:43,200
My eye itches

2271
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:46,528
But definitely

2272
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:50,112
Securing the show off

2273
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:55,488
We got a little more but

2274
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:58,048
Alex has a variant

2275
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:00,096
What's going on

2276
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,632
How they discovered

2277
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,400
Birthday identity

2278
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:07,776
The way Trump is very

2279
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:12,384
Bloody severed heads they say murdering

2280
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:17,760
They say the guy's a hero that shot scalise

2281
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:21,344
He just puts out an old video WWE with somebody else

2282
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,880
Logo

2283
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:24,160
It's not Hillary sad

2284
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:28,512
Do the president did some video shoot

2285
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:30,048
I would say

2286
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:45,664
Ultraviolence

2287
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,016
Exposing

2288
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:11,520
Jamaica versus other people and resisting

2289
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:17,152
Maybe there been some other

2290
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:22,784
Three of their employees had to resign

2291
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:26,368
This will be gone from our conscious

2292
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:31,488
But be that as it may. This theory that the Deep

2293
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:36,864
Is behind is

2294
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:37,632
Yeah

2295
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:38,656
I don't post

2296
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:39,936
Annie

2297
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:40,960
Cuz I know

2298
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:43,008
That is very easy for

2299
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,824
You know crazy people who have a lot of time

2300
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:47,616
Figure out who people are by their Pope

2301
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:53,504
So they figured I'd like a single reporter figured out who which is it

2302
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:55,808
It wasn't wasn't

2303
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:57,088
The director of the FBI

2304
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:00,928
They found his Twitter feed

2305
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:04,000
Followers

2306
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:05,536
Had to do was just cross reference

2307
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:06,304
It's a bunch of different

2308
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,072
Post

2309
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:07,840
And there it is

2310
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:11,424
I don't know that story and I think I saw some post

2311
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,448
I thought it might be

2312
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:13,216
Lakeside

2313
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,032
Interesting

2314
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,640
About the Deep State being evolved

2315
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:23,200
But we're not here

2316
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:27,808
The Deep state has nothing

2317
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:29,088
Sing better to do

2318
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:30,880
This guy made a meme

2319
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:32,416
We've got

2320
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:34,208
We are up to or not

2321
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:35,488
I'm trying to

2322
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:36,512
To get this f******

2323
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:38,048
Fake rush it to fly

2324
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:40,352
Guys we need a day off

2325
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:47,520
Let's take a m and f*** with this guy

2326
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:53,920
Do whatever yeah what's up

2327
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:56,224
Let's fuk with this one

2328
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:58,784
Another dumb Theory

2329
01:53:59,040 --> 01:53:59,808
Involves username

2330
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:04,672
Online name

2331
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:13,632
Noticed a black it out not to give the user any attention

2332
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:18,752
Don't they get now the new memes about to be in the hundreds of millions of views per hour

2333
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:25,152
So when bingo

2334
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:36,928
We should be pass

2335
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:42,304
Glycol we need to protect

2336
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:45,632
Children won the children are not f****** watch and see

2337
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:47,680
They're Not Innocent anymore

2338
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:49,984
Did the amount of pork

2339
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:54,336
The day of scene at this point

2340
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:55,616
Themself

2341
01:54:55,872 --> 01:55:01,760
Are on Xbox calling people the worst

2342
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:02,528
Things that they can

2343
01:55:02,784 --> 01:55:03,296
Totally

2344
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:05,344
Sis.

2345
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,392
Well it's

2346
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:08,928
Let me see rules

2347
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:10,464
I have to worry about most of the

2348
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,256
Except on those Phantom

2349
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:16,352
About this BNN

2350
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:18,912
Punchline

2351
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:22,752
To the whole thing I will play if you pick up

2352
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:24,032
On y

2353
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:25,312
This is

2354
01:55:25,824 --> 01:55:26,592
Hilarious

2355
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:37,088
Beehive

2356
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:49,888
I bet my bottom dollar that got this from other sources

2357
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:51,424
We know

2358
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,216
That mainstream media

2359
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:57,056
No one

2360
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:04,992
I mean every phone I've got is its come out

2361
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:08,064
From the sheriff department

2362
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:11,136
You get it

2363
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:13,184
That seems like a way larger problem

2364
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:14,464
Text Dennis Montgomery

2365
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:17,280
Is it that the sheriff's

2366
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,816
Department that's Joe Arpaio

2367
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,120
The wiretapping

2368
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:22,912
Just he's using that again

2369
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:23,936
Really

2370
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:24,704
Yeah

2371
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:28,032
I mean for the problem is

2372
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:32,896
The problem with that being Dennis Montgomery is that is also a very real thing

2373
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:34,176
That is going on

2374
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:37,248
No that's true

2375
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:40,064
That is one

2376
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:41,088
Hundred percent

2377
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:41,856
Montgomery

2378
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:44,160
Being used

2379
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:46,976
Much like the gay cocaine orgies at the battle

2380
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,048
Regency

2381
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:51,584
Full display

2382
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:54,656
He does that from time to time drop-in the Arpaio

2383
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:57,728
Stuff is all just that

2384
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:01,568
Hours to fergo listen to that episode cuz

2385
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:06,176
I don't think we've ever done a better job of burying his bulshit than that one goddamn

2386
01:57:06,432 --> 01:57:08,736
Just

2387
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:10,784
The force of his stories

2388
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:11,552
Frozen

2389
01:57:12,064 --> 01:57:13,344
2nd Dennis Montgomery reference

2390
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:14,112
Beyond

2391
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:17,440
The

2392
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:18,720
I know he has to

2393
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:20,000
He has to

2394
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:21,280
To turn this from

2395
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:22,304
A

2396
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,072
CNN

2397
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:24,352
Looks happy

2398
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:27,424
Right into a

2399
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:28,704
Part of his overarching

2400
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:29,984
Narrative

2401
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:30,752
You know

2402
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:33,568
They're in touch with the Deep state which

2403
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:35,104
Still further makes them

2404
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,128
Heart of the enemy

2405
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:39,968
Right so they're not just they're not just part of the enemy as a news

2406
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:42,016
Organization that attacked

2407
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:43,552
Your Trump guy

2408
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:45,344
They're part of the enemy in that there

2409
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:46,368
Connect

2410
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:47,136
To this

2411
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:51,232
Larger nebulous organization that is not going to meet

2412
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:52,768
Take Trump down

2413
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:54,816
Kill him

2414
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:57,632
Of course

2415
01:57:59,168 --> 01:57:59,680
But

2416
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:01,984
This is a team that seems

2417
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:03,008
Extreme

2418
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:03,776
It's boring

2419
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:04,800
That is born

2420
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:06,848
It's really boring

2421
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:09,920
Stewart there's nothing to the story that they're talking

2422
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:12,224
Thousand

2423
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:15,552
Theoretical my timer

2424
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:22,720
And then he throws that in there I guess I guess to spice it up

2425
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:28,352
Eid

2426
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:32,704
Essentially just use unrelated information

2427
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:33,472
For claims

2428
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:35,520
XO he throws that stuff in

2429
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:39,104
George Soros

2430
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:44,736
The collaborator

2431
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:46,784
You saw the the party

2432
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,320
The guest list

2433
01:58:48,576 --> 01:58:51,136
Rodger Stone

2434
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:53,184
But it used it as a way of life

2435
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:56,768
Complain about Valerie Jarrett I think something like that

2436
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:58,048
Of course

2437
01:58:58,304 --> 01:59:04,192
That there that's exactly what I was going about how

2438
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:05,728
Mika Brzezinski

2439
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:06,752
You got

2440
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:10,080
Ivanka Trump to hire a globalist Soros

2441
01:59:10,336 --> 01:59:10,848
Activist

2442
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:16,992
I don't f****** know I don't care

2443
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:19,552
That's that's basically what happened

2444
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:22,880
Mika

2445
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:25,440
Globalist

2446
01:59:25,696 --> 01:59:27,488
Associate

2447
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:28,512
Associate

2448
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:33,376
I don't know

2449
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:38,240
She has some vaguely middle-eastern-names reveron

2450
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:46,688
She's good friends at school, Aberdeen and Valerie Jarrett pedophiles

2451
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:49,504
Party in the Hamptons with Soros

2452
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:54,368
And then everybody evil

2453
01:59:54,880 --> 02:00:01,024
Yeah brother is Ivanka and Kushner

2454
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:06,400
We don't have a ruling class that exists outside of any kind of

2455
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:08,192
Laughable at the

2456
02:00:08,704 --> 02:00:13,056
Somewhat agree with you to certain degree I'm willing to believe that there are

2457
02:00:13,312 --> 02:00:13,824
Just sort of

2458
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:16,128
You know high-society things

2459
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:17,920
I swear you have your there with your

2460
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:23,296
I'm willing to believe a Chuck Schumer maybe doesn't want to talk to one of the Koch brothers

2461
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:24,320
Maybe

2462
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:27,392
Maybe not I don't know

2463
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:31,232
Anybody give the money

2464
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:35,328
Excluded from our world we live in I wouldn't even know the first

2465
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:36,352
About that

2466
02:00:36,608 --> 02:00:42,240
Witches are all at some f****** Bungalow party in the Hamptons

2467
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:44,800
Timmy is f***** up

2468
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:47,360
Slightly in the sense that it like look at all these

2469
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:49,408
Opulent motherfukers their riches

2470
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:52,736
To the extent that I don't know the context

2471
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:57,088
Maybe there was a fundraiser going on something like that there might be some excuse

2472
02:00:57,344 --> 02:00:58,624
Why they're all there

2473
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:00,416
I don't think I do

2474
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:04,000
