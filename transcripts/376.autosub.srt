6
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
Everybody would like a little bit about

00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,352
Alex Jones Jordan

8
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,632
Jordan

9
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,448
As we enter our fourth year

10
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,776
Perhaps we could even

11
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,360
Sure my question to you is what's your favorite season of lost I'll be

12
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,152
Wow that's a tough question

13
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,480
I mean the first one it's so shrouded in mystery everything is

14
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:31,136
You're discovering the island what is it about right who is this locked character

15
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,952
Is that a tires point in

16
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,720
Excitement

17
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,744
There's a lot of absurdity

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
YouTube butts

19
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,816
I don't know it's really hard

20
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,376
To say you love lost so much

21
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,960
Toughness review

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
I didn't care to

23
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,568
Too much about how they resolved some of the Mist

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,640
Of the island I thought a lot of that with Kyle

25
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,664
Kind of soft

26
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:57,504
In the last season but I do like the finale whichever want you notes very

27
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,784
Polarize

28
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,576
Divisive

29
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
But I didn't drive

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,184
I would say everything but

31
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,232
The the season where they're traveling

32
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,280
Time a lot

33
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,376
I've not that I thought it was bad

34
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,192
Sound travels to pull off

35
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,008
You could I think I think probably the best

36
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,544
Ava Dazzle

37
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,616
Probably I think it's

38
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
The second Seas

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
Okay

40
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
The end of the first season

41
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,040
The Mystery of the

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,624
The Dharma Initiative and all that stuff

43
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,440
Starts to form right right

44
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
Excellent

45
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,280
Alright this is a lot of feelings but lost

46
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,888
I also know a lot about Alex Jones

47
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,448
That's correct today we got

48
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
Last week

49
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
Sort of

50
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,080
It was my intention to cover

51
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
Last week's

52
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,432
Goings-on on the Alex Jones Show

53
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,224
And get us through enough

54
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,064
The speed and what I did is we start on the 3rd December 3rd

55
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
Are we

56
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
Until I had enough

57
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,952
That is about what

58
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,584
What form does the San Mateo

59
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,960
Turns out I can make it until 4 I get sick

60
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,240
Of Alex is not

61
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,568
That'll happen so today I will be going over that

62
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:29,408
Before we do got to take a little moment to say thank you some folks are signed up and are supporting the show

63
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,944

I'm a policy wonk

Spectrum app

72
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,032
Thank you so much you are now a policy wonk

73
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:03,456
People who donated on elevator love that very much so pasta

74
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
Thank you so much

75
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:09,088
And Maddie with an i or an alibi was

76
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,880
Technocrat

77
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,583
What's the business

78
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
Money off that heroin

79
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,167
So good

80
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,239
Freakishly large

81
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:34,431
Thank you so much pasta claw and Maddie

82
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:39,295
Export these grants

83
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,831
Yeah that would be very helpful

84
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
So Jordan like I said we're going over the

85
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
December 3rd 4th and 5th

86
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,743
Today from last week on Alex's show

87
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:53,119
I think that they're each really interesting in their own right and one of the reasons is they

88
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
Osterley disconnect

89
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,215
Did from each other that sounds right

90
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,495
Is almost a bottle at

91
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
Episode

92
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
Okay

93
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
Internally in

94
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
Consistent

95
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
Some things are like there's a

96
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,407
Progression going in One Direction anything

97
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,943
Completely

98
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,599
Like a broccoli dropped naturally it's it's very bizarre

99
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
Scratching narratives here

100
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,279
In infavorof recap

101
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,583
Need money

102
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,143
Pretty consistent

103
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,679
You're looking for a through-line

104
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,287
It's what Alex needs

105
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,591
I got you on the 3rd it's

106
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,663
Largely about how Alex

107
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
Wants to talk to David

108
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,503
David Icke is a guest

109
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
2 hours

110
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
Best

111
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,671
We'll talk about that here in a second before we do here is how Alex

112
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,207
That gets going on the show

113
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,255
Complaining about Elon Musk

114
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,583
I would encourage listeners and viewers a lot of you do actually

115
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,143
Look into what I say and what I claim because

116
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,215
Ninety-nine percent of the time you can easily just go find it

117
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,031
What is from the globalist perspective

118
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,335
Telling you how great is it all

119
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,615
NextGear

120
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,663
Tesla's going to roll out

121
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,039
Not just bring chips but dozens of wires put in your brain

122
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:21,951
But it's essential that it not be done at the hospital cuz that sounds to medical and scary brain surgery

123
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
It little

124
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,279
Kiosk at the mall

125
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,679
Sign up and you didn't they don't worry I'll robot

126
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:38,847
Cut the hole in the back of your head and Sheridan wires in there and he sign the waiver forms and then you walk out and all your friends go all your

127
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,383
So cool you're a cyborg now

128
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,991
You're so cool you're a cyborg now I love them

129
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:51,135
I love that idea and I would also like to meet the if I could feel anything about mall kiosk

130
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:57,535
Be very put-upon employee there staring into nothing I'd like that brain trip that allows me to enjoy

131
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:02,655
Orange Julius more only exist in malls

132
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:08,799
So the story Alex is talking about here is Elon Musk coming out and saying that he's company neuralink

133
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,615
I was working on an implantable brain-chip which she hopes

134
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,687
I could greater merge human and AI intelligence

135
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:19,039
As well as completely eliminated number of conditions like schizophrenia and Alzheimer

136
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
Right

137
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,879
Leaving aside the fact that his miracle cure language is abs

138
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,671
3rd and almost certainly something

139
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,999
DeKalb back up the larger reality is that this is

140
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:32,863
The project that is not going anywhere most likely

141
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:39,263
According to the Observer when asked if these chips would quote allow us to ultimately ride the wave of improving aai

142
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,335
I systems Elon musk's response was quote

143
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,639
I think the chance is above 0%

144
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,175
Good

145
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,503
Think right chances above 0% would you mean

146
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,343
It's very possible that he's wrong and the Chance is in fact 0%

147
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,183
The important element of the story is how Alex engages with news

148
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,999
We've talked about this before but it's important and important things

149
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,327
Point out particularly in the wake of that New York Times story from the

150
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,423
From his past employee Joshua

151
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,471
Alex says that 99% of

152
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,495
The time you can easily

153
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
We find things he's talkin

154
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
About Butch from a global

155
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
Perspective

156
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,615
That's how Alex

157
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,175
And how he makes it acceptable for his audience

158
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
To be completely

159
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,783
Unable to confirm any of the things he says and then Keep On Believing

160
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:29,183
So the globalist perspective you can find on this story is the media Outlets covered Elon Musk make

161
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
Braggadocio

162
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:35,327
Explain about his company having a Buick miracle cure implant they'll also give people access to quote

163
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:39,423
A tertiary layer of digital super-intelligent that's what I've always wanted

164
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,031
I look tertiary shitt sir

165
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,847
Most of those articles are critical about Musk

166
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:53,247
In general and more specifically about how Medical Science and the understanding of how the brain works isn't even close to a place where something

167
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Sing like what muskets proposal

168
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Could be done

169
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,855
Experts I've heard talk about it seemed to think the

170
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:04,255
The most likely outcome of all this is just developing better versions of already existing technology to do things like him

171
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
Improve prosthetic limb robotic

172
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:11,423
Wonderful biologist who spoke to businessinsider call the plan to merge AI with human brains

173
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,983
Quote aspirational Fantasyland

174
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
While giving the caveat that it's

175
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,079
Hard to predict what would be able to do in like 30 years

176
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,895
A I hope that's not aspirational

177
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:26,271
That's terrifying that's that's Fantasyland that's nightmare

178
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:30,111
Well of artificial intelligence controlling our very own brains

179
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,927
Feel like aspirational Fantasyland is

180
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,743
Asia value neutral

181
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
In some ways

182
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
You could have a terrible fantasy

183
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
That's the global Express

184
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
Activate

185
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,959
According to Alex this is what you will see

186
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:50,847
Right if you're one of Alex's listeners you'll try and track down the story that he's telling you know

187
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,687
This is what you'll find and it doesn't it all match Alex's tacos

188
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,223
Brain surgery being done at the

189
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
The kiosk between the Auntie game

190
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
Pretzels in the Hot Topic

191
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575
But that's okay

192
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
Because all the stories will find are just

193
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
The globalist

194
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Perspective

195
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,231
Their spin on the news where is Alex knows everything

196
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,511
He's researched everything

197
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,047
We can read between the lines

198
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,887
His version of it is the truth which is only further established by the

199
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,935
Back that no one but him is saying it

200
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
This is just line

201
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
But it's structural I

202
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
It's a self-aware deception

203
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,639
Because it includes a built-in explanation for why anything you made

204
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,663
Try to confirm

205
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
Will prove that he's wrong

206
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
It's because he's just making s*** up

207
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
He knows that

208
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,599
You can get your ear pierced at the mall and he's a terrific

209
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,159
Wires and somebody's brain

210
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:42,815
I like I like that idea of his is functionality of the kiosk is if I understand correctly

211
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
There's going to be a weird saw

212
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,191
After you walk into the into the chaos

213
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:53,311
Yeah I saw that opens up the back of your head and then they're just going to jam a bunch of wires in there

214
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
Done and done

215
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
Problem-solve

216
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,407
What I was reading area Zacks

217
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,431
Actually like a machine

218
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
That must

219
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
Proposing in

220
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,527
That would implant the

221
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
The champ

222
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,111
The chips right

223
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,671
Oh there are wires and actually has one of the biggest

224
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
Innovations

225
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,743
Talkin about

226
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
It would go from the

227
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,303
To the

228
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,167
One of the problems with the brain

229
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,239
And Sophia is the rigidity of wire

230
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,287
And how can cause damage

231
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,431
The structures in the brain that's what I was thinking that you just

232
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
Answer one of the hopes

233
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,783
Is that along the way we'll be able to

234
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,831
The develop more jelly

235
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
Psy

236
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
Or something like that

237
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
Some of them could be used in those medical app

238
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
The kind of like a realistic hope

239
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
The people

240
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
Neurobiologist

241
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
At least the ones that I read

242
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
The news articles

243
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,191
Deserts of incidental

244
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,287
Certain technological medical advances that come along the way

245
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:00,127
When someone has aspirational fancy as their target

246
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,431
I prefer those things to the

247
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,967
Kiosk I'm going to go that way

248
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,527
That's my that's my opinion

249
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,855
So Alex gets around 2 after

250
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
Rambles about there's a little bit

251
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,439
Does a full segment of

252
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
Like it's 10 straight minutes

253
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
Of just

254
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,047
Commercial

255
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
Suspicious

256
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
Exhausting

257
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,911
We does that Migos

258
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
And he comes back

259
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,775
One thing I didn't add last segments of the very exciting

260
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,823
That we've been working on

261
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:35,967
Third dimensionally exercise

262
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:40,063
When you do it gives other people face and other people

263
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,391
Really excited I can't tell you how many times I walk in the door

264
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,487
Children or my wife or my parents or my friends

265
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,583
Rock face

266
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:58,239
Infowars carbs or I was in East Austin 20 spray-painted it big up on the side of number password

267
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,823
Bumper stickers all over it and it just excites people

268
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,663
Spread the word and enforce Bensel demonized

269
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,479
Really is now a symbol of resistance

270
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,527
Global stand for

271
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,367
Until I went to my great graphics design folks

272
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:18,719
I said I want 15 new stickers.

273
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,303
I said I want 15 new sticker

274
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,887
So you did 10 minutes like a full break to break

275
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
Infomercial

276
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,471
Goes to commercial comes back

277
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:34,079
Now he's selling commercial new stickers are amazing

278
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:40,479
5:45. I thought he was like we only made two

279
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
See more stickers that's all we can

280
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
Can afford right now

281
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,855
That's next week

282
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
It's just

283
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,439
Excessive yeah it's pretty pretty f****** X

284
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,999
I think one of the reasons for that is

285
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
But he denounced

286
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,559
The David Icke was going to be on the show

287
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,375
I think he was hoping for a little bit of like

288
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Increase

289
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:02,751
Exposure attention in the first hour

290
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,543
Then David I comes in for the second

291
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,823
Cannon 3rd hour

292
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,871
And I know

293
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,919
Cuz the people who were in it for David ikard

294
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
Can you turn it off

295
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,271
Most likely

296
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,903
So like I said this was largely like this infomercial s*** and

297
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
I'm like really trying

298
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
Sell stuff and then to David Icke

299
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,279
Rite Aid so here's Alex's introduction to David Icke

300
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
Heineken

301
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
Hilarious

302
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:32,959
Remember

303
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:42,175
British Broadcasting host Sports programs

304
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
The UK

305
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
Around the world

306
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,855
Many a day

307
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,719
I guess all on the road to the man

308
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
Moment

309
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:59,327
Complete mental breakdown yes

310
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,375
Suddenly so different

311
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
Paradigm

312
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
View

313
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
The universe

314
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,055
This is really funny to me on a couple levels

315
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,335
The first is that Alex

316
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,639
David I got to Saul on the road to Damascus

317
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,431
Gizmo my perspective

318
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
2 Chainz

319
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,599
You be fair to say that I definitely had a shift in his Paradigm after he was struck by lightning or whatever happened to him when he was in

320
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
Bru B

321
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
Compare his experience

322
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,439
Answer that assault

323
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,767
Saul was a Pharisee who is intent on destroying Christian

324
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:34,143
Then he had an experience on the road to Damascus and changed his ways becoming the Apostle Paul

325
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,191
Eventually being one of the primary forces

326
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,471
Does it spread Christianity in

327
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:43,871
As well as the conspiracy theory that all Pharisees were lizard people dance

328
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,967
Approximately half of the New Testament is attributed to have been written by

329
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
I thought

330
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:53,599
Conversely David Icke having this life-changing event proceeded to go on Terry wogan

331
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,927
Show and declare himself the son of God

332
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,719
Which is a little bit different of a trajectory

333
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:03,583
Slightly you can go find that interview and if you do it's sincerely uncomfortable to watch

334
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,143
Ike is just saying these things and the audiences

335
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,167
Who's Laughing witch

336
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:13,567
I tries to play off as people being joyful then wogan jumps in and clarifies that the crowd is laughing at him

337
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,127
And not with him okay thanks

338
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
So goddamn

339
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,431
Uncomfortable

340
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:24,831
Aspirational Fantasyland

341
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
The duty of the broadcast

342
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:33,023
The second reason this is particularly funny as an introduction for David Icke is the Alex Jones didn't always have such a

343
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,303
Highview of David Icke

344
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,375
Before there was Alex Jones there was David IQ says

345
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,959
Not before there was Alex Jones there was Bill Cooper no

346
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
David Icke

347
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,519
Is the Alex Jones prototype

348
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
That's really bizarre

349
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:50,687
Because here's what Alex had to say about David Icke in the year two thousand when he was being interviewed by Jon Ronson

350
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,479
Producers

351
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,807
You just get tired of the real issues

352
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:11,679
True

353
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,543
Ministers and premiers and presidents

354
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,383
Real meat and potatoes

355
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,839
But it's being picked up

356
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,215
He's got

357
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,751
Punchbowl

358
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,823
That's his job

359
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,199
How many texts

360
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,991
Punchbowl

361
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,063
But Indian league with them to do that

362
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,463
World

363
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,863
He's completely insane or he's working for them

364
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,911
Attack on man

365
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,983
Understand how things work

366
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:25,919
Alex says the David Icke is a misinformation guy because he says a lot of true things but then throws in the blood drink

367
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,223
Making stuff as a turd in the punch bowl so no one

368
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Ever get

369
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
The real stuff

370
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:35,903
Bill associate the real stuff with this nonsense about vampires they'll just think it's all bulshit

371
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,951
It's so hilarious

372
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
Nice to hear

373
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,047
Something like that and imagine how Alex Jones

374
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,583
The year 2000

375
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,399
Would review his own show in 2019

376
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,447
I would go with

377
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:54,847
If you could just use the same word imagine you call himself a comment

378
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:02,783
That didn't take long at all embraced all of the things that he used to say where the reasons David I could

379
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
The conman

380
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,367
Yes and that's mainly because he's a con

381
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,439
The reptile shapeshifters but he's

382
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,767
Kind of in on that too I don't think he's that far away from it

383
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,839
No he just calls them interdimensional

384
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,119
Other demons

385
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,959
Yeah yeah that would be silly to think that lizard where people

386
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,079
So Alex that continues his introduction this is just one of them or embarrass

387
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,359
Introduction

388
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,895
I mean based on that

389
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,175
Heart Alone

390
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
Like the fact that

391
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
Alex is more

392
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,247
Into

393
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,807
All of the negative parts

394
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,623
Prior characteristics

395
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,415
But then

396
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
Man this is just

397
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,743
I want to cover the Waterfront today

398
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:47,583
He's been on Hiatus books making film

399
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,655
Here's why should I just had my head down

400
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,495
So Alex says the David Icke is both been on hiatus

401
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:00,127
And also been making films and books which is not what a Hiatus is now he's on Hiatus from what

402
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,919
Not making bugs in them

403
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,991
I guess if I had to be do assume what do you mean

404
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,599
I think it when Alex says I8 if he means he's not been answering my messages

405
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,647
Which makes a better side could be

406
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,695
On September 8th 2016

407
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,487
See what I gave a little interview on the

408
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,767
To New York City

409
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,559
When he was in town to give a lecture

410
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,375
Everything about this interview is super notable

411
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,191
Because well Alex and Infowars are never name

412
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,471
The entire thing is

413
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,263
The complete f*** you to Alex

414
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,103
41b interviews being conducted by Luke rudowski

415
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
From we are change

416
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,199
That's a dude who was down with Alex from day one

417
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:41,855
We are changing the loose neck Collective of people with cameras are going to yell at people and do confrontational stuff on the street

418
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:46,975
They're mostly relevant because of 9/11 conspiracies and promoting Ron Paul's campaign

419
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
President rights

420
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:53,375
In terms of overlap with Alex there are few group so you could say we're more in line with him in those early years

421
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,959
The fact that it's lucrative ski conducting this interview

422
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,495
Really brings into sharp Focus

423
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,519
Alex

424
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
The changed

425
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,823
More importantly

426
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,151
The actual content of this interview is absolutely scathing

427
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,199
And very clearly directed Alex

428
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
Calling him an embarrassment

429
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,575
For supporting Trump has David Icke laying out

430
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,879
Play alternative media's

431
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,464
Basic foundation in relation to politics

432
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
Husband

433
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,816
Any fact it doesn't matter who you vote for because

434
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,376
The same Hidden Hand gets ID

435
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:30,240
Republican or Democrat

436
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,520
Basically the same

437
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,312
Political class

438
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:38,432
Is in control and us nothing changes is actually deeper than that there is nothing changes but

439
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,224
That that's fair enough

440
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,504
As well

441
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,576
Since the emergence of Donald Trump

442
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
Subtly

443
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,136
Much of that has changed

444
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,440
Suddenly Donald Trump

445
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,720
This

446
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,000
Vacuous

447
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,304
Demogorgon

448
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,376
Who

449
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,704
Just comes out with stop

450
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,008
Phrases about everything without

451
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,032
Any substance

452
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,056
Without any

453
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,384
Explanation of how these things are going to be brought about

454
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,248
Plays on people's fears

455
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,040
On people's prejudices

456
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,088
Somehow

457
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:21,184
This man is going to take on what they call the globalists

458
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,512
As a result of that

459
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,072
The Narrative has changed any

460
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,888
Responsible tentative media from

461
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,680
You can trust any of them

462
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:36,032
They sold a rigged system to actually it is rigged against Trump

463
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,336
In fiber Clinton

464
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:42,688
What I see is

465
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,088
Some areas of the alternative media becoming little more than an alternative Fox News

466
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,208
Yeah I think there's a broader indictment of a lot of

467
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,744
Quote-unquote alternative

468
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:00,096
Media and chat Breitbart in the like it very clearly

469
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,960
Well that's a big part of it from other context clues

470
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
This is mostly about

471
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,056
Hey look David Icke sucks

472
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,104
But I mean you can at least say that you

473
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
He wasn't to Trump

474
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:16,224
And he's guilty of the same things that he accuses Trump of but maybe moving

475
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,504
He was one of the many

476
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,392
Along with people like Wayne Madsen and Webster Tarpley what a change of heart about Alex Jones

477
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:27,488
And this is the most likely explanation for why he's been on hiatus

478
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,024
Hasn't been on the show for a while

479
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,584
Because he thinks supporting Trump is embarrassing

480
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,376
I don't take my word for it

481
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,400
Here is

482
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:37,472
Here is David Icke saying that supporting Trump is embarrassing

483
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,008
Is foreign policy

484
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,056
Isis

485
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,592
Easter Easter baby

486
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,152
What was his words basically bomb the s*** out of them

487
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,504
Mysticism and alternative media

488
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,296
Stop pushing for president

489
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,832
On the basis.

490
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,648
This is going to be

491
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,976
Transformative

492
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,280
Expansion of this

493
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,304
Worlds

494
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,608
New World Order Global state

495
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,912
It's ridiculous

496
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:11,776
And why it's happening that's probably many reasons for it

497
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
But it's some

498
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:18,432
Embarrassing for the for the alternative media

499
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,992
That 2016 interview is a shot

500
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:21,760
Alex

501
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:28,160
His old buddy lukert asking someone to Alex basically put on the map is interviewing one of the biggest figures in the world of weirdos

502
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,232
The entire thing is more or less an indictment of what Alex has

503
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Comped

504
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:36,352
Not to put too fine a point on this but David Icke showing back up on Alex's show seems like an ID

505
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,632
Navigation that either icon

506
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
Is desperate for attention

507
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,448
Seems pretty unlikely

508
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,752
He has his own Big World Cottage into

509
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,056
History of his own

510
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:49,152
Point of allowing Gaston who are harshly critical of trump or have been in the past

511
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,968
If you think that there's some publicity and it for him

512
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,272
I feel like they slow pivot away

513
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,088
Alex

514
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
Everything you need to know about him

515
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,904
He said in that club

516
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
From 19

517
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,208
How about David Icke

518
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,328
Alex has now come to the point where he's a purveyor of all the stuff used to say was a turd in the

519
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,888
Yep he's completed that transition

520
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,424
And now it's so interesting

521
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,472
To see him with David Icke

522
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,752
Being like

523
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:21,152
Now I also believe blood-drinking vampiric Elite

524
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:26,784
Yeah narrative Alex spent the last 19 years drinking all the punch and then shiting in the bowl

525
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,088
So I don't want to play a ton of clips of David Icke

526
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,880
This interview is just standard David

527
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
Like garbage

528
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,440
Music zactly what sort of person I hate

529
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,464
To talk about cuz

530
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Too boring

531
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
To be like Mark Richard

532
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,584
Any simultaneously to disconnected from reality.

533
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
Deserve to be take

534
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
Seriously

535
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,680
Like I just

536
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,728
It might as well be white noise

537
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,312
So Bland

538
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,616
Anyway

539
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,432
It's with one of those thing I have a lot of curiosity

540
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:58,016
My curiosity only extends so far

541
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,416
I've always been fascinated as to how David I got so popular cuz he doesn't have any

542
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,464
Estimate Charisma that I am

543
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
Some

544
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,280
People discussing

545
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,608
And I think that one of the theories that I find the most

546
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,376
Compelling

547
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:20,032
Is he went on was already really famous soccer player

548
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,080
Early rheumatoid arthritis

549
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:26,176
And then he became a sports broadcaster

550
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
Guy in in

551
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:34,368
And started telling me about lizard people I'd be like okay cool

552
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:37,440
So what ended up happening is he went to Peru

553
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,744
And got kind of involved with

554
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
Got out there stuff

555
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:47,936
He claims to have had a transformative experience that I am saying he got hit by lightning or whatever

556
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
Talk about it before and it's like this

557
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,752
Felt

558
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,568
Like electrified and couldn't move and had a vision

559
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,712
Experience in Peru he comes back he goes on the bay

560
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,272
BBC gets mocked in front of the entire nation

561
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,600
Talking about how he's the son of the godhead or whatever

562
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
And then he goes on

563
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
Speaking tours

564
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,232
And this is how I I've heard it described before like how it transitioned

565
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
Into

566
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Celebrity

567
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,560
On its own right

568
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,120
People would come to laugh at him

569
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,936
He would go give speeches and

570
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,472
He would he was just in

571
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
Incredibly persistent

572
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,288
And people would like

573
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,824
People weren't going

574
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
Because they thought he had a good point

575
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
Right go Justice

576
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,712
Spectacle of somebody deliberate

577
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,272
Is ridiculous

578
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
That was

579
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,064
Absurd

580
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,856
People would just laugh at this

581
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
The spectacle

582
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,024
And then a couple people in the audience will be like this and then over the year now

583
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,328
Keeps growing into an organized group of P

584
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,168
Given enough time you'll find people who the message

585
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:51,936
Message resonates

586
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,240
With even if 80% of the

587
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,800
80 + 7

588
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,848
Gotcha

589
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,128
Started that

590
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,920
What was it he was 91

591
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,944
It was when he went on

592
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,224
The BBC

593
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,576
And 99 is when he put out the book where I believe that was the first time

594
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
It started with the

595
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,136
The Reptilian lizard

596
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,416
Shape-shifting alien stuff

597
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,232
It runs a fairly similar course fits

598
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,024
Yeah that is

599
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:20,352
Most people are laughing and enjoying the entertainment

600
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:25,472
Then there's the other people who are in the anti-semitic murder called it speaks to the danger of allowing

601
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,496
Stuff like that

602
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
To go on exam

603
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,056
Yeah it is an

604
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,104
Be around for too long

605
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,504
It's not to say that like you should shut down anybody Hussein crazyshit

606
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,296
My life that's that's not the

607
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,320
Ideal out

608
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,368
B

609
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
I think

610
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:48,000
I just think you know what is one of the cost of doing business

611
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,816
In a free Society

612
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,840
Unattended

613
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,608
Yeah

614
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,888
Celebrities with

615
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,424
I did to me David Icke

616
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,264
I don't know if it pains me because I think a lot of people are in

617
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
But I'm just now

618
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,080
Yeah I do not like

619
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,104
Interesting at all

620
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,408
I just don't care

621
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:11,808
I wish you hadn't gone to Peru I don't have it I listen to him talk and I to do not

622
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
Have any

623
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
You just boring

624
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:21,280
I don't even I don't even want to laugh at it because I'm already like at maybe if I'd have met David Icke before too much

625
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:25,888
Maybe back in 91 before I've already got Mark Richards

626
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,192
What what is David Icke have against that

627
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,752
F*****'-a he doesn't have a better butt

628
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:34,080
Nerva flying him around

629
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,200
So anyway that's not too much to care about with David Icke

630
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,992
And that's most of the Third

631
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,528
So we jump into the 4th

632
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,832
And this show takes on a couple

633
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,600
Different care

634
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,672
We have David Icke interview where Alex's

635
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,696
I'm trying to

636
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,232
Gas

637
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
Chase

638
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,840
Those kids say David Icona going to try and get

639
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,608
The lottery

640
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,912
Kids in really try and make the most out of this

641
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,216
Answer the 4th

642
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,752
Is very different

643
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,568
Alex is in a real like they're going to put

644
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,592
I sent to

645
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
Machines

646
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,640
Mood

647
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,920
But more important

648
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
There's a real world

649
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:17,600
Wednesday December 4th 2019

650
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:21,184
And this is the transmission that the globalist

651
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,304
Most human extermination because

652
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,376
We're putting out the reality of what's happening on the planet

653
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:36,288
We're getting people all over the world to talk about in to look at who is actually in control and what their plan is

654
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,312
As we are living

655
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,848
In a science fiction

656
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,384
Dystopic

657
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
Future

658
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,456
The future is here

659
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,248
The future is now

660
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,040
The simulation is real

661
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,368
Waffles are trying to create artificial stimulation

662
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,416
What does Saca stand to it

663
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,744
I thought long and hard

664
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
This morning

665
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,840
Before I went live here

666
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,656
About how I wanted to say this

667
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,960
Because it's very nuanced

668
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,776
Don't say it just right

669
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,872
It won't convey the thought I'm really trying to get out there

670
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,688
I think is important for all of us have a discussion

671
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,480
The debate about

672
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,064
And that's President Trump

673
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,672
Okay it's time to debate now we're having a debate about

674
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,256
That's right baby should have done that for years

675
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,280
Come on

676
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,584
Everybody in hindsight is 20/20

677
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,656
Rodger

678
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,216
Activate John

679
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
So Alex

680
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,080
Says we need to debate Trump

681
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,640
Like this is us this is big

682
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,200
Yeah he's already

683
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,736
Days past

684
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,040
Donut mocking Trump impression

685
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:56,416
Like that's a big huge f****** thing and now he's pretending that he prepared for the show

686
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
Gathered his thoughts about

687
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
About debating

688
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,512
Where is this going to go

689
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,792
And it turns out

690
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,584
It is disappointment

691
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,376
The spirit of God Trump

692
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
And office

693
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:10,496
He's one that's upset with tyranny upset with corruption

694
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,544
One Stop in the status quo

695
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,336
And wants to transfer

696
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:18,944
Our back to We the People and back to our elected constitutional government

697
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:23,552
They're a large swaths of folks out there that

698
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,368
Say oh just trust prompt everything's fine

699
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:30,720
Well we know if you

700
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:36,864
The information has come out but that is not the case in the Trump he is putting on a nice confidence back that's good

701
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,424
But that he's fighting for his life

702
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,984
It's always America and so is a Liberty Movement

703
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,800
Is it a full effort by us

704
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:49,664
Politically active economically active word-of-mouth activit spiritually active

705
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,736
We're going to lose this golden opportunity to really

706
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:57,088
Shortcut around the New World Order and not have to really go through

707
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,136
The worst deaths

708
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:03,488
So I would sum that up if you know if you want to put that in human language

709
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,144
We weren't wrong but Trump is not doing a good job we were right to do this but it didn't work

710
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,216
Trump is bad but that's not his fault

711
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,544
You putting on a confidence that is great

712
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,080
I wonder if he's just saying that he's

713
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,360
Pretending to be confident

714
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
Or if it's a

715
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:20,896
Con man

716
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:25,760
I think he's trying to think that he saying but the former but

717
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,808
I think he both he knows that

718
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,088
It could be yeah

719
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,392
Suggestion suggestion

720
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,928
Is that you need to put pressure on

721
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
Which is

722
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,488
Whatever

723
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,024
But

724
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,792
More important

725
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
Play

726
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,352
Another theme develops

727
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,888
I'm at is that Alex seems

728
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,912
All of a sudden

729
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,448
To be much more

730
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,984
Explicitly mad at qanon

731
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,776
Okay

732
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,800
He thinks it's b*******

733
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,360
So there's a psychological tendencies

734
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,480
Does your circle the wagons and fully get behind the president will you don't do that

735
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,552
By not putting pressure on the present

736
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,832
We know

737
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:04,160
That the board office desk

738
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:07,232
Information is Rodger Stone

739
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:11,072
You'll make the right decision every time but if he isn't given the right information

740
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,656
Shelf

741
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,704
We need to be very very Act

742
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,080
We all go just that kind of attitude

743
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,896
That's the stuff that defeat is made

744
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,712
Victory is what

745
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,016
Awesome

746
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,320
Kick-Ass audience of activists

747
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,600
Disappear

748
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,392
Broadcast

749
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:40,768
Lined up today I'm going to tell you Trump's biggest failure and get into it with evidence wake up

750
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,840
They look at the biggest positive things about what we can do

751
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,912
So much more today

752
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,216
So that got me really excited

753
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,240
Because

754
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,544
There is a presentation that Alex said he

755
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,336
Paired which always means

756
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,360
He's like well

757
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,152
You'll have your thoughts

758
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,992
Extemporaneous off-the-cuff riffing about nothing

759
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:04,064
So if he's going to talk about the good and bad of

760
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,880
Will actually be able to hear is prepared thoughts

761
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,672
This is the best you can do

762
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,720
Do you present this

763
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:14,560
As I sat down I thought long and hard so I can make my point

764
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,864
We're about to launch into

765
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,400
What is good about Trump

766
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:23,008
I was I was going to say that his biggest failure was probably on flush number 9

767
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,544
That was the one that

768
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,336
Shockingly doesn't come out

769
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:30,432
So in this verse it with this is just a segmented

770
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,248
From his list of the good things about

771
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,040
Gotcha didn't cut anything out

772
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:35,808
This is

773
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,392
Political correctness

774
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:44,768
So the first thing is just the taillights the trumps an a****** doesn't apologize

775
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,792
Yeah that makes sense

776
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,584
That's not a meaningful

777
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
No

778
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,656
But that's how

779
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,680
Dysart's list

780
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,704
Where's the next one

781
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,288
Even great saying America's a good Nation we should proud of ourselves

782
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,104
We can believe in ourselves again tomorrow I

783
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,896
That is equally meaningless

784
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:07,296
If your list of great things president has done starts with he's unnecessarily rude and then he followed that up with you says posit

785
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,576
Things about the country

786
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,136
Vacations dude hasn't done too much that you're in

787
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,952
Yeah that's pretty much I mean

788
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:19,840
What would that his ideas that Reagan City on the hill speech is all you needed to do is present

789
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,864
It's a soft

790
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,656
Soft list again

791
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,752
Point partnership

792
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,776
Hillary Clinton

793
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
Transferred

794
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,128
Secret Tribunal

795
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,200
Beyond even the tyranny of the World Trade Organization

796
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,784
Exiting the TPP is one of the only things

797
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,552
Alex

798
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,832
Can hang his hat on the Trump

799
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,600
Has.

800
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:46,976
I don't necessarily agree with Alex about what the TPP is but at least this is finally one thing the

801
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,000
Did you

802
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,304
Did Alex 2.2 is proof that he's doing

803
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:54,144
It's just a little lackluster how for the past three years this is the

804
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
Something Alex

805
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,728
Can think of to justify his zealous support

806
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:04,128
About Trump he's not good he didn't even include the fact that Trump pardoned war criminals that one wasn't

807
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,920
Happy best left unsaid

808
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,736
But we get to more substance

809
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,528
Reactivated

810
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,576
Are carbon

811
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,136
The world leader

812
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,672
An energy so that we can

813
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,976
Self-sufficient in under level of control

814
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,792
I was kind of weird I don't know why you would say carbonate

815
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,072
Nicole

816
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,144
I would assume he means coal industry yeah

817
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,168
I ordered it.

818
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,544
You reactivated our climate change exacerbate

819
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,384
Also I don't think that Trump has done quite as much as Alex thinks

820
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,152
The coal industry

821
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,992
A recent article on CNBC looked at the state of Wyoming

822
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,784
Where 40% of the country's coldisak

823
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,552
Extracted

824
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,624
The article cited a recent report from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics

825
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:51,488
Showing a 13% decline in coal mining employment in Wyoming in 2019

826
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,584
And a Wyoming state Geological Survey reflected a 30%

827
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,608
Drop in production

828
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,144
In the first six months of this year

829
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,192
Compared to production numbers from 2000

830
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:00,960
M14

831
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,752
According to the financial times

832
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,288
Coal is responsible for approximately

833
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,592
24% of electricity generation is

834
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,360
The United States

835
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:10,176
Compared to 48% back in 2000

836
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,552
I think call Alex is saying is the Trump has signaled an opposition to environmental regulations

837
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,832
He's related to carbonate

838
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,160
I'm not sure why he's praising that is be carbon into

839
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,184
History but whatever

840
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,720
It's not really an accomplished

841
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,792
Not as much as it is something I dropped over promise

842
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,120
Anyway

843
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:29,888
Is the next one

844
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,728
Border

845
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,568
I don't think any president or history is

846
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,104
Opposed to borders

847
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,200
This is just meaningless signaling disease

848
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,224
Xenophobia

849
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:49,600
Do you think that that's again really soft

850
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,672
Three of these on me

851
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,232
So you get this

852
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,512
Here's the last one

853
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:00,096
Gotten two supreme court justices appointed that are

854
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,144
Light years

855
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
Hillary Clinton

856
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,264
Hanging On by our fingernails

857
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,616
The list goes on and on

858
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,432
So Alex should not be in favor of the Supreme Court picks

859
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
The trumps made

860
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:21,600
Neither of them are really people who are in line with Alex's bizarre interpretations of the law so he has two couches prays for them

861
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,416
I miss being like yours better than who Hillary would have predicted

862
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,952
This is kind of week

863
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,744
Seeing as the nomination of these Justice

864
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:31,072
May well be the most impactful thing that Trump has done at office

865
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:31,840
Since their lifetime

866
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,608
Appointments

867
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:37,216
And Alex can't really even celebrate either of them being on the court in and of themselves

868
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:41,824
He can only celebrate that they're better than the hypothetical people Hillary would have put in

869
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,104
Just kind of sad

870
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,640
I mean there's nothing really

871
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,944
That's the end of the list

872
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:51,552
I didn't cut anything out Alex have you prepared his thoughts we can make his point even with

873
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,832
Forget the preparation

874
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,392
This is the best I can do to argue that Trump is good

875
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,672
Is not a deep list

876
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:01,792
There aren't real accomplishments on here certainly not the sort of list you use rationalize why you change your

877
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,560
Tire life

878
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,840
Does a porta politician

879
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:10,752
It's sad there's a reason that the Justice thing was the headliner on

880
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,336
His his accomplishments

881
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,152
Betts and maybe it's the only thing that the

882
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,456
Imdp higher-ups really want

883
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:22,016
Is a bulwark

884
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:26,368
Maintain minority control until they die what's so f***** up

885
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,904
I would understand that from them

886
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,952
Yeah but from Alex it does not make

887
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,744
No absolutely did not like

888
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,304
They're not in line with his ID

889
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,864
Right they must have put some wires in his head

890
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,448
That would be my absolute

891
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,240
So that was the good stuff

892
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,544
And now things turned

893
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,848
But when it comes

894
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,944
Standing up for his supporters

895
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,736
You shouldn't the Punchbowl

896
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,320
And standing up for Piero's like Julian Assange

897
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,696
President Trump is missing in action

898
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:05,792
So that's pretty big as an actual criticism

899
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,560
Because

900
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,096
Ed from all appearances

901
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,656
It doesn't appear to be real

902
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,936
Yeah that one strange

903
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:16,544
And Alex is smart to couch this as like putting a focus on Julian Assange as opposed to him

904
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
South or Rodger

905
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,896
Let's do the pure too self-serving and bitter

906
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:24,480
15 this way you can take her to the high road like Trump isn't loyalty

907
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,016
To these people who support him

908
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,088
I think that's probably really Wise Way

909
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:35,232
The picture that I don't particularly care about Julian Assange but I would like him to Parton

910
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,256
My buddy

911
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,560
So you got you got like these good thing

912
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:42,656
Things that Alex is sad and most of them were like he's rude you like some Erica

913
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,960
He thinks we should have a border they're all just

914
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,496
Superfluous nonsense

915
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,800
Yeah I'm going to get like a kritikos like

916
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,616
He doesn't care about us

917
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,199
But that's not it

918
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:58,015
It comes to getting the justice department

919
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,111
Criminals

920
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,887
There are reportedly at least 20

921
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,727
Virginia Maryland

922
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,031
New York outdoor areas

923
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:25,663
Individuals in the FBI and other areas that engage the whole fake russiagate

924
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:32,831
So Alex wants Trump to lock up his political enemies and he's not doing

925
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,111
Which is a real

926
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,391
Stumbling block

927
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,183
You know the rhetoric

928
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:42,815
Half of the people who voted for Trump probably just wanted him to put Hillary in jail

929
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:49,215
Okay you can retire now or whatever I don't care I actually don't like you but you did say you were going to lock her up lock her up

930
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:55,615
Up and then you can serve out the rest of your term make all the money you want

931
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,919
Will vote you out in 4 years we all had a great time

932
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:00,479
It was cathartic

933
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,039
Are you dressed

934
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,855
You know it's it's weird for me because I

935
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,135
I still think a lot of this

936
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,415
Trivial

937
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
But

938
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:12,511
These critiques that he has of trump come from a real Earp

939
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
Place

940
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,303
Then the

941
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,583
Praise but he has

942
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:21,215
In terms of the substance of getting out of the TPP is really about the only thing that

943
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
Alex

944
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,751
Can wheelie

945
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,543
Like I said hang his hat on

946
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,567
Where is here we

947
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,591
To criticisms

948
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,615
1 is

949
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:32,223
He's left me out to dry along with Julian and Rodger Stone right

950
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,503
Play the next one is

951
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:37,087
Hey our worldview really depends on the idea that

952
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,159
Attacking these globalist that you're going to help

953
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,999
Those are two fundamental

954
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:44,767
Talib

955
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,791
Problematic thing

956
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,071
For the

957
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,375
Narratives in the world view of Infowars

958
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,423
These are robust criticisms

959
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,215
It's a little bit like

960
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:56,543
It's a little bit like a delusional guy

961
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:00,127
Goat giving a pros-and-cons list for the woman that he wishes

962
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,151
Is that he was dating a

963
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:05,503
Wellpro we are going to get married someday live happily ever after

964
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:09,087
Conshy absolutely hates my guts and doesn't like me

965
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:13,695
So there is you know I think I think I should stick with her for another couple

966
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,463
Years but

967
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,231
We'll see

968
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,767
It's yeah it's hard

969
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,303
It's hard to make that equation

970
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,351
Yeah

971
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,399
Be able to much longer

972
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,959
Particularly after he starts talking

973
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:29,055
About how Trump is also in bed with Silicon Valley

974
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,847
When he came to Austin he was hang

975
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,871
Hanging out with Tim Cook

976
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:32,895
That's no good

977
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,943
Cook's in bed with China

978
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,479
By the transitive property

979
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:39,039
Trump is in bed with the chai, exactly

980
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:43,903
America's America's Best

981
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,207
Blocking everything we do up front

982
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:51,583
Antonio election meddling in Republican ads

983
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,351
And everywhere

984
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,887
Members of Congress the president

985
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,167
And he just sits there

986
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,447
Where is Ivanka

987
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:00,799
And Jared Kushner going to dinner with all the big stores on Valley people

988
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,479
He's letting them do all of this and is presiding over

989
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:20,511
Applebee's

990
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:32,287
Vai Global takeover that will destroy America and every free Society

991
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,967
He just did what now so Trump is apparently guilty of treason

992
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,527
That one is I okay

993
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:45,599
So he did get rid of political correctness

994
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,903
Sure he is also guilty of treason

995
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
It's hard

996
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,487
To say that that is putting pressure on some

997
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,511
Somebody

998
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:56,607
It's hard to say that that's like an accusation that you're making

999
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,399
In order to like

1000
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,447
Get him to let you back on face

1001
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:06,847
Facebook or something I really like the Supreme Court Justices he appointed that's really great

1002
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:10,687
It's but at the same time I do think he's guilty of treason and us should be hung

1003
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:15,039
I do think he's presiding over the destruction of all free societies

1004
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:18,111
But I like that he's rude

1005
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,647
And I got to be honest

1006
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,951
Love me some Porters yeah

1007
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:25,791
I mean when you look at this the balance of this is maybe a little

1008
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,839
Heavily skewing toward the negative

1009
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:33,215
You know what's fun though is honestly I do think that that is such a streak

1010
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,287
In these these white nationalists

1011
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,591
We need our borders kind of stuff is

1012
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:43,199
I would rather the guy who I literally think will destroy the world

1013
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:45,503
Then the woman who would let in three Brown

1014
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,783
Like it's it's

1015
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,831
I do think there's something to that for a lot of

1016
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,111
Maybe

1017
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,391
Then maybe you might be right

1018
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,671
Do you think though

1019
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,487
When he was rushed out to break

1020
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,511
Do you think he

1021
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,535
Came back from break

1022
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,303
Inside ala

1023
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,839
I said Djokovic.

1024
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,607
I didn't mean

1025
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,631
It was just a heartburn

1026
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,167
Do you think you said that

1027
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,703
Kind of yeah

1028
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,471
Doesn't

1029
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:11,871
What I didn't say that President Trump was guilty of treason

1030
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:18,271
RockShox is true

1031
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:22,111
Bum bum bum

1032
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,415
I'm guilty

1033
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:29,535
Guilty of treason

1034
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,095
F*** you

1035
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:36,191
We sit here and we accept he will only accept corruption

1036
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,263
We don't fight against it

1037
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:43,103
We give into it and we compromise with it

1038
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,151
We become guilty of

1039
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:49,247
We're taught by the system that sin is

1040
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:53,343
Thinking of female form is beautiful or eating too much food and others

1041
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,927
Extensions of that gluttony your luster

1042
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,719
Whatever the case may be but

1043
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,767
Alcoholism

1044
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:05,119
It's just being a coward that's the real

1045
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:10,495
Thou shalt not be a coward for a long time

1046
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:15,359
Pretty sure that one wasn't it as apparently she wasn't at the top of the list

1047
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,175
Some permutation of like being brave

1048
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,711
You know is

1049
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:25,855
Is spoken of positively throughout having moral character

1050
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,439
It's definitely didn't get rid of the rest of the list

1051
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,231
But

1052
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,255
That's all saying is

1053
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,279
Therefore

1054
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,815
You were all guilty of treason

1055
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,583
Because

1056
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:42,495
Man Deuteronomy had so many Sims in there and I really don't think any of them we're just straight-up cower

1057
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:49,151
So what I think about that that's a remarkable because Alex is doubling down on his Trump is guilty of treason

1058
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:52,735
Rowlett the same time undercutting what it means to have committed treason

1059
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:56,575
You taking it out of the political realm and he's putting it now into

1060
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,879
The spiritual Realm

1061
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:03,999
Yeah it kind of It kind of sounds like

1062
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
Rather than

1063
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,839
Is it doing the the classic like

1064
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:08,607
Like I'm sorry

1065
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,191
His way of apology is

1066
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:15,263
Is Jaclyn Keys over here and don't look at what I just said

1067
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,335
Yeah yeah yeah I think so

1068
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:21,663
I didn't get to way of like I mean if I'm being perfectly on

1069
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,991
It's a way of walking back what he just said what

1070
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,271
Without walking the back

1071
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,063
Kind of

1072
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,087
I mean

1073
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,623
Using his own terms

1074
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:36,255
Stop being a coward not owning your position

1075
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:42,143
But whatever he committed treason and now let me explain to you why treason has no meaning whatsoever

1076
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:48,543
And I'm by my definition of it

1077
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,847
Alex

1078
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:52,895
We're about to jump

1079
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,455
It turns out

1080
00:49:56,223 --> 00:50:01,343
Do you remember the third Alex is talking about Elon Musk wants to put those branches

1081
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,111
Chips in your wires

1082
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:05,183
I don't start scrambling a little bit about how there's a space

1083
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,719
What's going on

1084
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,255
Google and Facebook

1085
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,047
And I know I don't remember if

1086
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,839
Have the fold breakdown in the

1087
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,631
But basically what his ideas is

1088
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:17,471
Is there companies that are creating their own like artificial realities

1089
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,751
That are competing

1090
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:23,871
And they did end point of it will be like you got to choose which one you want to go with

1091
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,663
Okay jumping

1092
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:30,783
I'm leaving their artificial simulation and that's apparently now the end

1093
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,551
Game witch

1094
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,855
I don't remember being in his documentary endgame

1095
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,647
But anyway

1096
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,487
He was a real revolutionary

1097
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,351
You would understand

1098
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,167
But there is a race like a space race

1099
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:50,495

1119
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:47,839
Machine

1120
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:52,959
Uneasy

1121
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:57,055
Okay

1122
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,639
Are sending all the humans

1123
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,503
He talks about this a lot of

1124
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,807
I love

1125
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:11,647
I love that I love the way you put it

1126
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:19,071
It felt like oh my God the aliens are real or anything is there an is there an inconvenience you like these damn

1127
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,375
Stop it with the traffic

1128
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,679
It's like how you think about like

1129
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:26,495
Rodents

1130
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:30,847
Apostles eating your garbage or something

1131
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:31,871
Yeah

1132
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,151
It is a nuisance

1133
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,175
Please alien

1134
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:39,551
So if you don't understand entirely here's what Alex believes

1135
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,575
There's going to be

1136
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:43,391
Enticements of uploading yourself

1137
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,695
Put into these simulations that are in

1138
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:49,023
Artificial reality now what's going to happen is there's going to

1139
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:49,791
Tubi

1140
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:55,167
A situation where your your body will have to die in the process of the uploading right

1141
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,959
Two people will go ahead and do this

1142
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
Now

1143
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,543
People who are running the simulation

1144
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,567
So already

1145
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,335
Created

1146
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,359
Wheatley realist

1147
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,407
Assemblies of you based on

1148
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,455
Voiceprint

1149
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:13,855
And I all the spying the to the globalist to do natural he'll be able to create perfect versions of you inside the artificial

1150
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:20,255
Reality they will kill your human body your soul will be uploaded into the Demonic realm whatever

1151
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,559
Clear

1152
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,863
But is artificial version of you

1153
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:25,887
Not you

1154
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:28,959
It is not your soul okay it is in the computer and it will be used

1155
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,519
Other people to go along with hey it's

1156
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,543
Really cool in here

1157
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:36,127
It's real great y'all should do it so then everyone will die

1158
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:40,223
Right to have themselves put into the artificial reality

1159
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:43,039
And apparently there's also stuff about

1160
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,063
Like cyborgs

1161
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,111
Shirts

1162
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,671
Okay so the global is Ultimate plan

1163
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,231
Is to make us all NPC's in a role play

1164
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,535
Yeah

1165
00:53:54,047 --> 00:54:00,191
Yeah I guess so cuz NPCs don't really have any venomous or yeah or any any agency

1166
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,311
I talked to him we're all going to be a shopkeeper's in Skyrim

1167
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,335
Yeah

1168
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,103
Alright

1169
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,455
But you won't

1170
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,223
Experience

1171
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:12,991
That

1172
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:16,319
Your soul will be in the demon realm or Saturday

1173
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:21,183
He's not he doesn't spell that one out all too clear

1174
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:23,743
How this stall is uploaded somewhere else

1175
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,791
Like beef

1176
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:26,815
I don't know

1177
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,095
I just don't

1178
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:34,751
All right we got to squarely in that David Icke category of like well can't look into this

1179
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:41,663
Elon Musk hasn't made any we're going to upload your soul into the demon Realm

1180
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,455
Comments at all

1181
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,479
Okay he is

1182
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,783
Alex.

1183
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:47,807
Drop

1184
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,087
Deeply

1185
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:52,671
Classified information

1186
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,999
Really excited to do it but also kind of mad

1187
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,303
Aaron's

1188
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,583
Brains

1189
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,447
Literally Garden classified stuff

1190
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:08,031
Elon Musk his meeting with

1191
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,039
They already been delivered out of the Moon

1192
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:25,439
Mile run over on the dark side number 3

1193
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:28,511
3D printer

1194
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,815
If you even believe any of that

1195
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,351
A Jones

1196
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:37,215
Really go further here

1197
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,543
So we got

1198
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:46,943
So I guess Elon Musk working in concert the printers on the moon to create

1199
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:53,343
Based on unspecified crater on the dark side of the right

1200
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,183
Will not stop getting in the way of this Dark Side of the Moon crater nonsense

1201
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,975
This is deeply classified information

1202
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,255
Is it the is it

1203
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,279
Okay

1204
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,559
So Alex

1205
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,631
Shrew

1206
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,679
Is basically

1207
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,471
Advanced AI

1208
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:12,543
Really old rebel system

1209
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,639
System

1210
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,663
Your riffin

1211
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,991
You are ripping. Shut up

1212
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:26,623
And so just interchange aliens for demons and you got it

1213
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,671
These damn demon

1214
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:35,583
I don't know I don't have to replace your good to go

1215
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,143
With blizzard people we're all on the same page

1216
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:40,959
Speedway

1217
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,751
Nothing is real

1218
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:47,359
I would prefer to be in a simulation is an NPC that live in the world that he made

1219
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,663
Stop thanks

1220
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,943
It's tougher this

1221
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:51,711
Ksubi

1222
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,759
Position

1223
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,783
Very

1224
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,319
Research

1225
00:56:57,087 --> 00:57:02,463
Really like a news organization just making that s*** up is because Alyssa's

1226
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:06,815
I have heard a guy rip out

1227
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,351
S*** before poorly

1228
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,911
Many a time and that long like

1229
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,471
Chocolate

1230
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:19,615
Same bringing a bunch of system exactly struggling

1231
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:23,455
I would just say that it probably is just him pulling from like

1232
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,991
Memories of Bee Movie

1233
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:26,271
Syfy

1234
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:29,343
Like just coming up with whatever

1235
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:35,743
Makes a compelling narrative ancient Satan might be Event Horizon

1236
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,511
That iron

1237
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:41,119
Something Iron Sky

1238
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:48,031
Now that I know they're Nazis on the moon

1239
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:48,799
She's on the dark side

1240
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:52,383
Side of the Moon Nickelback

1241
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,663
Pulling from

1242
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,199
In order to build up the

1243
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:55,967
This narrative

1244
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:56,991
A butt

1245
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,527
He's not going to back down

1246
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,319
Alkaline this pretending the

1247
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,087
This Moonbase

1248
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,367
Like this

1249
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,391
Classified information

1250
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:06,719
Is real and then he starts shooting on

1251
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:13,887
Really really super loud

1252
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:17,471
Care

1253
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:31,551
Wheel bearing right here

1254
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,831
Sad

1255
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:33,599
Man

1256
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,159
I don't know I don't know man

1257
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,951
I just don't know

1258
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:41,791
I just I'm starting to see all of these people as

1259
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,583
As like one giant convention

1260
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:50,239
And they all just have boobs right next to each other and they're all all all kind of hate each other

1261
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:53,311
Listen to the guy next to me

1262
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:56,639
Formation accept each other for

1263
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:59,455
Validation

1264
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,991
Promotion

1265
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:07,647
There's a Taco Bell in a Baskin-Robbins

1266
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,439
2 in

1267
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,207
Text at like

1268
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:16,607
In the same way that Mike cernovich had a little season they didn't reward

1269
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,655
People that drift into each other

1270
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:21,727
Spheres of influence

1271
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,519
It's like a Premier League

1272
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:26,335
Somebody's somebody gets relegated at the end of every year

1273
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:30,175
Dialects and Barks on what I would describe as a

1274
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,967
Derivative

1275
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:34,527
Standard boring rant about the devil

1276
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,343
Okay on for quite a while

1277
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,647
And it's not notable stand on the deck

1278
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
Anti

1279
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,439
Okay

1280
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,463
Just want to be clear

1281
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:46,303
Strongly handsome Harry

1282
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:49,887
So I just wondered

1283
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:54,239
I appreciate you asked for clarification on that last anyone

1284
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,799
So yes is long boring rant about the devil

1285
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:59,615
It's not notable in any way except for how we

1286
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:03,199
We are overrun with the slug

1287
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:08,319
Fellow human that sold out to the gremlin the chief loser

1288
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:14,719
So he doesn't fight the AI take over unless it goes

1289
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,511
Through

1290
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:19,071
He is an agent of Satan

1291
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:24,447
So now we're opening up even the suggestion the Trump is an agent today

1292
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,727
As opposed to just

1293
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:26,751
Committed treason

1294
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,031
Psychic

1295
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:30,591
I think we're getting pretty strong scents

1296
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,359
That's

1297
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,151
Alex's

1298
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,711
Really flirting with

1299
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,247
I think he thinks

1300
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:41,599
Rent though like I think yeah yeah yeah

1301
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:42,879
Fueled

1302
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:49,279
Look at it feels in some ways I can specially cuz he framed this is like we have to put pressure on Trump

1303
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:52,351
Pressure on him feel like I'm willing to say stuff like

1304
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,167
Yeah you understand I'm going to be gone

1305
01:00:55,679 --> 01:01:01,823
And I don't think solutely now that's where things get really interesting because we're recording this on Monday

1306
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,591
Stay the night

1307
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,383
And just this morning

1308
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:06,943
Owen Shroyer showed up at the

1309
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,223
The impeachment

1310
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:09,759
Hearing in the house

1311
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:13,855
And started yelling about a bunch of stuff and had a score today

1312
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:16,415
No I don't have it because it hasn't happened

1313
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:18,719
I don't know what Alex's

1314
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:22,303
Is going to be probably giddy

1315
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,351
But if you really look at it with variant

1316
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:27,423
Is what they have done by doing this.

1317
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,215
It's not endear themselves

1318
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:30,239
Delta Trump at all

1319
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:34,847
They have made it that much more likely the Trump will not do the things

1320
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:35,871
Is that they want to do

1321
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:40,223
Like they want him to enact all this social media stuff in order to get them

1322
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:43,295
Access to Facebook and Twitter and

1323
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,575
910 YouTube again

1324
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:48,159
They want him to do all these things that would directly benefit them

1325
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,999
And by disrupting the impeachment inquiry

1326
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,303
I think the Optics are impossible

1327
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,351
For Trump to do anything

1328
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:58,911
Did signals support for Infowars

1329
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:01,471
Zenna becomes a transaction

1330
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:02,751
To an extent

1331
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,799
Where we're going we're going

1332
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,591
Tending to be a news organization

1333
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:12,991
A doing completely activist nonsense yeah trying to scream down Jerry Nadler literally the f******

1334
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,015
Boston bombing

1335
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,295
Prescott

1336
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,343
Yeah absolutely

1337
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,207
You know I mean that was still like under Deval Patrick in like

1338
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,767
Official people do a press conference

1339
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:29,631
This is the f****** house a little bit different I will admit

1340
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:35,263
He wasn't already there yet

1341
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,287
Sweetie

1342
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,079
Like it's an intense

1343
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,103
Disruption

1344
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,895
I honestly don't think it's

1345
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:43,711
Meaningful in any way other than to demonstrate like

1346
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:44,991
Infowars

1347
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:47,295
Desperate desire for attention

1348
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,063
4

1349
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,879
You know coverage

1350
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:55,999
That is like the only thing that he wanted

1351
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:00,351
Witcher

1352
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:03,423
Yeah that's good I mean that's good for them I guess they

1353
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:07,007
Pull up a publicity stunt like this and feeds them

1354
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,311
Whatever attention they need for a little bit

1355
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,335
Yeah

1356
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,615
Can't possibly

1357
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,919
Get them to where they need to be with Trump

1358
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:19,807
So while you have Alex going on this rant about you no like Trump may be an agent of Satan

1359
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:25,695
Really appears be like I'm leaving I'm leaving you can stop me I'm leaving yet

1360
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:26,719
They going public

1361
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:27,743
The stopwatch

1362
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:32,607
That much less likely that Trump is going to do the thing that they're asking him to do for them not to

1363
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,375
Believe

1364
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:35,167
Almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy

1365
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:39,519
I mean either that or it's just an admission that they realize he was never go

1366
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,543
Going to do it in the f****** purse

1367
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:44,127
Possibly if anything's going to happen we have to make it happen.

1368
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:44,895
Ourselves

1369
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,687
And we can't rely on Trump

1370
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,223
Obviously

1371
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:52,831
Which we should have known from the jump yeah it's really hard to tell the motives that

1372
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:55,647
Outside of just sheer publicity hunting

1373
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:58,463
Like it's kind of tough to tell where they like

1374
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:04,863
What are you trying to do the number one is always going to be I want to get Infowars trending right that's number

1375
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,887
One on the list

1376
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,167
Regardless of any

1377
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,703
Better that's definitely

1378
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,239
Play trivia question

1379
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,775
Becomes like is there

1380
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,311
Some other thing you've

1381
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:14,591
Right

1382
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,895
And I just don't I don't I don't know

1383
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,687
I think I think it actually

1384
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,479
It hurts them probably

1385
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:23,295
With Trump yeah yeah I see that especially

1386
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,831
I don't pretend to

1387
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:25,855
Trump

1388
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,647
But I would assume

1389
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,719
I would assume that even he would be like

1390
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,119
Good

1391
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:43,007
No let's see are there any positive

1392
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,543
I mean other than

1393
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,615
Once again turning the hearings into a

1394
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,895
Circus which I guess is

1395
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:49,663
The only thing that

1396
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,687
Would enjoy it

1397
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,223
You know

1398
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,527
Yeah that's that's it but it's a short-lived

1399
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,319
Circus Yankees removed

1400
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,343
They can move along with

1401
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,903
Their business right like it has an impact on the action

1402
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,719
I don't know it's it's interesting

1403
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,023
I look at

1404
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:07,839
More from that prism of like this is shooting yourself in

1405
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,375
And

1406
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,911
I don't know if Alexandra

1407
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,679
Really

1408
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,471
I might be wrong

1409
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,751
I might be wrong I mean

1410
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:15,519
Trump

1411
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,567
F****** pardoning war criminals

1412
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,895
It seems like that would be

1413
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,919
A short leap

1414
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:22,687
To being like

1415
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:25,503
You wait you disrupted the impeachment hearing

1416
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:26,783
Rodger Stone goes free

1417
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,831
Right

1418
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:33,695
Hey depending on what you just about to get a different Prisoner Part

1419
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:36,255
Iaintasaint world that doesn't happen

1420
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:38,047
I don't know where we are

1421
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:41,887
So Alex gets into yelling about how

1422
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,167
There's no man

1423
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:45,727
Anymore because men would fight the globalist

1424
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,775
Sure if there were

1425
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,055
But there are

1426
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,079
Especially not Trump

1427
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,615
Wow maybe

1428
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,943
Okay for the average man

1429
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:03,391
What was happening and nnn ever felt the animated contest of engaging

1430
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:08,767
Turner discernment on would never

1431
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:11,839
Want to just screw off and play games all day

1432
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:13,887
But

1433
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:17,471
Men are arrested on average at about age 12

1434
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,543
Women are arrested about

1435
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:26,943
What

1436
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:31,807
Get the f*** out

1437
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,903
You just made that up

1438
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:36,927
Through

1439
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:40,255
Persecution I not been through adversity

1440
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:43,839
I got his f****** puberty

1441
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:51,007
They're trying to get rid of exercise itself

1442
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,919
You know Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer

1443
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,247
Rankin and bass Nation

1444
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,855
Reindeer mean Demi has a red nose

1445
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,903
It's a story of overcoming

1446
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:13,279
He has a gift and and the and the other ones are inherently jealous of

1447
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:19,679
I will say on the one hand I'm glad that Alex can interpret the meaning of Rudolph the Red-nosed

1448
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:25,311
At this point with like children stories

1449
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,847
I think his batting average

1450
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:30,943
Is pretty bad this one is

1451
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,223
Jealous

1452
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:36,831
I'm trying to figure out who the bad guy is that he would

1453
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,111
Probably like

1454
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:44,511
The only guy I respect is Darth Vader in this whole situation like in Rudolph

1455
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,535
Rob Rudolph

1456
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,815
I know one of the other reindeer

1457
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,351
Dad

1458
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:54,751
Home and he probably identify so much with Rudolph though his dad was probably like

1459
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:59,359
So also Jordan this guy has no one's Banning Rudolph the Red-nosed

1460
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,687
Disagree I have done it now

1461
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,455
Alex's

1462
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:07,295
Talking about a video that The Huffington Post put out last year around Chris

1463
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:10,367
Which they even clarified was meant in jest

1464
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:14,975
It was more or less just a compilation of people joking on Twitter about how the story of Rudolph is

1465
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:15,743
Is problematic

1466
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:22,399
Of course this became the focus of a right-wing out Reagan actually in the 2018 War on Christmas

1467
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:24,703
Is there a bad and now I guess we're doing it at

1468
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:30,591
Yeah no one band Rudolph is just a dumb Huffington Post article the people like Donald Trump jr. over react

1469
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,639
Yankton Sioux and that isn't

1470
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:35,711
Example Alex can come up with when you talk about kids

1471
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:37,247
These days they don't have any advice

1472
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:39,807
Varsity jacket

1473
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:44,671
Finger development

1474
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,695
Ridiculous

1475
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,719
Ridiculous

1476
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,511
I was

1477
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:54,399
1520 years ago when you first got arrested when they outlawed dodgeball

1478
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,471
Who's got time

1479
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:58,495
It's a tough time for us

1480
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:04,895
All we could do with ribbon dance

1481
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:07,199
Call Emma Delarosa at 10

1482
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:10,527
Is that

1483
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,807
Alligators

1484
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,415
So each of these episodes

1485
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,207
The third fourth and fifth all have

1486
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:18,975
Terrible gas

1487
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,511
Check we had

1488
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,279
David Icke

1489
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,095
Aeroball in on the 4th

1490
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:24,863
We've got

1491
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,167
Gavin McInnes

1492
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,191
Leader of

1493
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:30,751
The proud boys even though he's not anymore

1494
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:32,799
You still always will be no kidding

1495
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,079
So Gavin

1496
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,127
A lot of this is about China

1497
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:40,223
A lot of the interviews about China I was wondering what the proud boys thoughts on

1498
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,295
He's not with the proud boys anymore

1499
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,855
Easy

1500
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:48,927
I want to be clear about this cuz what he's going to say is going to say

1501
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,231
Tremendously races

1502
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:57,887
And it's I don't know if it is as bad as it sounds it's only Monumental erasers does clarify

1503
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:58,655
By the way

1504
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:00,447
Chinese Americans

1505
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,983
People who have moved

1506
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,007
To America

1507
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,055
They

1508
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,103
Are very compatible with the United

1509
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,663
Okay

1510
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,687
Cher

1511
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:11,711
China

1512
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,479
Itself

1513
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,551
The way China operates incompatible

1514
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:16,575
With the United

1515
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,855
Okay

1516
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:22,463
Do you think about me relative like the government is not the people

1517
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,255
Kind of he's trying to make that Arc

1518
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,303
Yes okay in In fairness

1519
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,327
Okay

1520
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:29,631
But here it is

1521
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:30,911
Just dumping

1522
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:33,471
But the way they see life over there

1523
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,751
Is totally different

1524
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:38,335
Then the way we see like they don't value the same way we do

1525
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,455
I'm glad you make that point you know

1526
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,759
Asian-American

1527
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:48,063
Virtue signaling a squishy

1528
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,623
They are the biggest supporters in Florida

1529
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,927
Population

1530
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:59,583
So Alex you're saying that Asian Americans are the largest Bloc that supports Trump outside of the white population

1531
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,351
Hispanic

1532
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:03,679
I should tell you that in the 2016 election Trump won a proxy

1533
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,959
27%

1534
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,727
Deviation America

1535
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,543
The most generous poles

1536
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,615
Someone suggested the number could be much lower than

1537
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:14,943
The Asian American legal defense and education fund

1538
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:18,271
The more in-depth survey and they sounded 18% support

1539
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:21,343
For Trump lower than previous Republican Presidential

1540
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:23,391
Candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain

1541
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,927
They're pulling codes

1542
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:26,463
Pretty troubling indication

1543
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,231
Eroding

1544
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,535
Support for the GOP in Asian-American

1545
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,303
Communities

1546
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:31,327
In 26

1547
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,119
Like they're finding

1548
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,423
20% of self-identified Republicans

1549
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,959
Voted for the Democratic

1550
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:37,983
Okay

1551
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,543
That's probably not good no Republic

1552
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:41,311
Or Trump

1553
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:43,359
No and that trend has not stopped

1554
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:47,199
Vox published an article in May 2019 that the headline quote

1555
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:51,551
Trump could be turning asian-americans into reliable Democratic voters

1556
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:56,415
Part of this was based on a 49% democratic voting rate in the Asian America

1557
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:59,487
Community community in the 2014 midterm

1558
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:00,767
Compare 27

1559
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:04,351
27% of Asian-American votes going to Democrat

1560
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,119
Exit 28

1561
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:10,751
I'm not sure what Alex's what he saying is true that the Asian-American Community is Trump's large

1562
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,543
Just block of support outside of people

1563
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,591
But he's presenting it as if it's

1564
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,639
If you believe that's true

1565
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:17,919
Is a sad brag

1566
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,711
Considering the overwhelming evidence

1567
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,759
Is that the community is moving

1568
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:23,551
Pretty solidly to the left

1569
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:30,207
And a lot of that is directly in response to Trump's rhetoric and actions particularly surrounding it

1570
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,487
Which is even more

1571
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:34,815
Likely to create a severe back

1572
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,607
Clash in order to try and maintain a

1573
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,143
Minority white rule

1574
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,423
God I hate this

1575
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,727
So annoying

1576
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,007
A lot of this

1577
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:45,567
Gavin interview it's not very long

1578
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:46,591
And it's just

1579
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:47,871
Kind of boring

1580
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:54,783
They don't throw any access or some s*** don't they always get together in like hit each other a little bit

1581
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:57,855
Really what it is is largely

1582
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,159
Gavin just saying like

1583
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:02,207
Flippantly offensive things

1584
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,743
I'm like What's the value in listening

1585
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:07,071
Who gives a s***

1586
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,863
Kotori funny

1587
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:13,727
Exciting things that Milo posted on Telegram and like

1588
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:15,263
Make a call reference

1589
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:17,567
Tommy Robinson

1590
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,335
Okay

1591
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,103
Cool cool

1592
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:21,151
Yeah it's just a meaningless interview

1593
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:23,711
But there is this funny point

1594
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,783
That he's complaining about people at like

1595
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,575
He gets into argument

1596
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,343
It's about abortion

1597
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,391
Right and

1598
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,695
You know what they say is there

1599
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,719
Pro that's now

1600
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:38,303
Hell yeah I did not even say that they are

1601
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:41,631
I think there's something else going on that

1602
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:47,007
We say we're pro-life of Rancho abortion

1603
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:52,895
You're in New York City it there so radical that I've met many people who go yeah

1604
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:54,687
Abortion is murder

1605
01:13:55,455 --> 01:14:01,599
Murder to go well I don't know where to go with this argument here that's exactly the fork

1606
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:06,719
Of course they want to end the conversation

1607
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,487
Bye

1608
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:12,095
Shut up I'll eat.

1609
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,655
You suck yeah I love

1610
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:18,239
Ooo do you guys you guys are not even protein

1611
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:20,799
Sure

1612
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,335
I'm pro-death

1613
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,383
Leave me alone go away

1614
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:30,783
It's that it's the same thing with Alex talking about people at abortion rally

1615
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:35,647
You're f****** with you

1616
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,671
Engagement

1617
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,695
You're an a******

1618
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,767
So Gavin has little interviewing

1619
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:43,327
He's gone and Alex gets back into plug-in

1620
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,351
And

1621
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,119
Man

1622
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:48,447
Lot of the time he's just talking about a greatest products

1623
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:52,031
How you need to shop with Infowars

1624
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:59,199
Just plugins on a little bit of a different note where he's saying if you spend money anywhere else

1625
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:00,735
Sporting something pretty bad

1626
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:04,575
Sales running right now in Fort Worth, or AAA

1627
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:06,623
Dubai 3313

1628
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:14,047
Bayview Auto shop at Walmart or Dick's Sporting Goods or Target their funding anti-gun transgenderism

1629
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:17,631
Five-year-olds to Dad the right taken away and then

1630
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,191
Squeeze chute

1631
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,847
This is all mainstream news lights and gentleman

1632
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,407
To the family show

1633
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:35,295
Dick's Sporting Goods you're right

1634
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,087
Okay let's see

1635
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:45,023
I do like that method of inspiring

1636
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:50,911
I don't really understand where else he has to go from a marketing perspective like we've we've turned it we've

1637
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:51,935
This from like

1638
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,471
Extreme

1639
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,239
Panic

1640
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:59,871
To let you know you need to support me by buying products we're going to be gone in a year if you don't buy our product

1641
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:03,455
If you buy from anyone else I'll cut your kids genitals off

1642
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:10,111
I don't know what else I don't know what the installation can possibly be if this doesn't work

1643
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:13,183
One step in like and it is freedom fries

1644
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:19,071
If you if you buy anywhere else you're supporting the French or something like that and then later on you can go to

1645
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:19,839
Your kids

1646
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:24,191
Their genitals chopped off man that didn't play back the last time

1647
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:27,519
Fair enough roundly mocked

1648
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,567
So

1649
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,103
Take a break after this ad

1650
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:33,663
Pop quiz

Free or post-trib rapture

1653
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,879
Hell yeah you know what it turns out

1654
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,927
He's pre-trip globalist

1655
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,719
Pre-trib rapture

1656
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:53,375
Surround your world government Christians getting persecuted

1657
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,143
Coming

Bible

1659
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,031
Armageddon

1660
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:03,103
Is it

1661
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,383
Could

1662
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:07,711
The pre-tribulation

1663
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:10,783
After is only 180 years old

1664
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,319
And was developed

1665
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:23,327
There's no need to do anything it's all handled by somebody else and he is really Swinging On Cue

1666
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,863
Like he's been pretty

1667
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:29,983
Subdued on that note he's made overtures towards being against it

1668
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,519
But of course also

1669
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:33,311
Sort of a cool with it back when

1670
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:37,151
He was trying to do his own version with jealous jealous of it

1671
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,687
Yeah yeah

1672
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:41,503
But now these this stretch you really see

1673
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,551
Taking some shots

1674
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,087
Seems to hate them

1675
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:47,391
Yeah I think he's I think this

1676
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,927
Like a a hole

1677
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:51,487
He's having a rough time now that he's got two

1678
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,767
Turn on Trump

1679
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:59,679
I hate that I'm finally going to tell the truth if you hate if you're starting to turn on truck then it would

1680
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:04,287
Lend yourself to be anti cubes

1681
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,311
Remarkable things

1682
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,079
Videos

1683
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:09,151
Staunchly program

1684
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:11,711
EXO

1685
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,271
Another layer

1686
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:19,647
And also a real dick thing for him to say that their whole idea is

1687
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:25,023
Nonono everybody else is handled it while his whole idea is pay me money and I will handle it for

1688
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:27,071
For you

1689
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:30,655
A lot continues

1690
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:32,191
Do y'all about the rapture

1691
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:34,239
How much she believes

1692
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,263
Revelation

1693
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,287
Literally

1694
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:42,687
We are going to be living on literal hell on Earth billions are going to die it's going to be

1695
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:46,015
Falling away from me

1696
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:51,903
Drooling and nobody's being pressured and that's good cuz they're going to go to the real Church

1697
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:55,487
Fit inside of them in the ratio of God is to be a Revival

1698
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:57,279
Active wish we never seen

1699
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,047
You are

1700
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:59,583
God is going to send

1701
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:05,215
We are uploaded the god of the people

1702
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:14,943
Going to get killed and then rise again right up in front of everybody in Jerusalem

1703
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,223
Kill these people

1704
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,527
Imagine that point

1705
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,183
Think about that

1706
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:29,279
You're going to see all of it.

1707
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:32,095
Evelyn change

1708
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:32,863
Oh okay

1709
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:38,751
So I kind of kind of honestly believe that if he

1710
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:42,079
If he was if he was pre-trib rapture

1711
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:42,847
He'd be pissed

1712
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:47,199
Probably want to take a swing at God

1713
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:50,527
Yeah well I mean the hardship is

1714
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,831
Half of the fun for you

1715
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:55,647
Like the concept of living through the

1716
01:19:56,927 --> 01:20:01,535
Being so strong I survived the whole thing even though billions died I'd

1717
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:04,863
Did that's like his Amazing Race whatever like

1718
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:08,447
His version of Survivor

1719
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,751
Yeah man alright

1720
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,031
So Alex is

1721
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,080
A lot of this

1722
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:14,848
The lot of us

1723
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:19,200
A lot of devil ramp right out of Revelation talk

1724
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:21,248
But then you get blindsided by

1725
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,528
The news the truth

1726
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,320
Those two

1727
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:28,160
Just step down that could either mean they're putting work level up then

1728
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,048
Operation to remove

1729
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:40,704
War Machine

1730
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:47,104
Realize that started

1731
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:49,408
Putting it up on the screen

1732
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:51,712
That's a to Google execs

1733
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,992
Steps down

1734
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,832
So I'm third news broke that Larry Page and Sergey Brin

1735
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,880
We're stepping down from their executive roles

1736
01:20:59,136 --> 01:20:59,904
Google's parent

1737
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:00,928
Alphabet

1738
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,720
I'd remind you

1739
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,256
But Alex's reporting Mississippi

1740
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:07,328
Breaking news in the third hour of his show on the 4th

1741
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:11,168
He can't possibly be doing any preparation for his shows or else you would have

1742
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:13,472
Sing this news on the morning of the fourth before you start it

1743
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:16,800
It's just inconceivable that is processed as anything other than

1744
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:19,104
People showing headlines and then he rips on them

1745
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,664
As for the actual story

1746
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,504
Paige and Brandon both retain their seats on the board of directors

1747
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,552
And maintain their voting control of the direct

1748
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,320
Alphabet

1749
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:31,648
Need to step down from their roles as CEO and president of alphabet

1750
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:32,416
Respectively

1751
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:38,304
The reason for this was that they decided that having two presidents of two CEOs for alphabet and Google with

1752
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,072
Kind of redundant

1753
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:42,912
And that the management structure would work better if those redundancies were phased out

1754
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:47,264
As such in the announcement of their stepping down was also announced the Google C

1755
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,080
CEO Sundar pichai was going to be taking over as this

1756
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:51,104
Alphabet

1757
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,640
As well as staying on his butt

1758
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:54,432
Your Google it's corporate RaceTrac

1759
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:59,552
Here's an article that Alex didn't read and he's just guessing

1760
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:03,648
He thinks they're going to either bring in worst worst globalist

1761
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,416
So Trump is making

1762
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,696
Has moved but in reality

1763
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:06,720
Streamline

1764
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,256
And you would know that

1765
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,792
If you read the article

1766
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:13,376
I think the way I was reporting the stories partially an attempt

1767
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,656
Fully turn on

1768
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:15,680
Just yet

1769
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,216
His entire grape

1770
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:21,568
Foot drop is how we won't take action against these tech companies and you can see how eager Alex's

1771
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:24,128
To take this headline that he knows nothing about

1772
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,152
It turned it into a paw

1773
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:27,456
Possibility this is the long-awaited answer

1774
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,224
Search with prayer

1775
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:31,040
He's looking for excuses not to turn

1776
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:33,344
But I think he's just going to keep up coming up after you

1777
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,112
I don't think it's

1778
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,928
Yeah I mean

1779
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:42,304
Because everything that he thought Trump was going to do is imaginary and he wasn't going to do it from the first place

1780
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:46,912
Right that's just you just can't live on imaginary food for that

1781
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:47,936
Miss Isabella

1782
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:48,704
Now

1783
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,728
Can't do that

1784
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:50,752
Swapno

1785
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,288
Brightly colored flop

1786
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,360
So Alex

1787
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,896
Schism to a little bit of bad head

1788
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:58,432
Space as this show wines

1789
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,224
He starts

1790
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,296
Screaming about how he's going to start a bunch of new shows

1791
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:05,088
Yes

1792
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,392
Now old man house phone coming back

1793
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,416
What's great about that

1794
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:11,744
In the past Alex is always talked about how he's going to go

1795
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,328
24-hours he's going to give all of these people show Absolutely

1796
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:21,216
There's a slight difference in how he's talking about it now see if you can pick out the different that it might be

1797
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:21,984
Obvious

1798
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,264
You know what

1799
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:26,080
Haircut at 3:30

1800
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:29,920
Double H

1801
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:36,576
By the way I'm going to start I'm committed it today

1802
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:43,744
Seven days a week starting a new show

1803
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:49,888
Today

1804
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,520
That's not good

1805
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:59,360
That's not good

1806
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:06,528
I I can't I can barely feel the three hours that I'm on today and now I'm going to go to a

1807
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:07,296
At least

1808
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:13,696
9 total hours add a couple more hours of me talking about the devil

1809
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:18,560
So the main difference here is he doesn't pay anybody else

1810
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:23,680
I was going to hire people who just called in and I assumed that they were good enough for show but

1811
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:26,496
Man it's just got to be me

1812
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:27,520
Just got to be me

1813
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,544
I think what you see

1814
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,568
Here is

1815
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,128
I think it's pretty well reflected in like

1816
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:35,712
What the times that I've gone to banned. Video is YouTube

1817
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:38,016
Clone or whatever

1818
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,552
You go when you look at the light

1819
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:40,832
Anyting

1820
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,624
Are the other house

1821
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,672
David Knight or Owen Shroyer

1822
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:46,720
Dear such diminished

1823
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:47,488
Audience

1824
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:51,328
Right Paul Joseph Watson also isn't as much as I

1825
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:54,400
But that's because you know you at he's also elsewhere

1826
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,704
Yeah it is no need to bottle that

1827
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,544
And if I had to guess

1828
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:04,128
I would say that his ability to drive sales

1829
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,152
Is

1830
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:06,688
Soundly better

1831
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:08,224
Then these other hoes

1832
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:13,088
So when he does this even if he's not paying people like the callers

1833
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:18,208
Call Lynn hoziana or whatever he's not paying them he's still losing money

1834
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:21,024
Cuz he has to have the crew they're like

1835
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:21,792
So handsome

1836
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:22,816
The bandwidth

1837
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:25,888
Or whatever I write overhead is so high

1838
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:28,960
A call-in hosted show is not going to move the

1839
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:33,568
The product in the same way that Alex is absolutely is like if you buy from Hobby Lobby

1840
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:36,128
General cutoff yeah

1841
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,920
That will do it

1842
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,456
Old man house phone definitely is

1843
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:44,064
I'm just going to scream out that Walmart's going to chop your kids dick off at trails

1844
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,136
Pink spit in the next year in order to make things

1845
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,672
Write make things

1846
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:50,208
The ledger balance

1847
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:53,024
I'm going to have to do three shows a day

1848
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:54,816
That's not good

1849
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:56,096
3 hours is too much

1850
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:58,400
For him to be doing of this a day

1851
01:25:58,912 --> 01:25:59,680
Absolutely

1852
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:00,448
Not good

1853
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,776
Adding more oh my God

1854
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,800
I honest

1855
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,336
But that'll destroy me

1856
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:12,736
Yeah it's Ryan listen to his three shows you're not allowed the same time. I will take your

1857
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:13,760
Computer away from

1858
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:16,832
The same time the content that will be an hour 8

1859
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:19,904
Will be unbelievably on ridiculous

1860
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:24,768
Yeah that's true also he's not going to do that he'll be on he'll have to be on

1861
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:25,536
Speed at that

1862
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:26,816
Hellboy

1863
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:27,584
Rainforest

1864
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:29,888
Sew-ins

1865
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:31,168
Suit of a continuation

1866
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:32,448
Alex Costa

1867
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,216
Calls

1868
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:37,312
This this color here suggests that Alex should

1869
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,592
Turn Infowars

1870
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,616
Something positive

1871
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,944
Well

1872
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:49,344
Yeah I understand that works I just said I think we're this is going to go but it's not to say that in four words isn't positive

1873
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,904
In the Scholar's mind

1874
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:55,488
Inspiration that it could beat you haven't opportunity to

1875
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,512
Turn it into

1876
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:57,792
Alex

1877
01:26:58,048 --> 01:27:04,192
Freddie Mac turn Infowars into a crowdsourcing apparatus

1878
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:06,496
Crowdsourcing the best engineer

1879
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:12,896
Enfield a world that people these millennials

1880
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:17,248
Want to live if we don't give them a direction that they're all searching

1881
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:20,576
Tried to build something and I'm not the best at it

1882
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:25,440
Platforms as well what

1883
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:31,072
We're good at putting content out covering things and I've got a great crew I just I can't do more

1884
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:36,960
Trying to get out here with you

1885
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:38,240
Is that

1886
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:41,312
Yes we need to talk about the good world

1887
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:48,480
Earlier

1888
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:57,184
We can barely produce the shows where people for some reason

1889
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,000
Some reason

1890
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:10,496
I'm just saying that that that there's a lot of great stuff

1891
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:15,616
We could do theoretically

1892
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:23,040
Information on Ted call

1893
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:25,600
Pretty more shows here on the weekends.

1894
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,648
Go work another place tonight

1895
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:32,512
Hobby Lobby

1896
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:38,912
Yeah we love you dude but it's all about you no tip of spear tip of the spear now we got to move to the shaft is

1897
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:40,960
What comes after

1898
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:46,336
Fraser

1899
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:48,128
So Alex's

1900
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:51,968
Yeah if they doesn't

1901
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:53,248
He can't get Crew 2

1902
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:55,040
Come another weekend

1903
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:56,576
Can't

1904
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,904
I can't afford to hire people who can't afford webmasters you can't

1905
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:02,720
Sure I mean I understand that

1906
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:06,048
That is that is that is a tough situation

1907
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:06,816
Doobie and where

1908
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:07,840
You have an audience

1909
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,632
Expecting you to do

1910
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:10,400
All this stuff

1911
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,424
To fight the globalist

1912
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:12,704
And you just

1913
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:17,312
Yeah the only solution to that problem is the audience giving you more money

1914
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:23,968
Which day works unless you're the one doing

1915
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:24,736
Going to

1916
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:25,504
Active

1917
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,040
Yeah

1918
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:29,088
Ebenezer stuck between a rock and a hard place

1919
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:30,112
And I have a theory

1920
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,904
About what his plan is

1921
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,440
I'll get to that in a moment

1922
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,232
But that's pretty much

1923
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:36,512
Before he gets just

1924
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:38,816
The impotent

1925
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,096
State of Infowars

1926
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:41,376
It's so annoying

1927
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:43,680
Every time the answer to a question

1928
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:47,008
So utterly and blindingly obvious but the

1929
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,288
The person saying is like

1930
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,568
For some reason

1931
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:50,592
You know like

1932
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:56,992
Ike I can't hire people for some reason Psychonauts for some reason one you broke into everyone thing

1933
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:58,784
Exit this is a toxic nightmare fact

1934
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,088
Well those are possibility

1935
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,416
For some reason it's still a mystery to us

1936
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:07,744
Probably a combination of those two

1937
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:10,560
If it's not one it's the other and usually it's both

1938
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:11,328
Yeah

1939
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:13,376
So Alex comes in on the 5th

1940
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:14,400
And

1941
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,168
He's

1942
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,728
Meow basically just made up

1943
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,496
Made peace

1944
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:19,520
With the fact that the house

1945
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:20,288
She's probably going to

1946
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:21,056
The vote to impeach

1947
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:23,616
And makes a prediction

1948
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:24,384
Based on

1949
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:25,408
Is

1950
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:26,688
I guess prediction

1951
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,272
Pelosi says we will impeach of course you

1952
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,832
Add the votes as soon as they won the house

1953
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,136
In the midterms that was a shirt

1954
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,048
Is going to

1955
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:44,352
Not go to remove the president

1956
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:47,680
Add on the current course that's

1957
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:48,704
Accurate

1958
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:51,776
But you see they got a bunch of

1959
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,360
They got a bunch of

1960
01:30:56,384 --> 01:31:00,480
New allegations in fraud that they're going to be bringing out. It's on the president

1961
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:03,552
But on all of his Bedrock supporters

1962
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:06,880
Info stories everywhere total lies

1963
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:10,464
About the president about myself about others

1964
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:13,280
Try to really defeat the American

1965
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:15,584
Resurgence that's been taking place

1966
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:22,240
So Alex is making this prediction that there would be negative stories about him coming out

1967
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:25,056
Weather prediction of this episode this episode is from December 5th

1968
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:27,104
This is not a prediction really

1969
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:32,224
Since that morning the New York Times story written by Alex's former employee Josh Owens

1970
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:33,760
Todd Alex

1971
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:38,880
Kind of pretending he's not aware of that story you just reading the tea leaves they're going to spend it

1972
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:44,512
They're going to spend this house is planning to beat unless you know there's going to be negative stories about Alex

1973
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:46,048
Cuz he's drops guy

1974
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,632
In reality I don't believe that he's not aware of the story

1975
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:55,520
It seems like an intentional set up so we can make an after-the-fact prediction would you think Little Kim

1976
01:31:55,776 --> 01:32:00,640
Play whatever he brings up the story he can be like I told you they were going to put out a negative stories

1977
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:01,408
About me

1978
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:04,224
I know everything I know the global is playing

1979
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:07,552
Yeah that's how it feels to me but honestly

1980
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:09,856
I'm not positive how much he

1981
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:13,440
Because later this episode of freaks

1982
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:18,816
Alright, but I think he's aware that there is a story

1983
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,096
But he hasn't read it

1984
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:21,376
And I think that is

1985
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:22,912
Staff hasn't told him what

1986
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,448
I think that was smart of them

1987
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:29,056
I think that's the state he's in at the beginning of his mental state does

1988
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,360
Pretty dramatic

1989
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:34,432
And I think that's when he finds out what's in the story

1990
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,968
So

1991
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:42,880
Alex is talking a little bit more about impeachment year and you know how the globalist are like 10 years behind they are usually a decade behind

1992
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:43,904
Yeah well

1993
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:44,672
Turns out

1994
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,952
Impeachment also

1995
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:47,488
Behind

1996
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:50,560
Okay 15 days

1997
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,888
They're going to hit with everything

1998
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:55,424
This December the January

1999
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:03,872
Already articles out impeach by Thanksgiving to rub it into the American holiday that they ate so much

2000
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:08,224
Sure to have going on right around Christmas

2001
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:12,064
Make everybody turn away from their families turn away from Christ

2002
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:17,696
So yeah it's a war on Christmas

2003
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,464
Wow

2004
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:21,024
I mean you know any construction project off

2005
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,560
Time falls in today

2006
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:28,448
The delays and I think 15 days in that terrible I mean Lord knows it's you know my roof repairs

2007
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:36,128
15 days I think they're I think that's something that it's not what you're shooting for but it is

2008
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:37,664
Still somewhat commendable

2009
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:43,552
You got War on Christmas happening through these impeachment

2010
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:46,880
Isolated

2011
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:49,696
These sorts of things happen a lot

2012
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:53,280
The attack on Christmas legislatively

2013
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:56,096
The globalist

2014
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:58,912
Just like we got the income tax on Christmas

2015
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:00,960
Fell reserve on Christmas

2016
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:05,056
Law passed in takes Thunder from the stage for legislators

2017
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:06,080
Will let

2018
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:08,384
Senators they were creature of the state

2019
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:10,432
Victoria lectin

2020
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:13,760
That all happened the Night Before Christmas

2021
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:17,600
When all through the house not a creature was stirring

2022
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:19,392
I knew that was coming

2023
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:20,928
In 1913

2024
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,976
What's the weather like to do it

2025
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:29,120
We know that Alex thinks the Federal Reserve Act was passed by the votes of the three members of Congress

2026
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:34,496
He also thinks it was passed on Christmas Eve which is just a monster Ubly not true

2027
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:37,312
Be one way to prove that it's not true

2028
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:42,688
Stall the bill itself was signed into law by Woodrow Wilson on December 23rd 90

2029
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,456
1813

2030
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,224
Which is not Chris

2031
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:47,296
It passed the house on September 8th

2032
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:50,112
It's 1913 in the Senate on December 8th

2033
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,160
1813

2034
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:57,024
The mythology of the bill is that it was snuck through without anyone having time to read it or discuss it with

2035
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,072
With the evil globalist pushing it throughout

2036
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:01,376
Everyone was too busy with Christmas to pay attention

2037
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,400
But none of that

2038
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:03,168
True

2039
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:07,008
It's just flimsy rationalization for why this thing pass

2040
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,800
Yeah like it's not like

2041
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:11,360
In order for it to be like this

2042
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,128
Nefarious

2043
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:12,896
Plan

2044
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:16,480
There has to be a reason for why no one ticket. It does have

2045
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:18,784
That does isn't reflected by history

2046
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:22,112
Yeah the way you get around that is with this like three people voted for it

2047
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:23,904
I push through on Christmas

2048
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:27,232
It's just not true I mean

2049
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:28,000
September 8th

2050
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:29,536
18th to December 18th

2051
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,072
Lakers months

2052
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:34,144
Between it's passing the house and the Senate

2053
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,424
Plenty of time to discuss the

2054
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,472
The bill come to

2055
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,240
Consensus

2056
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,032
This is just a mansion

2057
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:41,312
Bulshit

2058
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,896
Actually argue rationally it with

2059
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:47,968
Function and form of the Federal Reserve

2060
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:52,320
Which there are there are rational arguments against but you can't make

2061
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:54,880
So rather than do that just

2062
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:56,160
Call the entire

2063
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:58,208
Creation of the thing suspect

2064
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:00,512
And that you don't even really need to worry about the

2065
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:03,072
Right you know go it's it's not the argument

2066
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:04,096
The cover-up

2067
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:04,864
Is the bigger issue

2068
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:05,632
Yeah

2069
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:06,656
Yeah yeah yeah

2070
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,192
Yeah it's a shark

2071
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:12,288
So why in the next play Alex hoo-boy

2072
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,848
I'll tell you what a lot of this is Ben

2073
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:15,872
Sounding

2074
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:16,640
Sweetie

2075
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,408
Negative

2076
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,176
Towards Trump

2077
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:22,528
On the third and fourth you have indications of a drift away

2078
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:27,136
Next clip here from the 5th I guess Alex is back on board or something

2079
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:28,928
He's very wishy-washy

2080
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:37,120
Extra surveillance grid

2081
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:37,888
But

2082
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:42,496
Factory stood up for pro-life in the fact that he's gone a lot of rallies

2083
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:44,800
Things like that

2084
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:49,408
What affected

2085
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:52,736
Either get us out of the TPP and he's been trying to pull the troops out

2086
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:56,576
Definitely a real president and I believe he has the best interest of country bar

2087
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:58,624
I should hard to see him

2088
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:03,232
Committed ring for us

2089
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:08,608
Dangerous

2090
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:15,008
Why didn't you think of the going to pro-life rallies trying to pull out the troops when he had time to prepare

2091
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:18,336
List of these good things about

2092
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:19,104
Why did they go

2093
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,128
This is so

2094
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:26,528
It's like when you gets like when you get made fun of and then it'll like a couple of days later you think of the

2095
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:27,296
The perfect guy

2096
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:28,320
Comebacker

2097
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:30,880
The same thing you know he's trying to think of good things about Trump

2098
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:33,184
There's such a dearth of them

2099
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:35,232
I made it to plates

2100
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:38,560
Do you like going away from Trump option

2101
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:40,096
Available today

2102
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:41,632
AMV retaining

2103
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:44,192
That they're too it's just

2104
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,472
It it's kind of

2105
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:47,520
It would be tough

2106
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:48,800
To understand

2107
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:49,824
Where he stands

2108
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:50,848
If you're in the audience

2109
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:54,176
If you're listening to this show like with any regularity

2110
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:58,272
I just I don't know how you'd be able to like if I were to ask you

2111
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:00,320
What does Alex think about Trump

2112
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:03,136
I don't know if you'd be able to say

2113
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:08,768
And I would guarantee I would I would almost guarantee that whatever I did say he would deny

2114
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,816
Yeah so

2115
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:12,352
Alex I think at this point

2116
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,120
Now

2117
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,144
Has heard

2118
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,960
More about the New York Times article

2119
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:20,288
But I don't know if he knows everything about it

2120
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,056
Because he's

2121
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,872
Easy saying that there's a story but he won't respond

2122
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:27,200
Listen to something

2123
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:30,016
Listen to it still happening

2124
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,160
I'll respond to hear on air

2125
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:41,536
That defending ourselves and I'm not going to do that

2126
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:44,352
Stanford I have discernment

2127
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:45,376
So

2128
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:49,216
And I hate that

2129
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:55,104
Clearly more directed at a specific thing

2130
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,920
I know a lot of people probably are curiously

2131
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:00,992
Like what my position on that is on that article

2132
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:01,760
And

2133
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:05,344
I would say that I can sum it up pretty succinctly and

2134
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,112
That like

2135
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:08,416
If Josh Owens has good

2136
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:10,208
Intentions behind this

2137
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:10,976
Great

2138
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,512
A lot of the things

2139
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:15,072
Betty brings up in that New York Times

2140
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:17,376
Defected Alex drinks a lot

2141
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:19,936
The fact that they make stuff up

2142
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:20,704
Yeah

2143
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,240
Even though

2144
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:28,640
Phone call vidhi talks about we're at when he decided to leave Alex said that I want to leave to

2145
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:32,992
Those things are things that you could deduce from watching Alex's show

2146
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:34,528
They're not like

2147
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:35,808
They're not growl

2148
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:36,576
Groundbreaking

2149
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:37,856
In in

2150
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:38,880
In the real way

2151
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:43,232
Their observable fact

2152
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:44,768
So it's kind of surf

2153
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:47,328
Evan secondarily

2154
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,352
The things

2155
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:50,912
It better like the most resonant images

2156
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:53,216
From the story are things like Alex

2157
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:54,240
Killing that goldfish

2158
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:56,800
An employee had a goldfish and Alex

2159
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:59,104
Yeah things like that

2160
01:39:59,360 --> 01:39:59,872
Or not

2161
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,152
Really

2162
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:03,200
Stuff we can work with

2163
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:04,736
I Don't Need You and I

2164
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:06,784
Give me the world can't really work yeah yeah

2165
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,600
Oh he's a bad guy

2166
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:16,256
The guy who denied that anybody died at Sandy Hook is also a bad guy on a personal level right there's that ass

2167
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:18,560
Speak to it but then there's also the he said

2168
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:19,840
He said yeah I do

2169
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:20,608
Elementary

2170
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:23,424
Everything that's in that article

2171
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:27,264
Is largely stuff that Alex can

2172
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:28,288
Wiggle away

2173
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,360
I don't I read it

2174
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:33,408
I could be wrong about this but

2175
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:37,248
Primarily there was stuff in there that

2176
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,016
Was

2177
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,552
It's easily deflect

2178
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:41,856
I would say

2179
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,624
What would make

2180
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,392
Me feel

2181
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:44,416
Way

2182
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:45,440
Way

2183
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:46,208
More

2184
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:46,976
Confit

2185
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:48,256
About this

2186
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:50,304
Is if in that article

2187
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,584
He also said

2188
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:55,936
I'm testifying in there we go

2189
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:57,728
Yeah

2190
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:59,520
Some kind of an indication

2191
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:01,312
Like where

2192
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,872
He could be singularly used

2193
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:06,432
This is a person who clearly has

2194
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,456
Paid

2195
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:14,368
Clear indication that he doesn't care about whatever ndaa he might have signed half with Alex he's writing an article for the New York

2196
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:15,136
4 *

2197
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,416
About his time there

2198
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:19,488
Clearly has inside working knowledge

2199
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:21,536
Of how Infowars operate

2200
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:22,816
That extends to

2201
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:24,352
We make stories up

2202
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:25,632
So

2203
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:26,400
He isn't

2204
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:28,192
Singular position where

2205
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:29,216
He could be

2206
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:31,520
Very helpful

2207
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:32,544
In terms of

2208
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,824
Bringing to light

2209
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,616
In a courtroom

2210
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:37,408
The way Alex is propaganda is

2211
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,432
Used and it hurts

2212
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:41,760
And I think that would be much more meaningful

2213
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:42,528
Then

2214
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,296
New York Times Are

2215
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:44,576
And to be clear

2216
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:46,368
I don't know that he's not doing

2217
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,160
Itemized

2218
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:53,792
No he could be he could have been supposed to could have all that stuff that's entirely possible I don't have it actual

2219
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:54,816
I just

2220
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:56,096
Do not care what he has to

2221
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:59,424
To say and he should go be a bricklayer for

2222
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,960
20 years and then maybe I'll give it

2223
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:01,728
What he has to say

2224
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:05,568
I don't care I think I care about what he says in his much as its interest

2225
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:06,848
This is the world

2226
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:11,200
Absolutely

2227
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:12,736
Any kind of

2228
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:16,064
Beyond a surface-level interest

2229
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:18,112
I have no interest like

2230
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:20,416
Fuckyour Mia culpa

2231
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:24,256
This isn't Redemption this article is stupid

2232
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:25,024
Don't care

2233
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:28,864
That kind of that kind of feel you can have that position I think I would be a little less

2234
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:30,656
Let's lift Hurst

2235
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:32,192
About it I wouldn't say

2236
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:34,496
Play fuk your me a call

2237
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:35,776
Appreciate the

2238
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:38,592
The perspective he's putting out I understand where he's

2239
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:39,360
Coming from

2240
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:43,712
I just I just don't I don't know if there's anything

2241
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:47,040
In that order

2242
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:48,832
I don't know if there's anything that moves

2243
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:49,600
The needle

2244
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,368
Past

2245
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:52,416
A lot of stuff that like yeah you could

2246
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:54,464
You could definitely assume that

2247
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,768
Like he told a story about them going shooting

2248
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:58,048
Alex almost shooting

2249
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:01,632
Yeah I do have it if you produced tape of that

2250
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:03,424
Then we'd be like holy

2251
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:05,984
Ya know where the phone call that he has a dollar

2252
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:07,264
If you had a recording of that

2253
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:09,568
That would move

2254
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:10,336
Sings

2255
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:11,872
But as it is it

2256
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:12,896
Kind of

2257
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:14,176
Interesting

2258
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:15,968
Yeah but I don't understand why Alex

2259
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,760
See that be like OSHA

2260
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:21,344
Sunnyway Alex isn't super mad yet

2261
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,624
You just decided

2262
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,904
I'm not going to

2263
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,184
Big Giver I'm not going to

2264
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:28,768
Because I think you can defy this with a

2265
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:30,816
Because I still think he doesn't know what

2266
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:33,120
And

2267
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:35,936
So he just goes onto complaining about iPhone alert

2268
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,520
UPS has been getting a lot of alerts

2269
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:43,616
Eddie thinks that everyone is okay

2270
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:45,152
I don't think

2271
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:47,456
Cookies right every iPhone user in America

2272
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:50,016
How many years are probably 70 80 million

2273
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:54,368
Look up the latest numbers on an estimated number of iPhone users in the United States

2274
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:57,952
Text my wife the same thing

2275
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:02,304
Same three hearts

2276
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:04,608
5 a.m.

2277
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:06,656
Am I am

2278
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:13,824
One-sided Pelosi sang

2279
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,616
What planet is

2280
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,200
Mars

2281
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:22,528
So that's how they're going to steal the election and they're doing it in every way

2282
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:29,184
There to steal the election with

2283
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,208
IPhone

2284
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:31,744
10 million

2285
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,560
IPhone users

2286
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:38,400
110 million iPhone users

2287
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:45,312
108 million right now

2288
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:50,176
100 + million people

2289
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:54,016
Hammered all day long with only what Pelosi say

2290
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:55,296
Sure

2291
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:58,368
Okay you go to settings

2292
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:00,416
Yeah you got a notification

2293
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:04,000
Alright you can show what shows up on your lock screen

2294
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:06,304
I have an iPhone in my hand

2295
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,864
Yes you do I have had an iPhone 4

2296
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:13,216
We did have a conversation on Saturday that where you did have issues with shutting off

2297
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:15,264
But that's just for like my email

2298
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,080
Yeah I know right now I have a GrubHub

2299
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:19,616
Is GrubHub in for

2300
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,688
But I think it's

2301
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:24,480
Better for me that I

2302
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:26,528
I have an alert for an email then

2303
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:27,552
But not

2304
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:29,088
But here's the thing

2305
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,160
I've never gotten an update for Nancy Pelosi

2306
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:34,464
She waits she hasn't texted you

2307
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,768
I get texts from her all the time

2308
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:38,048
I suspect

2309
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:39,584
That Alex

2310
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,864
And his wife

2311
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:41,888
And this employee

2312
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:43,680
May have signed up for something

2313
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:50,080
Or they have an app like a news app update

2314
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:53,152
Like that he's complaining about something that is a choice

2315
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:56,224
Yeah him to receive or not receive

2316
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:58,528
I don't understand what's going on here

2317
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:01,088
I don't know you have an iPhone I have an iPhone

2318
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:07,744
Updates from Palouse yeah but that's cuz we're soros-funded she doesn't need to jam those updates

2319
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:08,768
Down my throat I guess

2320
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:10,304
Be what's going

2321
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:13,376
This is such like a Peggy Noonan

2322
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:14,400
David Brooks

2323
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:19,520
Column of like I noticed one annoying thing so this is why all Millennials are going to

2324
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:20,800
Frankie

2325
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:24,128
Yeah it's very much I'm an old man and I don't know how my phone work

2326
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:25,920
You should get a house phone in

2327
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:27,712
Be like his old friend

2328
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:30,784
So Alex

2329
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:32,320
Now

2330
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:34,112
I think has figured out

2331
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:35,904
What's in the story

2332
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:37,184
And that's kind of

2333
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:39,488
I think his reaction to this

2334
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:41,536
Is what makes me

2335
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:44,352
Suspect that some of it is actually true okay

2336
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:46,912
And maybe there's some evidence

2337
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,704
Has been produced

2338
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:49,984
Because he is

2339
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:51,008
Pissed

2340
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:57,664
Broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday

2341
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,224
Program I'm your host Alex Jones

2342
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:07,648
And a big story about Latimer cooking the segment that I had some breaking news I don't have to deal with MS

2343
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:12,256
So he has to get off there okay

2344
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:17,888
How is this for an interview or is this so he can scream and punch a wall and maybe kill somebody's goldfish

2345
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:18,656
Probably

2346
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:22,496
There is no breaking news that he ends up getting too or anything

2347
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:28,128
Really think that the only thing that's relevant and his world is this New York Times article

2348
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:30,944
And do you see the progression of

2349
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:36,576
I think he's aware of it from the beginning when he predicts that there's going to be negative stories about

2350
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:38,112
I think he

2351
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:41,440
Is kind of aware more music I will not dignify this

2352
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:43,488
The combat

2353
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:44,512
And he's like

2354
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:45,792
God dammit

2355
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:48,864
I am going to go end

2356
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:49,632
The concept

2357
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:52,448
Exercise how angry I am right

2358
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:54,752
Gotcha Real Pit

2359
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:55,776
And the playing

2360
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,568
Special Report then comes back

2361
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:58,336
Can complain

2362
01:47:58,592 --> 01:48:00,896
About how the Chinese are trying to kill all of us

2363
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:07,296
My cousin my wife my husband died of Fentanyl

2364
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:13,440
You don't hear anything about that killing Millions

2365
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,792
Oh I've heard this tone of voice before

2366
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:19,584
The idea that

2367
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,400
Is killing millions of people per year is absurd

2368
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:25,728
According to the CDC there are approximately 69000

2369
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:29,056
Total drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2018

2370
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:31,104
He's actually a 2.9% decrease

2371
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:31,872
2017

2372
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:35,968
The World Health Organization put the number of global drug-related deaths

2373
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:38,272
In 2015 at approximately 450

2374
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:39,040
50000

2375
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:41,600
It's some estimates are even a bit lower than that

2376
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:45,184
Makes sense what I was saying if he's talking about globally

2377
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:46,464
2080

2378
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:50,560
You're not including all of the people that the fentanyl mascot has

2379
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:56,960
Strangled to do that all these right and we're back in absolutely they were back up in the Billy offensive character

2380
01:48:57,984 --> 01:49:02,336
Brother cdc's numbers 2017 was the worst year in terms of drug morbidity

2381
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:03,104
In the recent

2382
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:06,688
There were 40 7600 opiate-related

2383
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:09,760
Of which 59.8% were connected

2384
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:11,040
Static opiates

2385
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:13,088
Of which Fentanyl is one

2386
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:17,440
About 28,500 deaths that were related to

2387
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:18,720
Static opiates

2388
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:20,000
In 27

2389
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:21,792
A lot of that is

2390
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:25,120
No but that category also includes things like methadone and

2391
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:25,888
Tramadol

2392
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:30,240
So wouldn't be a safe assumption say that that number is a precise gauge

2393
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:33,056
Of how many fentanyl deaths there were in the United States

2394
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:34,080
I don't get me wrong

2395
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:35,616
This is a serious problem

2396
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:38,176
Has gotten worse in The Last 5 Years

2397
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:40,480
Or so and it requires attention and action

2398
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:41,760
It just seems like

2399
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:45,344
Talking about the issue in this kind of language trivializes the actual damage

2400
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:47,136
It's being done by synthetic opiate

2401
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:49,184
Which presumably is what Alex should be

2402
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:49,952
Concerned about

2403
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:51,744
But that's where things get Mark

2404
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:54,560
Alex isn't concerned about the overdose deaths

2405
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:55,840
Stephen Curry so dramatic

2406
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:58,144
Or at least that's not his primary can

2407
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:02,240
This narrative exist for him as a way to attack China

2408
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:05,568
The story is that China's bringing in this fentanyl is a way to attack

2409
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:06,336
Hack the West

2410
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:09,920
Of course the people being hurt by this matter and it's a tragic

2411
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:14,016
But it's also in Alex's best interest to exaggerate the problem

2412
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:17,344
The larger the death toll the more reason there is 28 China

2413
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:20,160
So we can be inflated however he wants to suit his

2414
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:22,208
And so that's what you say

2415
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,744
I need this next clip

2416
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,048
He makes it impossible to confirm

2417
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:27,072
Whatever statistic

2418
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:29,120
Presumably is relying

2419
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:37,568
Complications Egyptian the million

2420
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:40,640
Eduardo

2421
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:43,712
Complications from what

2422
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:48,064
Purpose

2423
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:50,624
They wanted

2424
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:53,696
It's all being done on purpose and you nailed it

2425
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:58,304
Complications of it altogether all these different things

2426
01:50:58,816 --> 01:51:01,632
It just becomes almost impossible to track down what he's even

2427
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,912
Presumably talk in the

2428
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:03,936
And it's just

2429
01:51:04,192 --> 01:51:04,960
Alright whatever

2430
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:08,288
What is heart disease heart disease but the bodies Fentanyl

2431
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:10,592
Basically include that

2432
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:11,872
Right

2433
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:14,944
So now Alex has his bad guest of the day

2434
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:16,224
We've had

2435
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:17,248
David Icke

2436
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:22,880
Heavy Hitters luminaries in their field and now someone new

2437
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:27,744
Levant

2438
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:31,840
Tom and still on Twitter

2439
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:47,712
Zeitgeist as well

2440
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:50,528
All of them were various ways in which he doesn't like Muslim

2441
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:51,808
Jerome guy

2442
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:53,600
Alright you come as no surprise that

2443
01:51:53,856 --> 01:52:00,000
The founder Rebel media is on the show today after one of his big Marquis employees Gavin McInnes was on the despres

2444
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:00,768
Prior

2445
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:03,328
Taking in concert with Alex's rant

2446
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:05,376
About needing to go work somewhere else

2447
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:07,424
Surprised

2448
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:08,704
Define Alex

2449
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:10,752
Having a show on Rebel media

2450
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:12,288
Within the foreseeable future

2451
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:15,872
What's going on here with him being on his really enter

2452
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:20,736
Cuz I don't know if I've actually heard Levante come on Alex's show as a guest ever

2453
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:23,296
But his influence has been a very strong one

2454
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:25,600
Wonton Alex whether or not Alex realizes

2455
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:29,440
If you look at the list of the people that have worked for Rebel media

2456
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:32,768
The past years you have a who's who of people Alex has promoted

2457
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:35,840
Faith Goldy Lauren Southern Katie Hopkins

2458
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:38,144
Laura Loomer and Tommy Robinson have all work

2459
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:40,448
Jack the Staubach was there d.c.

2460
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:41,216
Bureau chief

2461
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:43,520
Filling in their Jerome corsi shoes

2462
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:46,080
Gavin was a major player in trouble

2463
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:47,616
You work there for awhile left

2464
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:48,384
Austin is back now

2465
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:53,248
If you look at that list you see whole lot of people who Alex's treated like experts

2466
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:55,552
To the past few years too embarrassing result

2467
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,368
From Jack for sobiks terrifying reported

2468
01:52:58,624 --> 01:52:59,904
Pizza Comet Ping Pong

2469
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:02,976
To Gavin slap fights with Alex in studio

2470
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:06,816
This is just a crew folks have done nothing but make Alex look like a total idiot

2471
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:09,632
But they've also been a radicalizing influence

2472
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:12,448
What's the new shift towards being so strongly anti-muslim

2473
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:18,848
Most of these contributors at Rebel have an almost singular focus on Islam being the big problem in the world

2474
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:22,432
People like Katie Hopkins or Lawrence Southern or Tommy Robinson

2475
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:24,736
Are people whose names you would not know

2476
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:28,064
If it weren't for their over-the-top islamophobic stunts

2477
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:32,160
Interesting Lee ever Levant of gaunt on some roads

2478
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:33,952
But Alex can only dream of

2479
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:34,720
Going down

2480
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:37,536
It is career as a guy who writes down Bulletin

2481
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:42,912
And by that I mean that with Ezra Levant was working for Sun media in Canada

2482
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:44,192
Back in 2010

2483
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:48,032
He wrote an article about George Soros working with the Nazis in WWII

2484
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:50,592
And Soros threatened to sue him

2485
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:51,872
Yep

2486
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:55,712
Naturally levantan Sun media immediately issued an apology

2487
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:56,480
Who said quote

2488
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:59,808
The management of sun media which is the state that there is no basis

2489
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:00,576
Is for the statements

2490
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:02,624
The column and that they should not have been made

2491
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:07,744
This is exactly how things would play out if George Soros really cared what Alex said about him

2492
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,328
Alex would get a letter from a lawyer and it was probably copy and

2493
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,376
That sun media apology

2494
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:14,400
And that would be that

2495
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:16,704
The Alex has got to be really jealous

2496
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:20,032
He's not he doesn't even rated letter

2497
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,568
That's disappointing

2498
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:23,104
Yeah that's really disappoint

2499
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:26,176
Leaving aside other times levantis had to make

2500
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:29,760
Corrections or apologies in the face of defamation claim

2501
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:31,552
He's also had to apologize for

2502
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:32,576
Pretty blatant

2503
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:33,344
Bigotry

2504
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:35,392
2012 Levant basin

2505
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:38,208
Comments on a show he was hosting called The Source

2506
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:40,000
Victor Willets a word

2507
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:41,792
Not very kind towards the Roma

2508
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,584
He said quote

2509
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:44,352
These are gypsy

2510
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:46,656
A culture synonymous with swindlers

2511
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:53,056
The freeze Gypsy and cheater have been so interchangeably interchangeable historically that the word is entered the English language

2512
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:54,336
Is a verb Egypt

2513
01:54:55,104 --> 01:55:01,248
Gypsies Archer race they aren't a religion they aren't a linguistic group during medieval prototype of the Occupy Wall Street

2514
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:05,600
A shiftless group of hobos that doesn't believe in property rights for themselves

2515
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:09,440
They're Nomads or four others they rob people blind

2516
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:11,232
That is a swing

2517
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:13,280
Wow

2518
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:14,304
Damn

2519
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:15,328
I feel bad even reading

2520
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:20,704
The roast of Donald Trump Christ what was that

2521
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:21,984
Naturally people

2522
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:24,288
Like this too much

2523
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:25,824
So he was condemned around

2524
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:29,152
Six months later he issued an apology with seems a little flat

2525
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:30,688
But at least he did get around

2526
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:32,992
Man it's

2527
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:39,392
How is you know the only reasonable explanation for why a term like that would become part of our parlor

2528
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:40,160
Because it's

2529
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:40,928
Trudeau

2530
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:45,536
There's no possible way that some sort of bigotry could descend

2531
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:50,400
Throughout our f****** history escorted a twisted view of linguistic yeah

2532
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:54,496
Jesus couple years after this incident

2533
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:58,080
He started Rebel media and I think if you look at is hiring decision

2534
01:55:58,336 --> 01:56:00,384
Viewed in concert with his past Behavior

2535
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:03,200
You could pretty much get the sense of what this guy's about

2536
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:04,736
He hired Faith Goldy

2537
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:07,808
A woman was made over overtures to Neo.

2538
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:11,904
You heard Gavin McInnes the guy who created a western chauvinist streak

2539
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:13,440
He hired Lauren Southern

2540
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:16,768
A woman who teamed up with a white identitarian group to intercept

2541
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:18,048
Migrant boats in the

2542
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:19,072
The Mediterranean

2543
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:21,120
Good went on tour with Stefan molyneux

2544
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:22,400
Fire Katy Haupt

2545
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,216
Suggested we need a final solution

2546
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:25,984
Muslims

2547
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:27,776
Of course he hired Tommy Robinson

2548
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:29,824
Speaks for itself

2549
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:34,176
If you hire one of these people I'm going to be super suspicious about your

2550
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:36,224
When you hire all of them

2551
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:37,504
It's not an axe

2552
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:40,320
These are the people you want to promote in the message

2553
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:41,856
That sounds is very clear

2554
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:43,392
Are you saying to me

2555
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:44,416
That

2556
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:45,952
This kind of like

2557
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:47,488
Apology

2558
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:48,512
Before his

2559
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:49,280
Anti

2560
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:51,328
And very bigoted rhetoric

2561
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:53,120
Was was maybe not

2562
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:55,168
Not something that he actually meant

2563
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:55,936
Instagram

2564
01:56:56,192 --> 01:57:00,032
Are you saying that maybe some of his apologies have perhaps been performative

2565
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:01,824
M b i mean

2566
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:03,104
Maybe

2567
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:10,016
How to start running

2568
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:12,064
How does get going

2569
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:14,624
And this is

2570
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:15,392
Just stopped

2571
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:18,464
He asked how the rebel new started

2572
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:25,120
We used to have a real TV station that was on real TV they called us Fosters

2573
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:27,680
Closest Kohl's

2574
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:32,544
Tell me when we have to go to break

2575
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:38,432
We had 200 people we were on cable TV we were across the country

2576
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:40,224
But then our regulator

2577
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:43,040
Our version of the FCC

2578
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:46,112
Injected as basically aborted us

2579
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:46,880
Bye

2580
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:49,696
Having a regulatory ruling that made us

2581
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:50,720
Enviable

2582
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:54,816
Overnight this TV network of 200 people that was pumping out

2583
01:57:55,072 --> 01:58:01,216
A freedom narrative a counter-narrative to the media party

2584
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:02,240
Not the audience

2585
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:05,824
So that so then we started Rebel news out of the ashes of that

2586
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:09,408
So before starting Rebel media Levante works for Sun News

2587
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:10,688
On by sunmi.

2588
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:13,760
Shockingly is comments about the Roma somehow didn't

2589
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:19,904
Tell result in his termination nor did his defamatory comments about Soros

2590
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:22,464
Sun News Network went dark

2591
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:24,000
In February 2015

2592
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:28,352
And it was not the result of overzealous Regulators it was a failing business

2593
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:32,448
In 2013 the Canadian radio-television and Telecommunications

2594
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:34,496
Commissioned

2595
01:58:34,752 --> 01:58:38,080
Their request to be included in the category of channels that are required to be

2596
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:39,872
Be included on basic cable package

2597
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:43,200
I guess I could pretend that this is why they failed

2598
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:44,224
That's absurd

2599
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:47,040
The commission's reasoning for their denial was that

2600
01:58:47,296 --> 01:58:48,832
The channel was nowhere near meeting

2601
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:50,880
The criteria for being on the list of

2602
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:51,648
Require Channel

2603
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:53,440
Perspective

2604
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:57,280
The Canadian Broadcasting Company did they reported that data reveal

2605
01:58:57,792 --> 01:59:00,864
At The Sun News was available prior to them being

2606
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:01,888
Denied this

2607
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:02,656
Request

2608
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:04,704
They were available to viewers

2609
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:05,472
In Fife

2610
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:07,264
Week 1 million households

2611
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:09,568
And they were only pulling in an average of 8

2612
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:10,336
8000 View

2613
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,408
Not popular

2614
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:15,968
And they were basically throwing out a Hail Mary

2615
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:17,248
Where they wanted the government to

2616
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:20,064
To require their station to be on every cable package

2617
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:22,368
And then when he didn't get what they wanted

2618
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:24,928
It became a case of government repression

2619
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:30,048
The government to regulate them into the TV and then when the government did not

2620
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:33,120
They complained about government regulation

2621
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:37,472
I don't think these people have any good faith argument these days

2622
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:39,264
Not really don't think they do

2623
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:43,360
In 2013 Canadian Broadcasting Company was reporting

2624
01:59:43,616 --> 01:59:44,384
Station at lost

2625
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:45,920
13 million dollars

2626
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:46,944
The previous year

2627
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:48,480
There shouldn't be any surprise

2628
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:49,248
Collapsed

2629
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:53,344
Sun media sold off most of its assets to a company called post

2630
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:55,904
Media but they weren't interested in buying the Sun News Now

2631
01:59:56,416 --> 02:00:00,000
There was no buyer and Son media wasn't there to run the station

2632
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:01,024
So it went under

2633
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:06,144
Almost immediately the van started the rebel and honestly that's what he should have been doing

2634
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:06,912
Begin with

2635
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:08,704
Rickety puts out

2636
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:10,240
That's it how many YouTube channels

2637
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:13,312
Yeah to make it financially viable is a television station

2638
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:14,336
Isn't going to work

2639
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:18,176
The whole the government-regulated us out of existence story is great

2640
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:19,968
Please well on Infowars

2641
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:25,088
But the reality is the government right we assessed at the station didn't meet the standards they ever required station

2642
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:26,112
In basic

2643
02:00:26,368 --> 02:00:27,136
Cable packages

2644
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:28,928
I am dealing with reality

2645
02:00:29,184 --> 02:00:29,696
Not in the best

2646
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:30,976
The egos involved

2647
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:32,000
Telling these stories

2648
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:33,280
Yeah I don't

2649
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:34,304
I think that he would be

2650
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:36,352
At all willing to just be like

2651
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:43,008
Well we all had eight thousand people watching so it turns out in the marketplace of ideas

2652
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:45,568
F****** suck and you can make the argument that

2653
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:48,128
That they're like well more people would have watched us

2654
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:48,896
If they didn't

2655
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:50,688
To pay for the

2656
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:57,088
Cable package that we were on sure and I mean I guess that is only making the argument that no one thought your product was

2657
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:03,488
What we want for our product

2658
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,816
Free in order to compete with other people

2659
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:08,352
So here's how Alex rewrites

2660
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:13,216
What happened to your network

2661
02:01:13,728 --> 02:01:19,104
You watch it tell people the name is she looked into it years ago

2662
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:21,152
Do the government shut you down

2663
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:25,504
This is Canada folks

2664
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:26,784
Florida horseshit

2665
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:28,576
They talked about that

2666
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,624
What about China soccer

2667
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:31,392
And I really

2668
02:01:31,648 --> 02:01:33,440
I don't particularly care

2669
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:36,000
I do think though it's interesting

2670
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:37,024
Because

2671
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:41,376
What you have here is Alex freaked out before the

2672
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:46,496
He is so mad he was like I have to go out there and play this special report

2673
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:49,312
He could have canceled this interview

2674
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:50,592
Any dip

2675
02:01:52,896 --> 02:01:55,968
There's some through some reason that he still did it

2676
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:59,040
Because immediately after the interview

2677
02:01:59,296 --> 02:02:00,832
He plays another Special Report

2678
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:01,856
That is

2679
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:03,392
Bizarrely spiritual

2680
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:05,952
And then also indicates again

2681
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:09,024
Alibaba

2682
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:11,840
Radiation chemicals

2683
02:02:14,656 --> 02:02:15,168
Perception

2684
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:17,984
Make a larger connection with the universe

2685
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:19,776
Itself energize

2686
02:02:21,568 --> 02:02:27,712
Is a 90 TV Guru thing this bad even complete with abuse

2687
02:02:27,968 --> 02:02:32,064
Like what are we doing

2688
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:33,088
Open it

2689
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:33,856
The world

2690
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:38,464
Okay

2691
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:43,328
So

2692
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:46,400
Oh no

2693
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:48,192
Michelle

2694
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:50,496
That's a weird way to frame

2695
02:02:53,056 --> 02:02:57,920
Paralyzed by all the news I'm in the cereal aisle and I don't know whether to choose cat

2696
02:02:58,176 --> 02:02:58,688
Krunchers

2697
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:03,552
Crunch they're all crunchy I don't know I definitely relate to that in the cereal aisle

2698
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:05,856
Although I would say

2699
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:07,392
It doesn't makes

2700
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:09,184
I have too much content

2701
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:09,952
To produce

2702
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:11,488
Absolutely

2703
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:17,376
That's your issue right that's why we only I mean

2704
02:03:17,888 --> 02:03:18,400
Keep moving

2705
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:19,168
I guess

2706
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:21,216
This mood

2707
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:23,008
Just gets way worse

2708
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:29,664
And baby I would be more interested in like talking about the guy from Rebel being on the show if it weren't

2709
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:34,784
For like it really seems like it's a blip yeah seems relevant only to me

2710
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:36,064
Only because

2711
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,112
I don't think he's ever been on the show before

2712
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:42,720
And Alex said the day before he's going to have to go start working other places yeah

2713
02:03:42,976 --> 02:03:45,280
X seems to me like that's the only

2714
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:46,560
And Ezra's the founder

2715
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:50,656
Yeah okay well that's editor

2716
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:55,008
I think that it's only important because as his mood is so terrible

2717
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:56,288
Like

2718
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,848
Still had to do the interview I think that's interest

2719
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:00,896
But far more interesting

2720
02:04:01,152 --> 02:04:01,920
Is how bad thing

2721
02:04:02,432 --> 02:04:03,968
Wait what hour we are we in

2722
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:06,272
Okay

2723
02:04:06,528 --> 02:04:09,600
In the fourth hour okay so he still has to Ride This Out

2724
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:11,904
To the to The Bitter End of his third hour

2725
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:18,048
Well I mean he does say a couple times that he should be off air

2726
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:18,816
Because

2727
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:19,840
Biscuits

2728
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:20,864
So f*****

2729
02:04:21,632 --> 02:04:23,424
Thought a lot about this

2730
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:26,752
I just really can't lie to people

2731
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,848
I need to just tell you the truth

2732
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:34,944
I just lay out the best of my knowledge what's going on I think all you have

2733
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,480
Really good idea what's going on

2734
02:04:36,736 --> 02:04:38,016
Probably better than I do

2735
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:45,696
Because I did a lot of preparation last night today I probably work 4 hours last night on this show and I have a comforting I intended to

2736
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:48,768
We know and I operation early this morning

2737
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:53,632
Then why you doing things but

2738
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:54,400
We don't

2739
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:55,680
A subject

2740
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:59,264
In its fullness and its totality

2741
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:03,872
Poor people understand the interconnectivity and then out of defeated

2742
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:09,248
People know there's a better option and end

2743
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:10,784
What they're missing out on

2744
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:15,392
We're going to lose this thing and I just don't want to be

2745
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:17,440
Commentator

2746
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:19,232
Ball game

2747
02:05:24,352 --> 02:05:25,120
I don't want to be a spec

2748
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:29,728
This is a strange headspace because

2749
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:31,264
He has Alex saying

2750
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:33,824
That I can't lie to people I need to tell you the truth

2751
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:36,640
Which implies that there's something he's been less than honest

2752
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:37,920
Just about to begin with

2753
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:39,200
And I don't know what that

2754
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:44,320
I don't I don't honestly even knowing how the rest of this episode plays out I'm not

2755
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:45,088
Positive

2756
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:47,136
Are you know exactly what he's

2757
02:05:47,392 --> 02:05:48,160
Struggling

2758
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:51,488
So

2759
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,096
That would be a big one for him to

2760
02:05:56,608 --> 02:06:01,472
I think I'd be in a slightly different mood is that was

2761
02:06:01,728 --> 02:06:03,008
There was even some

2762
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:03,776
Some sort of amass

2763
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:06,080
Reveal

2764
02:06:06,592 --> 02:06:07,104
I think there's

2765
02:06:07,872 --> 02:06:09,152
Escalation towards like

2766
02:06:10,432 --> 02:06:12,736
I think there's there's violence here man

2767
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:16,064
I think that Alex is almost giving a sign

2768
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:16,832
Is audien

2769
02:06:17,856 --> 02:06:18,368
And

2770
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:21,440
I think he starts by justifying it

2771
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:24,256
By talking about the evil violent things

2772
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:27,584
That the globalist are already doing to us your

2773
02:06:28,096 --> 02:06:28,608
Advance

2774
02:06:28,864 --> 02:06:30,656
I will say this is pretty heavy

2775
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:31,936
But at the same time

2776
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:34,240
Pretty funny how this clip app

2777
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:37,056
Intellectual and political album

2778
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:43,968
You come to the realization

2779
02:06:45,504 --> 02:06:46,016
That

2780
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:47,808
They're doing violent things.

2781
02:06:49,088 --> 02:06:51,136
Institutional

2782
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:52,160
Ambien

2783
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:56,256
Systems the way you would slowly poison

2784
02:06:58,304 --> 02:06:59,328
A while

2785
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:02,656
Bird

2786
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:05,728
Large group of horses called

2787
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:12,384
Crows is called

2788
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:14,432
No it's not

2789
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:18,016
Getting a bigger it's called a murder

2790
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:21,088
Came up with

2791
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:22,112
What is happen

2792
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:31,328
Well saying about is

2793
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:33,888
Would you call

2794
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:36,960
Herd of horses

2795
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:39,008
Are horses

2796
02:07:39,776 --> 02:07:41,568
Bags under the eyes crow's feet

2797
02:07:41,824 --> 02:07:43,104
Fine lines and wrinkles

2798
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:49,504
He is so distracted but I think that's because he's recognizing on some level

2799
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:51,296
He's going down a path

2800
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:53,856
Where he saying that the globalist by

2801
02:07:54,112 --> 02:07:55,136
Doing all of the things that

2802
02:07:55,392 --> 02:07:58,208
He says they're doing to us and has for years

2803
02:07:58,464 --> 02:08:00,256
Are committing violent Acts

2804
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:01,280
Against us

2805
02:08:02,048 --> 02:08:05,376
That is a justification for violence against them

2806
02:08:05,888 --> 02:08:07,936
They're putting stuff in the water

2807
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:09,728
They're trying to kill all of us

2808
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:11,520
For decades

2809
02:08:12,032 --> 02:08:13,568
His show has been

2810
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:14,848
Adjust ification

2811
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:16,896
For murdering the globalist

2812
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:18,688
Andy realizes

2813
02:08:19,456 --> 02:08:20,480
I'm so angry right

2814
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:24,576
I'm not sure exactly what about could be the New York Times article I'm not pop

2815
02:08:25,344 --> 02:08:26,368
Whatever reason

2816
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:27,392
He's Furious

2817
02:08:28,928 --> 02:08:32,512
You recognizing that the path he's going down is going to lead towards

2818
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:34,304
A Murder of Crows

2819
02:08:35,072 --> 02:08:37,888
And so he gets distracted by talking about groups of horses

2820
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:39,168
Because

2821
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:40,960
I don't think he wants

2822
02:08:41,216 --> 02:08:41,728
2

2823
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:44,288
If you pardon the expression pull the trigger

2824
02:08:44,544 --> 02:08:46,080
What is an abrasive horses

2825
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:47,360
It's actually her

2826
02:08:47,616 --> 02:08:49,920
There's a ton of words Collective group

2827
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:52,224
The course is depending on if they're Wild

2828
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:55,040
I believe I've already come down on collective nouns

2829
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:55,808
Sounds pretty negative

2830
02:08:56,064 --> 02:08:57,088
They're they're fun

2831
02:08:59,136 --> 02:09:04,000
Anyway Alex comes back from break and again this is not great stuff

2832
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:07,328
Towards the end of this episode what they're still moments of levity

2833
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:09,888
Ladies and gentlemen we are back

2834
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:13,984
Broadcasting worldwide eyebrows Dallas

2835
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:20,896
Maybe some days I should just go off here

2836
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:24,224
I don't want to start yelling and screaming and threatening people

2837
02:09:25,248 --> 02:09:25,760
Yes

2838
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:26,784
Good

2839
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:30,112
No you were screaming and yelling

2840
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:40,096
So

2841
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:47,264
That is a really glad that that was resolved I'm really glad

2842
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:49,568
Moment of levity mixed in with like this real

2843
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:51,616
Terrible stop but

2844
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:56,736
What he said let me get back to where I was I go

2845
02:09:56,992 --> 02:10:00,320
I need to resolve a group of horses

2846
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:01,344
Clear this up

2847
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:08,256
Look at you know I've seen a lot of TV shows try to end and they leave that one narrative strand

2848
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:11,328
Resolved and I'm not going to do that on this show

2849
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:14,144
You are going to know what a f****** group horses is

2850
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:15,936
Or I'm going to end it now

2851
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:19,520
So the club was doing all this violence stuff against

2852
02:10:19,776 --> 02:10:20,288
People

2853
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:22,080
You know Alex has been

2854
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:27,200
Waging his on-air campaign against them for a very long time but it turns out it also has led him

2855
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:29,248
To be socially weird

2856
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:30,528
I get pissed

2857
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:32,064
Because

2858
02:10:39,232 --> 02:10:40,256
My Children Go.

2859
02:10:40,512 --> 02:10:41,792
Please don't do it

2860
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:55,360
Vaccine inserts

2861
02:10:55,616 --> 02:10:57,152
Cousin telling me that are my friend

2862
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:03,552
What's going on am I supposed to talk to each other

2863
02:11:04,064 --> 02:11:06,112
What

2864
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:12,512
I approached pregnant women at stores and tell them about Mexicans I'm not trying to be here but if I see a random

2865
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:17,120
Pregnant woman I immediately go up to her and tell her how to raise her child

2866
02:11:17,632 --> 02:11:18,144
Scaccia

2867
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:23,264
Strain not weird I do want to be weird here it's all in services

2868
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:25,056
Do you know the story that he's telling her

2869
02:11:25,312 --> 02:11:25,824
Here is about

2870
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:31,968
That was the reason he was struggling to come up with the word for gang horses is because

2871
02:11:32,224 --> 02:11:33,248
He is

2872
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:35,552
Trying to make the metaphor that

2873
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:41,952
If there's an unwanted horse population they'll poison get rid of them

2874
02:11:42,208 --> 02:11:42,720
The vax

2875
02:11:42,976 --> 02:11:44,512
Seems low ride in the water

2876
02:11:44,768 --> 02:11:45,536
Is the same

2877
02:11:45,792 --> 02:11:46,560
The globalist

2878
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:47,584
They're doing to us

2879
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:49,632
Answer that leads to some

2880
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:50,912
Start a troubling

2881
02:11:52,448 --> 02:11:52,960
Things

2882
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:59,872
Violent towards them and defend ourselves

2883
02:12:04,736 --> 02:12:10,624
Use that against

2884
02:12:11,136 --> 02:12:12,160
Do the vaccines arrested

2885
02:12:15,488 --> 02:12:16,000
Sure

2886
02:12:18,048 --> 02:12:19,584
They're going to Stage stuff in Ark

2887
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:28,032
But we should have a debate about the larger panoptigon

2888
02:12:30,336 --> 02:12:32,128
Universal

2889
02:12:32,384 --> 02:12:33,152
Paradox

2890
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:41,344
Radiological

2891
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:45,696
And just going to go on forever

2892
02:12:47,232 --> 02:12:53,120
A lot of people

2893
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:08,992
So

2894
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:14,112
Was that what's that movie with no that was

2895
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:15,392
You know

2896
02:13:16,416 --> 02:13:18,976
Panopticon debate

2897
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:21,792
Is here other than is it time

2898
02:13:22,048 --> 02:13:24,352
Yeah it does seem like he is

2899
02:13:24,608 --> 02:13:26,912
Inspiring people to go commit acts of violence

2900
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:29,472
And also at the same time saying that

2901
02:13:29,728 --> 02:13:33,824
If somebody commits an act of violence it's the globalist who are false flag

2902
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:36,384
But if they if it wasn't the global is false

2903
02:13:37,152 --> 02:13:38,688
I would still support you

2904
02:13:38,944 --> 02:13:40,736
Because the globalist

2905
02:13:40,992 --> 02:13:44,832
That's what the water like that all the time so we should be doing this

2906
02:13:45,088 --> 02:13:47,136
And it's disappointing to me that the global

2907
02:13:47,392 --> 02:13:48,672
BlueStar doing it for us

2908
02:13:49,184 --> 02:13:49,952
I have no idea

2909
02:13:51,488 --> 02:13:52,256
Trouble

2910
02:13:53,024 --> 02:13:54,560
Buy this hat

2911
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:59,168
It's also with the thing that I find the most troubling is like he's clearly mad about some

2912
02:13:59,424 --> 02:14:01,216
Something and that's what's precipitating

2913
02:14:01,984 --> 02:14:02,496
This this

2914
02:14:02,752 --> 02:14:04,800
Line of thought in this sort of like

2915
02:14:05,056 --> 02:14:09,920
Look I'm not trying to threaten you I'm just telling you a lot of people like me who kill list

2916
02:14:10,432 --> 02:14:10,944
Yeah

2917
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:15,296
A lot of cult leaders one of their defining characteristic

2918
02:14:15,808 --> 02:14:17,344
When they get into a bad mood

2919
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:18,368
Others get

2920
02:14:19,648 --> 02:14:20,416
Stroop app

2921
02:14:20,672 --> 02:14:21,440
So

2922
02:14:21,696 --> 02:14:22,976
The time is fast approaching

2923
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:25,792
When

2924
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:28,608
The people will put this into action

2925
02:14:28,864 --> 02:14:31,168
So you're involved putting floor on the water

2926
02:14:31,936 --> 02:14:38,080
Turnball try to push all this crap and your Bayer pharmaceutical heads that knowingly put HIV and hepatitis and millions of pee

2927
02:14:38,336 --> 02:14:39,104
People

2928
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:45,248
Screw those hemophiliac what what are you going to do when somebody walks up to you

2929
02:14:46,016 --> 02:14:48,064

2930
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:49,856

02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:55,488
Aorta

2932
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,304
How are you doing

2933
02:14:58,816 --> 02:15:03,424
You're a human your life values we're all animals all the rest of us UFO over

2934
02:15:18,016 --> 02:15:19,040
You're not just telling you

2935
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:22,112
That

2936
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:23,392
You guys

2937
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:28,512
That sounds like a threat what you're doing now

2938
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:32,608
If you don't back off

2939
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:33,632
Real quick

2940
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:38,240
Cats

2941
02:15:38,496 --> 02:15:39,264
Definitively a threat

2942
02:15:41,056 --> 02:15:45,664
That's that that's that's doesn't get more a threat than if you don't stop

2943
02:15:46,176 --> 02:15:47,712
We will hurt you

2944
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:50,272
Yeah you could you could make a pretty interesting

2945
02:15:50,528 --> 02:15:53,856
Argument that the threat I don't know I just

2946
02:15:54,112 --> 02:15:55,648
I mean like there is no

2947
02:15:56,416 --> 02:15:57,184
Backing off

2948
02:15:57,952 --> 02:16:00,512
Like the terms that he it what is he want like

2949
02:16:00,768 --> 02:16:01,536
Like no vaccine

2950
02:16:01,792 --> 02:16:02,816
Given to anybody

2951
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:05,120
Like what is like what is backing off

2952
02:16:05,888 --> 02:16:08,960
It's such a ridiculous concept depends on his

2953
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:12,544
Descendants

2954
02:16:13,056 --> 02:16:14,592
Badly

2955
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:16,128
This industry

2956
02:16:17,152 --> 02:16:17,920
I can't help

2957
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:21,248
But think it's in Subway triggered by the New York Times

2958
02:16:22,528 --> 02:16:25,088
It absolutely feels like he's just a child

2959
02:16:25,344 --> 02:16:29,440
Yeah it's this three-day stretch has been so childish

2960
02:16:29,696 --> 02:16:32,768
Of like depending on how he feels about anything

2961
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:37,632
Is how he's going to lie about it and there are all of these people who are just

2962
02:16:38,144 --> 02:16:42,240
Apparently captive listeners to the whims of a f******

2963
02:16:42,752 --> 02:16:45,056
Rapidly deteriorating Luna

2964
02:16:45,568 --> 02:16:46,080
Yep it's

2965
02:16:46,592 --> 02:16:47,360
It's not

2966
02:16:47,872 --> 02:16:48,640
That's not good

2967
02:16:48,896 --> 02:16:51,200
Yeah it's not a it's not a good show no

2968
02:16:51,456 --> 02:16:57,600
And like I said the beginning like I listen to until I was like I've had enough

2969
02:16:58,624 --> 02:17:00,928
Because like even at the same time even isn't listen

2970
02:17:01,184 --> 02:17:02,976
It's all this stuff where it's like

2971
02:17:03,232 --> 02:17:04,256
You don't back off

2972
02:17:04,768 --> 02:17:08,096
There are all these people out there web list of people there ready to kill

2973
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:10,400
And you know something's going to happen

2974
02:17:10,656 --> 02:17:12,960
But if you don't if you don't f****** stop

2975
02:17:15,008 --> 02:17:17,568
You even it as he's expressing those things

2976
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:20,896
He of course naturally ends up getting into a grocery

2977
02:17:21,152 --> 02:17:22,176
About drag queen story

2978
02:17:22,944 --> 02:17:23,712
Quick right

As you listen

2980
02:17:24,736 --> 02:17:25,248
Do this

2981
02:17:25,504 --> 02:17:29,600
Like you can tell like this is still him trying to get money from people

2982
02:17:30,112 --> 02:17:36,256
Major newspapers in Wichita Kansas or defending not knowing their identities we could we just need to groom your kid

2983
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:38,560

2984
02:17:40,096 --> 02:17:42,912
What's coming out this look like psychotic

2985
02:17:43,168 --> 02:17:44,704
Demons zombie movie

2986
02:17:47,008 --> 02:17:47,776
Brooke

2987
02:17:50,592 --> 02:17:52,128
Unreleased

2988
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:56,224
It's all in the background it's been waiting

2989
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:58,272
It's been preparing it's been tearing up

2990
02:17:58,784 --> 02:18:04,928
He's going to do it through Christmas shopping here change your life here

DNA Force Plus

2993
02:18:11,072 --> 02:18:15,424
Whatever bad Moody's and it's not so bad that he can't launch right into that voice

2994
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:16,704
Nope now

2995
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:20,544
So what I do think there is some like real

2996
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:21,568
I would like

2997
02:18:22,336 --> 02:18:22,848
Prices

2998
02:18:23,104 --> 02:18:23,872
Betty's feeling

2999
02:18:24,128 --> 02:18:24,640
What

3000
02:18:25,152 --> 02:18:25,920
End in

3001
02:18:26,176 --> 02:18:26,688
The terms of

3002
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:28,224
From you know

3003
02:18:28,736 --> 02:18:29,248
Maybe

3004
02:18:29,504 --> 02:18:33,856
End of the first hour he's in this mood where I've got to get off Airplane Special Report

3005
02:18:34,112 --> 02:18:36,416
Doing this interview that he has to do

3006
02:18:36,928 --> 02:18:39,744
My theory because he wants to work at Rebel media

3007
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:40,512
As opposed

3008
02:18:40,768 --> 02:18:42,816
But I can't prove that I don't know it's just a theory

3009
02:18:43,072 --> 02:18:44,352
At least keeping his options

3010
02:18:44,608 --> 02:18:46,656
Something longer

3011
02:18:46,912 --> 02:18:48,448
Have to do this a good sign

3012
02:18:48,704 --> 02:18:52,288
Interviews over he's freaking out even more and it deteriorates

3013
02:18:52,544 --> 02:18:53,312
It's to the point where he's

3014
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:54,592
Sort of

3015
02:18:55,616 --> 02:18:57,664
Fantasizing about these

3016
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:59,712
Patriots with kill last

3017
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:03,040
Being out there is something real to how he

3018
02:19:03,296 --> 02:19:03,808
Keys

3019
02:19:04,064 --> 02:19:04,576
Struggling

3020
02:19:04,832 --> 02:19:05,856
With it right

3021
02:19:06,112 --> 02:19:07,392
But it's not so bad

3022
02:19:07,648 --> 02:19:08,928
That the primary function

3023
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:09,952
Can't still be sir

3024
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:11,232
His

3025
02:19:11,744 --> 02:19:12,512
Got to get that money

3026
02:19:12,768 --> 02:19:15,072
Yeah I mean he's a f****** Pro

3027
02:19:15,584 --> 02:19:19,424
Like I don't think that I don't think that voice has been real for

3028
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:20,704
20 years if ever

3029
02:19:21,216 --> 02:19:23,008
You know that's that like sales voice

3030
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:25,056
He's not a pro when it comes to

3031
02:19:25,312 --> 02:19:27,104
Collective noun that's true

3032
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:29,152
But what

3033
02:19:29,664 --> 02:19:30,432
Just this is

3034
02:19:30,688 --> 02:19:31,200
This is bad

3035
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:32,992
It's bad stuff

3036
02:19:33,504 --> 02:19:35,040
The last week wasn't great

3037
02:19:35,296 --> 02:19:35,808
On his show

3038
02:19:37,856 --> 02:19:39,392
But it is what it is

3039
02:19:39,904 --> 02:19:45,280
You know I just don't understand how you can like have a show where

3040
02:19:45,792 --> 02:19:46,560
You have

3041
02:19:46,816 --> 02:19:47,840
Discreetly differ

3042
02:19:48,352 --> 02:19:50,144
Days you know like David Icke

3043
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:51,936
Extravaganza one day

3044
02:19:52,448 --> 02:19:54,752
Turning on Trump

3045
02:19:55,008 --> 02:20:00,128
You know like these in a cowardly way which is he is described it is treason again

3046
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:00,896
God yes

3047
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:02,176
We are you have these like

3048
02:20:02,432 --> 02:20:03,712
Picture of formulaic

3049
02:20:03,968 --> 02:20:06,016
Meaningless good things about Trump and then

3050
02:20:06,272 --> 02:20:09,600
Declarations that he's committed treason and maybe working for Satan

3051
02:20:09,856 --> 02:20:11,392
Wright and rambling about

3052
02:20:11,904 --> 02:20:13,952
How you know about a moon base

3053
02:20:14,208 --> 02:20:17,280
Yeah that one was trouble

3054
02:20:17,536 --> 02:20:18,048
Sort of

3055
02:20:18,304 --> 02:20:21,376
You know esoteric nonsense about the devil

3056
02:20:21,632 --> 02:20:22,400
On that day

3057
02:20:22,656 --> 02:20:24,704
Hey, do the fifth that just have a breakdown

3058
02:20:26,496 --> 02:20:28,544
Probably about this New York Times article

3059
02:20:29,312 --> 02:20:30,592
All that leads to

3060
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:31,360
Celebration

3061
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:33,152
Possible coming

3062
02:20:33,664 --> 02:20:34,688
Right-wing terror attack

3063
02:20:34,944 --> 02:20:39,296
Yeah I suppose that's that McPhee his best strategy to get new

3064
02:20:39,552 --> 02:20:40,064
Listeners in

3065
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:41,088
Viewers moving forward

3066
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:43,392
Be so unpredictable that

3067
02:20:43,904 --> 02:20:46,208
You'll tune in just to see what lunacy happen

3068
02:20:46,976 --> 02:20:47,744
Yeah maybe

3069
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:48,512
I mean

3070
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:50,816
What once you've already said

3071
02:20:51,072 --> 02:20:52,352
Shopping anywhere else

3072
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:57,984
Children's can I guess the only other players

3073
02:20:58,240 --> 02:20:58,752
Just like

3074
02:20:59,008 --> 02:20:59,776
Complete

3075
02:21:00,288 --> 02:21:04,384
Unpredictable disconnected even from yesterday

3076
02:21:05,408 --> 02:21:08,224
He's just like The Tonight Show and have a

3077
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:10,272
Have a week

3078
02:21:10,784 --> 02:21:13,344
Where the animal Wranglers come in not just

3079
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:15,904
Llamas let's find out what else we can put in that

3080
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:17,184
At Studio

3081
02:21:17,696 --> 02:21:18,720
I'll maybe you can't afford it

3082
02:21:18,976 --> 02:21:22,048
Probably not

3083
02:21:22,816 --> 02:21:24,352
But like I said the through-line is

3084
02:21:24,864 --> 02:21:25,632
We need money

3085
02:21:25,888 --> 02:21:26,400
