9
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,736

Oh no you're coming after talenti gelato now this is a different story

11
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,720

12
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,560
Cut open the f****** container

13
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:50,336
I was considering doing a week and going over it all the flavors

14
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,408
Find separating the wheat from the chaff

15
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,736

Frosting flavored ice cream is disgusting

19
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:14,144
Yeah but I did try to

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,704
That's the trigger is a 2 year scotch

21
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,264
The cheers is to the salted caramel

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,312
Laird

23
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,152
These are all the Laird was

24
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,736
Sort of

25
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,040
Chocolate cake

26
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
Good

27
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,832
Good

28
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
Strong

29
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
Good stuff

30
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
Then there's a peanut butter

31
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,256
Wanda

32
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,888
That's amazing yeah yeah it's horrific I ate a little bit of

33
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,472
That's that's a testament

34
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,544
I do hold 20 responsible for

35
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
They made it

36
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,872
But you know I'm not too mad at

I would have had it cuz imma I'm a big peanut butter person

41
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
But

42
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,536
Ice cream terms by partner she's allergic to

43
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,328
Do peanuts so never have ice cream

44
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
Make ice cream in the house

45
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,168
With that type of flavor so I've never got

46
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,496
That's it's good to know that I can just skip

47
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:27,104
Talenti is b******* peanut butter the peanut butter crunch

48
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,664
The layers

49
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Black

50
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,040
That's a big deer

51
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:40,416
My bright spot is yesterday my family did a classic

52
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,464
Platter of celebrations

53
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,768
Little sister's birthday

54
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
My grandfather's turning 100 Centennial

55
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,216
My partner and I got married in like

56
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
It was just

57
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,848
Take your pick of what you wanted to celebrate we'll all get together on a day will bang it out

58
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,896
It out and it worked

59
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,992
Is good stuff good to get it all taken care of

60
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,576
None of this Lego will see you on Tuesday and then on Friday nope

61
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
Get it done will see you in 4 months

62
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,440
Sweet yep I like it I think a lot of other people

63
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,536
Probably would rather see their family more often

64
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,375
But I understand your situation and I

65
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
I know you're coming from

66
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,239
Cake

67
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,335
Was that birthday cake 20

68
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,127
There wasn't even there were

69
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,431
There I think there might have been cake

70
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,223
But it was never brought out

71
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,759
And all we had

72
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,039
Around we're just

73
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
Candles

74
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
Because

75
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:47,231
If you would assume like a they were going to try and do the hundred candles thing quit on that

76
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,815
Candles around and no cake anywhere

77
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
So I think they just bailed out

78
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
Disappointed

79
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
We have episodes

80
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959

84
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,175
Some reason Stewart

85
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,735
Of course first Alex is still on his

86
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
Work vacation

87
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
That he had it on chair so

89
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,719
Today on Sunday

90
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
We won't have time

00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,047

We'll check in with him when he's back

93
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,655
Simultaneously

94
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,495

I have lost my interest in Russell Brand

99
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
That is unsurprising

100
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,647
Ivy I think that there is possibly an episode and like covering him

101
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
He bores me

102
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,719
Yeah no I saw Get Him to the Greek

103
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743

108
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,567

Henry not but be that as it may I declare myself the 74th sorts of fall

140
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,671
That's the name

141
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
You are now attacking

142
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,511
I'm a policy wonk I have

143
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,791
Risen above

And then we're going to

145
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Comeback

148
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
At the end of the day

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,391
F*** you and your new world order

150
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,439

Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

153
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

154
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
And you never see me again

155
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,983
That's really what I want to do

156
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
I never want to come back here again

157
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,079
I apologize to the

158
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,943

161
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
Isn't he is somewhat better

162
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:03,999
There's a couple of things actually revealed over the course of this episode that are like

163
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,583
Man you had some really f***** up positions for a pretty long time

164
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,143
You've just done a pretty good job of

165
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,703
Obscuring

166
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,519
How to restore off here on August

00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
A

169
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
What do you know

170
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,991
Certainly this is going to be

171
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,039
One of the most serious situations

172
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,415
Over several years

173
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
Knox

174
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223

NRA

177
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
What's the point of alert

178
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
And it smokes

179
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,231
Amore in Rochester

183
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,591
Yeah support Gore or bush

184
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
So like

185
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,175
Obviously not guesswork Bill Bradley

186
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,967
Who's in the primaries against

187
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759

00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
Bush in the prime

190
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
Raise

191
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:44,511
Alan Keyes was covered in the GOP primaries

192
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,839
I know that Alan Keyes unable come together on

193
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
Something yeah

194
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,543
Guest-hosted Infowars of the past year but

195
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,359
First part of 2009 that I remember it is we don't

196
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,895
We didn't have that

197
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
Republic

198
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,199
Can primary cavalcade

199
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
Debate stage

200
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:09,087
Did you know where we had sixteen different Republicans saying dumb nonsense at each other

201
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:18,047
All stupid the same way you had a number of folks but they withdrew like before the primary started yet

202
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,863
Exploratory campaign

203
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,399
Puppy panting was trying to run

204
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:27,519
Yes absolutely explored the idea

205
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,591
McCain to use ambush

206
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,175
Functions a little bit better

207
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
I think then

208
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,271
100 people on stage

209
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
But it's less entertaining

210
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:46,975
Sure might not be what we're going for right now

211
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,791
So this is a bill that Alex is talking about the gun bill

212
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:54,911
It did not pass as has been the case with literally any proposed gun bill that's come up at Alex

213
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
It is about to pass

214
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,495
And would leave the door to door confiscation

215
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,543
Everything all the way up to a child

216
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
What are the great

217
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:08,479
Consistent trans you notice when you go back and listen to Infowars from the past is that every proposed gun bill is apocalyptic

218
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,295
And all of them are set to be passed any day now

219
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:16,159
It's ridiculous as an act and it's weird that it never gets old for the listener

220
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231
Bush never did any of the stuff Alex

221
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,255
To claim he was going to

222
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,327
He let the Clinton assault weapons ban lapse

223
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,887
He didn't Champion any other gun legislation

224
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,167
But it does

225
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
Kind of makes sense for Alex

226
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,471
To think that he might

227
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
Primarily because

228
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:35,103
You clearly just getting talking points from the NRA's press release

229
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:39,455
And in the interest of total fairness as recently as May 2000

230
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,271
Three that had commented supported

231
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,063
Extending the 1994 gun bill

232
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:49,695
The thing is that in the real world Bush can't just do that on his own it would need to be passed by Congress

233
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:54,559
Howard subscribes to a very narrow strongman theory about the world and us

234
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,399
Because Bush said he's in favor of one thing it must be the case that it's going

235
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
Come to pass

236
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:06,079
After the 2002 midterms there was a 51-49 republican majority in the Senate and a 229

237
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
9 to 200

238
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
For Republican majority in the house

239
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:14,783
It was safe for Bush to Signal support to the idea of gun control in order to sway Independence to the right

240
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,623
Wow being entirely comfortable that no gun Bill had any chance of making

241
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
Get through either House of God

242
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,231
It's the governmental equivalent of having your cake and eating

243
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
YouTube basically is

244
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,791
Where he was going

245
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,583
Absolutely I support this

246
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,935
This thing that I know is impossible to happen I will never do anything

247
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,239
Text that I will sign this thing that is

248
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,055
Essentially impossible

249
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,359
I will sign this unicorns face

250
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:43,455
The moment you put it in front of me I promise you that

251
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:47,807
In the 2000 GOP Primary bushes whole brand was meant to be compassionate

252
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Conservative

253
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,879
I'm part of that is not having

254
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,951
Sing this Hardline Gunn absolutism

255
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,791
An element that strategy was probably informed by the fact that he was running against

256
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
John McCain

257
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,655
Who had a farm or outside or character than Bush and appeal to a

258
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:08,543
Han more voters that were closer to the center military history so you can't fight him on that front

259
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,615
There was no way Bush could win the

260
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
Congest off the supported

261
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:16,223
The Fringe right so he has conservatism as a strategy

262
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:22,623
One might argue that he had some actual inclination toward reforming gun laws but that seems like both

263
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,207
The NRA loudly endorsed Bush in 2000

264
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:30,815
M4 and they actually strategically withheld their endorsement of him in the 2000 election

265
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
Because

266
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
The New York Times quote

267
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:39,263
Polls suggest that the NRA will popular many republican areas is viewed negatively by large numbers of in

268
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,799
Independence Suburban voters

269
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,823
Who mr. bushes

270
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,871
Just trying to court particularly women

271
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,687
Sincere concern in 2000

272
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:51,039
Open for a new candidate but much less so by 2004 when Bush was the incumbent

273
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:57,951
Well we were keeping their love of bush quiet on the surface they also the NRA had a vice president who said that if Bush got

274
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,975
Selected quote

275
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,791
We'll have a president where we work out of their office

276
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
So

277
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,863
This this notion is

278
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
Is a loaded

279
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,471
Alex

280
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
Basically

281
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,543
Political maneuvering that bushes doing

282
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,567
In terms of

283
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
Placing himself in a place where

284
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,919
Independent voters could be drawn towards him

285
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,223
And there's no actual consequence

286
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,295
To the is exactly what

287
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
Bushwood

288
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,599
Like that's the strategy

289
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,183
Make Alex look like the conservative nut bag

290
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,463
Compared to Eureka

291
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
Compassionate conservative

292
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
Not bad

293
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:40,191
Rallying be like really far right in a certain direction you kind of make sure that the status quo

294
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,727
Remains the Same

295
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,775
That gun Bill never makes it to your desk

296
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
Don't ever have to sign and let's be real with

297
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,663
Those right-wing lunatics if they vote they're still going to vote for

298
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:56,063
What are they going to vote for somebody else get the f*** out of here.

299
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
Al Gore

300
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:02,975
You can pencil them in whenever you want Ron Paul wasn't a factor in that Elijah

301
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,815
So there's more more talk of this gun bill

302
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:10,143
It's basically one of his his primary points

303
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,383
I'm going to warn you

304
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,175
About the most

305
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,111
When did Ann Coulter

306
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
Sovereign

307
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
Almost identical

308
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
Record

309
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,151
Thoroughly

310
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
Border

311
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,343
We're in the very very

312
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
More

313
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,847
2013

314
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
Millions morgue

315
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:38,975
So this bill HR 2038 was introduced on May 8th

316
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,559
It's 2003 3 months prior to this episode that were list

317
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
Coming through right now

318
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,095
How's my birthday

319
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:50,495
Hey happy birthday it's literally nothing had been done to move it any closer to passing sensor

320
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:56,895
That's been a lot like my birthday 28th 2004 a motion was filed

321
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,919
Title resolution

322
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:02,015
769 which sought to bring HR 203

323
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,319
To immediate consideration on the house floor

324
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
These sorts of discharge petition

325
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,671
Require 218 signatures to pass

326
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
How many think this one got

327
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
30

328
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,583
72

329
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:21,215
At the point Alex's on are pretending he's covering a news story about a bill that's a real threat to cut ownership

330
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,543
You should have every reason to know that this is a dead Bill already

331
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:30,687
This isn't news or analysis its manufacturing a threat to scare you into thinking someone's on their way to take your gun

332
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,271
Relying entirely on a Guess Who press release from the NRA

333
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,295
Yeah great

334
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
Yes

335
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:41,183
Weird thing about going back into the past so often is remembering that at that

336
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,743
Time. I did not have

337
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,791
The tools necessary to like

338
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,583
Understand House 2

339
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,375
Stupid and transparent all of this

340
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
Really what

341
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
You know

342
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,983
Like I'd ever so many things back in 2003

343
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,055
I think I think I was in such a conservative family

344
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:02,687
After 9/11 I was one of those people whose like yeah 94% of people should support

345
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,223
It's a good thing I was 12

346
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:10,111
But the time sure can't really affect the political process

347
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,159
Yeah Amy I think

348
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
Do I look back in

349
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,767
There was a. I wasn't even in like a really conservative family

350
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,607
Listen to conservative talk radio a lot

351
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
The passive

352
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
Nature of listening to it

353
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:29,567
I thought like Sean Hannity had a legitimate point

354
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,871
Neal Boortz

355
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,807
I would immediately say oh these people are lying to make millions of dollars and it's a baddie

356
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
Yeah yeah

357
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:47,743
It's a different twist.

358
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,607
Big news about Personnel in the White House

359
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,031
By the way

360
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,383
They're going to put another

361
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
Background

362
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,416
And

363
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
Program

364
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
Alright

365
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,032
The hell right

366
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:36,384
Really on his way out he stayed in office until

367
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,200
75 when he resigned possibly at Bush's request

368
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,736
At the start of bushes

369
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
Enterprise

370
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,344
He was replaced by Condoleezza Rice who Alex hasn't mentioned up to this point

371
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,880
I don't know if you think she's a

372
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,648
Trotskyite

373
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,512
Listeners are the kind of people who could be so sensitive

374
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,792
Covert racism

375
00:21:54,048 --> 00:22:00,192
Have simultaneously unaware of what Black Ops are to the point where he could sincerely think anyone would sentiment

376
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,472
Email about that

377
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:05,568
Someone possibly should send him an email about his obsession with the mysterious secret truck

378
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
DIYs

379
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,664
And how that sounds suspiciously antisymmetric though I think maybe

380
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,992
Maybe that deserves an email it would have been

381
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,528
Three interesting if colon polyp was

382
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
Is a trotskyite

383
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
That would have that would have changed

384
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:20,160
Things a great deal as opposed to being a lying war criminal

385
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
That does change

386
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,792
Yeah police

387
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,608
Alex

388
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:35,008
But was it all in Alex's head

389
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,440
Like I was last week when

390
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
Be careful

391
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
Involving

392
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,896
Because there's no pun intended

393
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,296
This is all in Alex's head

394
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:25,696
He's getting mad about imaginary people having a completely absurd response to something he's

395
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,768
Self as the victim of these imaginary people

396
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
And here's the reason he's doing

397
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:36,960
Alex wants to inoculate his audience to the possibility of them hearing people accuse him of being a race

398
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:41,568
A lot of this content is flagrantly racist and he understands that on some level

399
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,152
So he knows that it's inevitable that people who listen to his show will end up

400
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
Hearing

401
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,992
From other people

402
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,552
That is racist a s*** I agree with you

403
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,368
The goal here is for Alex to take a

404
00:23:54,624 --> 00:24:00,768
Completely obvious example of something that isn't racist but includes a trigger word that he can protect someone

405
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,048
Call him braces for sale

406
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,584
In this case black

407
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:10,240
He pretends the people will say he's racist for saying things like Black Ops with a listener hear someone accuse Alex of saying something Gracie

408
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,056
Their immediate response will be like oh sure

409
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:19,456
Like how he said that he was a racist good to use the word blacktop shaft it gives them that kind of

410
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
Defensive posture

411
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,296
Read it really is

412
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,832
Exactly like how they think

413
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,600
Vaccination

414
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:29,696
It's like okay I'll take a little bit of dirt

415
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,488
False racism

416
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,096
And kind of make you immune to that so then whenever the real racer

417
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,656
I'm already prepared

418
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,424
Yeah

419
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,800
I think I think it's more for them to be able to

420
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,104
To withstand criticism from their friends

421
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
And family

422
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,664
Who might be like hey

423
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,968
That stuff you're listening to is pretty f*****

424
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:56,320
Remember all the things that he didn't say about Jews cuz he uses the word globalist

425
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,648
Imagine Dragons

426
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
Yeah, buddy

427
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,464
Put two and two together

428
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,560
So Alex is a big news source mrs. this is the other thing that takes up

429
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,096
I would say a large

430
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,120
Part of his

431
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,144
Content

432
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,520
Within the show you have the gun bill that is not to be but is the biggest threat in the world

433
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,824
Illusion they're bunch of phone calls

434
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,104
That many have this store

435
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
Washington

436
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,112
Pulling in now

437
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,416
Courtney

438
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,048
From European

439
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:43,168
This is not a lengthy article it'll be less than a page of text

440
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:48,800
But it might appear longer cuz Alex just print out websites and the 4matic there could make it look larger

441
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
My God

442
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,896
He hasn't read it so he has no idea how long it is or what it says

443
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
Steven about

444
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:58,528
This is an op-ed about how Supreme Court justices have appealed to Legal ideas from

445
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,088
From other countries are legal bodies in their decision

446
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:07,488
Notably about one of the things they bring up is the recent case Lawrence versus Texas which invalidated so

447
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
Sodomy laws

448
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:11,072
Country inmate same-sex relationships illegal

449
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,096
Across-the-board

450
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,936
2003's have their way

451
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,960
It will be overturned

452
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,032
On the Texas GOP

453
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,568
Statement of intent

454
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,872
Like we're going to criminalize

455
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,408
Homosexuality

456
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:31,808
Lawrence versus Texas going to take that back to court

457
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,856
Oh man that's crazy

458
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,160
Yeah it is wild

459
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
Go to Just

460
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:42,048
Jenna really wrestle with the reality that that decision was in 2000

461
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:48,448
That's very recent begins with a

462
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:52,032
They could break into your home if you were gay

463
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
And then arrest

464
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
For just

465
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,616
Being there

466
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,152
Would not be

467
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
Impossible to make

468
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,040
While

469
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:06,368
Anyway Justice Kennedy's opinion included a point they quote

470
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,488
The courts past approval of sodomy bands was out of step with the law and other West

471
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
Democracy

472
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,584
And made mention of the European Court of Human Rights

473
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,912
This is not the same as the Supreme Court being told what

474
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,960
To Dubai other International bodies but

475
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,264
It's a fascinating and really depressing thing to think

476
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
About

477
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,312
This makes

478
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:29,920
The point that traditionally the United States has seen itself as the innovator in the world in terms

479
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,456
The freedom and human rights

480
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,992
But the country quote

481
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,064
Now has much to learn from the rapidly developing

482
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,088
Digital tradition

483
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
Of other democracy

484
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:42,976
Abdicated our place know if Alex thinks that's

485
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,000
The same thing

486
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,048
As getting your marching orders

487
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:51,424
I have these examples that they use in this article are not like hey

488
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,264
The Bedrock of my argument relies on

489
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,592
A precedent

490
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,872
Pointing that out in the

491
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,664
The opinions of like a also

492
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
Everybody else

493
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
Doesn't do this

494
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:10,112
Crazy nonsense

495
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,392
This is fun

496
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:18,048
Conservative legal Scholars are largely opposed to even citing International opinion in terms of the Supreme Court but it's

497
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:22,656
Important to recognize that this isn't the first time it's happened nor is it really that groundbreaking

498
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,704
Conservatives like Alex hate

499
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:29,568
Legal experts in this article aren't thrilled with the thing quote

500
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,592
When the courts

501
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:36,992
Starts taking things like that into account it revealed itself as more interested in making policy that in

502
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,272
The fix text

503
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,320
The Constitution or statute

504
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,136
That was a quote from you

505
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:49,536
The guy who worked in Bush's Attorney General's office is most remembered for his memos that the hero justifying torture

506
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,776
Because they would have tried to make policy again terrible

507
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:04,896
Big Picture This is an editorial that someone wrote about an interesting thing to think about as it relates

508
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
For the Supreme Court

509
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:12,576
It's not hard news and it doesn't say anything or prove anything about the court being under the control of some foreign body

510
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:17,440
Alex doesn't read any of the stuff he covers though so he's just reading the headline in

511
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,768
Skimming the first two sentences of making up the restituted purposes

512
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,792
As always

513
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,328
Goes wrong

514
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,888
Because he tries to read the article on hair

515
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,960
And unfortunately it doesn't really go his way

516
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,984
So here he is

517
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,520
Beginning to read that article

518
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,224
But not jump

519
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,184
It's cutely written cuz it's an op-ed

520
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:54,048
It's written by someone who's trying to engage the reader in something less formal than news copy

521
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:59,424
I sincerely don't think Alex knows the difference between opinion and fact-based Report

522
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,752
A 2003 or even of the present-day I think he's still doesn't know

523
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:06,080
You legitimately trying to pretend that this op-ed in the washing

524
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,408
Camden Post is announcing that the Supreme Court is under the can

525
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,944
Control of international bodies

526
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,968
That's one of his

527
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,248
Top stories

528
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,296
This is his only source

529
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,832
That wild

530
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,368
Well what they're doing

531
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:21,184
Is there soft launching it threw up

532
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,280
Tell me if you made that argument I would say

533
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,816
That's stupid

534
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,608
At least

535
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,448
This sort of honest about the point he was trying to make

536
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,240
Brightwood just come off as like

537
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,312
Are you f****** serious

538
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,848
Virtually keeps read

539
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,200
Ono and the presentation that he's trying to make is that this is announcing

540
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,504
Write our courts are under the control of like the

541
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,576
European core sure Cuban rice short what have you

542
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
But

543
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,648
Because he keeps reading

544
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,488
He gets to the point where they talk about how Bunch people aren't into this

545
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
Right

546
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,048
And that that doesn't go well

547
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,584
Here's the thing

548
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,120
He just ignores it

549
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:06,240
He just pretends that he's not reading stuff that's critical of the Supreme Court

550
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,032
Considering European thought that is

551
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,312
Powerful stuff

552
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
Court

553
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,392
Is dropped

554
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
European

555
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,512
Colcord

556
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,896
Group meeting

557
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,808
Computer screen

558
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:53,856
Turn on printer

559
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
Margarita

560
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,952
But it is

561
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:05,120
Use of international

562
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
Amorphous

563
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
Illegal

564
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,640
It reveals itself as more

565
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:19,968
Interpreting

566
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,504
The Constitution

567
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,096
Previous

568
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,520
But we are

569
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,824
Weather is not

570
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,528
They

571
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,112
Crew

572
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
The Constitution

573
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,952
Xbox

574
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
Hyperbole

575
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,352
That's not the right one

576
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,448
When did what

577
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
When did

578
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
Emma Watson

579
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,408
Legal

580
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,088
We're going to follow the European model

581
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:32,928
Wild bear sweetly ignores

582
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:38,560
Song minutes of him reading this article that's critical

583
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:44,960
Snot stuff that's a bunch of Hyperbole and they say it's about globalism

584
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:50,336
Taking our sovereignty

585
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,128
It's

586
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,504
Legitimately Unthinkable to me that someone could get away with

587
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,344
Being this transparently bad doing what they're

588
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,392
Pretending to do and people just there like

589
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,416
Yeah

590
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,464
Are you guys making sense

591
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,768
If you listen to the words

592
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
What's he saying

593
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,072
This is convoluted

594
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,608
Please textbook abuse

595
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,656
That is a literal person

596
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,472
Telling you something that just happened

597
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,008
Is not what you saw

598
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,872
Definition of gaslighting

599
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,176
This article is announcing that the

600
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,480
The cord is under the control of the European

601
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,040
But also I just read 2 minutes

602
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,368
Conversation about Scholars

603
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,672
The people who are making

604
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:41,536
The argument that I was literally making about this article are making it in the article

605
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:47,936
And there's like a whole bunch of that article to but like house scalia's really against this like people Eva

606
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,776
Even citing European fans as a as a reference

607
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,800
I like yeah

608
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:56,896
That this is stupid absurd to live in a world with the internet and then

609
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,944
I think that the Supreme Court

610
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,064
Is yours going to never look out it it's other legal Scholars anywhere else

611
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,856
So we are

612
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:09,440
Get to Alex talkin about death pen

613
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
Stuff

614
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,792
This is one of the questions I've always had

615
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,840
You're with Alex that I think is like

616
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
It's weird

617
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,472
Make its position on the death penalty is always been strange to me

618
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,288
Because at times he seemed to be against it

619
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,056
Which makes up

620
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,336
That's based on his

621
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,640
So the political and philosophical beliefs

622
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,456
All the times you spin in favor of it

623
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,760
It's been confusing to me

624
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,320
And in this could be kind of spells out

625
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,112
What is hot sauce

626
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,136
Another disappointing

627
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:45,280
3 years ago

628
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,176
The boys crown

629
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,952
Somebody

630
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:48,000
That's a really Illuminating clit because it shows clearly how Alex's position on the death penalty

631
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:53,888
It's only really that the objection that he has is that he doesn't trust the government with producing evidence

632
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,544
It's not a moral objection it's strictly logistical which doesn't make a whole lot of sense and it makes me think that Alex hasn't

633
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,080
Walk through this position very much

634
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:07,712
Should be a primary concern whether or not the state has the ability to take up

635
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,504
Life for committing a crime

636
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,320
Why would you want to vest that kind of

637
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,392
Power in the hands of the very thing you would consider yours

638
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,464
Sworn enemy how do you think it's been taken over by globalist

639
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:25,376
I could see Alec being in favor of the sheriff getting a posse together and taking out two suspected murderer before they're even

640
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,144
Arrested

641
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,984
Position at odds with how he presents himself

642
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,264
And his school of thought

643
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:36,896
The things that he says would meet his high standard of proof which would justify the death penalty

644
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
Concrete pieces of evidence

645
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,576
Eyewitness accounts are notoriously inaccurate so basic an execution on that seems pretty unwise absurd

646
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,648
Alex you think that confessions are often suspect

647
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:50,720
Because they could be cool worst out of people by overzealous police

648
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,256
Yelp so you wouldn't want to

649
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,536
You're not necessarily

650
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,072
Use that solely as

651
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,888
The basis for an execution concrete information

652
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:03,264
Videotape is all good and well but often inconclusive in terms of being able to identify people

653
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:08,384
Yeah it's probably fairly rare that that's going to be solely what you're able to convey

654
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,152
Somebody

655
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,432
Alex

656
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:14,016
What's the death penalty in principle Because he believes in violent retribution

657
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,320
What is laying down here is just a list

658
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,112
Types of evidence he looks for to make

659
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,160
Peace with it inside his head

660
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:23,232
Ridiculous he thinks the people who do things should have

661
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:27,328
Violent consequences

662
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,608
Like I don't

663
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,144
The government to do this

664
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,472
However I do think that a judge and a courtroom should the

665
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,264
What what are you f******

666
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
Talking about

667
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
It's this

668
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:41,408
Dumb idea that I think a lot of people in Alex's middle you'll have

669
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:45,504
Maybe there's even a little bit of his mentality on the left

670
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,784
Piano baby isn't

671
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,808
Helpful

672
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,880
It's not like the government is somehow a thing

673
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,416
Like the football

674
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,208
Yeah it's people who work

675
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,816
It's not like a witness who is

676
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,840
I don't know

677
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:03,168
Works for the IRS or something there's still a person

678
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,704
Right now there's a governor

679
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,520
There there is a cop see what happens is

680
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,568
They don't capitalize their names

681
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,896
Okay so then they're both Holden to the government because

682
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:16,736
The $600,000 in liens placed upon their name

683
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,296
At Birth I buy a maritime law

684
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,832
Is Almighty

685
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:27,232
The story of the German bank robbers is being a little bit misreported by Alec

686
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:31,072
This is about brothers Walter and Carla G

687
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:37,472
Who were executed by the state of Arizona in 1999 for a bank robbery that went wrong back in 1980

688
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,240
82

689
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:42,080
They weren't illegal immigrants the way Alex is trying to prevent the situation

690
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,640
They were born in Germany but their mother is

691
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:48,224
Flight to the United States when one brother was four and the other was 5

692
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,528
They've essentially lived here their whole lives

693
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,064
But they never become US citizen

694
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:56,928
The brothers were robbers by trade and the bank robbery had

695
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:59,232
Just after they've been released from prison

696
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:02,560
For robbing a string of supermarkets in Tucson the year before

697
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,888
They were trying to rob the Valley National Bank

698
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:08,960
Bank in Marana Arizona

699
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,008
All of the details of this crime Raw

700
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,568
They showed up before the bank open

701
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,104
And there were no customers.

702
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,896
They didn't shoot anyone

703
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,456
Because the the gun they had was a toy gun

704
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:26,368
They did murder the bank manager when he couldn't open the safe because he only had half of a combination but they didn't

705
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,696
24 * with a letter opener

706
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,000
They attempted to kill the other person who was in the bank

707
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,560
Get the time to cousin employee they've Dawn Lopez

708
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:38,400
But they only managed to stab her a few times which proved to be

709
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,448
Not lethal but bad

710
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:44,288
The police didn't around the bank and then the brothers gave up

711
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,944
Another employee showed up and thought that they saw something suspicious going on inside so this other employees

712
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,528
She wrote down the license plate numbers of cars outside

713
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,320
1 mg last

714
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,600
And the police showed up

715
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:00,928
She gave him the plate numbers and the cops track the brothers down that way

716
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:05,536
I was just basically taking a real-life case and transpose all of the elements

717
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:10,400
The bank robbery movies onto it of what happened

718
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:17,056
No he believes every bank robbery is they opening 5 minutes of The Dark Knight

719
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:23,456
The Joker showing up everybody in the other address

720
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:27,040
100% they drove it out and even though there is dust on it

721
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:27,808
School buses

722
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:30,368
Nobody was the wiser I would rather if Alex

723
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,392
Just relay the

724
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:35,232
The plot of Inside Man

725
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,560
I'd love to see him try to explain that plot

726
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,584
Got to Be Wild

727
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:43,168
Anyway this case is actually really really

728
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:47,008
And the way it played out in the courts is something that's worth talking about

729
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:51,360
And it intersects with Alex's ideology but before we talk more about that

730
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:54,175
Let's see if he understands what happened

731
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
Okay cuz he

732
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,247
He definitely doesn't understand the cry

733
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,295
But then what ended up happening

734
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,087
In relationship to their death pain

735
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:01,855
Penalty

736
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,903
Let's see here is how I'll explain

737
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,639
We will follow

738
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:29,759
In the world

739
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,807
Court of Human Rights

740
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:36,671
So that's what Alex so

741
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,487
Ginsberg after this case was howling

742
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:46,399
The people naturally I saw the best minds of my German generation executed

743
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,679
So-so

744
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,703
Then

745
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,751
Justice Ginsburg Ginsburg

746
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,519
Well

747
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:57,919
Constitution. The window we got to follow the EU we waste on the go-ahead

748
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:07,647
On the day that Walter Legrand was set to be executed Germany filed with the international court of justice seeking a provisional

749
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:10,207
Court order so the US would pause the execution

750
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,535
The icj did give this provisional order

751
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:17,631
From there the Supreme Court decided that they didn't have any jurisdiction

752
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:22,495
Hear this provisional order since it was the state of Arizona that was carrying out the execution

753
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,519
And the federal courts

754
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,335
A lawsuit brought by another country against

755
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,359
What's the state right

756
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,383
A bunch of argue

757
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,455
Even flew around about whether or not executing the men would violate

758
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,015
Vienna convention

759
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:38,367
The u.s. party seem to take the position that international law wasn't legally binding

760
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,135
Heather the actor

761
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,671
Being

762
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,231
Word actually violations of this convention

763
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:49,631
Yeah then in 2001 the icj ruled that the US had violated rules about Consular relations

764
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:53,983
Because the Legrand brothers were never told by Arizona law enforcement that adds

765
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,263
German National

766
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,287
They have the right to

767
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,335
Contact the German consulate for help

768
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,359
Yeah I did

769
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,175
Informed of that ability to

770
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:08,575
Bummer eventually contact the consulate the delay was argue to have hindered Germany's ability to

771
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,879
Protect its Nationals interest

772
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:15,487
It wasn't the case of Ginsberg just saying that we need to bow down to International Court

773
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:21,887
Ebix it was a situation where the icj determined that the US had violated an agreement that we entered into willingly

774
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,935
With other government signed it

775
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,959
Yeah

776
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,727
And if it's

777
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:29,311
It's a bit more complicated than the presentation that Alex

778
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,079
Does making

779
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
Obviously

780
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,407
Because he doesn't know what happened

781
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,687
That is that is

782
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:37,247
Just kicking and screaming about the idea that

783
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,551
People respect the opinions of other

784
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,855
Yeah yeah especially when it's there

785
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,623
Nationalism

786
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,159
Yeah

787
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,207
Yeah and Germany was probably like

788
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,743
Don't

789
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,767
Kill people

790
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:54,399
That's I mean we don't do it I think there is an interesting

791
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,423
Sort of

792
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:59,263
Discussion to be had about the German Nationals

793
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,823
Aspect of it cuz I lived in the United States

794
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,871
Essentially their whole life

795
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:06,175
Technicality

796
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,015
But I don't know how meaningful it is in terms of like

797
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,295
The

798
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,343
Like refuting the circumstances

799
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:16,671
Well in terms of

800
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,695
Change

801
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:20,255
And eventually how much people

802
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,791
AppleCare

803
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,559
Is very little I

804
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:26,655
12 years later and Alex's essentially forgot all the

805
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,983
Details about crime all the details of the Court thing that happened

806
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,263
It's just

807
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:35,871
Yeah Beldum

808
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,943
Weird situation to have to have like six

809
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,711
Courts

810
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,991
Just argue

811
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:44,063
Made-up nonsense back and forth at each other

812
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,623
Like. We can't do this because of

813
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,159
Some dude

814
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:53,279
Arizona Phoenix Arizona going to kill this guy anyway

815
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,327
Call Beth

816
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,631
C 150 years ago

817
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,679
Sorry

818
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:04,543
So Alex believe that all these European courts and all this stuff it's all

819
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,567
Kangaroo court

820
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,359
You know that term comes from

821
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
Australia

822
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,663
Alex knows

823
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,711
Oh yeah

824
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:21,183
Call boy

825
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,847
The police

826
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,967
The people of the island

827
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,759
Nation

828
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,391
A kangaroo court

829
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,695
Side issue

830
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,071
Why do we say

831
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,863
He loves that but

832
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:06,495
Yes I've read all of Carroll Quigley

833
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:13,151
Really get excited for toilet reading

834
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,991
Bugatti characterize this book reader

835
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:20,319
This is not where Kangaroo Court comes from

836
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,743
It's an expression with a definite American origin although the kangaroo itself is deeply associated

837
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:31,839
I'm sure when you were just randomly guessing a classroom

838
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:37,727
So there's a number of theories about how this term came to popularity but none of them are close to it Alex has a

839
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:42,079
One is that in the early 1800s

840
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:45,919
In an area of Vicksburg Mississippi called the kangaroo District

841
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:50,527
Answer the name stock from that you wanted. People believe

842
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:54,367
Another theory is that the term comes from the characterization of these courts

843
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:57,695
Jumping to conclusions much like a kangaroo Woodshire

844
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:03,071
The third idea has to do with these amateur trials over being held

845
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,143
And the California Gold Rush

846
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:12,799
These were primarily for prosecuting Claim Jumpers

847
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,871
Okay so there was okay

848
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:21,247
Kangaroos again

849
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,527
So none of these

850
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,807
Involved

851
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:24,831
Mike McCarthy

852
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:31,231
That's what we're saying about the Magna Carta appealing to a non-american

853
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,511
Tatoosh indocumentado

854
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:38,911
You might as well be on Arrow painting about how 13 states make it illegal to ride a horse on Tuesday or whatever done

855
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:46,847
He's a f****** child

856
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,175
Who fuc

857
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,223
Exact

858
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:57,855
That's the level of like Source he's relying on for history lesson

859
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,391
Silas take some calls

860
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,951
And one of them

861
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,487
This guy

862
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,511
He he

863
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,791
He's just

864
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,327
It's normal to

865
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,351
Feel helpless

866
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,143
In the circumstances in the world

867
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,495
Promoting out

868
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,263
There we go

869
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,823
And then we get a little bit of a cameo

870
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,871
Very special animal

871
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:28,063
Infowars

872
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,087
Prison Planet

873
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,647
And handing out to your website

874
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,231
And elsewhere but get off

875
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,511
I guess that's really all we can do

876
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,911
That's my parrot actually I guess it is a neocon yeah

877
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,495
Haha neocon parrot that's funny

878
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:52,895
I appreciate that very funny lower-tier SNL sketch

879
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:53,919
For sure

880
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,223
I guess the joke is the Neil concert

881
00:49:56,479 --> 00:50:00,063
Just for pizza and I would assume so I guess that's probably what they're going somewhere

882
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,879
It's not the first time the parrot interrupted

883
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,903
The call by the way

884
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,999
Weird

885
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,095
Disorder consistent thing where

886
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,655
The solution is always promote Alex

887
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:20,799
Right really stick it to the globalists are do things that

888
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:24,127
Bring more people into my Revenue stream

889
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,943
Does that make them feel like they're doing

890
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,039
What they must give them that feeling of

891
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:35,135
I am doing something to fight the global and it's not just like me

892
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,695
Being part of a multi-level marketing

893
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,511
It's not me propping up a propaganda

894
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:44,607
And I think the reason is because Alex does all that stuff about how like

895
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:50,495
Hey my movies at a 90% rate in waking people up you must think like

896
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,823
Well then why do we get this message the more people will wake up

897
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,591
Sure has opposed

898
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,383
To the more people will

899
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,199
Give Alex rating

900
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,735
I'm so Alex

901
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,807
Another call from a guy who is anti-nra now

902
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,343
Nice to know that

903
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,951
Hang out to dry

904
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:10,975
Dirty laundry

905
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,279
Play I love America now

906
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,631
For our gun rights

907
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,191
And you're one of those

908
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,519
Greater than all of this

909
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,079
That's what's going on

910
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,359
And all people really

911
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,383
Blind

912
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,151
What's going on to

913
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,599
Articulate

914
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:48,351
Illustrates how helpless Alex has made his listeners

915
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:52,703
Everything I was just covered so far on this episode is completely fake and based on nothing

916
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:59,359
Is all about the Court's being told what to do by Foreign International legal bodies as a load of s*** based on him making

917
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,407
Things up about an op-ed that he didn't read

918
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:05,247
The entire fear about gun confiscation is based on a bill that's me

919
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,039
It's languishing in committee

920
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,831
For the last 3 months with no ax

921
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,599
Actions taken

922
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:15,487
He's done nothing but misinform and yet this call her experiences what Alex is doing is informing him

923
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,047
Really a testament to the power of branding

924
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:20,607
What's really remarkable

925
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:24,703
Just color is saying that Alex is a hero in informing the people about threats to their gun rights

926
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:27,519
And the NRA is not a good organization

927
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:33,407
But if you've been paying attention to Source Alex is basing his entire coverage of bush

928
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,943
Intending to re-up the assault weapon

929
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,711
Openspan

930
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:40,575
Eat these basing it on the legislative action press release put out by the NRA

931
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,623
He's relying on them for talkin

932
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:45,695
Points and yet he and installers are pretending like they're not doing

933
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,463
Anyting

934
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,255
The support gun rights

935
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,607
Yeah it is it is interesting to me

936
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:55,935
And also intensely disappointing end

937
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:56,959
And horrific but

938
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,007
It does feel like all of the butt

939
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,567
Is that they've been pushing for like

940
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,847
The past 50

941
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,895
All of those conservative button

942
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,919
Get people to

943
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,943
To do things that

944
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:13,343
Like okay so not only do we just want people to support us we want certain people that do support us

945
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,415
Vocally say that they don't support its end-to-end

946
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:18,975
All of these buttons can be pressed in the only thing that

947
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:21,535
Difference is just a principal lot harder now

948
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
You know

949
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,863
Like they haven't developed new techniques

950
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,983
They're mad at a videogame level

951
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,007
Smashing these button

952
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,543
Yeah yeah

953
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,591
And I think it's it's interesting to be able

954
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,359
To go back in

955
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,895
Ncv sort of

956
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:40,479
The more finesse

957
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,503
So Alex

958
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,527
Skip another call

959
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,063
And this this called

960
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,343
Is the press the s*** out of me

961
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,183
What's this

962
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,535
Google business

963
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,607
People there about what

964
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,375
What was going on

965
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,143
Happening

966
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,215
Look up your website

967
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:01,983
Find out later

968
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,519
And no man that

969
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,287
Derek

970
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,055
Perlier

971
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,103
Tell your later

972
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,943
I remember you you tell me about

973
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,223
What was going on

974
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,015
I had to go see a shrink

975
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,623
I told you what was going on

976
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,951
It got took your brain took it out

977
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:28,351
Problem

978
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,167
Call Gary Wright

979
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,471
Such a bummer

980
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,007
If you believe this caller

981
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:39,871
He ran into somebody who our year prior he had gotten into like Infowars type

982
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:40,639
Material

983
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,175
And the guy was like I had to go

984
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:42,943
The therapy

985
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:50,111
And then this is like oh no it's a sign of weakness

986
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,903
Taking care of his mental health

987
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,439
Could probably you know

988
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:57,791
This is indicative of somebody who got into this and it just went down

989
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:58,815
Terrible

990
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:02,143
Rabbit hole

991
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:06,751
Well I mean it's actually a very encouraging story really the interpretation

992
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,799
It's being given depressing

993
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:14,687
That is the people who left the Colts and they're like I can't believe those apostates

994
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:18,271
How could they do that how could they go get therapy and live

995
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,063
Well develop life

996
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,343
Yeah

997
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,879
Terror

998
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,671
Bummer

999
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:30,815
Like I don't know Auto real level that the damage that this is also doing is encouraging people who are listening

1000
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,839
To experience

1001
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,375
Any instinct

1002
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,167
To Veer away from

1003
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,959
Infowars as that

1004
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,263
And not just that

1005
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,031
Any

1006
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,079
Doesn't necessarily mean

1007
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,895
Infowars help it could just be like

1008
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:49,759
Hey man I have been really depressed for the past soon they'll they're like no.

1009
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:56,159
Still dig out your brain yeah they might try and get you off of the Infowars you know why you're depressed

1010
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,695
A warring enough

1011
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:03,071
Promote promote Alex more Jesus but it's

1012
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,351
It's for Alex and he gets

1013
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:09,727
So Alex that has a weird analogy that he makes

1014
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:12,799
That he thinks he can use to deprogram left

1015
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,591
Who are against

1016
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,895
God help man I'm scared what if he gets me

1017
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:22,527
He's not he's not going to and then he has one of the saddest weirdest

1018
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,807
I've heard in a long time

1019
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:26,879
Anna Gunn

1020
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,191
Monopoly

1021
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:21,919
I want

1022
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,247
Job

1023
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,927
Herbal healer Academy

1024
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,023
I don't know how many

1025
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,631
Thing we never

1026
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,495
21

1027
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,199
On real

1028
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,135
Dealer.com

1029
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,671
Ford.com

1030
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:10,559
He looks like a

1031
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:13,119
Like what he was trying to do was get out of

1032
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:18,239
Describing any of the things she had no idea he was reading this is too long

1033
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:22,847
He had no idea what he was supposed to be selling so you start

1034
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:29,247
How great the pamphlet was all look at the color

1035
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,551
It's almost it's almost an anti ad

1036
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,319
Where is like

1037
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:37,183
He wanted to say like this is too many pages to sell a good product I'm going to be honest with you

1038
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:39,743
Actually such a bad commercial.

1039
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,279
He comes back from break

1040
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:43,839
Doing another's results

1041
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,607
Call them

1042
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:48,447
Oh you can get classes

1043
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:50,495
Actual specific

1044
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,519
So did he get you

1045
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,055
Well

1046
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:53,823
I mean

1047
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,359
Here's the problem with that are

1048
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:57,919
It's not

1049
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,687
That

1050
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,735
Malaga

1051
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:01,503
Metal

1052
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:05,087
What do you mean

1053
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,623
Well here's what I was

1054
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:11,231
I was just thinking that Roman centurions did not have guns to begin

1055
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:14,559
True so that was a big problem Alright and then

1056
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,583
Yes

1057
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,375
A lot of people were f******

1058
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,143
King Arms

1059
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,679
Monroe

1060
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,727
It's just a lot harder

1061
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:25,055
American example

1062
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,591
What about the Native American

1063
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,359
Example

1064
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,895
I'm going to throw this out at you

1065
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,943
Maybe the problem

1066
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,223
He's not

1067
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,247
Fundamentally

1068
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,783
But they don't have guns

1069
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,575
True there's a deeper

1070
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:39,391
Problem or systemic problem

1071
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,671
Right

1072
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:44,255
This is where I kind of come to my point about it not being an

1073
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,279
Cuz there was a

1074
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,047
Active

1075
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,839
Genocide

1076
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:48,863
Whose campaign

1077
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,143
Of that against

1078
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:54,239
The people who hit existed and lived here prior to the the calling

1079
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:00,127
That's not happening to Alex and his dumb militia 40

1080
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:02,431
Bounties out on all white p

1081
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:09,599
If that were the case I think things will be a little bit different and also if there were just like

1082
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:14,463
Common Sense type gun reforms and we're going around in foot

1083
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,231
Time

1084
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,559
The colonists

1085
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,351
Then I don't think it would have been

1086
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,399
A problem

1087
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,423
I will say that

1088
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,983
If there are bounties out on left

1089
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,007
Just sitting for years

1090
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,543
I might buy a

1091
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:35,199
Until there are literal bounties out on anyone who believed similar things to be

1092
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:35,967
I don't think

1093
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:43,135
And also let's not forget that the Trail of Tears and Indian Removal Act

1094
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:46,463
The only good presidents in US history

1095
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,767
Really care too much about whatever

1096
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:51,327
Sort of bizarre Garnet argument

1097
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,095
Yeah

1098
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:52,863
You know

1099
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,399
You think

1100
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:58,751
That you wouldn't harm an American Indian but my favorite President killed most of them

1101
01:00:59,263 --> 01:00:59,775

So

1105
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:07,711
I have a surprise guest to Pops in

1106
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:10,015
This is this was weird this caught me off-guard

1107
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:14,879
Diaz

1108
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,183
Agave

1109
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:20,255
New homeowner

1110
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,095
Interrupt

1111
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,143
Programming have a good program

1112
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,639
DNA for me fingerprints

1113
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,455
Erector spinae

1114
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,015
Driver's license

1115
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,951
UPS science news

1116
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:00,703
Preparation of

1117
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:09,151
It's also we're going to be on my website Maybe

1118
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,935
Find a public providing School

1119
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:43,455
This came out of nowhere

1120
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,807
Want something came up earlier on the show at all

1121
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,599
That's a real strange things

1122
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:51,903
For somebody to call in and be like Alex

1123
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:58,303
Did you know that a horde of Pegasus are flying over the country to start murdering all of us

1124
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,863
Do posted on the website already

1125
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:05,215
Remember like his wife was

1126
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:06,495
Basically

1127
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,799
Running a whole lot of Infowars

1128
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,079
Back at this point

1129
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:16,223
Yep radio show called call to decision radio

1130
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:18,783
He's not really a figure in Alex's world anymore

1131
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:24,927
That's really strange since he's pushing all the same s*** like covid vaccine conspiracy than anti-abortion

1132
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,695
Extremism

1133
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:28,511
You think they'd still be like really tight

1134
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,047
I don't know okay

1135
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:34,143
One of his guests is

1136
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:39,007
Coach Dave daubenmire complete lunatic who we've covered a couple times

1137
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,543
More bizarrely though

1138
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:46,175
In the last week he had Larry Pratt on his guess the guy from gunownersofamerica

1139
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:50,271
That's only weird because I haven't seen Larry Pratt on Alex's show in a bit

1140
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,039
It feels like

1141
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:54,623
He's not on my Alex's gunship talking Rolodex

1142
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:55,647
And I suspect

1143
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,695
Because Ted Nugent's there for that

1144
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:02,047
And Alex is nothing if not a strfkr over the

1145
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,351
Alex

1146
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,655
He wants to take more calls

1147
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,191
Buddy cat

1148
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,215
Because there's no

1149
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:11,775
Call

1150
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,079
Be covered

1151
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,479
Do that

1152
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:23,551
Cuz I want to play

1153
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:30,207
Wait what

1154
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,487
What is vertigo

1155
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:36,863
What are some plugs

1156
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:46,079
That was a rollercoaster ride of what the what the agenda is going to be I have no idea what's going to happen

1157
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:51,711
I'm sorry I can't take calls I'm going to do some plugs I'm going to talk to Carol from Indiana

1158
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:56,831
But he does get to them headlines on some news

1159
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,599
The news

1160
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:01,695
Much and it's because the show grinds to a f****** halt when he's reading headlines

1161
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:05,535
It's just horrible the energy is sucked out of the show entirely

1162
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:08,351
When he's talking to callers or riffing around and making

1163
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:12,703
Some stuff up and yelling it's kind of fun but they're not that old reading headlines of being like

1164
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:19,103
Are we even doing the reading things that actively disagree with his

1165
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,639
Point as

1166
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,407
Yeah

1167
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:24,991
Normally he does so much more preparation via does regular

1168
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,831
Stories

1169
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,623
Don't worry

1170
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,183
Do you believe

1171
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,287
What are the major Russian

1172
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,567
Iranian

1173
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,175
Okay

1174
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:54,943
Well

1175
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:55,711
That's ones

1176
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,759
I mean that's a low bar

1177
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:04,671
Sure you did not clear that

1178
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:07,999
Not still thinks it's saddam's kids death was faked

1179
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:08,767
Yeah we're fake

1180
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,303
And that Saddam

1181
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,583
Is living in Belarus

1182
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,607
So

1183
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,143
Good good

1184
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:17,215
This was something he consistently

1185
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:17,983
Has been

1186
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,543
Reporting and saying he believes

1187
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,591
It's nice to know that he's always

1188
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:23,871
Trusted Russian

1189
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:30,271
Intellivision because they would have him

1190
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,855
Oh yeah well yeah he was Gaston like a roni and

1191
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,903
TV shows

1192
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:42,303
I think the amputee on RT inch it so like

1193
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,327
Trust those

1194
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,887
Media spheres cuz they accept

1195
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:51,519
So are you telling me that it's entirely possible if not probable that it one point in time

1196
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:54,335
There were several Iranian Infowars

1197
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,615
Yes

1198
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,383
Death Valley

1199
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:58,687
Yeah so you're smoking news

1200
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,479
What a weird thing to be

1201
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,527
This one

1202
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:03,551
Not good

1203
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,343
Continuing

1204
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,367
Before

1205
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,647
Movie on Delta

1206
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,327
Because

1207
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:19,935
The corrupt

1208
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:25,055
And

1209
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:32,735
So this wasn't the criticism the Jewish groups had the criticism wasn't just coming from Jewish groups

1210
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,015
There were

1211
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:37,599
Whole Lotta anti-semitic tropes that at least

1212
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:43,999
In that movie and there's just a foundational problem of trying to make one story out of the four gospels that

1213
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,279
People have suggested

1214
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,327
Mel Gibson should just not have tried

1215
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,095
To do that

1216
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:50,655
Didn't they win best adapted screenplay

1217
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:57,311
Gibson's a Holocaust denier in his claim that the second Vatican Council

1218
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,079
The one where I was

1219
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:01,151
Decreed that the Jews were not responsible for Jesus's death

1220
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,431
What's a secret plot

1221
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:04,479
Orchestrated by the Masons and the Jews

1222
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,551
W Whittier

1223
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:13,183
This is absolutely ridiculous and the Holocaust it's all maybe not all fiction but most

1224
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:14,975
He was asked

1225
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:16,255
Quote why do the

1226
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:18,559
Jews construct Holocaust museums

1227
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:21,375
There are too many survivors

1228
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:23,423
It's just a gimmick to collect the money

1229
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,215
They have to go where there is money

1230
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:28,799
And here's another quote of his

1231
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:31,103
Quotes they cannot admit they were wrong

1232
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,127
Riverfront

1233
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:38,527
To Killing Jesus for all of history is the Jews still actively a

1234
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:39,295
Play Christian

1235
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,063
He is

1236
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,391
Score by being a Jew he's anti everyone else

1237
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:50,559
That's one of the Wilder things that I've ever heard of a person say out loud

1238
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:58,495
In 2010 Winona Ryder told the story about meeting Mel Gibson

1239
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:01,823
Jewish people came up in conversation and he asked her quote

1240
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:04,127
You're not an oven Dodger are you

1241
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:10,783
This language and worse was reported to have been used regularly by Mel Gibson reported by Joe

1242
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,551
Joe eszterhas

1243
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:15,391
A screenwriter who was working with Gibson on a film that never got made

1244
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,695
He also said the Gibson called the Holocaust

1245
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,999
Quota mostly a lot of horseshit

1246
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:26,911
Of course in 2060 yelled about how Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world when he got pulled over for a DUI

1247
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:27,935
Was that

1248
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,215
Seems like this is

1249
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,775
Family

1250
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:34,335
Maybe there were a lot of anti-Semitic trope

1251
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,103
In The Passion of the

1252
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:49,695
If you watch the movie and you don't know who made it it's still a bit affected

1253
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:52,511
There are some decisions that are like

1254
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,303
You consider

1255
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,327
Who made at

1256
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,607
Okay

1257
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,887
Yeah presidential

1258
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:03,775
You remember how many youth groups were bussed in to see that movie and all those

1259
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:06,335
Children wear jeans

1260
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:08,127
Hollywood antisemita

1261
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:09,919
Tough

1262
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:14,015
Good to see that Mel Gibson still getting somewhere

1263
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,551
Anyway

1264
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:17,087
Have some thoughts

1265
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:17,855
About

1266
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,927
I don't know how else to put it

1267
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,719
Navigate agenda

1268
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:27,071
1024

1269
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,623
Promotion

I want to make advertisement

1271
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:08,799
Oh my God over

Concomitant

1273
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:29,535
This article that Alex is talking about is about how successful Queer Eye For The Straight Guy

1274
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:32,863
People want to buy product placement taimane

1275
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:37,983
Right I don't know Vidal Sassoon products

1276
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:43,359
Fashion product of some sort would be

1277
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:44,383

All of the government is paying

Gay content

1282
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,647
This is popular people enjoy it

1283
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:59,231
It's getting high ratings out to people who want to sell their product

1284
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,535
What's our buying time on this

1285
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:07,423
You're just wrong the entire family

1286
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,191
If it work

1287
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,727
For the Bush family

1288
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,775
Will & Grace would never have made it to air

1289
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,079
Fully funded that first step

1290
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,103
So do you know that

1291
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:15,871
You know that

1292
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:19,967
I put the first season of Will & Grace was on

1293
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:20,735
PBS

1294
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:21,759
I forgot.

1295
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:27,391
Look man this is ridiculous like

1296
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,951
He's pretending this isn't just like

1297
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:30,719
Commercial

1298
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:36,095
Somehow offended by

1299
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,679
Buying add Time auto program

1300
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:44,799
That features homosexual people is somehow an Insidious conspiracy for him

1301
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:46,335
This is this is pathetic

1302
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,383
Yeah yeah you know

1303
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:51,967
The attitude where we're pretty convinced we were pretty

1304
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:57,087
I convinced that the attitudes from even the far-right had kind of changed over the years

1305
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,111
It's been 20 years

1306
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,903
Not there haven't been

1307
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:03,743
Ton of hurricanes because gay people are fine now you know like it

1308
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,535
And then you just realized it

1309
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,303
Stop.

1310
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:09,375
Talking about it or slightly different what exactly

1311
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,655
Play they didn't they didn't change

1312
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:14,495
Maybe less overtly like

1313
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:16,543
Identifiably hateful

1314
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:19,359
And then just sort of

1315
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,663
Keeping keeping the fire going

1316
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,687
Underground

1317
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,527
Yep brutal

1318
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:31,135
So here's the the end of our adventure on August

1319
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,415
West 4th

1320
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:34,463
I think it's just kind of like a nice

1321
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,255
Thing that resonates to the present

1322
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:53,663
Call

1323
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:58,527
Portland

1324
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:04,927
Alex is saying the false

1325
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,695
Flag attack

1326
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:11,839
Power grids going down everything we're about to happen so they can blame it on

1327
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:15,167
Yeah it says all that kind of s*** for the last 20 years

1328
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:17,983
Yep pretty regularly so

1329
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,263
Alex's prediction

1330
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:22,591
Constantly good kids

1331
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:28,991
When you've only got one response to things it does happen over and over and over again doesn't

1332
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,295
Yay

1333
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,063

1334
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:36,927
Careers bad

1335
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:38,975
20 years

1336
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:39,743
Damn

Mrs. Davis

1340
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:54,079
Bats I'm struggling to come up with Breitbart

1341
01:14:54,591 --> 01:15:00,735
Things are getting less bright before time it's not your fault it's not your fault

1342
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:02,271

1343

01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,143
Pictures from his trip

1349
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:24,799
Maybe he'll have a 15 about running into a globalist weird outdoor location

1350
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,335

You know

1361
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,327
And then he thinks it's a conspiracy

1362
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:51,167
Nothing jams actually work

1363
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:51,935
I would like

1364
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,215

The Oaks hang on to that he was looking for the skunk ape Oh I thought it was looking for the Loch Ness Monster

1373
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:34,431
Really doesn't have a sense of dread Bilderberg

1374
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:39,807
That's what's really going on it would have been a better career for life

1375
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:46,207

01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:13,343
They planned on people that was most of the show

1384
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,647
Trying to think of other cryptic

1385
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,951
