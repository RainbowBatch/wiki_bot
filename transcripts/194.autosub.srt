1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,592
And talk a little bit about Alex Jones

4
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,200
If you could

5
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:19,968
Could fight

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,736
1

7
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:22,784
What would it be

8
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,856
Any animal I can tell you what I would

9
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:33,536
Okay

10
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,352
That's my least favorite animal

11
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,168
Annabelle probably be

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,448
Hydro something soft

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,984
No

14
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,544
Something

15
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,968
I know but I got a lot of body you could work

16
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,760
That's true I don't think

17
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,832
Generally

18
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,880
I don't know people swim around with them

19
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:04,768
Lettuce all the time as a vacation destination

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,792
That's true

21
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:12,960
You want to go with a man it would pain me to do it

22
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,544
Image for Glory

23
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
I want to make it out the other side looking for survival

24
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,784
Deadly

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,136
Alright what are we doing a lot about Alex Jones

26
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:36,768
Just about what I tell you! Bit more because he's in there

27
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
These days it's hard to escape

28
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:43,936
Things I would like to

29
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,240
To do is give a shout out to a new donor

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,896
Thank you so much you are now a policy wonk

31
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,432
I'm a policy wonk

32
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,528
Thank you

33
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
Sprite.com

34
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,576
Sports show

35
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,112
That little button

36
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,648
We would appreciate it

37
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,464
You better bring me something else

38
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:13,632
Voicemails in the near future

39
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,656
You're going on vacation

40
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:19,008
This weekend to recording a little bit earlier than you

41
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,104
Going on a little trip

42
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,944
Our schedule is a little bit

43
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712
Some computer issues

44
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,576
Look into the mailbag

45
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
Messenger

46
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:40,256
Will get back to him in Minneapolis maybe we'll do that at some point

47
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:45,888
Get through some of them we've gotten a ton

48
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
They aren't from Chico

49
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,240
Okay

50
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,824
I did get a request by someone who is

51
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
Gentleman

52
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,920
To visit us here in Chicago

53
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
Had a nice drink with him

54
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
User instrumental

55
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,784
And helping us set up for the show in Austin Texas

56
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:14,560
Just the other day this is a special congratulations

57
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,328
Him and his

58
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
Company

59
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,376
Qo

60
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,912
I will start up

61
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,448
Use that working in

62
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,472
Working on

63
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,360
I just got awarded a $100,000 Grant to put to their

64
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,664
OG ideas

65
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,712
Emotionally I am

66
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,832
Talk about this

67
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
Think about like Rico

68
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:45,280
Claiming my Waters

69
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,328
Would be giving out Trade Secrets

70
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,632
That's exactly

71
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:55,520
What I do remember from talking to his really cool idea and something

72
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
I could be very helpful

73
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,824
In conservation

74
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,128
I went there

75
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
The world

76
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,992
Whenever we talked about it I thought it was great IUI

77
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
What asterisk whatever you said

78
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,648
Right after like he got

79
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,696
I feel really bad about that

80
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,000
I swear to God I thought you're going to be like

81
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,583
They shouldn't have given him that money he told me about the idea

82
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,679
Terrible I don't know what people are doing

83
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,519
Congratulations

84
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
After John and Doug

85
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
And also

86
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,455
That's really cool the way they

87
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
Tell your mother your brother

88
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,087
And the way that to everybody's

89
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
Congratulate

90
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
It feels really good

91
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
We don't have a bunch of s*** head

92
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:52,863
Thank you all for being there and I we all

93
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,143
Support each other as best we can

94
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
Believe it

95
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,239
Oh boy we're back into

96
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
2000

97
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,079
An interesting episode

98
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
Who's going to be there's going to be some

99
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:10,271
Nonlinear storytelling going on inside

100
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,295
No no hot tubs

101
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,623
Before we go

102
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
Text drop

103
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
Today's episode

104
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:28,447
Wall Street money never sleeps

105
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:34,079
That was Alex asking somebody

106
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,663
Is expecting the answer to be terrible

107
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,647
It's doing pretty well

108
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
2009

109
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,047
We're still not quite going to get to

110
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,607
The actual emergence of the Tea Party

111
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,631
But it's interesting

112
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,655
Guisi

113
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,959
A couple of pieces that are very relevant

114
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,239
2

115
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
Alex is mine

116
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Before

117
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,591
The ship goes down

118
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
As it were

119
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,247
The world or anything like that

120
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,783
What about

121
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
Alex

122
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,087
Is very concerned

123
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,647
We're going to start here on February

124
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:25,791
Oki 45678 stacks

125
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:31,167
I could spend the entire show on any one of these

126
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,775
How do you stories yourself

127
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,247
That's why we exist

128
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
News

129
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,575
And any one of them could last the entire show

130
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,367
I'm not going to be

131
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,719
Everything that I say right now but let me tell you something

132
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,167
Journalist

133
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Congratulations

134
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
So a lot of the time

135
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
We're going to

136
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
To be looking at this

137
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
People very afraid

138
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
Britches

139
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,503
Iran

140
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:22,623
Although we just talked about spiders for a few hours

141
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,439
But

142
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
He has more info

143
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
Institutional

144
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,535
A for you to chew on

145
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,119
On the 1st

146
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
2019

147
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,703
Before we're pretty mad about airport scanners

148
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Body scanner

149
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,871
Baby taking naked pictures of your body

150
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,943
Slightly different take on it which I didn't know is part of

151
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,575
Here's another one they're announcing all over the country and USA Today they're putting in body scanners

152
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,367
Were you walking scans your

153
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,439
Naked body and puts it in

154
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,231
Izzy's airport scanners

155
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,399
I have your body

156
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
What instant ID

157
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
What's a body

158
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:19,455
Digital algorithm

159
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,479
Google algorithm

160
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,295
They were great in the 80s

161
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:29,695
Hit song

162
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
I don't know about that

163
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
I don't think.

164
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
Harvesting

165
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,607
Body digital algorithm

166
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
Street cameras

167
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
But if they were

168
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,751
Technology

169
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,823
The idea that every single Street camera history

170
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,359
Hooked up

171
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,407
Massive database of every

172
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:55,807
Body digital algorithm

173
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,647
The only way in fact that you could keep that information

174
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,719
Synthesizer

175
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:09,119
Is if you build an artificial intelligence that can do it even faster than you and now you have an AI that has every single

176
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,959
A person who can afford to fly because that's all that really matters

177
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
It will eventually

178
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,663
Controlla using Airport

179
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,479
And again only people who can afford to fly

180
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,575
Black Knight Meredith

181
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,415
Satellite map of the Earth

182
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
I don't know

183
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:40,095
That's also one of the strange things about those skaters is that they were all connected by one gif

184
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
Message

185
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,983
I had a lot.

186
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
To look up on the

187
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:51,615
This episode this one I punted on a little bit because just like

188
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,919
He doesn't explain what he's talking about

189
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
I like I don't care

190
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:01,087
I don't just doesn't seem

191
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
We get to this next

192
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
Clip where Alex

193
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
What the

194
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Is all about

195
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
I like you too

196
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
To try and

197
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
Can parse out any

198
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,423
Okay so I need to figure out what the system

199
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
Okay

200
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
The system is

201
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
To go after good

202
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,895
Hard-working Americans

203
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,223
Famous cases

204
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,855
And I never saw it and it called the animal

205
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
People went to jail

206
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
Again

207
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,767
This is all about getting regular

208
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,559
Citizens in the net

209
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,887
This is all about capturing regular citizens

210
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,703
Because we're the ones that have money they can suck off

211
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,519
99%

212
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,871
99%

213
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,175
I'll cover when I get back I'm up

214
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,367
Not that I'm aware of

215
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,439
If you do get back to it you phrased it so differently

216
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,231
I love that

217
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,791
That's so good if you're going out to break with that

218
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,607
And the bolts and never come back to it

219
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,215
Before

220
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,263
You were writing some notes

221
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:28,127
Explain what you think I'm going to say before I understand

222
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
If I understand

223
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
Him correctly

224
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
Right this instant

225
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,111
The system is going after real hard-working Americans

226
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,647
Because

227
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
What you notes later on

228
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:47,583
Exactly like how remember when that guy murdered rats who ate his potato tomatoes

229
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,887
Neighbors called the cops on him

230
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911
Eddie went to jail

231
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
Right right

232
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
And then

233
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
99%

234
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:59,359
99%

235
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,175
But you just broken down

236
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,015
Get the play-by-play which is

237
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
Inappropriate

238
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,903
What Alex is talking about is what we here

239
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,719
From him so often I believe

240
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,279
Depicting a scenario that is happening

241
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Underclass

242
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
Franchise group

243
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
Can Americans in

244
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,959
Particular okay threatening that this is what the globalist want to

245
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
To do to wifey

246
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,287
Wright's the good hard-working people

247
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,103
Good American

248
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,407
He's using coded language in order to depict the

249
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
Nightmare scenario wherein

250
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,015
Using real-world

251
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,807
Stuff and turning it into a faint

252
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,599
You fear for his

253
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
Privileged audien

254
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:54,143
I do I think we heard you killing rats with a shovel

255
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,191
And then his neighbors called the cops on them

256
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
Maybe it was their pet rat

257
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:04,639
Maybe he was out in the middle of the night murdering rats with a shovel

258
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,711
If I look out my neighbor's window

259
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:13,343
And I just see a dark silhouette with a shovel smashing it on the ground

260
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
I thought the system

261
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,207
That's a terrible

262
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:23,071
Go to prison

263
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,095
Just for being weird

264
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:29,983
By killing rats on your own property is legal that's not like

265
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
Restaurant

266
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,663
I don't think so

267
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,711
What about those big rats

268
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:46,111
What the ones down in Lake the Bayou

269
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,927
What about the ones in Australia

270
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
Those really big ones

271
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,375
I don't know much about wildlife

272
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,423
That's not what this podcast

273
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,287
2009 where we know that Alex

274
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,823
This is about to launch off on

275
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847
On a major

276
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
New adventure

277
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,151
Where he joins up with a p

278
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
Tea Party

279
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
Believes himself to be

280
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
More like

281
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:17,087
He's going to fold in all his Ron Paul beliefs

282
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
Into

283
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
Party

284
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
The different direction

285
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,999
He's been on already

286
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,535
I received these narratives

287
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,559
From

288
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,351
What we've covered already

289
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,399
With the pro-palestinian

290
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
Neutrality

291
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,727
Anti-police sentiment

292
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,775
These sorts of things are going

293
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,055
To continue into the future

294
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,127
The ship and the only other Masters

295
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,407
Do shift that we've ever seen

296
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,431
Alex Jones

297
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
Is the switch

298
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,759
And as we covered all of that

299
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,783
In 2050

300
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,063
There's one piece of it

301
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
And that is what

302
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
Everything

303
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,695
You clearly tell was guiding Alex and motivating

304
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
To make that switch

305
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
Was he was being

306
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
Popularity

307
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
His numbers were through the roof

308
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
Now what

309
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,911
Would it surprise you

310
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
You to find out

311
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
Today's numbers were exploding

312
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,751
Right before the tea

313
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
Tea party bro

314
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
Program directors Nivens

315
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,967
The doctor seemed very big radio consultants in contacting me famous people

316
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:25,439
Time people want you to be the number one show in the country but obviously the big corporations that own the biggest

317
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,487
Parking let you on the air

318
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:31,071
I bet they tell me that

319
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
Radio

320
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:37,215
Evenly probable executive her scared and know that there

321
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,007
Know that their time is number

322
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
Notice

323
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,823
Know that America is.

324
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:52,063
No that is anti New World Order anti-global espresso America

325
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
And that

326
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,159
Basically

327
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,463
Exploding

328
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:02,047
I'm just one small part of this

329
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,375
Everything

330
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,191
Hyperbolic right now it is exploding

331
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,727
Good to hear from you my friend

332
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,335
Does he literally Mimi he is

333
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,383
Over exaggerate

334
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,783
Exaggerated

335
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,391
Exponential

336
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,183
I would I would say

337
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,231
It's very clear from everything

338
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
15

339
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,679
Astro purse

340
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Yeah there was automated

341
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,519
Bots that were over inflating traffic

342
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
Look at

343
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
Primary

344
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,151
Entirely bankrolled by Americans

345
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
Prosperity

346
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,479
Yep freedomworks Koch brothers Foundation

347
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:57,599
Stoked by Fox News

348
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,183
It was also an artificial

349
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
2000

350
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,071
The Alex's numbers jumping

351
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
Again

352
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
It really hard not to

353
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
The Koch brothers bought you

354
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
Traffic

355
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
Yeah

356
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,079
They might be bothering you up already

357
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,895
I can't can't see that for sure

358
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,431
To be like if I were Alex Jones

359
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:26,271
Ever saw an increase in traffic

360
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:34,207
Doesn't have conspiracy theories about mainly because he attributed to

361
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,999
How great his own

362
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,815
Yeah so I don't know its interests

363
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:46,239
Like what kind of language

364
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:52,639
Normally like there's no way that happened Brothers villains in like real life

365
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,967
If we were like political strategy

366
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,039
Any stripe and we were trying to get Alex Jones

367
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,111
To bend to our will it would only take a couple of episodes

368
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
Really soft

369
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
What he's about

370
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
His own

371
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
If you were

372
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,399
Like someone who is working

373
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,423
Sing for the Koch brothers in

374
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
Strategy

375
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,751
And you wanted to flip Alex Jones

376
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,287
It would be incredibly easy

377
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
To just

378
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,847
Stroke the ego

379
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,407
And then I don't know have some

380
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,455
Functionary

381
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
Die with

382
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
Like Rodger Stone

383
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,623
Behavior salesman and then you have the artists

384
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:39,487
Growth in order to butter up his ego makeup feel on top of the world

385
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,047
Spokesperson salesperson come in

386
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,607
And double down on that

387
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:51,263
Maybe the meetings but he's taking with these high-end people saying his time has come

388
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,567
People are the people who are working

389
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,591
In concert with

390
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
False growth

391
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,175
Listen let me tell you something

392
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,455
How great

393
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
This is

394
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,503
Hold on

395
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,087
What do I got to do

396
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,903
What do you want

397
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,183
I need to be bigger

398
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
Alright you got it

399
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,231
You got it

400
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,767
$17,000

401
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,583
Also this is a used car

402
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
Oh

403
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,959
You know I'm picking my car

404
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,287
I'm going to get drunk and talk about it on there

405
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,127
I think at this point

406
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,151
It's still just a sore

407
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
Spitballing

408
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,199
There's no real

409
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
But that's what happened

410
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,575
Parallels of

411
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,159
We heard him talking about the airport

412
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
Is this

413
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
Describes a paranoid

414
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:03,967
Going to be patrolling North Dakota

415
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
They have

416
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,599
High-altitude blimps at 100,000 ft in Canada that us and England

417
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:14,719
Weather

418
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,583
They know your biometric residence just by the way your body move

419
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,911
Went from a shoot-down position from above

420
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
Resonance

421
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,751
Involved

422
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
I think

423
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
You can change your gate

424
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,175
Auras

425
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,247
It seems like he must but you must think it's

426
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
Some sort of AC

427
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,319
You know it's like

428
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,951
Snowman

429
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,767
Grease pencil

430
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,559
Beers like no matter where you are

431
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,119
You're one second away from this blimp shooting

432
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,167
You dead because of the way you walk in

433
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,703
And because they've scanned you innocent

434
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
System

435
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,495
You're never safe

436
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,335
Why would you be very unpleasant place to put your body

437
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
Did you read the

438
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,431
New York Magazine's headline

439
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,247
Trolls Park

440
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
Alien verse

441
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:19,232
Predator

442
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,768
The right

443
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,840
With

444
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
Predator

445
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,472
I don't know what year that was

446
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,752
The movie theater

447
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,776
But that doesn't help

448
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,312
Whataburger

449
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,896
Movie theaters

450
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,456
Biography of me

451
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,856
This episode little bit longer

452
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,136
Ultimately pointless

453
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,672
But I wanted to keep it in

454
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
Because

455
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,000
This is this is still indicative of Alex

456
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,280
Trying to have fun

457
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
2009

458
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
Which is sorely missed

459
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,152
Humor

460
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:16,320
The royalty of Europe in what's scum they are and how low they think the public

461
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,328
Pretty funny

462
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,752
I shouldn't even get into it

463
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,824
The Queen of England

464
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,872
They claim a stops at 1901

465
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,664
The Queen of England

466
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,552
If you Google it it's mainstream

467
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,368
The office last night didn't believe it

468
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,416
When I told him so they Googled it

469
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
And

470
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:00,608
My wife feel about it because she was also a history minor when she went to school

471
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
France

472
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
So she learned about the

473
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,704
Used Range Rover

474
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:13,920
I was just joking around during the break with the guys but it's just that are such, ladies and gentlemen

475
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,456
But you can't even

476
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,248
You can't even imagine

477
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
How did the

478
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,928
I'm not going to get into it maybe later this week when I have time to cover it

479
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,976
Break it down

480
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,096
Common one of the

481
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,888
Headache official nose picker

482
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,472
Hand and I'm serious who were they

483
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,872
Royalty

484
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,944
Has a toilet attendant and I'm just going to leave it

485
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,504
At that let's just say they don't touch toilet paper

486
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,320
Taken care of by somebody else

487
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,880
It's called the groom of the stool

488
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,904
30 go

489
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,072
Absolutely

490
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,448
That job have benefits

491
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,752
Oh man

492
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,288
Ridiculous

493
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,568
Because the groomers

494
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,104
The stool was a real position

495
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,408
But it was always held by like

496
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
Noble Team

497
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
Because it wasn't

498
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,736
Like about wiping

499
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
It was a

500
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,856
Super close adviser that would sit with him in the bathroom

501
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,904
And they would have liked meeting

502
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
Because back then

503
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,208
Being there half an hour

504
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:35,328
We're not great

505
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,608
Position where

506
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,888
Acceptably High standing

507
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,216
Close

508
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,008
Confidant

509
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,288
Don't know that make sense

510
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,592
Deeply trusted by the

511
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
Part of it is

512
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,064
If there's

513
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,856
You know there's an outside

514
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:03,488
Maybe there was some ass with all depends on what you're into

515
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
The office

516
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,560
Exclusively want

517
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,840
Serve male monarch

518
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,888
Elizabeth

519
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
The first and 50

520
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,960
58 it was replaced by a kazoo

521
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,288
Amanda

522
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,312
The position was neutralized

523
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,360
Year later

524
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,176
Queen Elizabeth

525
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,064
Is it worth

526
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,344
Well it did

527
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,624
Steward of transitioning

528
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,416
You just an advisor

529
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,720
Position but then when Edwards

530
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,256
Power

531
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,096
Alex mentioned that official

532
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,728
Became the prime

533
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,640
The lineage of these people it's like it was a public office

534
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,176
But it wasn't

535
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:58,272
You know so the list of all of the people who have held that position is available

536
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,832
The history isn't like something they

537
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,880
And they're all

538
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,416
Cool

539
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:09,536
I would love to

540
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,816
30 great from 8

541
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
18042

542
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
12 Georges

543
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,656
9th orlova

544
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,984
The Gremlins

545
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,288
I thought he was dead

546
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,872
Oh no no no

547
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,920
Whatever

548
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,688
Marquis

549
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:27,968
Marquis

550
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,368
But that is

551
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,976
That's where we come to the end of February 20th

552
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,536
To have them sit in a room while you sure

553
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,352
Blood because

554
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
He's very

555
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,192
A very vulnerable position

556
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,496
That's why it's always Duke

557
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,312
So we going to the toy

558
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
8/3

559
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,872
And job

560
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
That's just a fun fact

561
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:01,248
Always fun to learn

562
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,600
Hundreds were we

563
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,816
Is it going to take all day

564
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
So that we had to

565
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,144
23rd

566
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:19,936
Straubenzee

567
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:20,960
Very

568
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
I want to make

569
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,008
You scared narrative

570
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,384
Would local police

571
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:35,040
Michigan

572
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,120
Home store

573
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:03,968
Those are two very different subjects today

574
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,552
So even more f***** up is he

575
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
Not

576
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:12,928
Holy Alliance

577
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,232
He is lying a bit but

578
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,024
He's not like this event

579
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048
Did happen

580
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:21,632
Describing it is

581
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
Sweetly off

582
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,960
Turn off of it

583
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,752
2004 article in the washing

584
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,824
Thrown by Reverend Sun Myung Moon

585
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,872
The article was written by Michelle

586
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:35,200
And so that is Stryker running to

587
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,552
Was not as subversive

588
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
Attempt to make

589
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,600
Homeschoolers

590
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,648
Poorly-written preparedness drill

591
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,744
The students involved volunteer

592
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,792
Most of them were members of the drama classes

593
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,584
There's School in folders after me

594
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,888
Makeup like they had blood makeup and squibs

595
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:58,752
False Flags

596
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,288
Crisis actors

597
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,848
This is the one time where the false flag

598
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,920
What's the weather

599
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
No

600
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,528
The kids were high schooler's there weren't children involved no bus

601
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,856
Blew up because the homeschool movement

602
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,624
In America

603
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,672
Is super defensive

604
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,000
Crazy and f***** up and they should not be allowed

605
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:23,328
Is actually why they're super

606
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,376
Because people have that position

607
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,192
I don't think all homeschooling is really all that bad

608
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
I think a lot of

609
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
Fundamental

610
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,544
Homeschooling a lot of their religious

611
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,592
I think that can be fairly Danger

612
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,896
Homeschooling is based on like

613
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,200
Be asleep

614
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,736
Yeah

615
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
Involve some sort of

616
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
The community

617
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
Involvement

618
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
You know like

619
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,344
Where you go out in

620
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,112
Have

621
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,904
Socializing groups in

622
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
I think I can

623
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
Be very damaging

624
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,000
But just the idea of not wanting

625
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,536
Go to public school

626
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,376
I think that there is there is an argument you can make that it's not based on bulshit

627
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:02,240
Homeschooling is bad

628
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:08,896
It is possible for kids who are homeschooled

629
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
But

630
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,576
Motels

631
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,880
Is brainwashing

632
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
Homeschool

633
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,928
There is a nun

634
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,208
Unfortunate amount of

635
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,744
I would say

636
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,024
So the other thing

637
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,048
Really funny

638
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,584
I lost the

639
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,704
OK Google I lost the Exacta article of it but it's

640
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,800
The guy who ended up writing

641
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,592
The drill was like I wasn't

642
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:44,992
To make anyone hate together it is what I came up with

643
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,040
What look

644
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:51,392
The group that you came up to be the villains of the

645
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,120
Rocco's

646
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,520
I think this is a great roleplay right now

647
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:11,616
This is a dmj D&D I love it

648
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:18,016
It's a little selves against education

649
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
Like

650
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,064
Taken poorly

651
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,368
I get what you're trying to do in terms of

652
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,904
Planning preparedness

653
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,464
X

654
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,000
You guys really should have done the second

655
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:32,096
Second breath on this gift

656
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:35,168
Back to the drawing board

657
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,960
Punch up yeah for sure

658
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,312
I don't remember his name it's not really important

659
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:47,968
This is just a low-level intern guy most likely

660
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,296
But all of the responses that

661
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,064
You can find

662
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,832
From homeschooling

663
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,696
I'm not going to come down on them

664
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
Two Harbors

665
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,744
Because I would much rather come

666
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
Come down on them

667
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
For being like

668
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,072
Muslim group

669
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:09,728
Why wasn't it a Muslim terrorist group that was the bad guys in

670
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:16,128
How come you were making

671
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,152
The reason

672
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
It was in Buskey

673
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,456
County in

674
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,736
In Michigan

675
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:25,088
Muslims

676
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
Under one

677
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
Percent

678
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,768
Muslim or Arabic it anyway it's a

679
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
Kylie White

680
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
The population

681
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,632
I'm out of place

682
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,960
Michigan does have one of the highest

683
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,568
Muslim like Community or one of the largest Muslim

684
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:51,968
But there are definitely aware that everyone

685
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:57,856
They are in the Muskegon County in order to avoid the other

686
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,488
2009 episode

687
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:04,768
We covered

688
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,536
A b a g

689
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,400
Was that

690
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,472
An interview that Alex has with

691
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
The member of the Iowa National

692
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,800
Alex's big narrative

693
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
He's pushing around this time

694
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,872
Is that there is this

695
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,152
Arcadia Iowa

696
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:21,920
Weather

697
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,200
Do this drill

698
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,480
Where

699
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,088
Houses with v

700
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,880
Tear to go along with the roleplay

701
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,648
Well they try

702
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,672
Define Vista

703
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,952
Arm dealer

704
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,976
Who's them

705
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,256
Prepare them for

706
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
To talk about it

707
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,984
Because I'm the 20

708
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,312
Alex Jones says this about that and

709
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:54,432
You know what what's going on

710
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,456
Hapgood

711
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
Friday

712
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:04,416
I was really interrogating

713
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,024
Okay

714
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,872
Love's

715
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:46,656
I started cracking up I was so much

716
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,192
And that's why you begin

717
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:54,592
Start the Republic

718
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,200
And that's why this is going to fail ladies and gentlemen

719
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,504
So when I heard that I was like

720
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,904
Bucking dare you how dare you Alex

721
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,464
Look Every Good Boy Deserves

722
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,096
Fudge

723
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:20,448
So I don't know about that I'll leave that to the I will say first of all

724
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
Near crying

725
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:30,176
No I remember we listened to it we didn't listen to

726
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,480
Good enough for me to just

727
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
Assert

728
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,784
That he didn't cry

729
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,832
I must play this for you

730
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,112
Illustrate

731
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:38,880
Exactly

732
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,648
Happened

733
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,184
You didn't cry

734
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,952
He was a

735
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,720
YMCA

736
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,768
White guy

737
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:48,352
Who stayed there for over 20 minutes while Alex badgered him

738
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,400
Total dictum

739
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,448
2 questions

740
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,984
To the best of his ability

741
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
And then Alex

742
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
Piece of s***

743
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,128
Actually important

744
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,664
Because I want to illustrate

745
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,944
How much of a liar Alex

746
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,992
America

747
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760
2 something

748
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,784
There's a big piece

749
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,344
Did I need to go

750
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,112
Exhaustive

751
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,208
And I am but apologizing

752
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:19,072
Okay alright but here is where Alex

753
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:19,840
Starts to

754
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,144
Back to the 20

755
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,448
Flashing back to February 20th

756
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,984
When Alex had

757
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,776
Colonel Greg hopgood

758
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,080
He's already done before

759
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
Adduction

760
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,896
Start leading

761
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,688
Hopgood hapgood down

762
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,344
Are you aware that there's now a massive domestic roles

763
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,696
Regular Army National Guard

764
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:52,096
But I think you have to look historically is that domestic role really has been filled by the National Guard across

765
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
United States

766
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,144
A decade

767
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,704
And I will wear no different Princeton

768
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:00,032
Summer we had this incredibly historic flood

769
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,592
Here in the state the number one response

770
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:06,688
Force for many military is always the National Guard in their home state

771
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:11,296
More than 4,000 people last summer to fight bludgeon Iowa

772
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,368
That being said if there are other kinds of

773
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:18,720
Response necessary in the state and chip for the responses that we really have to do with

774
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,280
Are most the time natural disasters

775
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:26,912
Other disasters let's say some kind of weapons of mass destruction or some other kind of instant

776
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:31,520
I would be also called upon to do that so it's so I do have some visibility on that Duty as well

777
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:32,800
Colonel

778
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:37,920
Firearms unknown

779
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:48,160
With respect to any kind of Duty that we perform in Iowa it's kinda depends on on which

780
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,720
Battleships in about who we take orders from number one

781
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,280
If it is in peacetime situation

782
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,840
The vast majority of the time any

783
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,656
Kind of a request for assistance

784
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:02,752
Comes from the governor of the state of Iowa I can tell you that the order of which you just spoke

785
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,288
I have never been

786
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,848
Received by the Iowa National Guard

787
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,712
And I can tell you that you will not find stronger

788
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:15,552
Defenders of the Constitution's in a minimum of the Iowa National Guard

789
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,344
So if that sounds

790
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,368
IQ

791
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,392
Colonel

792
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:24,512
Kill the Jedi and more importantly the young links

793
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
I mean it's not far off

794
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
Do you know what he's

795
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,144
Where he's going with his

796
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
Badgering questions

797
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,216
So

798
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,032
Because

799
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,056
It would be unfair with me

800
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:37,824
Me to cherry-pick

801
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:41,664
Well that's the one part where you wasn't crying

802
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:45,248
He's on the edge of telling Alex every

803
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:52,160
It was hit the governor he almost even said it he said if the governor ordered us to take everybody's guns away

804
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,696
Obviously we

805
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,024
The tution

806
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,144
Andy doesn't mean anything and we're destroying it and we're taking

807
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,472
Heathens

808
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,496
You didn't hear that part

809
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:12,128
Did you hear the part about how great his grandfather was cuz then we can

810
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,920
Rivers engineer everything after

811
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,688
My granddad

812
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,504
No

813
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,528
Who is Meredith

814
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,648
And be like yeah right

815
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:43,872
I'm in the guard for 23 years and I've never heard of that

816
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,664
I remember the Iowa National Guard

817
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,528
1986's 1991 I do not recall

818
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,576
Evergreen infatuation

819
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,488
Marine

820
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:05,888
Please don't put me in the camp

821
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:20,480
I'm certainly aware that absolutely but I think you have to look at the role the National Guard's historically

822
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:24,832
Is that historically we are used in States

823
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,160
4 disasters overwhelmingly

824
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,720
And our job is to number-one you ready

825
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,024
Our mission

826
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,424
Federally which has to go to war and number two is to help our fellow Citizens United States of America

827
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,728
Farpoint rain for

828
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,264
The army war College

829
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:53,504
And directives on engagement with the American people under northcom

830
00:40:55,552 --> 00:41:01,184
They were talking about

831
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:10,144
Remember that the National Guard 99% of the time is

832
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,192
Peacetime

833
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:15,264
Belongs to the state in which they are located

834
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,896
Only on occasion to become federalized one of those examples of courses being mobilized and deployed

835
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:24,224
About to go to war peacekeeping other kinds of federalized mission

836
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:29,088
But other than that the National Guard generally in peacetime belongs to the governor of that

837
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,440
Absolutely absolutely

838
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:38,048
Hair looks

839
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,096
Cry

840
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,376
He's throwing out the best

841
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,960
Calmly and politely

842
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,008
Responding

843
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:49,824
Important information

844
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,663
Terms of being at

845
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,479
The will of the governor of the state that they're operating

846
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,503
Almost all the

847
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:58,783
Batman they become

848
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,551
Federer live

849
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:03,135
Stuff like that

850
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,695
So the idea that their Federal

851
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,071
Relyance Bank

852
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,351
Of what they do

853
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,399
Even when they go into another

854
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
Ford like

855
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,703
Natural disaster relief

856
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,239
Stuff like that

857
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,543
Like let's say the Iowa National Guard ends up

858
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,311
Illinois

859
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,615
Is of the Illinois gov

860
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,919
They're being

861
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,943
To the state of Illinois

862
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,479
Respond or they

863
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,759
The chain of command

864
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,527
Illinois

865
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,295
Okay

866
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,831
So good

867
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,879
Answers for Alex

868
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:36,927
To calmly

869
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,207
Deflect his narrative

870
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,535
Well here's the real situation I understand what you're

871
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,095
It's not working

872
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,631
And it leads to Alex getting

873
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,655
What I would describe as

874
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:57,151
Breakdown of society riding right now

875
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:03,807
I mean what I can tell you is only what we do here in Iowa that's be prepared to go to war to prepare to help people here

876
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,575
United States

877
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,367
Those are the things that we do

878
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:18,655
Louisiana Mississippi

879
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:25,311
We haven't we haven't been asked to do that in the state of Iowa and history of our state we've been around 470 year

880
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:28,127
Militia

881
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:33,759
And like I said we uphold the Constitution advocate for the Constitution

882
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:40,159
Everyday and what we do and what I can change

883
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:46,559
70 years

884
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,887
The point I'm trying to make as you've tried it out to pray the horrible

885
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:52,191
Of which I can't possibly comment

886
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:56,799
All I can tell you about is what we do here in Iowa to get ready That's the pistol I'ma talk to you about

887
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:03,199
Appreciate

888
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:06,527
Because we're educated

889
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,207
I'm interrogating

890
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:18,303
Showing a little bit of his ass off to underbelly there

891
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,327
Because when

892
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:24,703
Hamptons like there's your bring it up there's no f****** way I could comment on Facebook

893
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:29,311
First of all probably I don't know about like other states

894
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,127
And then beyond items everything that's like

895
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,919
Something I wasn't involved

896
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:41,855
Hang up on me

897
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,903
I still got it

898
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:50,303
Which is this occurred would you take the aliens gun

899
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,607
Would you protect their second amendment rights

900
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,727
Text blaster

901
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,335
So now we get to

902
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,127
What

903
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,663
I think everybody

904
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,687
Every Space movie

905
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,759
Alright I'm sorry I'm sorry

906
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:14,623
So now Alex Quest

907
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,903
And then we will get

908
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,207
To a lot of information that I have

909
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,999
Clearly illustrates

910
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,023
Alex

911
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,583
Big dumb dumb

912
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:29,215
Germany or Russia

913
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,287
The military

914
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,383
Be like Italy or Japan

915
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,991
Again I can just tell you what I see here in front of me everyday

916
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:44,319
I seen 9,500 men and women that are committed to Liberty

917
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,367
Better Community United States of America

918
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:50,207
State of Iowa doing they can do

919
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,279
Temperature people that's what I can tell you about

920
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:58,143
Lieutenant Colonel guard trips to New Orleans

921
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,423
Yes we did

922
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,495
In fact I was there myself as well

923
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:05,823
We did send approximately 400

924
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,687
Catrin Mississippi and some that were also in New Orleans as well

925
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,271
We did not take part in any of those kinds of operation

926
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,551
Did you witness it

927
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,599
Did not

928
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:27,327
Mercenaries were also used from Israel

929
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,631
No formation about that

930
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,447
No information

931
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,751
Formation

932
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,543
Didn't personally see it

933
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:42,943
About stuff

934
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:43,711
Best

935
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,759
Probably his best Salvo which is

936
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
You guys work

937
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,087
Katrina Katrina relief

938
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,159
Did you take part in the gun down

939
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:56,255
We need to talk about that now there's a lot of writing

940
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,023
And reading

941
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:00,607
About guns and Hurricane Katrina because

942
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,375
Is a liar

943
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,263
The story of

944
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,055
Publicly out there and

945
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,359
It would do with all a good bit

946
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,663
2 RS

947
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,711
To understand the Dynamics

948
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:20,063
The idea that there was gun confiscation

949
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,367
After Hurricane Katrina is not based in reality

950
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:26,463
That was created by the NRA along with the Second Amendment

951
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,231
Dissociation

952
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,023
They were trying to create this image

953
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,583
Control Federal power taking advantage of

954
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,607
Horrible tragedy

955
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,143
In order to grab people's gun

956
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,679
But the truth is

957
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,215
More complicated than that

958
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,519
But their reasons for doing so are not

959
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:44,383
The NRA propaganda is largely propped up by an unfortunate quote from New Orleans

960
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,943
Police Department superintendent Edwin compass

961
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:50,783
The third who said quote law enforcement are allowed to have weapons

962
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,855
After struggling to retain a state of calm

963
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,623
In a city that was

964
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,671
Under percent underwater

965
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,951
Plagued by looting

966
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,999
And mismanaged efforts to help survive

967
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,279
He was a clumsy

968
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:04,095
Dumb thing to say you can understand his mental state

969
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:10,751
Either way he was no longer New Orleans Police Department superintendent a few weeks later he was relieved of Duty

970
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,591
No just because of his bungling and

971
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:20,735
I didn't look too deeply into his leaving office but I believe

972
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
Steps down

973
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,295
I think it was like a

974
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,599
Either way

975
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:31,999
A marine veteran in New Orleans police Reserve officer

976
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,327
The Katrina is going on record

977
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,887
There was not widespread gun

978
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
New Orleans

979
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:42,239
It was nowhere near as widespread as some would have you believe

980
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,519
I know I am count

981
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,055
Countless people with firearms in

982
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:45,823
Did not,

983
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:46,847
Single one

984
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,895
Neither did any officer I knew or work

985
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,943
The only time Firearms were seized

986
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,735
I wear when someone

987
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,759
War crime

988
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,295
No different than before the ring

989
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,855
He even goes on to say that he and other officers

990
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,391
Specific Instructions

991
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,159
Not

992
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,439
Take anyone's firearm

993
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,559
Alright

994
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,839
That is

995
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,399
Pretty concrete

996
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,799
Experience you know you can extrapolate

997
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,823
Whatever you'd like to

998
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,359
Because there ain't

999
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,663
Piles of shih tzu only care about gun

1000
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,711
Glommed onto a couple incident

1001
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,247
There were a bit unfortunate

1002
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,783
Example an older lady

1003
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,087
He was waving a gun around in front of officers were trying

1004
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:29,855
Persuade

1005
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,647
Leave her outside she end up getting

1006
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:39,583
She doesn't just have a gun out and then her old lady status

1007
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,631
Revoke it's not like waving around

1008
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:48,031
Threateningly necessarily but even if

1009
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,335
Nonviolent

1010
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,383
I believe that the legal definition of Brandy

1011
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,151
Finishing is EOTech

1012
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,687
Finger on the trigger Zone

1013
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:57,247
Something like that I don't care to litigate

1014
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:00,831
Even her telling of it is like I have done in my head then I got back up

1015
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:07,231
There is a clear cause-and-effect relationship there that makes that but

1016
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:11,071
NRA

1017
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:12,607
Like this

1018
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,887
I'm a pseudonym

1019
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,655
Police

1020
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:21,567
Very closely after already to the rescue

1021
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,103
Department revealed they take

1022
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,127
550

1023
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:27,711
Gun into their headquarters between August 23rd

1024
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,991
2005

1025
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,039
Hey December 31st

1026
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:31,807
2005

1027
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,599
According to police

1028
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,159
These were mostly

1029
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,439
Stolen guns

1030
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,231
Confiscated

1031
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:43,071
The terms of the settlement made it to the New Orleans

1032
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:46,143
I have to do everything in their power to let people know

1033
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,935
That they can come and get their gun

1034
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,519
That was it none of this should have happened to begin with

1035
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:55,871
Quotes in April 2006 police Firearms available to owners

1036
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,943
Hard to claim if they could present a bill of sale

1037
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,503
Weapon serial number

1038
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,783
Which of course

1039
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,551
Difficult

1040
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,087
How does a person who's

1041
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:09,695
House flooded provide proof of ownership of a gun probably was destroyed in the flood

1042
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,743
What do you do if your

1043
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:16,351
Do you just give guns to anyone claiming to be their owner

1044
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,935
Basically the NRA's lawsuit in the settlement of lead to the resolute

1045
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,471
The people would jump

1046
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:24,287
Have to sign an affidavit that a certain gone was there's a

1047
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,311
And then it was

1048
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:37,599
So there are a few stories that exist out there in The Ether about people having their guns taken away from them

1049
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:40,159
Aftermath of Katrina stories

1050
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,719
Clearly involved

1051
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,023
People talking about run-ins with in New Orleans

1052
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:45,791
Police Department

1053
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,583
Not with some sort of National Guard

1054
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,863
It's been federalized

1055
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,471
Or out-of-state forces of the government

1056
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,543
And it was all over

1057
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,615
Note every single person who had their guns taken away

1058
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,383
Old lady

1059
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,431
Now but we will get you one commonality but

1060
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,455
Between them a little bit

1061
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,247
Apple notes

1062
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:10,623
They were running

1063
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,903
To the New Orleans Police

1064
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,183
Is because

1065
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,207
Did investigation

1066
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,279
Police department has a long history of stealing

1067
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,047
People's guns

1068
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:18,815
The traffic stop

1069
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:24,191
Gordon Hutchinson writing for the Louisiana Sportsman

1070
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,727
Said quote in the course of research

1071
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:26,495
Search for AR book

1072
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,567
On the confiscation of firearms in the aftermath of the hurricane

1073
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,359
We heard a number of similar stories

1074
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,151
They all follow the same thing

1075
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,199
A citizen is pulled over in a traffic

1076
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:37,247
Stop the New Orleans Police Department

1077
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,527
There takes a gun from the city

1078
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,855
An extra citizen if they have a receipt for the gun

1079
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:45,695
When the answer is no the gun is seized and the citizen is informed

1080
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,231
If they will show up

1081
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:50,303
Precinct with proof of ownership they can have the gun back

1082
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:55,167
When I asked a good friend to retired New Orleans Police Department Officer about the practice

1083
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,215
He stated that it was a fairly common practice

1084
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,495
To take on for motorist

1085
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,263
Before the hurricane

1086
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:02,591
This Is An Open Secret in New Orleans community

1087
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,127
And if zero to do with hurricane

1088
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,663
Katrina

1089
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,431
Federal Officer

1090
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,711
Or the National Guard

1091
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,271
It was the behavior of an underfunded understaffed

1092
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,039
Undertrained

1093
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:11,807
Structural

1094
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:16,671
The Department of Justice did investigation into New Orleans Police

1095
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,439
I found it to be

1096
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,207
Complete map

1097
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,487
The kneaded essentially a

1098
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,767
We overhauled

1099
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,351
From their 158 page report

1100
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,911
The deficiencies are in the way than world

1101
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:27,679
Police Department police

1102
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:31,263
This is the city are not simply individual but structural as well

1103
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:35,103
For too long the department has been largely indifferent to widespread violations

1104
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,895
It's officer

1105
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:40,223
New Orleans Police Department does not have in place

1106
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,247
The basic system

1107
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,295
Don't improve Public Safety and

1108
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,831
Constitutional practices

1109
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,111
And promote public kompa

1110
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,391
We found it

1111
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:49,951
Deficiencies that lead to constitutional violation

1112
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,231
Spam the operations

1113
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,255
The entire department

1114
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:57,119
From how officers are recruited trained supervised and held accountable to the operations

1115
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:57,887
The paid detail

1116
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:58,911
And the apps

1117
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,679
The mechanisms

1118
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,471
To protect and promote civil rights

1119
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,263
Officers too frequently uses

1120
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,031
Excessive force

1121
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,847
And conducting illegal stop searches and arrest

1122
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:07,871
Impunity

1123
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:14,271
That was that was like in that documentary Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans

1124
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:20,671
Nicolas Cage New Orleans cop for a while

1125
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,975
So are they

1126
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,767
Stealing guns to use

1127
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:27,071
Like to issue to each other

1128
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:33,471
Like it because the standard issue gun there no

1129
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:41,919
It's like that kind of like old police cars

1130
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,479
Power Trip

1131
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,759
Incorruptibles

1132
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,391
They're f****** crazy could be just also to you legally collect

1133
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:58,815
Sure weapons

1134
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,351
Portland Police Department has been doing that

1135
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,703
Civil forfeiture

1136
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:12,895
It's yours you can have it back that was guns for years

1137
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,687
Isn't something that happened in hurricane

1138
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,991
Caprina it was a problem for a long time

1139
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,551
No this is a systemic problem within the

1140
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,111
Department that was left on check for a long

1141
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,671
To the NRA

1142
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,695
Don't care about that

1143
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:30,047
They only care about their imagine fantasies of out-of-control federal troops using

1144
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,071
Disaster to take gone

1145
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,351
And very

1146
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,679
The people in the NRA's video with their guns

1147
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,447
Taken by the police

1148
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,471
Are all white

1149
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:40,031
Fresno Police Department generally showed

1150
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:46,431
Absurd bias towards targeting African-Americans

1151
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,647
Racial disparities in arrest of American

1152
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,183
Virtually all categories

1153
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:59,743
We particularly dramatic disparity for Africa

1154
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,535
Can Americans under the age of seven

1155
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,839
Are provided by the New Orleans

1156
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:07,423
Apartment

1157
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,471
Did 500 African-American males

1158
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,239
+ 8

1159
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,263
White males

1160
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,287
Under the age of seven

1161
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:18,943
A serious offence larceny over $50.

1162
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:19,967
65 a

1163
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,759
Working American females and one white

1164
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:22,783
Female in the same age

1165
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,599
God damn even if you adjust for population differ

1166
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,903
You're being arrested at a rate of approximately

1167
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,183
21

1168
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:29,951
Compared to whites

1169
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:33,023
Goddamn also notable quote of the 27 in

1170
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:37,119
January 2009 and may 2010

1171
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:40,191
Officers intentionally discharge their firearms at

1172
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:42,495
People all 27 of the subjects

1173
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,519
Deadly force

1174
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,543
Where African America

1175
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:49,151
So it's very clear if you look at the pattern of the department

1176
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:54,271
What was going on for a long time they were stealing guns from black people and don't care cuz they had no social power

1177
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,551
USA

1178
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:01,183
The officers taking guns in New Orleans weren't federal troops

1179
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,207
Cops that have been taken

1180
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,743
People's guns in New Orleans forever

1181
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,535
Alex in this community make this such

1182
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:09,631
Does the classic instance of white people receiving the treatment

1183
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,399
The minorities were

1184
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,935
Subjected to all the time

1185
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:18,591
Also sorry their guns were taken away but also 1800 or so people died in that storm

1186
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,663
6 days after Hurricane Katrina

1187
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,455
Katrina struck New Orleans

1188
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,479
Farmer killed

1189
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,247
Two civilians

1190
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,527
Seventeen-year-old James

1191
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,575
Percent and forty-year-old Ronald Maddison

1192
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,623
Four other civilians were wounded

1193
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:33,439
All of the victims were African-American none were armed

1194
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:35,743
Ignore had committed any crime

1195
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:38,559
Madison a mentally disabled man was shot in the back

1196
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,447
There's bigger issues to talk about than a couple people who had their guns take

1197
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,727
In the same way that

1198
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:51,103
Triage

1199
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,151
Absolutely the smallest bill

1200
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,943
So

1201
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,991
I think I really need to

1202
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:57,759
Winning

1203
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:01,087
You strip some of the horrors away from it with a very difficult to do

1204
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:02,623
Is it not

1205
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,647
Nothing to do with

1206
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:06,975
Federal troops coming in or National Guard troops

1207
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:09,535
It's Deep by product of a years

1208
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,303
Deficient

1209
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,327
Police Department

1210
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:14,911
No one has stepped in to get into line Orchard

1211
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,191
Problems

1212
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,471
They're behaving in the exact

1213
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,519
Before the storm

1214
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,055
And Alex is using it

1215
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
Sort of like

1216
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,871
This is what happens when the federal government comes in

1217
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,895
No sir

1218
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,175
This is City

1219
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,967
This is state-level stuff

1220
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,271
You are very wrong about that

1221
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,831
If you want to get right with your narrative

1222
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:33,855
Then you have to

1223
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,879
To get right with all of the

1224
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:38,207
You have to get right with the fact that this is a department that was running

1225
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,231
I'm walking without hacking

1226
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,535
Control now the further thing that Alex needs

1227
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,559
To get right about

1228
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,327
Is this

1229
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:46,911
Because there was such an outcry by the NRA

1230
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,703
Group

1231
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,983
About this

1232
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:56,383
Ended up pushing through a new code us code title 42 chapter

1233
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,175
68 subchapter 5

1234
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:00,223
AR code 5207

1235
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:00,991
Which reads

1236
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,783
Prohibition of confer

1237
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,807
Gestation of firearm

1238
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,367
No officer or employee of the United States

1239
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,927
Including any member of the uniformed service

1240
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:13,791
Or person operating pursuant to or under color of federal law

1241
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,815
Federal funds

1242
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,839
Or under

1243
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,143
Control of any federal official

1244
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:22,495
Providing services to such an employee officer or other person

1245
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,519
Supportive release

1246
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:26,847
From a major disaster or emergency and they won

1247
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:29,663
Temporarily or permanently seized or authorized

1248
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,199
Seizure of any firearm

1249
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:36,319
The possession of which is not prohibited under federal state or local law

1250
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,623
Federal law or as evidence

1251
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,903
In a criminal investigation

1252
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:43,487
They may not require registration of any firearm

1253
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:47,071
For which registration is not required by federal state or local law

1254
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,607
The only limitation

1255
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,911
Is it nothing in the sex

1256
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:51,935
Chinchilla be construed

1257
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,959
Any person

1258
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:56,543
From requiring the temporary surrender of a firearm as a

1259
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,311
Condition

1260
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,335
For entry into a motor

1261
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,359
Interpretation

1262
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,895
Rescue or evacuation

1263
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,943
During a major disaster or emergency

1264
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,223
Provided that such

1265
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,503
Search temporary surrendered

1266
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:07,295
Byron has returned to Ithaca

1267
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,319
Completion

1268
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:12,927
Said Rescuers activation

1269
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:16,767
Hulk is like

1270
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:21,375
You will get to keep your gun no matter the f*** won unless you're in an ambulance

1271
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:33,407
That's not good that's that might be a little overcorrecting

1272
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,431
Jordan

1273
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,967
2009 listings

1274
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,735
Alex

1275
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:40,063
Fear about the idea that the federal government is going to use disasters

1276
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,855
After Hurricane

1277
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,903
Because the NRA propaganda

1278
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,183
And what they were doing

1279
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,231
The federal government made a code

1280
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,511
Can't do that

1281
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,535
You can't take guns

1282
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,559
From anybody

1283
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,863
At no Federal Officer working at

1284
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,399
Capacity

1285
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,167
Can take

1286
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,959
Done during an emergency

1287
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:58,239
Free because of the emerging

1288
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,055
It's right there in the federal code

1289
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:03,871
Alex Jones is going to use a federal code that he rattles off

1290
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:09,503
That's Justice real you dickweed

1291
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,807
That's the same Federal code to they can't

1292
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,599
You can't do it

1293
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:17,695
Now the other thing I want to bring this up because it's one of the sort of like

1294
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,791
I believe that I think I've covered a lot of

1295
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,095
Why this narrative is b*******

1296
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,631
One more

1297
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,399
Decent

1298
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
And that is

1299
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,471
Is that one of them

1300
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,007
Millions

1301
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,287
Things that people

1302
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,567
In the government got wrong about

1303
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,615
But what

1304
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,639
Incredibly on 4th

1305
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,663
I think

1306
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,687
Because it leads

1307
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,551
Is that the evacuation was

1308
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,111
Evacuate

1309
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,671
Yeah and one of the reasons for that is

1310
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,951
Is because of the

1311
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:50,975
The fact that 80% of

1312
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,255
Underwater

1313
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,815
The fact that people were talking about how there was going to be

1314
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,095
Thousands

1315
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:56,863
The Dead

1316
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,143
Found in the water

1317
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:58,911
And that

1318
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,447
It was being had

1319
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,471
With straight

1320
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,239
Somber faced

1321
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,519
Very credible

1322
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:05,823
You know what it was

1323
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,127
I don't know how we don't have a death toll that

1324
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:08,895
Yeah

1325
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:09,663
You have that service

1326
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,431
Situation

1327
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,455
The possibility for

1328
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,223
Chemicals

1329
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,271
Dead bodies rotting water

1330
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,039
Stewie

1331
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,831
Massive Public Health crisis

1332
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,391
You need to clear your things out

1333
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,951
Yes we had a mandatory

1334
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,743
I think Mike

1335
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:24,767
Have been

1336
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:30,143
Not helpful necessarily the reason for it.

1337
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,679
Another reason too big

1338
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:32,959
Problem

1339
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,751
Is because there aren't any

1340
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:36,031
Concealed carry laws

1341
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:36,799
Indoor

1342
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:39,615
So if people are evacuating their homes

1343
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,455
If they bring their guns with them

1344
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,991
By virtue of them being out

1345
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,015
Public with his gun

1346
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:48,063
That is now an illegal gun

1347
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:50,879
I think that

1348
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,439
Some of these cops were already doing to motorist

1349
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:56,511
Before the storm

1350
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,279
Entrapment

1351
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:58,559
To take some

1352
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,583
Yeah

1353
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:02,143
I don't like I said

1354
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,447
People's guns without cause

1355
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,471
B

1356
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,775
Just say it was about the storm

1357
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:09,567
National Guard federal troops

1358
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:12,127
Is missing the forest for the trees in terms of

1359
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:12,895
The story

1360
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:13,919
And that's all I have.

1361
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:22,623
Alex is not afraid of government overreach because he's only really afraid

1362
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,903
Date of government overreach

1363
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:27,999
Before they come to treating white people the way that we always treat

1364
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,559
Tattoo

1365
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,583
If you can't

1366
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,863
Claims that it

1367
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,399
Such a thrill

1368
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,751
What we do

1369
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,287
To minorities

1370
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,311
Is wrong

1371
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,847
Because if it happen

1372
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,919
In even the slightest capacity

1373
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:48,223
I will lose my f****** my

1374
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,271
You're so mean

1375
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,039
You are

1376
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,855
Fine with this level of Mystery

1377
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,671
If it happens to anyone who looks like me and I

1378
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,207
I feel bonded with

1379
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:02,047
Then I will create an entire world government

1380
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,095
In order to jump

1381
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:04,863
Spotify White

1382
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,631
Is wrong

1383
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,167
When I don't give a s*** if it's

1384
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:11,519
Anaheim

1385
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,287
Stealing this

1386
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,103
Every

1387
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:15,871
Phasers

1388
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,895
Every black

1389
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,175
Person

1390
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,223
Every Muslim person

1391
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,015
Everyone who is 91

1392
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,063
Registers

1393
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,343
Advise a gun

1394
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,671
And the NRA will explode like an overinflated balloon

1395
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:31,231
Royal Star Trek rules

1396
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,279
They didn't you know they don't

1397
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:34,815
I just didn't like the

1398
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:43,263
Might you know what else they might take care of themselves

1399
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,311
Stories about how they're not make

1400
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,103
The fold

1401
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,127
S*** like that

1402
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:54,783
Edward are still probably about Evergreen Drive

1403
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,343
Yeah that's

1404
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:03,231
I've said my piece about Hurricane Katrina I don't think I've covered all of the bases

1405
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,767
Irrelevant

1406
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:05,791
To Alex's narrative

1407
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,071
He's a liar

1408
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:10,399
I think we have a pretty good job

1409
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:14,751
Christ but now we get back to this interview with Greg hapgood

1410
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,543
Who I actually looked into him

1411
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,359
I don't know it's boring

1412
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,663
Except the articles that I was able to find actually

1413
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:22,943
Retired this year

1414
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:28,319
Hurricane Harvey

1415
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:31,391
And now I'm Houston

1416
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,671
From the Iowa

1417
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:35,743
National Guard out to help with the hurricane Maria

1418
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,023
Out in Puerto Rico

1419
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,583
He's been doing this forever

1420
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,143
I don't know that

1421
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,383
Just hit of his narrative

1422
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,431
BisMan

1423
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,199
Clinch

1424
01:05:55,711 --> 01:06:01,855
Martial law

1425
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:14,911
Images

1426
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,335
Anna population

1427
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:32,319
All I can tell you is what our intent is in our antennas provide prepared soldiers so they're ready to go

1428
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:35,647
When it comes time for time for them to go someplace very dangerous

1429
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,975
For them to not only do the mission successfully

1430
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:42,815
Survive and come home and their families those are the things that we doing what we see

1431
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:54,079
That's a different place we're talking about Iowa here another one

1432
01:06:57,151 --> 01:07:03,295
I was just trying to move the goalposts and talk about

1433
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,831
Off the Record

1434
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:09,695
That guy can go by himself sure not ideal but Lego

1435
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:16,095
F*** yourself later the National Guard

1436
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:17,887
Doesn't

1437
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:21,471
Interview from February to

1438
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,239
20th

1439
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,543
I got to be fair

1440
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,079
Let's play the end of it cuz maybe

1441
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:32,479
Certainly again

1442
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:34,783
We absolutely believe in the Constitution

1443
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,319
And are you won't find

1444
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,367
Better Patriots and people in the National Guard

1445
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:49,887
Freedom

1446
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:55,775
Is what we do here in Iowa and what we see in our operations

1447
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,823
For instance we were just asked

1448
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,127
To take part in operation Washington DC

1449
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:03,711
Our job there was to help me keep sure people got in the right places

1450
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:08,831
Make sure the people are safe and those are the kinds of missions that were generally asked to do

1451
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:15,999
Searching people's bags

1452
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:21,119
No I didn't say that in fact it what I can tell you about the Iowa National Guard is were generally

1453
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,423
Interstate status on operation

1454
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:27,775
Unless of course were deployed for war thing we being a federal status but generally

1455
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:30,079
We're going to work here in the United States somewhere

1456
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:36,479
Generally on a state status of some kind which is

1457
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:43,903
But we actually have gotten the number phone calls about this and refreshing summer that is once people find

1458
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:47,999
At the actual mission is about replicating training

1459
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,279
So we can go to war

1460
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:55,679
Then Thunder okay with that

1461
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:08,479
Martial law FEMA camps

1462
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:17,439
Thanks for your opportunity

1463
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,255
Wow

1464
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,023
That is a

1465
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,559
Dick

1466
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:27,167
That's unbelievable

1467
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:31,007
Next level

1468
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:34,079
He spent like a half-hour talking to him and

1469
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,199
Dungeon New Orleans

1470
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,223
When

1471
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,759
Airbnb

1472
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:42,783
Nope

1473
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:49,439
Can I respect your analysis and all of the evidence that you have shown here but I'm going to have to tell you that

1474
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:53,791
You're wrong you lied about everything and you're the enemy

1475
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:59,167
You have

1476
01:09:59,423 --> 01:09:59,935
R36

1477
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:03,519
Years

1478
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:09,919
You shut your f****** mouth dumbass

1479
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:16,575
Yeah mainly because you're mainly cuz you're a f****** a****** and I hate you and I'm coming

1480
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,343
On your show

1481
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,647
To make sure that the people who would call us

1482
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,415
Who are called

1483
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,207
Shut the fuk up

1484
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:28,607
And you're an a****** I'm reaching out because I know that you're dangerous

1485
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:32,703
Actually going on

1486
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,983
You're wrong

1487
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,263
You're a betrayer

1488
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:36,799
Crazy

1489
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:39,103
That's an interesting interesting question

1490
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,639
Now to me

1491
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:41,407
Is

1492
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:47,039
So he goes so ostensibly what is that lieutenant colonel

1493
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:54,463
The entire way

1494
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,743
Public Outreach

1495
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,279
Part of the National Guard

1496
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,047
Jesus

1497
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:02,655
He's a PR guy for the most part at this point

1498
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,423
1580

1499
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,519
New Years or whatever like on the ground in the National Guard

1500
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:08,543
Your position

1501
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,847
So that's why you so boring and

1502
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:14,431
Answers that are like

1503
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:19,039
What I can talk about is what Iowa does what we do in Iowa

1504
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:19,807
But that's why

1505
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:22,879
Cuz that's the only thing I know about

1506
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,695
Classy

1507
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:26,975
Because it would be very easy

1508
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,535
Like fight back with Alex playing

1509
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,071
He knows it's pointless

1510
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,351
You could hang up

1511
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:36,703
Use that is some sort of evidence that he's afraid of my question right

1512
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,007
He does the only thing you can do witches like

1513
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,031
No

1514
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:40,799
Look

1515
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:42,335
You're talk about federalized out

1516
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:43,615
You do realize that

1517
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:46,687
The book the role of the National Guard does have a federal application

1518
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,455
Insert

1519
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:50,783
Circumstances but generally were under the authority of the governor of

1520
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:57,183
The no-win situation God bless him for trying

1521
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:00,255
That's the question there is it so for him

1522
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,791
His motivation

1523
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,119
Is

1524
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,143
He wants to

1525
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:12,287
Like preamps all of these f****** phone calls like he's got enough phone calls now

1526
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:18,687
Is spreading this b******* around

1527
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,735
The end of the phone call they're usually like

1528
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:21,759
Okay

1529
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:25,087
Actually you know what you're a reasonable guy in that makes a lot of sense

1530
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,623
Cool dude

1531
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:27,903
So he's thinking

1532
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:34,303
Maybe if I go on Alex's show

1533
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,607
Once

1534
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:43,007
MMA go on the train like a into his bye

1535
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:46,847
Rational human

1536
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:49,663
Come back he's a bad example of a rational human

1537
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,719
David Lynch.

1538
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,487
You come back

1539
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:12,703
I thought that's what I thought this would be a conversation it was not there was

1540
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:17,311
Just recently in 2018 that Senator Matt gaetz

1541
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:19,103
Roulette congressperson iroc-z

1542
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,431
But he went on

1543
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,455
And then people will like

1544
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,735
Yeah

1545
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:28,831
I ate that was a mistake I was not going to do that again

1546
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:31,647
I shouldn't have done that

1547
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,415
I think that

1548
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,439
Even you know

1549
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:36,255
People get the message

1550
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,327
That's it that's an interesting

1551
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:41,631
What you want

1552
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:43,679
So now you have to ask yourself the question

1553
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,959
Is it

1554
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:49,567
More important that everybody is aware of Alex in order to beware

1555
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:52,383
No one should know

1556
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:55,455
Or like because we

1557
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,479
Situation

1558
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:59,295
People go on Alex's show expecting a good-faith

1559
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,575
Sprite

1560
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,879
And then they wind up getting their ass

1561
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:05,439
Is dunked on because Alex is a f****** lunatic

1562
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:10,303
So you only lend your credibility

1563
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:13,887
To Alex's show no one knowing would be great but I don't think

1564
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:17,471
Possible thing that I think is appropriate

1565
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,263
Is people being aware of him

1566
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:21,311
Be wary

1567
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:25,407
But you have to play his game a little bit even if you're outside of it and

1568
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:26,943
Because

1569
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:27,967
There are critics

1570
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:31,039
He makes that are valid of cover him

1571
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:33,855
Like the idea that they don't play the clips of

1572
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:35,135
Give me saying xyr

1573
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:37,183
Yeah like we talked about in the past like

1574
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,719
Brian stelter doesn't have time

1575
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,487
Play all York

1576
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:43,583
So he's going to make broad generalizations

1577
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:45,375
But you can attack him by saying

1578
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,399
He didn't play the clip

1579
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:49,215
Right-eo like ours I think it's super important

1580
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:51,263
Cuz then you can be wary of him

1581
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,615
I know what you said

1582
01:14:57,663 --> 01:15:01,247
I don't know I don't want to shoot our own horn but

1583
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,015
The void that we

1584
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,575
We can feel incredibly well

1585
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:08,415
So that's why it's real solution to Alex Jones

1586
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,719
Is for everyone to know who we are

1587
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,255
It would help

1588
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:16,863
Even if not everybody listen to our show necessarily

1589
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,911
But just knowing that has a resource

1590
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,263
Is there

1591
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,543
I think it helps

1592
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:26,079
Because

1593
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,103
Go to Brian

1594
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:28,895
Get

1595
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:30,431
Breakdowns of whyalla

1596
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,527
Posted on Media Matters are just

1597
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,295
Clips

1598
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,087
Script of it

1599
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:40,415
Of something inflammatory doesn't necessarily breakdown

1600
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,951
Why this is crazy

1601
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,999
It's just crazy on its face

1602
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,791
Right

1603
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:46,815
To some extent by

1604
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:53,727
I don't know we need every article about Alex Jones to end with a little end for confirmation

1605
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:58,847
Sources cited

1606
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,127
Should just be us

1607
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:04,991
I need cuz I don't

1608
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:08,319
Expect you to do this I need a much more robust database

1609
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,343
Of the things that we

1610
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,367
We've covered about him

1611
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,391
With a lot of the

1612
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:18,047
So people don't have to just go to the episode

1613
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:21,119
Like right-wing Watcher or Media Matters is something to do that

1614
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:21,887
Then

1615
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:24,191
F*** yeah you should do it until then

1616
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,471
I wouldn't do for

1617
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:29,055
I wouldn't do it for free

1618
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:33,407
I'm not sure that's good

1619
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:40,319
23rd now

1620
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:43,647
With this interview with good who did not cry out

1621
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:44,927
Lying about that

1622
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,463
He was a classy gentleman

1623
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,743
And now we get back to

1624
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,767
To the 23rd

1625
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,815
Alex is back on his b*******

1626
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:53,631
Trying to make you super scared

1627
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:55,679
Wow he's trying to make you super scared

1628
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:57,727
He's trying to build in a backdoor

1629
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,263
Cuz he knows that all the things

1630
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,287
Making you afraid about

1631
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,055
Aren't going

1632
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:17,183
You try to drag me off the back of a flatbed truck like

1633
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:20,255
Okay

1634
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:25,631
Back off

1635
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,911
Sister cells

1636
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:36,383
It was a bad recession

1637
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:45,599
This is a cowardly way Alex

1638
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,623
Presents most of

1639
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:47,903
Fear-based narrative

1640
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:50,463
He's making it much more overt

1641
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,511
When usually does but it is

1642
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:55,583
If we do something again by fear won't come

1643
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:03,775
We're going to bounce back from the crash that happened

1644
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:10,431
I know that it things are going to normalize and we're going to be okay

1645
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:14,015
Was it manufactured event

1646
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:21,439
You know it's because we stopped it right

1647
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:23,743
It definitely isn't that it was just a bad reception

1648
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,023
It's caused by

1649
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,559
20 years of

1650
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:32,959
Terrible f****** management after the deregulation of confirming propaganda which is

1651
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:33,983
Dangerous

1652
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,007
Because if you're dumb

1653
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:41,919
Okay well with no matter what outcome Alex gets

1654
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:44,223
2%

1655
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,247
It's basically just

1656
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:49,087
Exporting types of three-card Monte game that he's playing with his eye

1657
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:51,135
Yes where the queen is all the time

1658
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:51,903
He's f******

1659
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:55,999
Please Google you will meet a stranger wearing red shoes

1660
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,279
He might as well just be

1661
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:02,143
You're you're somebody who likes to go out alot

1662
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:07,007
But sometimes

1663
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,055
Stupid

1664
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:09,823
I went to a fortune

1665
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,615
Tyler Watts

1666
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:13,151
Yeah I got taken

1667
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:13,919
A ride

1668
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:20,319
Was it like the price

1669
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,855
More than one

1670
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:23,647
Pure to be advertised

1671
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:25,951
40 boxes

1672
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,231
Cuz your fortune

1673
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,767
No it was

1674
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:30,815
The Vegas pile of s*** I've ever seen

1675
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:34,143
Your life

1676
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:34,911
Is going to go

1677
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,471
But they're very old

1678
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:45,151
I thought this was a cliche

1679
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,967
Made fun of for kids

1680
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:48,735
Entire experience

1681
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:50,527
Is this is really disappointing

1682
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,063
Did you vomit ectoplasm

1683
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,111
I'm not but

1684
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:56,927
Okay that's good that was just

1685
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,719
What is cheesecloth

1686
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:00,255
Cheesecloth is fog made of

1687
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:02,303
Think that's

1688
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:04,095
True & Yeti

1689
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:07,423
I really porous cloth

1690
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:12,287
Do some research on your own time

1691
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:13,055
I just can't

1692
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:15,104
9

1693
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:16,896
Is on

1694
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:18,944
Thanks that was bad

1695
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:24,576
Lost Mike collector

1696
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:25,856
It is on our plate

1697
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:26,624
Ready

1698
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,648
To be devoured

1699
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:29,952
So what's going on in the world in 2009 is

1700
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:31,744
Is so foreign to current-day

1701
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,024
Because Glenn Baxter

1702
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,656
Like right looked at by right-thinking people it's kind of a goof

1703
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:43,520
A fall from grace

1704
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,824
But he has now wherever one

1705
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,176
He still had a big fan base

1706
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:52,224
And he was the Golden Boy

1707
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,552
What Alex

1708
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,576
View the zodian

1709
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:59,648
Did you have people like Sean Hannity

1710
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:02,464
And Rush Limbaugh for Mainline

1711
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,768
Republican rate surfeited Folk

1712
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,072
Radiohead Glenn Beck coming in

1713
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,096
With not the

1714
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:09,888
The same sort of libertarian

1715
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:11,424
Jewelry that Alex has

1716
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:13,472
But he had much more of a

1717
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,496
Corner of the market

1718
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:15,520
That was

1719
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:17,824
Not the same as a Hannity or

1720
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,408
Like the Neal Boortz

1721
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,712
Which doesn't mean anything to you I just left

1722
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:25,760
No idea who kneeled

1723
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:30,112
Are you in a black sidekick

1724
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,136
Kik name to Royal

1725
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:32,160
What

1726
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:33,440
Royals pretty cool

1727
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,464
What

1728
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:37,024
I wait what I love the Neal Boortz program

1729
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,096
But you was also a Wii

1730
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,680
Hey what are you talking about the Lone Ranger

1731
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:44,448
No

1732
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,288
Neal Boortz

1733
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,824
I used to when I

1734
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,664
We spent like ordering some

1735
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,432
Supplies

1736
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:57,504
Scheduling

1737
01:21:58,528 --> 01:21:59,040
You know planning

1738
01:21:59,296 --> 01:21:59,808
The schedule

1739
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,088
What theater

1740
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,368
Movies would be in

1741
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:03,648
Making schedules

1742
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,416
For the employees

1743
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:06,720
Doing payroll

1744
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,488
Balancing

1745
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:08,512
Drawers

1746
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,280
Estate

1747
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:11,072
Stuff like that

1748
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:11,840
Give me office

1749
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:12,864
Large portion

1750
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:13,632
Ends of the day

1751
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,400
When I was

1752
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,216
Responsibilities

1753
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,800
On the floor Ministry

1754
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:23,360
And so I would end up being there

1755
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:25,152
Close the movie theater it like

1756
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:25,920
2 in the morning

1757
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:26,944
Life movie start

1758
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,712
At midnight

1759
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,736
You end up getting out of there

1760
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,528
Hey by the time

1761
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,808
About like 10

1762
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,576
There's not

1763
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,344
That much

1764
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,112
To do a lot of

1765
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:34,880
All the time except

1766
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:36,928
Make sure everything's running smoothly.

1767
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:40,000
I'll be back in the office and I just listen

1768
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,024
Times Arkansas

1769
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:44,352
I would listen to

1770
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,120
Eagle

1771
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:46,400
And they had Glenn

1772
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,424
I'm back of the head

1773
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:48,960
Eminem

1774
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,264
Would have

1775
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,544
Neal Boortz

1776
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:54,080
And then they'd have

1777
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:57,408
Is really awesome

1778
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,176
Phil Hendrie

1779
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:01,504
He wasn't a conservative but I don't know what he was doing on this station

1780
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:03,296
You know Phil Hendrie

1781
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:04,576
I've heard that name before

1782
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:06,112
The hit show was that

1783
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:07,136
What do you do

1784
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:08,160
Is he word

1785
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:10,464
Have an interview with a fake person

1786
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,768
He was doing that voice to

1787
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,816
He was doing

1788
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:21,216
No actually I do know this because

1789
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:30,944
Okay will look into Joe Frank and I'll look more

1790
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:34,528
Callers

1791
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,552
Or he's on interview

1792
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,320
Use would be

1793
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,088
Himself

1794
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,648
The straight man host

1795
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:43,744
Wacky interview subject to say something f****** inflammatory

1796
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,560
I bet you would take calls and be both characters

1797
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,864
If you would

1798
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,912
And those people

1799
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:56,544
Really and think about to go to my life I don't know what

1800
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,336
I guess that's probably the you like

1801
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:02,176
Marketing model

1802
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:04,224
With Ted's of Beverly Hills

1803
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,040
Well that's his restaurant

1804
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:10,624
Beverly Hills

1805
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:16,000
He's like his real guy I like a restaurant him on it was

1806
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:18,304
Closed after 9/11

1807
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,072
It was

1808
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:20,608
Not far after

1809
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:21,888
Have been within a month

1810
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:23,936
Keep coming on

1811
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,216
And he's like

1812
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:30,336
Pittsfield

1813
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,104
To have

1814
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,896
The World Trade Center rebuilt

1815
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,176
I'll take care of all of it

1816
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:35,456
I'll take care of all the

1817
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:37,504
Don't worry about it I'm very rich man

1818
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:38,784
I'd like to help out the

1819
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,576
I'll pay for it all

1820
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:41,600
But there's one condition

1821
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,904
And that is what I need there to be plaque

1822
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,696
At the base of the new towers

1823
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,744
The names of everyone who died

1824
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,792
At Dayton Memorial eyes.

1825
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,072
Everybody said

1826
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:53,632
My daily special

1827
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,336
I love that so much.

1828
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:08,736
Brilliant

1829
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:15,904
Brilliant like it's the best kind of creative trolling

1830
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,184
Side listen to that

1831
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,232
Coasttocoastam.com on

1832
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:23,328
Because

1833
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:25,888
Coast-to-Coast which are palatable shows

1834
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:26,912
I ended up listen

1835
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:29,728
That station born

1836
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:32,032
Yeah I know about him

1837
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,848
At that time

1838
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:36,896
Going back with irrelevant

1839
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,944
And I think that Alex Jones

1840
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,968
Is a little bit jealous

1841
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:40,992
Because

1842
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:43,296
He's being much more successful

1843
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:48,672
Towards the end of this episode here on February

1844
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:51,232
Alex has a clip of Glenn Beck's video

1845
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:52,512
Particularly

1846
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,048
Decides to play it

1847
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,328
Ione

1848
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,096
Wanted

1849
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:58,912
We're going to listen to a little bit of the Glenn back portion

1850
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,448
But I think it's

1851
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,472
Alex

1852
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:02,496
Response

1853
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:03,520
The end of it

1854
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,824
That's much more Talent

1855
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,616
I believe it's really interesting

1856
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:09,152
You're going back to sound like

1857
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,688
Future Alex Jones

1858
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:12,736
As opposed to Alex's narrative

1859
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:13,504
Where you like

1860
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,784
Glenn Beck is always ripping

1861
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,064
Right

1862
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,600
See if you can tell what I'm

1863
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:25,280
That's tied into what would happen

1864
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:30,400
Muslim extremist

1865
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:33,984
America

1866
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:37,056
Deal with it

1867
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:44,480
Very important

1868
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:49,088
Classroom

1869
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:51,648
And what you have in Western Europe

1870
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:58,048
Is there no longer going to be able to be embarrassed

1871
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:19,040
Twisting

1872
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:28,512
Gas was

1873
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:39,008
Insider trading

1874
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:41,568
Financial collapse

1875
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:50,272
In the USA

1876
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:56,672
Operation

1877
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:03,584
Wild

1878
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,632
That is wild his Wild

1879
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:11,264
Answer my new operating thesis based on special

1880
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:14,336
And based on Alex's thing or just traffic is

1881
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:16,896
Is he's going to get

1882
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,968
His ego is going to get the better of him

1883
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,248
And when he sees

1884
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,272
Glenn Beck

1885
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:24,064
Becoming the figure of

1886
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:24,832
The Tea Party

1887
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:26,624
He's not going to be able to stand it

1888
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:27,904
He hates Glenn Beck

1889
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,696
He's going to start adopting some of

1890
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:30,720
The things

1891
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:32,000
Just putting out to the world

1892
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:33,024
A little bit more

1893
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,816
Such as

1894
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,864
I'm at that we heard there that is not

1895
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,656
Super persistent

1896
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:40,448
In Alex Jones in 2009

1897
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,984
I still think he's a bigot

1898
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:45,056
2009

1899
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,336
Particular hatred

1900
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:47,360
Distrusted Muslim

1901
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,896
Is not as

1902
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:51,456
Focused as just even that Glenn's clip was

1903
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:52,992
It's wild

1904
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:54,784
Why is it

1905
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,624
Sometimes Alex in 2009

1906
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,904
Sounds like me now

1907
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:03,232
7 years am I going to sound like Alex now

1908
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,512
Is that how that works

1909
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,560
What happens

1910
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:12,960
No I don't think people like us

1911
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:15,520
The first season of The Wire but we're not characters

1912
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:18,592
Yet you're not okay okay

1913
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:24,992
Spoiler alert in the last season of The Wire everyone takes over the roles of the mantle

1914
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:29,600
Becomes the new bubbles Michael Padilla.

1915
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,536
Parking lot

1916
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:39,584
Marlowe is a different character

1917
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:44,192
Alright alright alright you have that generational

1918
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:45,728
There must be one

1919
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,288
And it is interesting and fun to think about like

1920
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,080
Your future

1921
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:52,384
Maybe you become the next Alex Jones

1922
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,664
Man that'd be fun

1923
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:59,552
Like Alex Jones back then was crazy

1924
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,112
2

1925
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,904
F****** somehow

1926
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:15,680
But you only after that because he hates

1927
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,704
Glenn Beck

1928
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:18,240
Think it's not like that

1929
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:19,776
Genuine person

1930
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,568
Contradict

1931
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:24,128
Very soon narrative

1932
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:29,504
Well he will believe soon I'm right about everything is because I

1933
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,576
Guys who knows what I'll think

1934
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:38,208
Picture

1935
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,024
24th to be

1936
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,048
Berkeley honest

1937
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,864
Just get it done with

1938
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,400
Cuz we need to move through this

1939
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:52,288
Because of things to keep happening

1940
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:58,688
I really hope you'll be there already but

1941
01:30:58,944 --> 01:30:59,968
Covid-19 we made it through like

1942
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:04,064
Metro

1943
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,392
Has a new thing he wants to scare people about

1944
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:08,160
It's not new

1945
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:10,464
The episode today

1946
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:11,744
And that is

1947
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,768
The public schools

1948
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:13,792
Are going to kill you

1949
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:24,288
The police

1950
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:27,360
Let me call before a judge

1951
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:37,856
A contract

1952
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:44,512
And then Federal

1953
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,752
Thousand dollars

1954
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:55,776
Million

1957
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:02,688
Legal probation

1958
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:03,712
That's exactly

1959
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:07,808
April teale

1960
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:13,696

Go to prison

1962
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,864
The teacher left the room I am officer of the Court

1963
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:26,240
But then Alex gets into something that would

1964
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:28,800
Coming out in the news at that time that is very real

1965
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:38,272

1969
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:10,016
Unshackled

1970
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,256
Like the class three times

1971
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:22,048

1973
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,888
Red flag right there

1974
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:27,424
Well it's incredible

1975
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:33,824
Scroll down far enough on the page

1976
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:38,176
But a fifteen-year-old

1977
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,528
Principal on her Myspace page

1986
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:57,632
Steal DVDs from Walmart

What

1998
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:18,624
Which is really

1999
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:21,184
Bop version of the prison industry as a whole

2000
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,488
Not okay but the outrageous

2001
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:25,024
You feel when it's being done to children

2002
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,328
Also apply when it's being done to it.

2003
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:32,448
Do you received money from people

2004
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:34,240
Juvenile Detention

2006
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:41,408
Sociopathic

2007
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:42,176
That's all I'm saying

2008
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:44,480
I thought maybe we should have a second

2009
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:47,808
Maybe Jon Ronson should interview every judge before they take

2010
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:52,928
Guy ferrelli

2011
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:55,488
Who started the main focus of the day

2012
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,584
Taking illegal payments

2013
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,120
The nearly $1000000

2014
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:02,144
From the youth center

2015
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,168
Pinhead

2016
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:03,936
The hit the

2017
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:06,752
Pirelli was sentenced

2018
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:07,520
28 years

2019
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:08,288
Federal Prison

2020
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:10,080
Because there was not long enough

2021
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:13,152
Long enough

2022
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,176
And the other guy was sentenced

2023
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:14,944
Dude I believe so

2024
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:16,992
Years because he played

2025
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,064
So the issue is

2026
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,624
This to a lot of

2027
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:25,696
Are up to

2028
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,464
5 South

2029
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,232
Converso

2030
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:34,912
The key is not

2031
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:35,680
Because of

2032
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:38,240
Finding out about this

2033
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:39,520
The trials and everything

2034
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:40,544
Is that they

2035
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,080
Just vacated all of the sudden

2036
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:43,360
Is that they had a

2037
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,896
Issued over

2038
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:51,296
Want a lot of money

2039
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:57,696
Imagine the damage that was done

2040
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:00,768
Suicide

2041
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:03,840
On

2042
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:07,680
What's the right word

2043
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,472
You can't

2044
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:10,752
Power know you can

2045
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:17,152
You giving a reversible

2046
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:19,200
The sort of the sort of damage that

2047
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,992
It's just like impossible to undo

2048
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:23,296
Is there a very awful

2049
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:28,160
Which is like what how many people in Rikers Island who are waiting on like

2050
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:30,208
3 years for a single f******

2051
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:35,840
Trial like they're the right to a fair and speedy trial is gone

2052
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:38,656
Yeah real big problem

2053
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:42,752
The phenomenon of incarcerating an institutionalizing children is not some

2054
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:43,776
New Norris

2055
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:44,544
Something unique to this

2056
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:45,824
Pennsylvania

2057
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,360
It's notable because there's a

2058
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:49,152
Clear quid pro quo

2059
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:50,432
Is clearly receive payments

2060
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:52,224
Spilled private room

2061
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:53,248
The issue

2062
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:54,784
As it always is with Alex

2063
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:55,552
Cuz narrative

2064
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:57,600
According to

2065
01:36:57,856 --> 01:37:01,184
To the sentencing project nationally the youth rate of incarceration

2066
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:02,464
152

2067
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,000
100000

2068
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,560
Bluetooth placement rate

2069
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:09,632
What's 433 / 100,000

2070
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:11,936
When compared to a white youth placement rate of

2071
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:12,704
6 / 10

2072
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:14,752
Overall the racial

2073
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:16,288
Disparity between black and white

2074
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:17,056
In custody in

2075
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:17,824
22

2076
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:19,616
Since 2001

2077
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:23,456
5 times more likely to be incarcerated

2078
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:27,808
And this is something that goes on in pretty much every state with no charismatic proper

2079
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:29,088
Ganda screaming about how it's a

2080
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,624
The globalist attempt to break up the

2081
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:34,976
Alex doesn't care about that he cares about the case

2082
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:35,744
In Pennsylvania

2083
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:38,816
And it may be because it's in the news and he's lazy

2084
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:41,632
It's just an easy thing for him to talk about but I would suggest

2085
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:42,400
Something else

2086
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,424
More relevant to him

2087
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:46,752
Namely that the judge the city he was in Wilkes

2088
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:49,568
Is 92.3% white

2089
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:51,872
The county Luzerne County

2090
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,664
96.6

2091
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,688
Percent White

2092
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:57,504
So this judge was doing it to white people and that's why it's

2093
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:02,368
But it's also why Alex cares about

2094
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,952
As is always the case that exceeds not care about the problem at all

2095
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:08,768
Until he feels attorney white people

2096
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:10,048
Bloody murder about it

2097
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,328
I never recognized as a

2098
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,096
Black activist

2099
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:15,424
Impune

2100
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,704
Have been trying to draw tension

2101
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,728
Problems

2102
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:19,520
Gears insurance

2103
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:22,080
Anyway I would say Alex Jones

2104
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:23,616
Is a gigantic

2105
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,408
Yep

2106
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:31,040
So no disagreement America is a giant

2107
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:34,624
I don't disagree with that house there multiple narrative

2108
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,952
Is on this episode that he's going through it all

2109
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:41,024
Intertwine with this same business line of like

2110
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:42,560
They're doing it to White

2111
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:45,376
Whatever it is the gun confiscation in

2112
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:47,168
Katrina that's that same thing

2113
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,192
This

2114
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:49,984
You know kids being

2115
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,520
Detention centers

2116
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:52,800
Because it's profitable

2117
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:55,616
This is the same thing you don't care until it affects

2118
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:56,640
His own

2119
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:58,944
This is such a parallel to

2120
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:00,992
To right now

2121
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:01,760
Like

2122
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:03,296
The idea of

2123
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:08,160
People being angry is released

2124
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:09,696
Omarosa

2125
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:13,280
Omarosa

2126
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,352
Yeah

2127
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:18,144
He's still

2128
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:22,496
It doesn't even f****** matter if he does or does not have an n-word tape

2129
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:24,032
He's got most races

2130
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:27,616
Like because of s*** like this because of this kind of like

2131
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:28,640
Obvious

2132
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:29,664
Racism

2133
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:34,528
Why people would give a s*** if he says the N word is like

2134
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:39,648
Why would you give a s*** if somebody owned slaves but never said the n-word their awnings

2135
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:40,928
Slaves is the issue

2136
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:41,952
Isolved

2137
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:42,720
Interesting

2138
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:44,000
Take on it I guess

2139
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,536
Hate to bring up

2140
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:50,656
I don't like text but

2141
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:52,960
Argument

2142
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:54,752
Because the media is so f****** lazy

2143
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:56,544
And won't do their job

2144
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,080
The idea that there is

2145
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:01,408
To come out before

2146
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,176
2

2147
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,456
Be like Trump

2148
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:08,832
To cover it that way because they're so reductive and can only calls

2149
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:14,464
Media into a box

2150
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:15,488
Where they

2151
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:16,768
Couldn't do this

2152
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:20,352
Dance around

2153
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:23,680
That that's one benefit but other than that

2154
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:25,472
Doesn't matter at all

2155
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,520
The proof of the pudding is in the eating

2156
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:28,800
Yeah

2157
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:31,872
Everything they do is

2158
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:32,640
White National

2159
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:39,296
An arm of the KKK

2160
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:43,648
At this point what are you

2161
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:45,440
To make it even

2162
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:47,232
More clear to what we talked about

2163
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,512
This show

2164
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:49,792
The argument that Alex

2165
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:50,816
She's gotten worse

2166
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:52,352
Absolutely you've gotten worse

2167
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:53,632
This is always been

2168
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:56,448
At least a decade

2169
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:57,984
He cares about is

2170
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:01,312
They're going to do

2171
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:05,152
Your response

2172
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,432
Family Court

2173
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,344
We didn't have them

2174
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:18,976
Earlier

2175
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:23,072
Racial hygiene courts

2176
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:27,168
The rack Warehouse rental apartments

2177
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:29,984
Kill you

2178
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:34,080
We did

2179
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:36,384
Newsreel clips

2180
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:40,480
Go back to our coverage of any more information about that

2181
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:53,024
I think they're like now that Alex is wrapped up in Family Court

2182
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:56,096
It seems relevant

2183
01:41:56,352 --> 01:42:01,984
That would maybe you could have put in there if you want to play then for the judge

2184
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:05,312
You're not the lotto

2185
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:10,432
But God dammit event is Mister Jones

2186
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:11,200
Kill you

2187
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:15,296
You can't play the tape

2188
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:18,624
I'm going to have to call Dan Friesen to the sand

2189
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:23,232
Who have brought a boombox

2190
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:24,768
Because you are from the

2191
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:26,560
80s apparently but go ahead and

2192
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:27,840
Play what you have to say

2193
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:34,240
Eddie Bauer

2194
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:37,824
Is gross

2195
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:41,408
I don't know why I

2196
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:49,088
A year in jail and then you read what happened to these kids some of them died in custody others come out

2197
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,680
Shock therapy

2198
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:09,056
They thrown out on the street

2199
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:12,640
Workforce

2200
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:15,456
Your story

2201
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:18,272
Tower 12 I got the fish fight

2202
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:35,424
I know I'm crazy I deserve it they shocked me over and over again

2203
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:40,800
Let me guess

2204
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:47,456
That's your sickening degenerate

2205
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:50,784
Family court is to blame for all the homeless

2206
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:54,880
He wants to make a documentary about these

2207
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:56,416
People is to use them as a prop

2208
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:58,208
So what he is f******

2209
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:02,816
When applied to the healthcare and just

2210
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:05,632
This system is a fundamentally exploit

2211
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:12,032
Dualism is the f****** problem

2212
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:18,432
Everybody f****** makes money off of all of this

2213
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:21,760
Why are you making my argument for ready

2214
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:26,624
F****** idiot

2215
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:30,208
At the same time I track

2216
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:32,512
Like I don't think of that

2217
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:34,560
I don't think the victims' family

2218
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:35,840
Court or necessarily

2219
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:36,864
Because

2220
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,400
Most of the homeless

2221
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:45,312
Follow his f****** argument

2222
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:49,920
All about profit-driven even even if you is right

2223
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:50,944
Exactly

2224
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:56,576
Even if you going to be right or wrong you're talking about

2225
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:02,208
Why are people black

2226
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:04,768
Existing like him

2227
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:06,048
I don't know it's wild

2228
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,864
You're so f****** stupid

2229
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:09,632
Yep

2230
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:11,680
Another version

2231
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:13,216
Is a color that is

2232
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:13,984
Gets here on the 20

2233
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:18,080
This list off what you would

2234
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:18,848
Described as

2235
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,128
The big globalist

2236
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:22,432
Missing from this list

2237
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:25,248
I think

2238
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,016
DuPont

2239
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:27,040
The Rothschilds

2240
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,368
The royal family in England

2241
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:35,488
Royal family with Dutch Shell

2242
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,048
How about Bugatti

2243
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:41,888
Including outdoor what is the biggest shareholders Knox

2244
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:42,656
Petroleum

2245
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:46,240
200

2246
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,008
To the lab

2247
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,800
70-year can rates

2248
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:50,080
The world cost

2249
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:50,848
These problem

2250
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:54,432
And they've been able to profit handsomely by that

2251
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:56,992
He's just a lot of that is just

2252
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:58,016
Just another College

2253
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:00,832
No Soros in there baby

2254
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:04,928
So up to this point still no mention of that guy

2255
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:06,464
No

2256
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,232
He's not in the game

2257
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:08,768
Why don't they ever

2258
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:10,048
Even then

2259
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:11,840
He added in oil come

2260
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:15,424
Even tertiarily through Al Gore

2261
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,312
Because it's such a part of Alex's

2262
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:25,152
He's mirroring back a lot about

2263
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:30,528
Yeah but you ain't if you even throw in one oil company

2264
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:31,552
You threw in all the

2265
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:32,320
The oil

2266
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:35,648
Like they're all f****** doing whatever it is you

2267
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:39,232
Rothschild

2268
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:40,768
The way you think

2269
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:42,560
They're just talking about

2270
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:43,840
Economics and taxes

2271
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:45,120
That's all they're talkin

2272
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:46,912
I'm still I'm still

2273
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,728
Alright fine

2274
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:52,032
Is Victoria

2275
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:53,056
Does not

2276
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:55,360
The conversation

2277
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:57,152
Need to check off the list

2278
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,456
I mean who knows we'll find out

2279
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,480
Who hates Taurus

2280
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:02,272
Vladimir Putin

2281
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:11,232
Concerns that I can off the internet is going to

2282
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:13,536
Somehow ruined our show or something like that

2283
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:15,840
Yeah don't worry about it

2284
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:20,960
2 years of episodes on my external hard drives that I have not listened to

2285
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:26,848
Front loading a lot of downloading plenty of stuff to go over

2286
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:29,152
Because I need to know

2287
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,944
In the same way that I

2288
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,736
Did to know what happened during

2289
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:33,504
The election

2290
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:37,344
I need to know when Soros

2291
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:43,488
Even if you turn into the next Alex Jones and leave the show

2292
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:46,048
I will keep doing it on my own until I figure out

2293
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,072
The f*** did he

2294
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:53,728
Start hating George Soros

2295
01:47:53,984 --> 01:48:00,128
Villain backstory the only thing that keeps me in check

2296
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,688
Like if I were let loose on my own

2297
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:04,736
I might just start claiming all kinds of s***

2298
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:11,392
I mean the sky's the limit

2299
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,952
Most of it would probably sound more Bass

2300
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:18,816
No cuz you do the same thing you just reference an article in the house

2301
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:27,776
Most of it

2302
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:32,640
Glenn Greenwald

2303
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:34,176
Still better service than the washing

2304
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:35,200
Mountain Time

2305
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:42,368
I'm wrapping up the show here

2306
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:43,392
Where to check in

2307
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:45,440
No Soros in the narratives yet

2308
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:46,720
We get

2309
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:48,256
This which I think is it

2310
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:49,280
Interesting

2311
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:50,560
Referral

2312
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:52,608
Revelation of where his head is at

2313
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:56,192
About how like

2314
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:57,728
You know I can't reinforcing Alex

2315
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,008
Faucet

2316
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:00,544
Espoused earlier about how he's

2317
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,104
Time is now

2318
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,640
John Cena politics

2319
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:08,224
Okay

2320
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:08,992
You deserve to be

2321
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:10,784
The biggest foxes ripping you off

2322
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:14,624
That sort of thing another 2 years that fox

2323
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,392
Foxwood start ripping

2324
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,696
More than that but

2325
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:19,232
We get to this Alex

2326
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:20,256
3 things

2327
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:22,560
About support

2328
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:24,096
Support that are very

2329
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:27,936
Let me bring it to across to you because this is what I think it is

2330
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:29,216
If fox has

2331
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:29,984
Beginners

2332
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,032
Following orders and beating the drums

2333
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:33,056
War

2334
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:34,592
For a conflict with Iran

2335
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:38,688
They have all of your thoughts looks like that may be on the horizon

2336
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:43,040
So they now have faked her puppet news frontman like back painting

2337
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:47,136
Crazy real scenarios on Fox like the Bubba effect

2338
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:49,952
Alongside yesterday retired CIA

2339
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:53,792
And Military paid TV pundits is that not an imminent sign of times

2340
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:57,120
In the very near future

2341
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,400
Stand against

2342
01:49:58,656 --> 01:49:59,680
Security right now

2343
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:02,240
Showing us what they're going to do

2344
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:14,272
Ireland

2345
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:33,472
In one Fell Swoop

2346
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:34,240
I hate

2347
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:35,520
Michael Savage

2348
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:39,872
It sure doesn't support Michaels

2349
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:42,176
Ron

2350
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:44,992
Within the confines of

2351
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:47,296
IGA

2352
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:51,392
Right everything is great

2353
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:53,696
Sports are on Andy believes it is real

2354
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:54,464
Committing acts of

2355
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,328
So that's where we are

2356
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:01,632
Here at the end of February 24th

2357
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:02,656
2009

2358
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:04,448
Can't wait for this

2359
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:05,216
Just to change the

2360
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:05,984
Because it'll be

2361
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:08,544
Meaningful

2362
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,312
Lot of

2363
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:10,080
180

2364
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:10,848
Degrees that is

2365
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:15,200
A lot of everything except the whites

2366
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:15,968
Everything is good

2367
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:17,504
Everything except the whites

2368
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:20,064
The only thing that is fake

2369
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:22,112
Is white supremacy

2370
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:26,464
So I guess that's it

2371
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:29,280
Supremacist and he's been so from the beginning

2372
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:32,352
Unlike any from Texas

2373
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:33,376
Who would have got

2374
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:34,656
What is shock

2375
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:36,704
He's consistent about that if nothing

2376
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:37,984
I do mean

2377
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:39,008
Nothing

2378
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,312
Except for his shadowy figure group of

2379
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:45,408
That's you and that's fine

2380
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:47,456
I am fascinated

2381
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:49,248
Concept

2382
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:51,040
Everything is negotiable

2383
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:52,064
Except whites

2384
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:52,832
Soupremacy

2385
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:57,952
Like that's non-negotiable that's the only thing you got

2386
01:51:58,464 --> 01:51:59,488
A lot of white supremacy

2387
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:09,728
I want to understand that point of view it's like I have no beliefs other

2388
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:11,264
Like Central life

2389
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:12,288
Lies

2390
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:13,824
Other than

2391
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:19,712
So I will let everything go I will play team sports forever

2392
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:20,992
But if Trump was like

2393
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:24,576
Which

2394
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:26,112
He only even

2395
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:28,672
Kind of begrudgingly 7:30

2396
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,232
Which everybody already knew was a lie

2397
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:39,424
The only thing the only thing that would be the only thing that would get people that support Trump off the Trump train is him being lie

2398
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:43,776
Luther King jr. day a week

2399
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:44,800
Like that's it

2400
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:47,872
Process what you're saying

2401
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:49,664
My mind is

2402
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:53,760
Is rattling around cuz I'm about like other issues that are negotiable

2403
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:57,088
It wouldn't really matter

2404
01:52:57,344 --> 01:52:57,856
Things like

2405
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:02,976
Something like that

2406
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:07,840
What I kept coming to in my head like with whatever issue you want to talk about

2407
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:08,864
Is that

2408
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:11,168
It's the same reason that I left the Lost

2409
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,448
As a major

2410
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:13,728
No in college

2411
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:17,056
Go to take about the logic class

2412
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,848
Formality

2413
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,128
Concreteness of logic

2414
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:23,712
Welsummer

2415
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:25,760
It's not even the math part about it that I liked

2416
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:26,528
It said it was deaf

2417
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:29,600
If you're willing to contradiction

2418
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:30,368
Can't do that

2419
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:35,488
Philosophy

2420
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:36,768
In argument

2421
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:38,048
Based philosophy

2422
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:40,864
You could make an argument for genocide

2423
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:42,912
And I can make an argument against John

2424
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:44,960
Genocide

2425
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:45,728
Could be

2426
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:51,872
Valid would be able to argue about it whether or not the premises

2427
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:54,944
Conclusion

2428
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,736
Just it doesn't make sense

2429
01:53:56,992 --> 01:53:58,784
Retina

2430
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:00,832
Who's arguing what's going on

2431
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:02,880
The only reason I bring this up is because that's

2432
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:04,928
Feeling that I get about a lot of the issue

2433
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:06,208
Shoes outside of

2434
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:07,488
Whiteness is right now

2435
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,280
Yeah I would like all those other things

2436
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:10,560
Could make an argument

2437
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:12,096
Diabetic support

2438
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:14,400
White identity for or against

2439
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:15,168
Welfare

2440
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:16,960
You can create

2441
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:18,752
The public school system

2442
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:24,384
Improvements argument

2443
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:29,504
You could do all of that the only thing you can't do is make an argument for a pluralistic

2444
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,272
Society

2445
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:31,552
Full of acceptance

2446
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:33,088
The end that's why it's

2447
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:34,112
The only non to go

2448
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:39,488
And it's reinforced by the idea that if we allow multiculturalism

2449
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,024
Creep into our society

2450
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,560
What it's going to do is going

2451
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:44,096
Diminish the whiteness

2452
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,120
And make it

2453
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:46,656
You were or whatever

2454
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:47,936
And to them

2455
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:49,728
To those people who believe those

2456
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:51,008
That's something

2457
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:52,288
Can't be undone

2458
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:54,592
And that's why they've so vociferously

2459
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:55,360
Defend

2460
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:57,152
The idea of their whiteness

2461
01:54:57,664 --> 01:55:01,248
Because they're like they're trying to come and take it away and eventually it'll be gone

2462
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:02,272
Can't get it back

2463
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:03,296
Because

2464
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:07,136
Then in what

2465
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:12,256
10 sentences you just did

2466
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:13,024
That I have

2467
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:13,792
F*****'-a

2468
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:20,192
How many f****** like

2469
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:23,520
Good life in Trump country articles have you f****** red

2470
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:27,872
About a million of them you just f****** in 10 seconds

2471
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:31,200
10 sentences ruined all of their bulshit argument

2472
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:33,760
That's exactly what it is it's brilliant

2473
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:39,904
I was putting forth is also super vague cuz I'm not willing to come up with

2474
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:42,464
On-the-fly what the arguments for and against

2475
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:43,232
Certain policies

2476
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:46,560
No that's

2477
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:53,216
You can you could spend all the time you want writing those arguments but the point is

2478
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:54,752
Your urinalysis

2479
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:55,520
Is curry

2480
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:09,344
So if I wanted early I can just compliment you and then we'll just talk to go

2481
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:16,256
Do you have any

2482
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:17,024
Final thought

2483
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:18,304
Thank you or mad

2484
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:19,840
I just want to make

2485
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:20,608
Make sure you got

2486
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:21,376
River

2487
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:22,400
You needed to get out

2488
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:23,680
Like

2489
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:27,008
Brett

2490
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,312
Things that we

2491
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:30,080
We talked about

2492
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:31,616
In three days and 2,000

2493
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:36,736
I think shocking

2494
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:38,016
Giving the contact

2495
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:39,040
Except we live in in

2496
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:43,392
If we did three straight episodes of Alex now

2497
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:45,440
It'll be all the same everything

2498
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:51,840
2009

2499
01:56:54,144 --> 01:57:00,032
Yeah but it's still at least like oh you're talking in homeschoolers right but even then like

2500
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:01,312
Schooler

2501
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:07,712
B******* ties to drills and the drills then ties to the Iowa National Clark National Guard

2502
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:13,088
Type to New Orleans size do police oversight

2503
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:15,648
And all of that s*** ties into his

2504
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:17,952
F******

2505
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:22,304
What is prison industry

2506
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:25,120
Like this

2507
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:29,728
Message

2508
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:32,544
What you responding to I think is that

2509
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:34,336
He'd better writers

2510
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:40,736
Or at least he was better at the gate

2511
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:41,504
Like really

2512
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:45,088
Focusing all that much on how

2513
01:57:55,584 --> 01:58:01,728
There are just a bunch of times he's talking about the state's putting for 13th Amendment right

2514
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:02,752
But it's like we can't

2515
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:03,520
Wake me up

2516
01:58:07,104 --> 01:58:09,152
In terms of what you cut

2517
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:09,920
For us

2518
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:10,688
To follow

2519
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:14,016
You you have to agree that were you to listen

2520
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:15,296
Listen to three straight episodes

2521
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:16,320
What's today

2522
01:58:16,832 --> 01:58:19,648
You would never be able to cut together the swap

2523
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:20,416
The things that we

2524
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:21,952
Cut together in 2009

2525
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:22,720
Not at all

2526
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:27,840
So that's my summation that's my final

2527
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:28,864
Thought process

2528
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:33,984
I'll be back in Paris for a while

2529
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:35,008
For the best

2530
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:37,312
Know about our

2531
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:38,848
Alex Jones

2532
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,640
Feel free to trust

2533
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:43,456
Rightwingwatch and Media Matters have you covered on that front

2534
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:44,736
Or people tweeting

2535
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:45,504
Stop

2536
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:48,320
Whatever the outrage cycles that they're promoting

2537
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:49,600
At this point

2538
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:51,648
It's really the only thing that's going on

2539
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:55,232
Deeper analysis

2540
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:57,280
Right

2541
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:58,304
CookieSwirlC

2542
01:58:58,816 --> 01:59:00,608
Shallow and I think actually

2543
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:03,424
Hurting him in the present

2544
01:59:04,192 --> 01:59:06,496
I'm not it's not my primary motivation

2545
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:10,848
Consequences

2546
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:12,384
That's your urine

2547
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:14,944
I think that the best way to do that is

2548
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:15,968
Unravel

2549
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:18,784
I think it's much more valuable

2550
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:20,320
So we'll see

2551
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:21,088
Anyway

2552
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:25,696
Live website knowledge faith.com

2553
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:31,584
We are

2554
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:35,168
Which if your new is a reference to

2555
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:35,936
Exactly

2556
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:37,984
Beyond

2557
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:39,520
That's weird

2558
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:44,128
Jordan is your turn

2559
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:45,920
Well

2560
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:52,320
As much as I normally like to hate on anybody militaristic

2561
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:53,088
Stance

2562
01:59:54,368 --> 01:59:55,392
As as you know

2563
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:57,184
You know I don't like the military

2564
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:03,584
Pray you know I'm not a fan of I would have loved to

2565
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:14,336
I don't

2566
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:20,992
Want to tell him to go f*** himself he seems like a good guy

2567
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:22,272
Some money too

2568
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:26,112
Standing Rock Puerto Rico and help people out

2569
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:34,304
Anyways

2570
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:38,144
The only answer is

2571
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:41,984
Go f*** yourself the entire New Orleans Police

2572
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:44,800
Holding

2573
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:50,688
Alexandra Thurston color with your trip and I love your work
