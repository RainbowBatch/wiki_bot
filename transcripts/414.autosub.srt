00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
Acknowledge

4
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,240
Novelties as we do before we might as well

5
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,288
Update it for our specific

6
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,592
Indeed we are

7
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,360
Hi

8
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,640
What up

9
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,688
Okay

10
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
Well interesting you should bring that up

11
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,160
Let It Go and I try not to go on it

12
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,464
Too much because it seems

13
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:40,608
Mabel gazy is Shindaiwa a little uncomfortable but I think it's really cool and I want to give a shout out to it

14
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
Created a Reddit subreddit about the show.com

15
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:54,688
Okay conversation

16
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,480
Too much

17
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,320
I can only imagine that they frequent Source conversation

18
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:06,720
People coming up and talking about the very thing to come up in the show

19
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:11,584
That is really cool I also I don't think it was from this but someone did send me a message

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,144
We also ask actually

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
Predicted the

22
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,960
Coronavirus

23
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:23,616
Of course we did that might be something that has come up on the board I'm not sure but

24
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,944
Episode that we did where dude

25
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,832
Who's mad at Kerry Cassidy interviews of time traveler he talks about how

26
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:39,232
That wasn't Martin Luther King's granddaughter or great-granddaughter is going to be president but you wouldn't be the right age

27
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:45,632
We discussed how the political realignment would need to happen for that to happen and one

28
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:50,752
One of the things was a massive outbreak of a disease B mostly kills older people

29
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,336
I've got multiple messages

30
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,736
Do people who are like you guys predicted this and also the time travelers are right

31
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
Rosary

32
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,296
So

33
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,624
Vide0 these Time Travelers in the policy

34
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,440
Of course we would accidentally Alex

35
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:14,560
Try so hard to predict everything he's always wrong and naturally he was joking of course

36
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:20,960
About what the surrounding context of this like nineteen-year-old becoming president would be

37
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:25,312
I bet she's going to be great at the job

38
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
They had stuff

39
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,872
But we'll see

40
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:34,528
Hey what's your bright spot and I don't mean this to be to blanket but

41
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,552
Batteries dead

42
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,344
Love documentaries

43
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,744
I might be two blankets

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
Everyone

45
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,048
Did you didn't

46
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:51,168
No I don't have a password

47
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,240
Tyrese they looked

48
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:59,360
Into that story a while back like when it was making the round unblocked

49
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:05,760
Send stuff remember a lot of the details of it already know but

50
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,576
Mighty about by get around to it

51
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,648
You're not going to worry about the national

52
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,720
No not really like really

53
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,768
Really specific

54
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
Really specific documentary

55
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
One of them is a fastball

56
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,935
Which is just a documentary about tires.

57
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Not the band

58
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
No

59
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,007
Who sang stairway

60
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,079
Where are they going without ever knowing

61
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,151
The Beltway

62
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,735
God that song with every way

63
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
I don't know

64
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,087
I don't know I have heard that song long time I don't remember hating it

65
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,623
Make a dam I love that

66
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:49,023
Specific books

67
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:56,703
The book just about salt

68
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,799
This one that history

69
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,103
Of course were fascinated with micro history

70
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:09,503
I know there's one that was just released on YouTube made by this guy up just about how

71
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
One guy

72
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,855
Had all of the record high score fast

73
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
This times for Mike Tyson Punch-Out

74
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,487
And it's a story about any the entire community of

75
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:23,583
Tyson Punch-Out fans yeah that's like real nice going going

76
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,423
Hard and like we're going to find a way to beat this guy scores

77
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,495
At the end of this documentary I'm like

78
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:35,359
I need Sports back in my life I want baseball

79
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:41,247

Mario I need Sports clearly

81
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927

Freakishly large

102
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,015
Take as much Sarah and

106
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
I like this.

107
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:51,807
You could find a nice local charity or something like that

108
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
Would appreciate that

Inspira

110
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,879
So Jordan today

111
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,183
Got an interesting thing to talk about

112
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,767
We're going to talk a little bit about Bill Cooper

113
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,863
We've talked a little bit about Bill Cooper on the show in the past

114
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
And how he's clearly one of Alex's Gyros

115
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,471
Awesome. Where Alex is just getting started in Media

116
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:14,335
I'm very strong drive through a lot more coverage about Bill since I find him fast

117
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,663
But one of the problems they've run into is that bill show is often

118
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
Really f****** dry

119
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,783
A lot of it is inbreeding a long drawn-out passages from his own book

120
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,135
Or a letter from one of his listeners is a member of his dumb intelligence-gathering operation

121
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
Apache

122
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,463
You combine that dryness with how come

123
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,303
Completely out of line Alex's show has been in the past few months

124
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,911
You have a recipe for me not having the kind of time I need to create the kind of Bill Cooper content

125
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
I think our audience desserts

126
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,519
Rest assured that those episodes will come hopefully soon

127
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,871
You're my exploration of bill there's a whole lot of exactly what you would

128
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
There's a whole lot of old

129
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
School conspiracy theory

130
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,039
Is a lot of pretty extreme right-wing militia sensibilities

131
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,343
There's an overwhelming sense of distrust of

132
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,927
Most of the other people in the militia media landscape

133
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
What'd you expect

134
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:09,375
I've noticed that one of the things that I resonate most with in terms of doing the show is not the expected but the paqui

135
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,983
The ways in which Alex is similar to Bill Cooper are largely uninteresting

136
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:20,127
They both love guns they hate taxes they have shockingly low standards of evidence for absurd things they want to believe

137
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
And report is true

138
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:26,015
What interests me far more is a ways in which Alex is a worse version

139
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,295
Of the person he's emulator

140
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,623
Our last episode about Bill we experience how much

141
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
More competent

142
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,951
Bill is it presenting information

143
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,743
He actually played the roles

144
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:41,375
Someone trying to prove something as opposed to Alex or just yells about nonsense and it's insist it's been proven already

145
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:45,471
Go look it up

146
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,519
But without saying

147
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,591
Further we saw how much better bill was it broadcast

148
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,175
Very clearly plan to show that advanced Incorporated music

149
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,455
Come to the show to reinforce theme

150
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
Today we're going to look at another dip

151
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
That I found

152
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Between Alex and Bill

153
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,367
This difference is a strategic difference

154
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,023
It's one that makes me think that bill is pretty sincere about his relief beliefs regardless of how dumb they are and

155
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
It is ideas are

156
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,863
The difference begins in a similarity

157
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,447
Starting out their careers both Bill Cooper and Alex Jones

158
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,215
Had to know

159
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,263
The odds were not in their favor

160
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,335
They both interviews and politics that are not really welcome

161
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,871
And mainstream conversation

162
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:29,759
So the odds of them getting a widely syndicated radio show like Rush Limbaugh or getting a TV show on an actual Network

163
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
Incredibly Slim

164
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:35,391
We seen the Alex responded to this difficulty by trying to create his own Empire

165
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,207
He got a little bit of a foothold

166
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,607
He started in going to the local acts of TV show and then you got a radio show cuz his dad agreed to pay for

167
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,703
Advertising and then from there

168
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:54,591
From there he found a crazy dude in inside Anderson who had a gold sales

169
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,151
Operation that needed a pitchman Alex

170
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,199
Rose through the ranks through that

171
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,527
Publicity stunt after publicity stunt along the way

172
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
He managed

173
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,599
To create a cottage industry for himself

174
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,879
No point

175
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
Would you ever get

176
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,719
The science that he's not what's important

177
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,511
Right Alex use

178
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,303
Infowars Alex

179
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Use

180
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
The head of the Liberty moved

181
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
Alex Hughes

182
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
The man who

183
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,007
Mainstream did 9/11 truth Alex caused brexit

184
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:27,359
Alex is like it's all about him he's a megalomaniac

185
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,639
And all the things all the

186
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:32,479
The trappings everything around it is in service of building up this

187
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
Greater

188
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,575
Sing Infowars

189
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
Monetized

190
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
Delusions of grandeur

191
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
True

192
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,439
The strategy is

193
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,511
Born out of that megalomania

194
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
And

195
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,375
Strategy is specifically

196
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
Create your

197
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,775
He knows that he has no place in mainstream World he's never going to have a column in the New York to

198
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,591
He's never going to be on Salem broadcast

199
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,407
Syndicated all these other

200
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,455
Sort of Mainline conservative talkers

201
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
He's never going

202
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
To be on Fox News

203
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,087
He's never going to have a job in a place

204
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
Of

205
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,415
Cultural legitimacy

206
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,463
I have to create my own thing

207
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
I believe

208
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,559
The Bill Cooper is really interesting

209
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Because

210
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,143
He saw a broader picture than I

211
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,959
He had to create his own thing

212
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,751
In the same way that Alex

213
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
So he wrote

214
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,823
Behold a Pale Horse

215
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,359
And it became an underground class

216
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:35,967
He started his own radio show that ended up becoming the shortwave

217
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
Hour of the time

218
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,319
And by October 1993

219
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
He was at a point

220
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
Where he realized

221
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
There are other ways

222
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
To do this

223
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,023
I'm never going to get my own show somewhere else

224
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
Maybe

225
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,399
I have a limitation in terms of how big I can make

226
00:12:54,655 --> 00:13:00,799
Without turning into what Alex's assuming that's what he thought I don't know entirely

227
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
But

228
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,591
On October 5th

229
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,639
Teeth 1993

230
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,175
Bill Cooper launched

231
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Initiative

232
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
On his show

233
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,783
But I think is one of the most interesting things

234
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,575
That a conservative

235
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,647
Right-wing militia weirdo would ever think to do

236
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
Tonight

237
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
Taco Bell

238
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
Media

239
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
But you

240
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:24,863
And I

241
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
Listeners and

242
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
Cohere

243
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,239
Who produced the OurTime

244
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
Are going to

245
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Purchase

246
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,335
Here we are

247
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
Going

248
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
To do that

249
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,175
The Bill Cooper has his realize

250
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,991
Correctly that he has no place in mainstream s***

251
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
He's built his thing

252
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
It is audio

253
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,831
It's up to a certain point

254
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
Best strategy

255
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,927
By the media

256
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
That's the trick

257
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
You if you're the boss

258
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,047
You are on your own show

259
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,375
Alex is proof of Alex would never think

260
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,447
To do this or it wouldn't be something that he would

261
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
To do

262
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,519
Bill Cooper is like alright look

263
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
I don't like the

264
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
The media

265
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
We can change that

266
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,895
All we have to do

267
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
Inspired

268
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
Which

269
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,343
So he's saying that he wants a large group of people to pool their money together in order to a

270
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,159
Achieve a goal that's not possible by himself

271
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
Well look the

272
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
Well sure there is that

273
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:29,119
But the interesting thing is it's very unclear what his plan is as he launches this initiative

274
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
But it is

275
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,935
Very clearly

276
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
Ambitious

277
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:37,055
Let's go

278
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,871
NADA just a major conglomerate

279
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:45,247
He starts out here on the 15th of 1993 in October

280
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,039
By talking about why

281
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,855
You would want to do this because the media has destroyed

282
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,391
So you must reclaim it

283
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,439
To rebuild

284
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,999
It is absolutely

285
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,023
Necessary

286
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,303
For us too

287
00:14:59,327 --> 00:14:59,839
Take back the sky

288
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,631
The media has been

289
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
Destruction

290
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,543
Then it also appears

291
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
YouTube

292
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Control

293
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,383
The only way to do that

294
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
Capitalistic

295
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,687
Republic

296
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
The media

297
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,063
The wrong

298
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Exactly

299
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
Working gear

300
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
That was wrong

301
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,823
God we find a theme attic song but used

302
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
Open the show

303
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:46,431
In this case it's winners track from the Bill and Ted soundtrack

304
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
Battlestations

305
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,015
Lyrics from that song

306
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,343
Take a note prisoners open fire Battle Stations

307
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,951
Someone's trying to brainwash me Battlestations

308
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:04,607
It's the season to resist pre-programmed morons computer sleeves

309
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:09,983
It's not nearly as fun of a song is make it big but it's definitely unintentional choice of the bill is make

310
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:16,127
Like this is f****** someone's trying to brainwash me battleship

311
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
Yougov course

312
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,479
It's great he's he's doing what he does bills interesting

313
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,759
Seems like a real lyrics

314
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:26,111
You know like it doesn't physically have a genre of music

315
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:32,511
Deep cut from The Beach Boys and that Winger

316
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:38,399
I think he might actually like like Dead Prez

317
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,495
Turn off the radio turn off that b******* will never know

318
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:47,615
I want that no one asked him back then but

319
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:52,991
So Bill gets back to talk about it in this episode here on October 15th

320
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:59,647
Bill doesn't know which company he wants to buy him and his audience

Sure I could still don't think if you have 10% of the shares have controlling interest in a company like Paramount

378
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:13,023
10% of the business of Paramount you now control the Knicks

379
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,863
Absurd

380
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,215
The purchased 10% of the shares in Paramount using his figures you would need to scare up

381
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,031
847 million dollars

382
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,079
An 1919 $93

383
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:32,479
So if everybody gives a dollar it only takes 108 847 million people to come together and

384
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:36,319
That's over 1.5 billion in today's money

385
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,415
How do you fix this is something that's an option within the realm of possibility

386
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,231
He's still not clear what

387
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:49,375
You suggested like is it everyone sending money and that I can buy 10% of the shares

388
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:53,983
It's unclear is one option

389
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:58,591
But there's one company that is not an option

390
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
Mario Kart

391
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,407
Incorporated

392
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
56

393
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
And I suppose.

394
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,991
Today

395
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
Chairs

396
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
Outstanding

397
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
According to

398
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
2 hour

399
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
Report

400
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
Back burner

401
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
But it is

402
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:23,423
Viacom

403
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,239
Viacom not on Bill Cooper's right hotter

404
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,007
Dubai

405
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,823
Tooth ball

406
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:36,223
Mancino that's where he was wrong what you got to do to buy them down on the ground floor you know whenever Viacom

407
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,063
Tom only has 120 million

408
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:46,719
Now look where we are Viacom owns everything on his part

409
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,743
But I will give

410
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
Bill credit

411
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
To an extent

412
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,351
Amatis he does know his limitations

413
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
General Electric

414
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
Corporation

415
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
That's too big

416
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:56,959
$6

417
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
At the close

418
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
Today they have 800

419
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,799
54 million shares

420
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,591
Is out of RV

421
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:08,735
Yes yes yeah can I buy General Electric

422
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:14,623
A rare instance where hubris isn't complete

423
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,184
His limitations are like

424
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,000
50 share with 120 million

425
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:26,656
90 + share with 800 million that's too hot it's not about 7 ish are at 118 building

426
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:33,056
That's why I think it is about the money with General Electric a outstanding or whatever his

427
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:39,200
Math doesn't work out electric it wasn't it wasn't about the money

428
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:45,600
It was about two small potatoes

429
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:50,976
Bill's plan which he still hasn't really spelled out exactly yet

430
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:55,328
The problem is that once he starts putting this into action

431
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,352
And once

432
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,376
They take

433
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,424
Control of a media entity

434
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,704
What's going to happen

435
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,520
Is that the establishment is going to sabotage them

436
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,336
NBA established

437
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
Figured out what

438
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,896
We are about what

439
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
Are doing

440
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,944
There will be effort

441
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
Shania

442
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,296
Union may go on

443
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
Strike

444
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
Corporation

445
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
Coronavirus

446
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
International corporation

447
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
2 hour

448
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
Papers

449
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,328
If we have

450
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:34,240
But once we take control of the vomer it's their own newspapers we will dictate all the terms

451
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
What goes in those May 4th

452
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,288
NFL

453
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,336
Way of fighting back the people who

454
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:43,200
Put Supply the supplies to create newspapers will probably not give us

455
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,992
Unions might strike

456
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:50,112
I would say maybe they would if you're just trying to force them to print militia propaganda

457
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,440
I don't know this is silly

458
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,792
20 minutes into this episode and I'm already realizing like

459
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:01,632
This is nonsense

460
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,680
One I would say

461
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,752
A worrying about the establishment reaction

462
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,312
Is putting the cart before the before the horse

463
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:13,152
Yeah I'm going to go with that one we need to focus on the early planning stages

464
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,688
That's what I'm saying to you right now

465
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,712
Spurs playing

466
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:22,368
Especially since at this point in the episode he hasn't really made clear what the plan and I think he's declared himself

467
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
King of

468
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:29,024
Sitting here on this episode like really looking over these gigantic companies

469
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,376
It seems like a guy talking about like we could own all this kid

470
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:39,776
Looking at a catalog order any

471
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:46,176
Treating American companies like Skywalker feels like that doesn't seem to recognize that just because this

472
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:50,016
This is the parent company it doesn't mean that all of the decisions of the

473
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:54,880
Constituent companies are dictated by the board of the parent company

474
00:23:55,136 --> 00:24:01,280
They're still like they're more interested in just only thing they would run

475
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:07,680
Or let's say like X company is owned by y company company is incredibly /

476
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:14,080
Profitable and doing well why company is not going to change what x company does and risk it be coming out

477
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,128
Profitable dish of propaganda

478
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:22,272
It's a problem with the New York Times has always been not enough militia propaganda

479
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,808
Wall-to-wall

480
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,088
I do appreciate it

481
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,184
The blind idealism

482
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,584
It's aspirational these times we find ourselves in here in 2020 of Dan has 120

483
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,984
The thing where that kind of thing could be very refreshing and I appreciate a little bit

484
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,312
Give that guy in San Francisco who just declared himself king of America

485
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,592
Words just like

486
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:50,944
Man you took such a big swing that people are around you just going like

487
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,504
You're crazy but you know what

488
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,600
I'm all for you I know a guy that Columbia Missouri who is

489
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:04,000
Drunk guy on the street

490
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,144
I think it was kind of an a****** but

491
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:15,264
Anyway it is next Club Bill suggest another company that they might buy

492
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:20,128
And I think this is where he starts to get into the nuts and bolts of how this would work

493
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,664
And this is

494
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Job

495
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
PDS Incorporated

496
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,480
Close today

497
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504

Prepare

502
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
Millionaire

503
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,720
That is all

504
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
Outstanding

505
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:38,816
Million 3

506
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,840
300000

507
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
American

508
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
To buy one

509
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
70 to dollars

510
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,448
58

511
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
Heartache

512
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
We would

513
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
Incorporated

514
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,664
With the rest of America

515
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
I found out what

516
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,712
We were doing I can guarantee

517
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,256
This is outrageous

518
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:14,656
Yep So the plan is everybody in the audience go ahead and buy one share and then we will

519
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:21,056
Collectively

520
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:24,384
Prohibitive

521
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,152
Page

522
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
In terms of

523
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,480
Making decisions

524
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:33,088
It all 1.3 million Americans have an equal share together

525
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:39,488
And their opinions are all equally valid but you would assume they would all act as one

526
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,192
Conspiracy theorists agree about everything

527
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:54,848
Conspiracies are crazy because it's act it's pretending like 10,000 people like the globalists are so many people and it's so

528
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,872
So implausible

529
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:00,736
The number of people would act as one without anybody sharing the details down he's like

530
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:05,600
Okay let's ramp it up to 1.3%

531
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,392
What an incredible

532
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:13,024
That is great so there's that and then there's the assumption that once people figure out what we're doing

533
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:19,424
The other stockholders I'll get on board as I was thinking the complete opposite of

534
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,824
Why would they

535
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,832
Also just said that like there are laws

536
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,624
Companies do does

537
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,024
You know what I mean

538
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:51,424
Understand things like this can happen

539
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:57,824
Like this coming in and buying up a bunch of stock hostile takeover

540
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,152
They can offer more stock

541
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,224
They cannot have stock BuyBacks

542
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,760
Their processes that

543
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,808
Do the defensive mechanism

544
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,856
The business is going to have to avoid

545
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,696
Corporate piracy

546
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,256
Can you imagine

547
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,280
The headlines

548
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,816
Batman if he did

549
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,520
Right-wing militia

550
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:33,152
1.3 million people together and motive business immediately

551
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:39,552
All the audience spent all their money on stockx

552
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
Holy s*** it's

553
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:49,280
Just baby that's a big swing that's a big swing I love Bill Cooper so much

554
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,096
Dennis surprises like use these things

555
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,168
He is not an idiot but this is dumb

556
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,704
This is f****** dumb

557
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,776
It's the kind of thing that I used to think when I was

558
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:06,176
When I was a kid and I am legitimately thought I can

559
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
Viscerally thinking

560
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,992
I'm going to make a business out of this

561
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,808
Is going to make me thousands of dollars

562
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
Iodine

563
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:18,208
Printed out sheet of paper with prices for like sizes of lawn trimming Hedges and stuff

564
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:18,976
Like Ike

565
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:22,304
I have the ability of the labor people haven't need

566
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,864
Why wouldn't they pay me to do mow their yards

567
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,704
I was like looking at people's Lawns and I was like alright

568
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,264
20 Lawns on this block

569
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
Couple hundred bucks

570
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,384
Every week do they need lawn mowed every week absolutely

571
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,944
Plan made total sense because there was a f******

572
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,808
This is how it feels to me this idea that I had

573
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,368
A million people sign my petition

574
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:50,720
If those million people all buy $250 worth of stock

575
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:57,376
I'd somehow all coordinated CVS it reminds me

576
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:01,728
More of when I had the idea to talk to a few of my friends and I was like okay

577
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,008
None of us can afford

578
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
A Nintendo

579
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,616
On around but if we pool our money together we can share it

580
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,944
And that's between like five people in the more I thought about it the more I was like

581
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,224
Who gets it when

582
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,624
Endust Begins the troubles you know like you're going to f****** a couple will be resolved

583
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
Later

584
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,416
Poorly

585
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
Idem

586
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,632
Whatever the case both of those examples we have our when we were kids

587
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,496
Because this is not adult fidget

588
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,824
A party in the sky thought

589
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,872
Is fun and it's filled with her

590
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:43,200
And as we all know the governors are trying to get rid of

591
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:48,576
It's also providing us with this later so I appreciate that

592
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:54,976
So CBS is in the running General Electric is out viacom's out not enough not enough

593
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,304
Paramount is in play possible

594
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,912
And also you brought this up earlier Turner Broadcasting is what play

595
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:03,936
Our

596
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,704
Gender is

597
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
Dorchester

598
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
System

599
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,800
Practice for all of us

600
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,128
Wellwood

601
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,664
25 + 7

602
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,712
Dollars per share

603
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,736
170

604
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,016
Insurance

605
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,344
Don't let the hundred

606
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
76

607
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,928
25 + 7

608
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,696
Pretty flowers

609
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
4share

610
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,232
There's no one

611
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,560
Who could not

612
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
Report to buy

613
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:35,424
Disagree

614
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,960
Do it today

615
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,752
We do it

616
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
You're going to

617
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,504
He doesn't even bring up the Ted Turner's crazy

618
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,112
I know I was I was one of you when he said TBS Turner Broadcasting is like

619
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,024
Ted might be crazy enough to be sold on this idea politically the other direction

620
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,816
Bring up that they own the WCW

621
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:06,400
Which is great but 93 is before like the Newton

622
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,984
New World Order

623
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:17,920
Thinking 93 Hogan was in WWF

624
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,736
Yeah I bet bill was a old school Hulk Hogan guy

625
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,576
Woohoo is it going to root for a foreigner

626
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:31,232
I would think Sergeant Slaughter but then he turned his back on America during the Iraq War

627
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:37,376
Who's the who's the most who's the character probably

628
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:44,288
So Turner Broadcasting in play also another entity that you may not have heard of before but is a big

629
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,312
Anthony

630
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,616
USA Today Gannett

631
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,152
Is also in play

632
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,176
Garrett Tokyo

634
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,760
Janet is the largest newspaper group

635
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
The United States

636
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
Headquartered in

637
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,320
In Arlington Virginia

638
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,856
Jennifer owns and operates

639
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,648
One daily and more than 50

640
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,416
Inundated

641
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,184
Newspapers

642
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
Robert Davi

643
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,560
Companies USA

644
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
Today is

645
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,096
Second only

646
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
The Wall Street

647
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
So weird

648
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
Possibly too big

649
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,456
You know what's crazy now that I'm thinking about it

650
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,224
Beaches

651
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,784
Shockingly similar to Sinclair media

652
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:33,696
What do you mean I mean the way that Sinclair media has bought up all of these local news stations it slowly

653
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,512
Gradually over time and now from the top is directing them

654
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:42,912
Two opposite

655
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,728
Is bill was like alright

656
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:52,128
For $85 I can get this station in the middle of nowhere and then kept doing that

657
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:55,456
That would be like Sinclair

658
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,992
Buck

659
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:00,832
I guess that bills not an idiot this is. This is very.

660
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:05,696
So we got Gannett is in the in the running

661
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:09,536
Turner Broadcasting needs that held him out

662
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:15,424
Well you have intelligence

663
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
It's like I'm looking

664
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,544
This sounds like he has a clear-eyed plan

665
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:27,200
All of the information he's just reading off something that one of his listener sentence like I

666
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,992
Edgy did all the all the

667
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:35,392
Figuring out what these conglomerates own and all that so he's recording off the

668
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
Okay I got

669
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:40,256
So we got another entity that's in the running we got another plan haha

670
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,328
Time Warner

671
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,352
Incorporated

672
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,632
Butterfly

673
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,912
Even better better

674
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
Love it

675
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
41

676
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,496
3/8 hours

677
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,520
For sale

678
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,312
You say that again

679
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,104
41

680
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,872
38

681
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
Dollars per

682
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,296
Well I was entertained

683
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,856
How many shells are outstanding

684
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,416
Insert Time Warner

685
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,184
Inside

686
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:14,816
Well within our reach has never been stretched to the breaking

687
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
Keypoint Moore

688
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,544
F*** is wrong with you I'm with you

689
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,896
Thing that gets me is the well within

690
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,432
Like within our reach is

691
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,200
Suggest you like

692
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,016
You know what we can do this but it's going to be a struggle

693
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:40,416
Well within our reach is like guys we could do this tomorrow if we want to do no big deal like I'm not trying to be a dick

694
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:46,048
And say like no one listens to bill cuz he's very popular at this point he's a hero for his book and like

695
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,328
He is

696
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,352
Baby

697
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,912
It's too strong to say the king of shortwave

698
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,728
But he's a pretty busy yes pretty big name

699
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,264
Conspiracy right-wing

700
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,568
Militia shortwave radio

701
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:01,920
He does not have an unsubstantial audio

702
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
Bye

703
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,480
He's what he's

704
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,272
Way too big for his britches

705
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,576
Like this is a situation where like

706
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:12,416
Time Warner buying it is 10% of the companies within our reach

707
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,464
Is just like you are

708
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,744
You think

709
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:20,352
Way higher than you are you you are out-of-pocket

710
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,168
This is the first time that it's like I'm really like

711
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
There's Alex

712
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,240
That like idea of like

713
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:31,616
Oh I'm not I look I have a grill on L have a big audience but know my audience is

714
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,384
Billions

715
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,664
The people

716
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,064
I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to do this episode is because as you go along you see a little

717
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,088
Lil bit more of our

718
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,112
In this

719
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,648
And it's not

720
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,232
It's it's interesting Lee not on a Content level

721
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,256
It's

722
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:54,656
Very much on a on a megalomaniac level

723
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,240
Differently and I think one of them was really interesting about this is

724
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,032
Bills

725
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,824
Basic idea

726
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:02,848
He's smart

727
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
Yes

728
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,408
Did is it like okay

729
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:10,784
I might have a limitation in this Empire that I can build myself right but

730
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:14,624
The problem that I see is that the media doesn't report things

731
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,976
In a way that I view is accurate how can I change the media

732
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
That

733
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,280
Is good think absolutely

734
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,584
When he decides to go about it

735
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,376
Alex young dumb

736
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,192
But the thought is it is a smart thought

737
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:33,312
I mean how would you if you diagnose the problem as the media is lying all the time

738
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:40,480
Why wouldn't you want to do something to change it right my misguided but whatever

739
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,248
Is that

740
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,320
As far as I understand his principles

741
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:50,720
The idea of 1.3 million people coming together and pooling their money collectively is anathema to them

742
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,256
That's a union

743
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:57,120
There is a problem there and I would

744
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,680
Caution you to ignore that

745
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:06,080
You'll get bogged down too easily also considered like okay so just use the Paramount example

746
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,640
That was a 847 million dollars

747
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:11,200
That would be needed to buy 10 right right

748
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,992
Like any big Union

749
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,528
If you're able

750
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:19,136
2 mode immobilized that level of money

751
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,928
You shouldn't

752
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,696
Do it that way

753
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,232
Because

754
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,000
Like

755
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,048
Listen clear examples perfect

756
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,608
These entities are already too big

757
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:32,960
You're not going to get the bang for your buck that you want there yet if you can mobilize

758
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,008
847 billion dollars

759
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,800
You could do devastating

760
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:43,200
Things you use that money wiser

761
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,736
Trickle-up as

762
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,784
Bottom-up movements always do

763
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:50,880
We were we were I think he might have had a better

764
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:56,256
Strategy possibly if it wasn't 1993

765
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,280
Do you know what you have

766
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,328
You do have to consider the state of

767
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,864
Technology at that point

768
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,912
Prior to social media

769
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,448
So there is

770
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,984
There is a certain amount of like

771
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,032
What could be done

772
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:11,360
To disseminate information cheaply

773
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,128
Different

774
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,944
But still write still a bad plan

775
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,224
I thought though

776
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,808
Good know he does it is something where it's like

777
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,344
If you are

778
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
If you are

779
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,928
Meditating on your problem

780
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
The media

781
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,768
Then this is something this is an idea

782
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,560
That appear in a writers room

783
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,584
Somebody floats

784
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,704
Yeah somebody float this more like and then you guys start talking to you like

785
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
Weekend

786
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:41,568
Obviously

787
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,592
You're next

788
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,872
The problem though

789
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,408
You still stay with the proper

790
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,992
The problem is that the writers room is catch it

791
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:54,880
Probably there all till 10 so I don't think

792
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,440
That if you buy 10%

793
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,232
Accompany you now

794
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,280
Control it I don't think that's true

795
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:07,680
From everything I can tell and I remember my economics classes generally to have a controlling interest in a business you fifty one percent

796
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
Sevenstock

797
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,032
Typical that's where you're stupid and there's different

798
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,568
Kind of stock to

799
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
But anyway

800
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,616
Bill thinks

801
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,432
That if you have 10% of time War

802
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,480
This listen to this s***

803
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
He's

804
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,784
Absurd I want to hear it

805
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,624
Turner broadcast

806
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,648
In other words if we

807
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
Purchase time

808
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,696
Corporated

809
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,464
Wii with on

810
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,792
Turner broadcast

811
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
So

812
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:38,400
So why even talk about buying Turner

813
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:44,800
If Time Warner owned 19% of Turner Broadcasting if you buy 10

814
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:49,664
A set of Time Warner use that have double what you need to control Turner

815
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
So in that case

816
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,272
Isn't Time Warner the parent company of

817
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,808
And then if anybody

818
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,624
What if you have a company worth more

819
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,744
One guy on 10% one guy owns 11% one guy owns another 10%

820
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,792
They're all controlling interview

821
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,840
What is going on

822
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,680
It's funny that he's accident like

823
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,288
Incorrectly correctly diagnosing a big problem

824
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:19,104
Which is that all of these media conglomerates

825
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:24,480
Own parts of other media can do is

826
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:32,416
Double-check a lot of this but if bills accurate then it is a problem

827
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:35,744
He's he's even pointing to it there's so much as stuff where

828
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,024
Bill always seems like

829
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,072
He points at the problem

830
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,608
And then his solution

831
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,400
Exacerbates the problem

832
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:50,848
Unlike most of the right which is like I don't look at that problem just don't even don't even worry about it he's not real

833
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,151
And what I think we should do

834
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,199
Is gather an army of llamas

835
00:41:55,455 --> 00:42:01,599
And then we will be able to defeat them on the battlefield like sense man you're like okay just make sense

836
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:05,951
We've already touched on the fact that

837
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,255
You know it's unwieldy to have

838
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:14,911
One point something billion people all have to agree on equal to agree on

839
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:21,567
And so in this next clip Bill explains the solution to that problem which I think is a problem

840
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,639
You were going to

841
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,663
Future All-Star

842
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
You are

843
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,223
You have a tissue

844
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,015
With your name

845
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,295
Why

846
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,319
I'm telling you to

847
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,087
That's why

848
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,391
You don't buy gold

849
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,159
Have somebody else

850
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:36,927
Stuart for you

851
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,559
All we want you to do

852
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:43,839
Eproxy

853
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
Giving

854
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,631
The voting

855
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,167
Right

856
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,239
If we don't do this

857
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,263
R v

858
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,543
Movie fractured and we will not

859
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,567
Have control

860
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,103
No s***

861
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,383
Anybody object to that

862
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,919
You don't want to do it you better let me

863
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,967
Me know now because I don't want to put my heart in

864
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,807
Penis work I don't want to build the organization

865
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,087
And follow it through

866
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
Make it work

867
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,391
All we can see

868
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,415
A bunch of idiots

869
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
Walgreens

870
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:09,951
Wilbur Who

871
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:10,975
Going to hold the vote

872
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,559
I want to know about it right now in the beginning

873
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,351
Because I don't want any part of it

874
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,263
I don't want this going to happen I don't want you squabbling about who's going to hold the vote cuz it's f****** me I am go

875
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,799
Going to control Time Warner

876
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,847
Hi Bill Cooper

877
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,175
Are you all side where your voting rights

878
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:35,295
Gigantic project charge

879
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:40,415
I guess you could pretend but like whatever decision I make is in the best interest of my audience

880
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,975
I mean you can tell yourself that but

881
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,767
I want to control I want

882
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,303
Control and I want you to give it to me

883
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:52,703
I don't like the media and I would like all of your money to buy me a controlling stake or what I believe to be a controlling stake

884
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:56,287
The gigantic Media Company

885
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:59,103
I love that he's already resenting people

886
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,175
So what's up the thing that is impossible to do

887
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,991
It's so much like

888
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,527
And in here's the thing

889
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:11,647
After we on this and I've I've established my business running the entire media world for the

890
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,927
For about five years

891
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,023
And I hate those people in

892
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,095
Don't worry about it yet

893
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:23,935
That's a good problem to have your walk before you run bill

894
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,519
So Bill goes to calls at the end of the show

895
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:34,175
And system is really interesting because he just has a phone number

896
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,455
People can call in

897
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:39,039
And supper baby pheasant

898
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:44,159
No call screen has a guest they have to call in

899
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:44,927
But

900
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,999
Everyone knows the phone number so is other people call in

901
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,559
The gas can't get on the line

902
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,607
I've heard a number of episodes

903
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:58,495
He's checking in to see if a guest is there and it'll be a caller is like I told you I'm not to call in tonight

904
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:04,895
If you guys keep calling in and my guests can't get through we're not taking calls anymore

905
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,855
It's childlike

906
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:20,255
It is it has a childlike innocence to it

907
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:24,863
I think what it is is like a guy doing the best he can with no

908
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:30,495
Competence right in the world of like production

909
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:36,895
No one outside of like maybe a couple of like ideological associate

910
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,479
Were there to legore radio professionals who were making this slick

911
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:44,575
And somebody can't afford to pay anybody

912
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:47,135
And let's be honest you can't trust

913
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:51,743
That could be an FBI informant

914
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,023
If evil f******

915
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,303
Bill's world

916
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,583
I think his wife

917
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,863
Was probably a snitch

918
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:03,263
We're on our way he comes up to me there were a number of people that he targets even over the course of these couple episodes real

919
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,567
Listen to the eclipse

920
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:11,967
You hate this guy named Todd Valentine who's another radio guy insists he's a mason

921
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:18,367
Is proved by handshakes that catchy members did with him he knew the Masonic handshakes

922
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:24,767
It's way too complicated to get into tell good he has a weird intelligence-gathering Network

923
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,815
He's what he's got a Scientology group like

924
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:33,215
It's spying on everybody it's so funny

925
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:41,919
Roof guy who's like in the right-wing sphere until like Bill

926
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,735
Kind of thinks he's controlled opposition or something

927
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:50,111
Anyway bill goes to cause any gets this caller who I think has a pretty good piece of advice for Bell

928
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,391
Streaming Romeo

929
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,999
Hi Siri how are you

930
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,327
Alright

931
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,143
You're bad

932
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,191
Okay

933
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,983
Sometimes I need a conscience

934
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:15,455
Well I don't have to get my hopes too high on their CGI nomos America

935
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,783
For anyone to really

936
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,087
The Martian Watch

937
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,879
This is something they can hold in their hands

938
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,927
This is something they can really do

939
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:34,143
And maybe right about that problem

940
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:37,983
That's fun

941
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,007
Voice of

942
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:45,663
Hey Beltline buddy you're talking to people who bury their money

943
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,455
Well I support you I got your back

944
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:51,807
But don't get your hopes up you know your audience

945
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,367
Notoriously suspicious and

946
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,135
Yeah

947
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:58,719
I appreciate that color that is really color is like a real

948
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,487
Positive

949
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,511
Yeah

950
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:03,327
Yeah and he's not all these calls are going to end up being

951
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:07,935
Episode episode

952
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:11,263
Who hates the Jews

953
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,799
Not so uplifted

954
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,567
Doesn't surprise me

955
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,615
So

956
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,639
At this point

957
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,919
We on the 5th

958
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:21,759
And bill hasn't decided what company

959
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,783
He's going to buy

960
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,623
Is this episode was really just feeling it out it was supposed to decide

961
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,415
It wasn't supposed to be

962
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:33,791
Take whatever there was

963
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:40,191
He hasn't decided which company to buy it like that is millions and millions of dollars at his disposal and

964
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,495
Discuss the possibility

965
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:48,383
So on the 21st of October 1993 Bill comes back on air

966
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,687
I mean granted he has other shows before that

967
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,479
He has

968
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,527
He comes back and it's been decided

969
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,087
Okay Arcadia

970
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:02,719
He knows what he's doing he's feeling on top of the world like everything is going pretty well

971
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,511
We are

972
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:05,791
We're doing it

973
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,071
A lot of calls

974
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,631
Stock

975
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,911
Intermedia venture

976
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,471

977

50 and 1/4 dollar

982
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,479
After 4

983
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,503
Today

984
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,807
The damn party

985
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,135
Today's high was 51 1/8 today's low was pissed

986
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,159
One quarter

988
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,535
Yesterday's clothes what's 50 +

989
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,303
7th

990
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,583
So

991
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,119
Downhill hope so

992
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,959
When all of us begin

993
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,239
Antibiotics

994
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,543
And other people get in on this venture

995
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,567
It's going to go up

996
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,335
If your

997
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:55,199
Your Fork restaurant eating on there you're making a big big big mistake

998
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:57,247
Because we're going to own this company

999
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,271
And we're going to tell

1000
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,039
America

1001
00:49:59,295 --> 00:49:59,807
Latruth

1002
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,575
About what

1003
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,343
Happening

1004
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,623
Hot on this country

1005
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,647
But in the world

1006
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,951
So he's decided on goodnight

1007
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:11,071
The owners of USA Today among other papers around the

1008
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:16,703
Country this is probably a function of the time that this was created in

1009
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,775
That you think that the singular Focus like

1010
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:26,175
I want to prioritize on somebody who owns a ton of paper as opposed to newer media

1011
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,455
Slowly gobbling up

1012
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,503
That's that it's

1013
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:30,783
Itsfunneh

1014
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,623
Sounded like a great plan in 93

1015
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:39,743
When did the decimal point get invented was that about 20

1016
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:43,583
So I think it's a problem

1017
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,679
If I check him now they're listed with not the paper though

1018
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:51,775
Oh that might be tracking the days of the News-Press

1019
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:55,103
I mean I was joking but also I wasn't sure if it's

1020
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,175
Cuz it's now it's out to like the fourth decimal point to

1021
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,759
Yeah I feel like back I don't think that doesn't seem all that foreign to me

1022
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,807
I feel like back in the day

1023
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,575
Fractions

1024
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,343
Are foreign

1025
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,903
Feel like fractions were used on stock

1026
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:12,511
Ticker is good enough for Dewey it's good enough for you

1027
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,047
So we're good we're going with Jeanette

1028
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:17,375
Now the theme that bill uses on this episode

1029
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:19,167
I don't have any clips of it

1030
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,703
We're going with

1031
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:26,335
I don't even I don't even eclipse of the musically plays but it's just from Disney

1032
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,383
When You Wish Upon a

1033
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,431
God that's so funny

1034
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,735
He has no interest in music and

1035
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,271
He reads music

1036
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,039
He doesn't

1037
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:41,439
Listen to me there's no lyrics

1038
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,463
Dislike

1039
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,815
Idealistic metaphor

1040
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:50,399
So most of this is dedicated to taking calls

1041
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,959
From people about the plan to buy Gannett

1042
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,263
And here is one caller

1043
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,823
Claims he's Bots

1044
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,591
Compares

1045
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:01,663
Not sure basic I detail

1046
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,967
I'm here

1047
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,831
Fantastic

1048
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,159
What brokerage

1049
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:16,255
Well you don't have to look it up

1050
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:17,791
What Christ

1051
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,935
Oh okay

1052
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:33,407
Did you tell him you wanted to voting shares

1053
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,039
There's nothing else lifted

1054
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:44,159
Are using else really how you feel about it

1055
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,767
I don't think I got about chairs

1056
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:56,447
Oh it's just me an Old Prospector from 1949

1057
00:52:56,703 --> 00:53:02,847
The guy

1058
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:08,735
I'm not sure.

1059
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,855
That's a guy's bacon shut up

1060
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,391
Only

1061
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:21,791
Yeah I don't know if that's the time you can put on the board or not but here's another

1062
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,327
Call her to give you a little bit of

1063
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,351
The temperature

1064
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,631
Hello

1065
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,423
Cheyenne

1066
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:33,567
Good any of you to put your Receiver right in front of your mouth

1067
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,335
Talk a little louder

1068
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,919
That's a little better

1069
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,199
Turn it off

1070
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,927
Starting to work

1071
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:52,511
Leave excited and he spread the word

1072
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,047
Also Bill might be

1073
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:59,679
Dead Prez turn off the radio

1074
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,775
So you got a guy who

1075
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,895
Stroop

1076
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,663
I do believe

1077
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,967
Bots.

1078
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,527
Another guy who's excited but hasn't bought any

1079
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,599
So so far so good for 2

1080
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:18,879
Bill

1081
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:22,463
Start you know ruminating about what's going to happen

1082
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,815
Whenever he takes over again that the cart before the horse

1083
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,839
Yeah so

1084
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:30,655
What he's going to do is he says I'm not going to

1085
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,423
The firing

1086
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:38,079
This isn't going to be a situation where I take over Gannett and then I fire everybody at all of the underlying business

1087
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,871
Although

1088
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:42,431
He turns out a lot of people would end up getting f*****

1089
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:44,991
The purchase

1090
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:45,759
Corporation

1091
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,551
Fire everybody

1092
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,087
Call the big

1093
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:49,855
Calamity

1094
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,415
What we going to do you're going to tell him what we want

1095
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,255
If we own the corporation

1096
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,023
The mirror

1097
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:57,791
For you

1098
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,071
They're going to have to do what we

1099
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,143
Like their job they will

1100
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
Play don't do it

1101
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,703
We worked in

1102
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,239
We're well within our rights

1103
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,007
We're firing you

1104
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:07,775
M4 review

1105
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,311
To change the policy

1106
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,591
With the page of ownership

1107
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,895
So you got a situation where it's like

1108
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,663
Okay

1109
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:16,223
Bill your first episode

1110
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,271
Of your broadcast

1111
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:22,879
Was about that silent weapons for quiet Wars right just fake f****** document

1112
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,695
It's easy to figure out is fake

1113
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:29,791
Now let's assume that you take over Gannett and you want USA Today too

1114
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:32,095
Publish that document on the front page

1115
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,375
As true

1116
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:37,471
Now let's assume some editor does little bit of leg work and fixtures

1117
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,495
Exactly

1118
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:42,847
Exactly

1119
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:51,295
Complete breakdown of like any kind of standards

1120
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:55,391
You turn it into the Inquirer in a week now this is me USA Today isn't even

1121
00:55:55,647 --> 00:56:01,791
Like I'm listening to this going like is this guy Jim spanfeller did did Bill Cooper fake his death and then bye

1122
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,839
Gizmodo is that what happened here

1123
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:07,679
This is insane maybe you finally figured out New Media

1124
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:11,263
So another caller calls in this dude is

1125
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,543
I think he

1126
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:15,359
Maybe more into buying shares

1127
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:17,151
He has a

1128
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:26,879
Well

1129
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:27,903
We're going to do it

1130
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:29,951
And with the help of people like you

1131
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,791
Really need it

1132
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,119
4 year

1133
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,655
I'm okay

1134
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,007
Well I think we're getting for the year

1135
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,543
We may not have fun

1136
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,591
This president

1137
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:49,407
I'm glad you called your brother

1138
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:52,479
Real greathorn and I don't normally like to

1139
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,015
You know one person

1140
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,135
This pregnant

1141
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,671
Who's president

1142
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,207
Is going to be deeper

1143
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,231
Destroyer

1144
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:03,999
Discovery

1145
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,815
That's Bill Clinton that would be built

1146
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,351
How did how did that go

1147
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,167
What year are we

1148
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:11,935
So

1149
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:18,591
Here is Bill's Cohoes whenever he goes on vacation

1150
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:31,391
The UK a little while back in the timeline

1151
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,695
She has her that I can't remember her name

1152
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:38,047
60 year old lady

1153
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,863
Schizo

1154
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,655
You know we might not have five

1155
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,191
Wait.

1156
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:47,263
We might not make it to 1998

1157
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,079
When you said that I immediately thought

1158
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,895
That he thinks that the world will end

1159
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,687
In five years

1160
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,479
If they don't purchase the country

1161
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,759
The country

1162
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:58,783
Right

1163
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:03,135
So I'm assuming that he doesn't mean we can't hold out for five years

1164
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:06,463
Monetarily but no no no we don't do this now the world

1165
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:11,327
The country won't survive because I needed the truth that badly

1166
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,607
Right right

1167
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,911
Yeah I mean videos with the other things

1168
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:18,239
That that demonstrates the one of the reasons I wanted to

1169
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,263
Keypad clip in

1170
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:24,127
Is it like this is such an intrinsic element of this kind of media

1171
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,151
Is that that

1172
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:27,455
That immediate crisis of

1173
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:30,527
Every single time there's something that they don't like

1174
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:34,623
It's This Will Destroy Everything

1175
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:38,463
Think about it that I noticed is

1176
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,231
Has to be a

1177
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,535
Apocalyptic because that's the only way

1178
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:47,935
That you can get people to unquestioningly unquestioningly believe something and unquestioningly

1179
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:48,959
Disbeliefs

1180
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,263
So that guy is literally like

1181
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:54,335
I don't trust a thing the media says

1182
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,639
Everything you say anybody

1183
00:58:56,895 --> 00:59:00,735
Possible that were buying Gannett

1184
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:04,831
What one he's part of the media whether or not you like it

1185
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,367
Yeah like that's just how it is

1186
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:13,791
So at this point bill goes to another caller it is where everything breaks really bad because this guy believes that the Jews control

1187
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:18,143
The media

1188
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,423
Yeah well enough

1189
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:25,823
Carvel

1190
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:33,759
Go ahead

1191
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:38,623
Feed bill is the kind of guy who's open to whatever

1192
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:43,231
Even if you're saying something that is maybe offensives and outside of

1193
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,535
What he wants to

1194
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,815
But talk about

1195
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,839
He takes

1196
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,631
Conversation

1197
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:52,191
Which on one level I can

1198
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,983
Now the other level

1199
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,031
There's

1200
00:59:56,287 --> 01:00:00,895
There's a real interesting situation happening here with the

1201
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:05,759
The question of do Jews control the media I feel like that question should already be answer

1202
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,039
Well here's the thing

1203
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:13,183
Bill is pushing back against this color because it's very clear that he's coming from an anti-semitic place

1204
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,231
But at the same time

1205
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,255
I think

1206
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:18,047
The bill is pushing back

1207
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,583
The wrong way

1208
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:23,167
Because what he's doing is essentially ceding the point

1209
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,471
That Jews run the media

1210
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,519
And then pushing back on

1211
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,543
Wow

1212
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:32,383
What oh what are you going to do about it

1213
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,015
No no

1214
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,295
No no no no

1215
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,063
Nothing against

1216
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:40,831
You

1217
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:43,647
I am really angry with the Americans

1218
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,671
People as a whole

1219
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,439
For being

1220
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,207
People

1221
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,231
Another word

1222
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:48,255
This is a

1223
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,279
Capitalistic

1224
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,047
Republic

1225
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,071
That we live in

1226
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:56,703
Why is everybody sitting around complaining because somebody else was smarter than them and

1227
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,471
The media

1228
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:02,079
You're really care by it back everything in this country for sale

1229
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:05,663
Everybody was complaining and railing against the Japanese

1230
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:09,503
For buying property and business is over here cool sold it to

1231
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,063
Greedy Americans

1232
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:18,207
Sure

1233
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:24,863
Wow disagreeing with this guy who lives here

1234
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,679
Falling into anti-Semitic

1235
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,239
Archetypes and believes himself it is

1236
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,031
It is a little bit like

1237
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,847
I mean

1238
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,127
It's

1239
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:42,015
It's very fascinating his his idea of like well yeah why wouldn't the Jews buy up the media that's a good investment

1240
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:44,575
What are you buying up the media

1241
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,599
I guess that's

1242
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,159
I guess it's more Progressive than

1243
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:53,279
Out note anti-Semitism but it is like well obviously the Jews control

1244
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,559
If that's the problem

1245
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:59,935
But that's because we sold it to them it's your fault that the Jews control the media that's a weird

1246
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:05,567
Way to have this rebuttal that's not still playing into anti-semitic trope

1247
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,615
And that would be to respond to him like

1248
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:12,991
Look you're wrong but let's entertain the possibility conception

1249
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:16,831
Do you know Jews control the media

1250
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:17,599
What's stopping you

1251
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,647
You from buying it back in a couple of smokes

1252
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,671
Exact

1253
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,975
Like rebuttal he's making

1254
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:25,023
Pfriem slightly differently

1255
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:29,887
To make clear that you don't believe the truth control for me

1256
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,679
Start with

1257
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:35,775
No the fact that you bought on the premises a problem

1258
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:38,079
That's weird. Weird

1259
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:41,151
At the end of this conversation bill is like

1260
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,175
Hey

1261
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,455
You hate the Jews

1262
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,991
Your real big anti-cellulite

1263
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:48,319
But how about you help us by Gannett

1264
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,111
You want to get on the bandwagon

1265
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,903
Help us we're going to buy a major

1266
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:52,927
Media Corporation

1267
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,207
And make sure they print

1268
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:54,975
The truth

1269
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:57,023
Whatever the truth may do

1270
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:00,863
30 parkour liberal

1271
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:01,887
Are meteor

1272
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,167
Corporation is NACA

1273
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:06,495
Media Corporation is going to be Armenia Corporation

1274
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:08,287
There are others but okay

1275
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,335
The truth murders on radio television

1276
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,615
Parma newspaper

1277
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,175
If you want to get on board and do something

1278
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:14,943

Will welcome your help

1280
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,759
If all you want to do is

1281
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:18,783
Complain about the Jews

1282
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,319
I am running tell you something

1283
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:23,391
The Jews have not done anything illegal

1284
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,439
They have exercised their right

1285
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,231
Under the system.

1286
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,511
Smart

1287
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:31,071
They're smart enough to stop

1288
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,095
To buy something in

1289
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:32,863
Controller

1290
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,703
And everybody else sits back and wine you're flying that plane towards the mountains deserve to

1291
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,471
Controller

1292
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,495

1301
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,255
God

1302
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:05,887
It's so weird that these terrible beliefs are there

1303
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:09,983
With the wherewithal to recognize legitly

1304
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:14,591
Anti-semitism

1305
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:15,871
It's

1306
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,663
While

1307
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:24,575
I don't understand your note for the wrong reason with him bill but it's one of the reasons

1308
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,343
Booty fascinates

1309
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,367
Because like

1310
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:32,511
There's stupid stupid beliefs that he has like the silent weapons for quiet Wars

1311
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:36,607
But at the same time whenever caller will call in and say something

1312
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,399
Absurd he'll be like

1313
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,959
Where'd you get that information or push back on

1314
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,751
On people who have fun

1315
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:48,127
Proven Theory to sell them things in a way that Alex doesn't

1316
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,919
When Alex get the caller who's like

1317
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:50,687
Hey don't

1318
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:53,759
Pop air bubbles cuz there's Chinese are there Eva Coronavirus

1319
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,807
He's like oh my God amazing

1320
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,087
Bill would never do that

1321
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,111
But Bill's

1322
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:02,207
Still believe things like silent weapon

1323
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,487
Opposed

1324
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,511
Too big

1325
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:07,583
Like you. He gives speeches sometimes about like

1326
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:10,911
White racism black racism Asian racism

1327
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,447
Anti-semitism

1328
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:16,031
All of these are inappropriate they don't have any place in society

1329
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:16,799
And yet

1330
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:23,455
You just have him eat that here to this guys complain about the Jews under the media together juice on the way because they're smart

1331
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,991
Boo are you mean

1332
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,271
I think well

1333
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:31,135
I suppose you're the only argument he could survive on is that

1334
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,951
The people who own the media

1335
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:34,975
Are Jewish

1336
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:39,071
And because they own the media they are smart

1337
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,095
Therefore

1338
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:47,007
The Jewish people are smart I guess that's what he's trying to say one of the problems with that

1339
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,287
Yeah

1340
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:51,871
Is a compound noun

1341
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:52,639
Struggle

1342
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:55,455
The phone because anti-semite I don't think he's buying

1343
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:59,295
But you got another guy I don't know who's

1344
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,855
This guy is doing the Lord's work in terms of buying

1345
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:02,623
Okay

1346
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,487
Absolutely

1347
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,023
That's the best argument

1348
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,559
That anyone

1349
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,863
Including bill is given so far

1350
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,399

01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:02,271
What it means dick

1353
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,551
It means nothing

1354
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:08,159
Terms of control of Gannett

1355
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,439
That's funny too because it

1356
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:12,255
It's like a stubborn it's a sovereign citizen

1357
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,535
Broker

1358
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:16,607
Play the market

1359
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:21,471
Naturally I've signed everything with capital letters because otherwise the government won't know it's fake

1360
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:25,055
I'm not going to leave money on the table Dan

1361
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:27,615
I'm not going to leave money on the table just because

1362
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:30,943
I think I don't need a driver's license doesn't mean I'm not going to get rich

1363
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:34,015
Well I mean like there if you know if if

1364
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:40,415
Being that you see this is a good opportunity to make some money involved

1365
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:46,815
Bill's not going to be able to buy this company but I'll join in your makeup bucks off it or whatever

1366
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:47,839
That's

1367
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:52,959
Fine. Can I make money there's no downside

1368
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,751
Why not anyway

1369
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,031

But either this is what's going to happen

1405
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:47,647

01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,135
America's doors

1478
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,183
Began confiscating weapons

1479
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,487
The blood will run

1480
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,023
SuperAmerica

1481
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,559
Now or something like Alex

1482
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,327
There we are

1483
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,607
So we had

1484
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:11,007
A newspaper has done a special issue about gun violence and Bill is

1485
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,287
Bucking Furious

1486
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,055
About this

1487
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,335
Because

1488
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,383
She loves go

1489
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:22,015
What we have here is a very Alex Jones evolve

1490
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,319
Here in January 1994

1491
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:29,439
Where Bill is saying you touch one gun streets will run red with the blood of

1492
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,975
You know whatever

1493
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:37,119
Listen to this I noticed a lot of very very familiar themes with Alex

1494
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,423
So some of this is a little bit content

1495
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:46,335
At one of the things is that bill is of the mind that all this gun crime and all this crime

1496
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,359
It's going on

1497
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,639
It being manufactured

1498
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:51,199
In order to create a problem that the

1499
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:55,295
Public will demand a solution for which is more government control dialectic

1500
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,135
Crime list

1501
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,415
Have you heard from Crete

1502
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,695
It's simply for the purpose

1503
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,999
Obtaining Americans

1504
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:07,327
Conflict

1505
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,351
Resolution

1506
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,399
Scream for more control

1507
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:12,959
So

1508
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:14,239
Voluntary

1509
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:19,871
Just a hundred percent does he think Reagan introduced crack in the black community

1510
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,663
Maybe I don't know

1511
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,455
It's Foster Reagan introduced

1512
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:30,367
I have no idea if bill has a position on that more episodes May shed light

1513
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:32,927
So they have that same sort of

1514
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:33,695
Yeah boy

1515
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:39,839
I know it's sort of trivial differences but what I really think is going on is more just bill is mad

1516
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,911
He's channeling a little bit of this

1517
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,215
Is this anger that he has with

1518
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,239
And

1519
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:52,383
I mean like I could beat around the bush all day but the reason that he's mad is that no one's buying stock

1520
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,687
And you talk about that here

1521
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:55,967
And gets

1522
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,503
F****** so bad

1523
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:58,271
What is audience

1524
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,551
Grandmother car race

1525
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:01,087
Tonight I cannot stand

1526
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:04,671
Stupidity like

1527
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,439
Scrabble

1528
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,023
That's what I see

1529
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,607
I gave you all the answer on this

1530
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,375
Program

1531
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,167
Several months ago

1532
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,447
The answer

1533
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,775
A few Noble coals went out

1534
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,543
Followed

1535
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:21,823
Mark Lamb

1536
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:23,615
Ellen Rucker

1537
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,783
The newspaper that I'm quoting from iPhone with every page

1538
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:35,903
Topeka bear arms is USA Today owned by Gannett company

1539
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:41,023
Proposed

1540
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:49,471
That is Juicy as a narrative and ironic twist that is just perfect

1541
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,751
That is perfect

1542
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:57,407
I have warned you guys that we need to purchase Gannett and then three months later we haven't

1543
01:14:57,663 --> 01:15:03,807
Purchase Gannett and they have done the exact opposite of what it is I would have asked so let's imagine a scenario Pearl

1544
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,599
Emerald where you buy Gannett

1545
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:11,999
Give me the three months able to completely control the editorial editorial

1546
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,047
Great Imaginext

1547
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:16,095
Man somehow here's the weirdest

1548
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:16,863
Somehow I

1549
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:17,631
I kind of

1550
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,423
I would prefer

1551
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,471
Bill's reaction to

1552
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:25,311
Calling people super predators

1553
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,103
It didn't it didn't go well

1554
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:27,871
For

1555
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,663
The early night

1556
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:30,943
I wouldn't suggest

1557
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,223
Recommend

1558
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,247
Screenshot

1559
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:36,831
So what you end up with AIDS Village Furious

1560
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:37,599
Because

1561
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,135
You see this gun

1562
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,415
Control gun

1563
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:43,743
Issue gun violence issue of USA Today

1564
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:44,767
He's recognized

1565
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:51,423
I tried to buy USA Today didn't work out

1566
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,751
Listeners have to pay

1567
01:15:57,055 --> 01:16:03,199
It's so fascinating to me that what he's mad at me he's mad at the Articles and he's mad at USA

1568
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:03,967
Today obviously

1569
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:06,527
Play please really mad at his audience

1570
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:09,599
Because he seems to feel like they have failed him

1571
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:12,671
And being able to stop that issue from existing

1572
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:14,463
It gets into that a little bit here

1573
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:17,023
You followed my advice if you have done this

1574
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,327
But that you could never have

1575
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,399
Never happen

1576
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,959
It's good to have an article

1577
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,287
A large particle

1578
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,847
Wayne the real purpose

1579
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,127
The second article

1580
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,407
And amendments and why it is

1581
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,687
Nefertari

1582
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,479
Never relinquish their rights

1583
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,503
Bear arms

1584
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:44,159
Because we

1585
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:48,511
What is the articles in the paper are Acura

1586
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:52,607
What if he's articles about.

1587
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:56,447
So you would just like sensor

1588
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:59,263
Things about the negative parts of God

1589
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:05,663
In service of pushing your pro-gun agenda and have you never heard what justifies the means

1590
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:08,479
Why is it not possible to have a publication

1591
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:13,087
In your idealized world where you do talk about the fact there is gun violence in

1592
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:16,671
Something needs to be done about it but also the Second Amendment is important

1593
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:23,071
Why is it impossible never works that way even in Bill sort of like weird idealized

1594
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:25,887
A version of we have control over a net

1595
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:28,191
Doesn't come into like a new w

1596
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,983
Gone absolutely

1597
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:38,687
Let's say an authoritarian type of rule over the editorial

1598
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:42,271
Going through that we we spent so much time talking about Alex and

1599
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:46,879
It wasn't it was for awhile before I was like oh this guy's out now fascist

1600
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:49,951
But if we listen to this clip right here and be like oh

1601
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,743
So the hard right wing

1602
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:55,071
Wants complete control over what people

1603
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:55,839
Here

1604
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,423
Google jit patches and

1605
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,959
Bill Watts

1606
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:07,359
He's audience to pay for it and have no saying and give it to him

1607
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:16,063
This isn't this is a fascist dictator old people for not making him a fascist dictator

1608
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:18,367
Plain about communism and like

1609
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:20,415
These deserve like pineapples

1610
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:23,743
Revolution communism

1611
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:28,351
Millions of people that come together and give me their money right and I say take

1612
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:30,911
Sole control think about what happened with the b*******

1613
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:37,311
Civic sedan see that's the thing is they talk about these like negative historical events

1614
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:42,175
Exactly he's trying to recreate it

1615
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:48,575
It's not even it's a one-to-one dictator in a certain scent

1616
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:52,671
Through the work of false populism

1617
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:55,487
This nonsense and you tell funny

1618
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:58,815
God damn mad

1619
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:02,143
I would assume a large part of it is a people wanted to or would have

1620
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:08,543
Supported him but didn't have the financial means to or unfamiliarity with the stock market it's something that

1621
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:09,567
If you're not

1622
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:12,127
A stock person it's easy

1623
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,407
The

1624
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:18,783
Border of Entry is tough already involved

1625
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,319
First one

1626
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:23,903
Trying to talk you don't know exactly who to talk to you don't know

1627
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:30,303
The process of it I think it's probably a lot of his audience

1628
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:33,631
And of course they're the type of people who hide their money under a match

1629
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:38,751
What are you going to do give them out there to paper that says it's money

1630
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:46,175
He's mad at them for not getting over that hurdle without realizing that like

1631
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:52,831
Most of them can't yeah you're asking them to do something that is outside of the programming

1632
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:55,135
You offer that bike

1633
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:59,999
Even earlier in this episode was talking about buying gold inside don't let someone else hold your gold yet are you

1634
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,279
Hold it yourself

1635
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,303
How do stocks work

1636
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:04,607
Imaginarium holding

1637
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:11,007
Hard money of the hard right

1638
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:13,567
He's asking people to

1639
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:19,712
Go against what they're inclined to do right now these mad at them for not doing it

1640
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:26,112
Because he wanted the power to stop this anti-gun an anti-gun put the

1641
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:28,416
He perceives to be Antigone

1642
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:30,720
It's it's very weird it is

1643
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:32,000
It is so

1644
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,048
Applicable because it is

1645
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,072
Him saying

1646
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:38,656
I want you my audience to abandon your principles

1647
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,448
Order

1648
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,216
That I

1649
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:46,080
In order for me to then Institute your principal

1650
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:52,992
Like it is absolutely it's literally the Bolshevik Revolution it's incredible it's big brother

1651
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:53,760
Bananas

1652
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:58,624
This is like if Don Quixote was pissed at horses for not helping him by a windmill

1653
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,904
Like it's insane

1654
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:00,672
That works

1655
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:02,976
So surprised

1656
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,024
So earlier

1657
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,072
In the beginning of this back in October

1658
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:09,120
He needs 10%

1659
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:11,424
Of a company to have control of it

1660
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:14,240
Yeah

1661
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,520
When we begin

1662
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:19,360
Gannett Company Incorporated stock was selling at $50 per share

1663
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,456
We only need to Garner 15% of the stock to

1664
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,248
Effectively control the corporation

1665
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,016
Uh-oh

1666
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,808
The girl throwing it 50

1667
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,856
7 and 1/4 / share

1668
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:32,160
Sovereign citizen broker made from Bank

1669
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,440
At 4 p.m.

1670
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:34,976
New York time

1671
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:40,864
So now you need 15% it seems like these numbers are arbitrary

1672
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,680
But the other thing to Zack if you look at this

1673
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:50,080
The stock is up $7 the only thing they've done is GameStop

1674
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:53,152
I'm so mad at you

1675
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:59,552
The only functional thing that this has achieved is Bill is angry and Cadet stock

1676
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:08,000
That is exactly how that would go that's exactly how that would go

1677
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,304
Physicist Bill himself in the face like it's

1678
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:16,192
Goldberg

1679
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:22,592
All these Byzantine Roots the ball goes down and then at the end he just gets slapped

1680
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:28,992
It's so funny to me that if you would talk to an economic advisor who was it with Severance it isn't hard to catch you they would have been like

1681
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,528
Here's what's going to happen

1682
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,064
And then 86

1683
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,088
Exactly what would happen

1684
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,880
You're gorgeous

1685
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:41,280
Some people who are going to join up with you to end up buying a bit of stock value of

1686
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:43,072
Woodstock

1687
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:49,728
And that's going to price out people who otherwise would have joined to possibly

1688
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:56,128
Make more money and you are going to do nothing you're just doing free work for Dano fun it's all yours

1689
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:58,176
What

1690
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:04,320
You have to do it now just made more money for USA Today

1691
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:07,904
You funded Sagano

1692
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:10,208
Now Bill I'm going to say this to you right now

1693
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:10,976
And this is my pee

1694
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,560
Get all 1.3 million people together

1695
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:15,584
Before

1696
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,632
Don't have people

1697
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:21,216
Trickle into the bags.

1698
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:25,056
Work buddy that would be difficult to do because then you know that

1699
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:28,384
Possible to do Dan and that's why he shouldn't have tried

1700
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,176
Number one would be impossible

1701
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:34,528
Also when you have 1.3 billion people all gathered together

1702
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,296
And they're like

1703
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,600
Let's give control to one guy

1704
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:38,880
It becomes more,

1705
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:45,280
What's the reality of a we could buy

1706
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,096
Also

1707
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:49,120
While we're here

1708
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:52,448
The people who are going to be in that 1.3 million

1709
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:56,288
Are people who listen to Bill Cooper probably take

1710
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:58,336
One and a half second before they like

1711
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:04,992
FBI informant even if they trust Bill implicitly they don't

1712
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:05,760
Trust

1713
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:08,576
30% is that 1.3 million

1714
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:14,464
0% seems low so bill is mad but he wants to start over

1715
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,024
He wants to he wants to speak out again

1716
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:23,424
Everybody sell your stock no no you had to hold it but we're going to do it

1717
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:26,240
Alright okay and if you don't

1718
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,312
Bill is going to

1719
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,080
F******

1720
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:30,848
Destroyer

1721
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,152
I'm going to tell you about this Corporation

1722
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:36,736
I'm going to tell you that if we don't do it.

1723
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:38,528
Carmen if you don't get off your butts

1724
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:44,160
To your churches in your organization's and everybody else who's sitting around in this country

1725
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:46,208
Dream about the media

1726
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:50,304
Bitching about what they did on television bitching about what's in the news

1727
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,072
Papers

1728
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:55,424
Everytime I hear you b**** I'm going to

1729
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,704
Laugh Loudoun

1730
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,776
Loud and clear white in your face

1731
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:04,896
Because you would have proven to me answer the world into our enemies but you are not

1732
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:08,736
You are not worthy

1733
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:12,832
To be treated as people

1734
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,392
Parkland High School

1735
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,416
Bruce Arians

1736
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:17,440
Affairs of running

1737
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,208
Your country

1738
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:25,376
Are you will prove that the Illuminati are correct

1739
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:29,216
Use their intelligence are no better than animals who do not have in Telugu

1740
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:32,288
Such people are Straits on the table and be

1741
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,080
Of Burden by choice

1742
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:40,224
That's what they think of you everyday you prove them right

1743
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:46,368
That's a quote from silent weapons for quiet Wars that's not a real Illuminati thing but builds dumb

1744
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,184
This is where Bill starts to feel a lot like Ally

1745
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,000
This is the guy

1746
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:58,400
But what it is is like a guy who feels betrayed his own psychodrama that's playing

1747
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:01,216
Now he feels like his audience has let him down

1748
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,496
Now we're going to do this again

1749
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:03,776
We're going to try

1750
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,800
Forgot to buy Gannett

1751
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,080
If you don't buy shares

1752
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,616
You'll get every one of your church.

1753
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,384
Buy shares

1754
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,920
Then you aren't human

1755
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:11,456
And you don't give a f*** about America

1756
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:14,016
That might be an overreaction if you don't

1757
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:16,576
Worried about a woman president

1758
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:19,136
I mean

1759
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:24,000
This is this is narcissism

1760
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,280
Let me run this by you

1761
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,560
I actually think I could

1762
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:28,352
Make this a workable plan

1763
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,656
Still impossible but far more workable

1764
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,424
2020

1765
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:32,448
Here's what we do

1766
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,216
Okay alright

1767
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:39,104
We get a sufficient number of people not to be 1.3 million but it's going to be less 100,000

1768
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:41,408
Right we buy plenty of stock

1769
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,456
Then all at once

1770
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,224
We sell

1771
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:48,832
Because of the way the algorithms run the market now that's going to artificially deflate

1772
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:55,232
The price then we get a slightly larger number of people to buy more stock at a lower price that's

1773
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:57,792
Making it more affordable then we do that at

1774
01:26:58,048 --> 01:27:04,192
Over and over again later we do the same thing goes down its Market makes

1775
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:07,008
Call Wilder

1776
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,800
All the sudden is yes I am

1777
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:09,824
Describe a Bitcoin

1778
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:17,504
This is really real

1779
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:23,904
This is this is the point at which I like really in this Saga felt like this is so

1780
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:29,024
If I were Alex and I had the same issues that Alex

1781
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:32,352
I was listening to this guy I would really identify with

1782
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:34,656
Totally right

1783
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:43,104
He should be mad why didn't people join up with his exotic Quest

1784
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:47,456
It just feels so Alex

1785
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:49,760
If you ever call us and complain about anything

1786
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,784
I'm going to ask you first

1787
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,064
Do you own shares and going to

1788
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,088
Incorporated

1789
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:55,904
Do we have your puppy to both your stuff

1790
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:59,488
If you say no we're going to hang up on you because we don't

1791
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:01,536
Even want to talk to stupid fool

1792
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,264
#neverbiden

1793
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:14,336
You could save this nation

1794
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:16,128
Are you a fortune

1795
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:17,408
OK Google

1796
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,688
Somebody making you

1797
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:21,760
You do it and I don't care if you hate my guts I love my country

1798
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:28,928
Show me the most hated man in the world if I have to

1799
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,464
The Constitution

1800
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,232
The Bill of Rights

1801
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:33,536
That feels so much like Alex

1802
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:39,168
Yep that martyrdom essay said false martyrdom welcome your hate

1803
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:43,008
And I do not care for those who are not true believers

1804
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:44,544
I will have this in

1805
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,872
Incredibly artificial cross that I'm bearing

1806
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:50,432
And I will make sure you make a note of it

1807
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:53,760
Because otherwise you're a f****** a******

1808
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:54,784
It's

1809
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,064
Pizza it's ludicrous

1810
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:58,368
That's something that I

1811
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:01,696
Listen to and I recognize so much of that like

1812
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:03,488
Bernie or bust thought process

1813
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,512
That I'm seeing.

1814
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,536
There where it's just like

1815
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:10,912
If you guys do your b******* then f*** you I don't have any

1816
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:15,008
But I know that the difference between that and bills version

1817
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:18,336
Good words like I'm going to hang up on you until you go fuc

1818
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,896
Because you weren't part of their true believers

1819
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:22,688
The difference for me is like

1820
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:24,224
I know for a fact that

1821
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:28,064
The when Biden gets his ass kicked or whatever happens

1822
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,856
Though Bernie people are going to be like

1823
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:32,416
Haha I Told You So now how can we help

1824
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:37,792
The stakes are also the stakes are also quite different

1825
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:41,376
Imagine world

1826
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:44,704
There's no outcome

1827
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:46,496
Of this that

1828
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:47,264
Positive

1829
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:49,056
Right really

1830
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,848
Well

1831
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:51,872
There's no outcome

1832
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:01,600
So a bill is just f****** mad

1833
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:04,160
Most of the show is just being like

1834
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:09,792
The f****** if you don't buy the stock in the company and sign over your rights to this to me

1835
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:13,888
Shut up a default righteousness

1836
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:15,424
Is on May 4th night

1837
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,704
1694

1838
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,288
And whether you know it or not you're going to purchase

1839
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:21,568
Soccer

1840
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:22,336
Incorporated

1841
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:26,432
The American stockholders what's that mean

1842
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:27,456
And we are going

1843
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:29,248
Garner control events company

1844
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:32,320
And we are going to the real truth and the real news

1845
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:36,928
And the newspapers and on the television sets and on the radio station

1846
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:38,464
Coconut Company Incorporated

1847
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:41,280
Across this country and we're going to use those billboards

1848
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,584
For construct

1849
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,352
Purposes

1850
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:46,912
And we are going to turn this

1851
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:49,728
Country around are we are going to shut our

1852
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:54,848
And put the things around our ankles

1853
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:02,016
So far

1854
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:03,296
You all have been

1855
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:08,416
Daddy's disappointed you

1856
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:13,280
The Constitution with Bill of Rights you profess to want to do something you don't ever do a damn thing

1857
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,584
If you don't like the language

1858
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:17,120
You change the station

1859
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,056
I'm angry

1860
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:29,408
I'm tired of listen to your thigh and kitchen mon

1861
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:31,968
I'm tired of just stop calling me

1862
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:35,040
Took all your problems and save your country for you

1863
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:36,832
I'm sick of it

1864
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:39,648
You're going to get off your butt and you're going to help are you going to shut up and put

1865
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:40,672
Change run your ankle

1866
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:41,952
One of the two

1867
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:45,536
Going to bring this to a head right now

1868
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:49,120
Peter gets bergner help save this country

1869
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:50,400
Shut up

1870
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:51,680
I become a good little

1871
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:52,448
Play

1872
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:54,752
Bill Gates Twitter

1873
01:31:55,520 --> 01:32:01,664
This is the thing that's another like real emotional commonality and

1874
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:08,832
God I can't even imagine like

1875
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:13,184
Let's imagine some weird scenario wherein like literally everybody who supports

1876
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:19,584
Donate to knowledge fight right now you are you know you're a coward At You song

1877
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,632
Call Valic

1878
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:26,496
That would be the equivalent 141 take to be like

1879
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:28,032
The act like that

1880
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:30,080
I don't know I can't even comprehend that

1881
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:32,384
It's horrifying

1882
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,456
Now that I really do have that corollary of that

1883
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:37,504
Literally what it would be it would be us

1884
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:40,832
Yelling at every listener who does not donate

1885
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,136
Even a dollar or whatever it is

1886
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:44,672
And just be like

1887
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:45,952
You guys

1888
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:52,352
Love Alex Jones fight against Alex

1889
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:56,448
Ratatata if you don't don't if you're not human don't subscribe

1890
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:59,520
Dead to me you're a cattle your Sheep, Co

1891
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:02,592
That is ridiculous I can't imagine how you get there

1892
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:04,128
Well I mean I think

1893
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:05,152
Gradual

1894
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:08,224
Cut I do

1895
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:14,624
About now 10 years from now somebody's doing knowledge fight knowledge fight like and this is where they started to go downhill

1896
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:20,768
Really don't think it comes on overnight but I think that by degrees you and out like sort of

1897
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,304
Buying your own s***

1898
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,840
To such an extent

1899
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:24,608
That

1900
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:27,680
What bill is talked it up in his head obviously

1901
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:34,080
From the conception the germination of this idea in October 93 to the point where it now in

1902
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:36,384
Weary where it's like this is the

1903
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,152
Answer

1904
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,480
And it's the answer because I have decided it's B

1905
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:43,040
He answered up and anybody who doesn't agree with me

1906
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:43,808
Is

1907
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:44,576
Cattle

1908
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:45,856
The well is

1909
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:51,232
Do a subversive person

1910
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:53,024
But that's a thing

1911
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:57,888
I know you probably like the militias you agree on right-wing stuff and all that

1912
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:59,936
You call in and you didn't buy it

1913
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:03,008
Call fuckyourself good night with your chat yet

1914
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,312
Yep it's it's

1915
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:10,688
And you know what it's ludicrous because bills on the air until he dies in 2001

1916
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:14,784
Did he know

1917
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:15,808
First of all no

1918
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:22,208
Also bill doesn't keep being like answering every call would like to do by Gannett stock

1919
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,352
Yeah of course it is embarrassing

1920
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:30,912
Answer lashing out then and that's another

1921
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:31,680
That big

1922
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:33,216
Commonality between him and Alex

1923
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:34,240
They lash out

1924
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:36,544
Their individual personal

1925
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:37,568
Problem

1926
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:38,848
Am feeling

1927
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,152
Need to be vented out

1928
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:42,176
And

1929
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:44,480
The audience needs to feel those things

1930
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:46,784
Or else they can't handle whatever you're going through

1931
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:51,136
Like as much as Bill appears to be more of an adult in

1932
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:53,952
You read long passages he's literate

1933
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:56,256
Yeah it's still like

1934
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,024
He's a baby

1935
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,048
He's a baby

1936
01:34:58,304 --> 01:35:04,448
He comes up with these ideas like I would have by this media thing because a bunch of people signed a petition to of something I

1937
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,216
I was going to do

1938
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:06,752
And that means that I can

1939
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:09,312
Raise 800 million dollars

1940
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:14,432
The anything when it doesn't happen he lashes out like a like a child yeah it's

1941
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:17,248
It's still the emotional intelligence of

1942
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,528
Somebody who

1943
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:24,928
Needs to grow the f****** absolutely that's that's such a that's such a good point just because that that

1944
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,744
Veneer of literacy and

1945
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:34,144
Consistency at all that's like legit service like he was in that he was in Vietnam

1946
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,936
Bitter respect about that certainly

1947
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:37,728
And all of that can

1948
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,520
Cloud U2 the rest

1949
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:40,544
You know like it's

1950
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,312
It's like

1951
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:44,128
Somebody doing a profile on Richard Spencer where you're like

1952
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:49,504
Look at the new alt right or whatever and it's like see he's literate and he's got all this s***

1953
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:50,528
And that

1954
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:53,600
Tricks you into accepting that

1955
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:54,624
This is a

1956
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,160
Fine human being

1957
01:35:56,416 --> 01:36:02,560
And a lot of things and a lot of the information about what a what a whiny races baby he is behind the scene

1958
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:08,960
Maybe isn't available when you're writing that piece

1959
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:12,288
In the same way that like with Bill IQ of course I

1960
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:13,824
You should assume

1961
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:15,360
That this guy

1962
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:17,920
Is the guy who would act like this

1963
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:18,688
You know it

1964
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:21,760
But if he doesn't for long enough you're like

1965
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,064
Yeah cuz you're the type

1966
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,368
Type of person who wants to believe other people

1967
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:31,232
And I still think he's interesting and I still think there's a lot of worthwhile things in terms of

1968
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,768
Discussing some of the beliefs

1969
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:33,792
That he has

1970
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:35,072
Yes but like don't get it

1971
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:37,632
This is this is part of a real Bilko

1972
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:41,216
All of it

1973
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:43,520
Three months

1974
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:45,568
Arc over his career like

1975
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:49,408
So we have one last night but it's basically I'm saying that if you don't buy stocks

1976
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:52,736
To get him control of goodnight your dad

1977
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,528
You must make a choice at this moment

1978
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,064
You must

1979
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,880
Destroyer arguments Tuesday

1980
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:01,696
Stand up and take whatever risk you need to

1981
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:02,464
You take

1982
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:03,744
Your fight on the side

1983
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:04,512
Right

1984
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,048
Mark Gaynor

1985
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,328
Company Incorporated

1986
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:09,632
Rock the first thing tomorrow morning Joe

1987
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,912
Anybody ever call us

1988
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:14,240
Communicate with us unless you have done that because we don't

1989
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,008
Good morning

1990
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,360
We don't need money

1991
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:21,664
That was

1992
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,480
Sad that we don't even want to hear from you

1993
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:25,760
Sad

1994
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:32,160
You don't even I don't even believe it now like as as delivered I don't believe that

1995
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:34,720
But it's so lashing out

1996
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:35,744
It's so

1997
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,280
Yeah petulant

1998
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:38,560
Absolutely

1999
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:45,472
And I think that's that's part of what underlies a lot of these these folks

2000
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:52,128
In therapy Indianola Catholic I have a little better handle on some of my emotional response

2001
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:55,712
I'm not like some sort of paragon of maturity

2002
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:57,760
I wouldn't ever pretend

2003
01:37:58,016 --> 01:38:02,112
You see this and I think I think that a lot of these people who dwell in these world

2004
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,136
Have just

2005
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:05,184
Incredible unexamined

2006
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,464
And undealt with

2007
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:13,376
About Shameless cause a certain amount of delay

2008
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:15,424
Develop

2009
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:21,568
I certainly don't have any expertise in the field or

2010
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:26,944
Enough information to really figure this out but I would suspect based on

2011
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,504
Somebody the information I can find about Bill

2012
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,528
And Alex

2013
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:36,928
That maybe that's a commonality maybe maybe folks who are drawn towards this megalomaniacal

2014
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:38,976
Individualistic

2015
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:40,512
Conspiracy theory

2016
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:46,912
Are Shiba maybe it's a product of unresolved

2017
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:49,984
Yeah I have it maybe it is a function of

2018
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,264
Being stuck

2019
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:52,544
Ena

2020
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,824
13

2021
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,872
You're alright emotional

2022
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:58,176
Yeah no I didn't I

2023
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:59,712
Genuinely understand

2024
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:00,736
His his

2025
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,272
Feelings on that like

2026
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:03,552
That's

2027
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:04,320
That like

2028
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:06,368
If you're not doing this

2029
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,904
Then you are

2030
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:12,000
Also responsible for what happens to

2031
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:14,816
You might as well be a

2032
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:17,632
There are so many times where I am

2033
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,912
Like looking around them like

2034
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:23,264
There are people in still in cages

2035
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:25,312
Why are we doing

2036
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:30,176
And if you're not actively fighting if you're not doing something if you're not trying

2037
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,968
What the f*** are you for

2038
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:33,248
Why are you involved in this

2039
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:36,832
And then you stop for one second and is an adult you're like

2040
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:37,856
F******

2041
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:39,392
It's a struggle

2042
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:41,440
It's a struggle for people

2043
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,464
People who want

2044
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,488
To do something

2045
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,768
Sometimes they just f***

2046
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:49,120
Well that catalog for this

2047
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:50,656
Is Bill realizing

2048
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:55,520
Find 10% stock is not going to give me control of all of the child companies

2049
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:57,568
What am I doing

2050
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,104
It's weird

2051
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:05,760
So I think these weird emotional commonalities and sort of spiritual commonalities you can find

2052
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:07,040
Find it

2053
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:08,576
Yeah

2054
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:12,160
But at the same time this is such an intrinsic difference

2055
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:13,440
That like

2056
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,256
Again as much as we've laughed

2057
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:17,792
Abell is a dumb idea

2058
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:20,864
It's very ill-fated

2059
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:22,912
That's what I'm saying exactly

2060
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:25,728
The way that he responded to the question

2061
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:29,568
Did both him and Alex had to answer the question is

2062
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,872
Media doesn't want you what are you going to do

2063
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:33,920
You want to be a voice in Media

2064
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:35,456
In a certain

2065
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:39,808
Genre companies

2066
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:41,856
Don't want anything to do with you because

2067
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,624
You're lying

2068
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,648
Or your job

2069
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:46,208
And also saw the ideas you have our date

2070
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:49,536
They don't want to publicize your promote you

2071
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,560
What are you going to do

2072
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:51,584
Alex

2073
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,632
It seems like most of his career

2074
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:55,936
Is entirely been individualistic

2075
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:56,960
And like

2076
01:40:57,472 --> 01:41:00,288
Just I'm going to create my Empire it will be my Empire

2077
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:03,360
Build seems to want to co-op

2078
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:06,688
Which is the other option I which is a better option

2079
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:11,296
Sort of misguided the way he applies it yeah

2080
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:14,368
As he blames more about what his actual plan is

2081
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:20,768
It's really just I want my Empire to be good that

2082
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:21,536
That differ

2083
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:26,400
But no Alex wanted to build an Empire and Bill kind of was like What if we

2084
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:32,800
Concord and Empire you guys ever consider that Jefferson consider Conquest what if I use what if I use my audiences real

2085
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:37,920
Resources in order to hostile takeover Empire

2086
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:42,016
Ensign collectively it'll be ours but I'm the only one who will be able to do anything

2087
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:48,416
Never heard of a situation where collectively people all got together but only one guy wound up being able to make the decision they noise

2088
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:50,976
Heard these guys complain a lot about Collective

2089
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:55,328
Anyway

2090
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:00,704
I just thought this was one of the more interesting things that I've stumbled across in terms of like listening to Bill

2091
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:03,776
I think there's a lot more like

2092
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:07,360
Compelling and important things to talk about in terms of like

2093
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:11,968
His actual believes in his worldview but this was like really a thorn

2094
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:14,784
In my in my back unit like

2095
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:17,088
I got to talk about him trying to buy them

2096
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:23,488
Like 4 months ago

2097
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,792
This is amazing Bill Cooper

2098
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:27,072
Literally

2099
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:33,216
Thought it was a good idea to buy a media Outlet that's fantastic

2100
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:34,752
This is great stuff

2101
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:37,312
You mean like I forgot all kinds of it

2102
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:43,968
On Friday folks

2103
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,552
