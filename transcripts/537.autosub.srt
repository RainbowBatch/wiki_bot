35
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,232
She was always very nice

36
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,096

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,872
Expect and I think that

49
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,152
Sometimes you fish

00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,688

Once you know more about fisting you know you're in a good time

It was as good as advertised

92
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,055
What was it what did Patton call it

93
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
It's like the

94
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Devil reading

95
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
His memoirs

96
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,711

97
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,807

Okay Boardwalk

103
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327

Jordan

00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Kim

106
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,543
Is that literally Joakim Noah know it's not better for the Bulls team in the early aughts whenever

107
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,127
Derrick Rose Road

108
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,687
Because this is Joakim from Denmark

109
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,511
Heroin

110
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,119
Freakishly large

111
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
Very much

112
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,775
Canjo came specifically

113
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:40,639
If you can I assume all joachim's do each other hook me up with Joakim Noah

114
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
Great fantastic

115
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,479
Center for the Bulls in the early aughts when Derrick Rose

116
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,575
I feel like a friend of mine had a story about run

117
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,391
Into him the long room

118
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,463
Oh yeah that bar on Irving Park

119
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,279
Seem to recall the story about that

120
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,815
Who never wanted to know if it's true

121
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Number two

122
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
Don't remember the story

123
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,263
I don't know

124
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,567
Again story might not be true and I

125
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
I don't remember the story

126
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
Betty White Jordans

127
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
February 24th

128
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
This year

129
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
2021

130
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,783
Infowars released a video titled quote

131
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
Video sharks in the world

132
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
!

133
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
Alex Jones predict

134
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
Covid lockdown

135
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,183
In 2010

136
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:29,023
This is a three-minute clip taken from Alex's July 6th

137
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,559
16th 2010 show

138
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,863
And this is a little bit rare little bit unconventional

139
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
But I want to play the

140
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
Entire thing for you

141
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
BB launching off

142
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
Point for this

143
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
Entire episode

144
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
So it's important

145
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,383
But we give a fair hearing the original Source material

146
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
How long is this

147
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687
3 minutes and 20

148
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,479
Brutal sorry alright

149
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:54,879
Let's do it there is a war on for your mind

150
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,415
Information is powerful

151
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,719
And I hope that you pay attention

152
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
Because I've had chills

153
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
Since last night

154
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,959
This just confirms everything else we've already researched

155
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:15,103
She envisions future dictatorship control by Elite

156
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,175
Millions being killed mandatory quarantine check

157
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,967
Appoints the end of the family

158
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,271
Everything that's in the other documents but

159
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:33,023
The hell already living in this is going to continue to intensify until we take our government back

160
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,607
From these Eugenics Madmen with that story is up on Prison Planet

161
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:43,007
Dot-com the question is will you have the courage to really do the research yourself because I don't want you to just sit here and here

162
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
Near me make these claims

163
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
These people are so arrogant

164
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:52,735
But they write policy papers so many of them that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white paper

165
00:08:54,783 --> 00:09:00,927
It is an open conspiracy against you and your family I pray to God

166
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:07,071
I pray to my father Jesus Christ every night to give me strength and the will build

167
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:13,727
Give me the strength to carry on because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and

168
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:18,591
Comment on the YouTube videos are on message boards and I'm a liar

169
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,151
I know because it's scary

170
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,551
You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore

171
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,439
You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends not to be able to just

172
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:41,119
Go out and enjoy yourself all the time

173
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
Dictatorship

174
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:48,031
The time to incrementally enslave you

175
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,103
Mentally psychologically physically spiritually

176
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,479
The defeated is for the rank-and-file of this planet

177
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,527
Realize that

178
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,343
You have a choice to make what your destiny is going to be

179
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:08,255
Once you face this about that works

180
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:14,655
What else what else could it be

181
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:21,055
We got to get past the artificial stigma that the control corporate media has been putting out for decades

182
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:27,455
Dictatorship

183
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,415

00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
With vitamin K

190
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,383
For your amusement

191
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,503
The reason at the end

192
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,575
I heard that video the first thing

193
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
Stuck out to me was

194
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,463
That seemed strange to me and it made me suspect that Alex in 2010

195
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,255
Not have been talking about exactly what

196
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,047
Do you want people in 20 21 22

197
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
I think he was talking to

198
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,351
Believe some things

199
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
Details here and there.

200
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:24,799
The second thing that caught my ear was helvegen almost formulaic this coverage of the Rockefeller document was back in 20

201
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,383
Was this really as deep as Alex got into the document that

202
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,431
Supposedly demonstrates an outline

203
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
The globalist evil plans

204
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
Is in

205
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:37,599
Anyway believable that if he consider this document to be anything even

206
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
Close to that but he wasn't able to

207
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
Find the clip of him that has more

208
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,791
That was soft yeah that was a big load of nothing

209
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
Is Alden sit right with me

210
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
This is apparently a video that shocked the world

211
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
This is supposed to be Alex dropping the mic

212
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
Proven that he was always on the lock

213
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Operation walk

214
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,079
And that's you totally wasn't doing about everything you're saying now cuz dog

215
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
Don't come true in the future

216
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,407
That's the underlying argument

217
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
It's being made by this video

218
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,735
And it felt dishonest to me

219
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Surprise

220
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,855
I wanted to understand the larger context so I went back

221
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,903
To this and let me spoil this

222
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
A little bit

223
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
My suspicions

224
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,231
We're not unfounded

225
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:22,143
Give some background about what was going on around this time if you're listening to Alex's show the only real world

226
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,447
Actual Edline is that the Deepwater Horizon

227
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,751
Oil spill was ongoing

228
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:31,359
And BP had announced the day prior to this episode that they had successfully

229
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
The spell

230
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Which represents

231
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
Progress store

232
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
Resolving

233
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,807
Alex also mentioned the car bombing in Mexico that was carried out by cartels

234
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,855
But he doesn't really dwell on the story much

235
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
Outside of that

236
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,695
I'm not sure we get much else in the way of news

237
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,743
You know who else predicted a pandemic

238
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,071
That would be the CDC when they made up

239
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
Plan for how to

240
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,887
Deal with a pandemic that was

241
00:12:55,167 --> 00:13:00,287
Really important Ilse a certain time. Whenever it was ignored and

242
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
Mistaken the CDC cuts

243
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,967
Basically their job to plan for things that are going to

244
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,831
Here we get to we're starting here on July 16th 2010

245
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,135
The David all that is taken

246
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
Confirm

247
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,439
For Alex is very

248
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,743
Moodily

249
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Discord

250
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,119
Here is the beginning of the show Alex driving is

251
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Story

252
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,287
And I have all the vital stacks of information here in front of me that we're going to be covering

253
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:36,127
BP claims for the first time in 80 plus days

254
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
Have stopped

255
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
The leak

256
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,551
At least three times

257
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,111
In the last 87

258
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
Plus

259
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,303
That alone is weird to me

260
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
First of all

261
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,423
Weed story is the BP oil spill on the day that he supposedly breaking these.

262
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,751
Yeah well I mean destruction of

263
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,287
The family in quarantine

264
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,823
Teens inhaling of all the p

265
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
People that's

266
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
Race

267
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
The other thing that I think is super weird about that

268
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:14,015
The clip is the way that Alex seems to be willing to give BP the benefit of the doubt

269
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,063
About whether or not they'd sealed the leak

270
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
Well I mean

271
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
BP's

272
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,927
Leak happening makes oil prices

273
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
Is go down right

274
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
Prefers oil

275
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:28,095
Alex has sources he has documents he knows everything he's kind of psychic

276
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,423
Will see it

277
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,751
Well that's weird

278
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:40,383
I certainly hope I certainly hope the Pennzoil company

279
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:47,295
You got to give BP the better than I thought that was weird

280
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:51,391
Is Hell British Petroleum is one word away from British is realism

281
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Some dad and that's

282
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:52,927
Basically what

283
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
So

284
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,047
Alex does get to the Rockefeller document pretty

285
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,839
It is the second headline

286
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,911
Buddy's got although I'm not sure he's ready

287
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,215
I'm not sure he knows much about it

288
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:11,359
I was here in the office last night when Aaron Dykes and I were doing research for the

289
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,175
Full-spectrum dominance Eugenics film

290
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,503
We are working on that deals with other issues

291
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:22,367
And we've come across so much more information that are

292
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
Earnest

293
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,743
The globalist master plan is

294
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,535
Growing exponentially

295
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,095
Don't think you ever know everything

296
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,631
The more we learn

297
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:38,239
Add more horrified we get to discover that things are far worse than originally thought

298
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:45,151
Rockefeller Foundation document over to Paul Watson wrote a story about it this morning

299
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,735
And just everything we talked about here

300
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,527
The magnet

301
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,855
I mean I'm not even information

302
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,951
And I hope that

303
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
Because I've had chills

304
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
Since last night

305
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,399
This just confirms everything else we've already researched

306
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,311
Rockefeller study

307
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,943
Millions being killed mandatory quarantine checkpoints

308
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,247
Everything that's in the other documents

309
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:34,303
The hell we're already living in this just going to continue to intensify until we take our government back

310
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,607
I promise Eugenics Mad Men

311
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
But that story is up on Prison Planet

312
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
Dot-com

313
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,983
This is about as deep as it gets

314
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,847
It's not much

315
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,663
Fixed it Alex's just reading off a headlight

316
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,223
From an article to Paul Joseph Watson Road

317
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:56,319
And everything that in the present-day Alex is trying to pass off as his prediction

318
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,367
Actually just him reading from

319
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:04,255
Paul's outrageously bad opinion piece the one who told Paul

320
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,655
Who found it

321
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:18,591
Global pandemics that killed Millions mandatory quarantine checkpoints biometric ID cards and a world of top-down

322
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
May control

323
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,919
The Regal in the present

324
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,967
That's just the first line

325
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,527
So if anything Alex

326
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:31,647
To be saying the poll predicted all the stuff that's happening now and Alex read it and then took credit for it

327
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,207
Think Alex will be doing

328
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,047
And that being said both article is not a dick

329
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
KeyBank

330
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,631
It's just the same kind of trash coverage of this rockfeller doctor

331
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,423
Give me the Racine 11 years later

332
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,263
Just happening in 2010 and being quickly forgotten even by the people who push

333
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
Another conspiracy

334
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,079
The article lays out

335
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,871
Did this is a scenario

336
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,943
In the document titled

337
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,967
Scenarios for the future

338
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
Technology and International

339
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
Development

340
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,599
And Paul even notes that it's one of four scenarios that are included

341
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
The document

342
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,439
Event described the scenario title block

343
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
Doxepin

344
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,743
Exhaustive detail

345
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,047
Ignoring other scenarios or the point

346
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,327
Of the document at all

347
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,655
Conclusion of this article is absolutely unearned

348
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703
And completely unsupported by the underlying asset

349
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,287
The Rockefeller study is not a warning against

350
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,359
Preventing the kind of tyranny contained in the scenario from unfolding

351
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
It's a blueprint

352
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:28,991
Global crises like bioterror attack and pandemics

353
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:33,087
In order to completely destroy society and rebuild it under a new world order and their image

354
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:39,487
Crystal clear from reading the lockstep scenario that the oppressive Society portrayed in the study is not presented

355
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,535
As an admonishment of how governments would

356
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,327
Khaleesi's upon a pandemic

357
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,143
To set up a police statement Empower themselves as dictators

358
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,471
It's a ringing endorsement that this approach would be the correct

359
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,263
To do 10 I've been holding

360
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
Hand up your ass

361
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
Please call on me

362
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
I have a quick

363
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
Why

364
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
Just pull think so

365
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,711
Oh okay

366
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,015
Now that I've got that

367
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
He said

368
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,087
It is not a document

369
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,135
Predicting or or like

370
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,743
Because

371
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,023
Because it's not

372
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,047
Yeah because

373
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
No course not

374
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,655
These conclusions are not sensible to arrive at from reading the documents

375
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:22,239
Unless you went into it with those conclusions already in mind and you were just

376
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
For anything you

377
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
Define to justify your nerd

378
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,383
That entire blurb that I read you there from Paul's article

379
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:33,759
It's completely dismissive bull by just reminding you yourself that everything he saying is his

380
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
Opinion

381
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
It's not fair

382
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
Coherent onala

383
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
The real tell

384
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
Here is

385
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,927
It's a completely

386
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,255
Ignoring the other three scenarios in the doctor

387
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:49,887
How come the conspiracy isn't that the globalist are secretly trying to reveal that they're trying to usher in a world

388
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,703
Depicted by the clever together scenario

389
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
Where quote

390
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:59,103
Pharmaceutical Giants release thousands of drug compounds shown to be effective against diseases like malaria

391
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,639
Public domain

392
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,687
As part of an open Innovation agenda

393
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,015
They also opened their Archives of research and development on neglect

394
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:11,135
The disease is deep not commercially viable offering seed funding scientist to wanted to carry the

395
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,159
Forward

396
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,719
Why isn't that the conspiracy that's in the document

397
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,511
I will argue

398
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,303
Because in that world

399
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,095
Zinc sales are

400
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
Mario is

401
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,703
That used or even mentioned because it doesn't pick the

402
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,239
The kind of vibe that Alex in Spanish

403
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,519
His career making his audience

404
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,287
Scared about

405
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,079
The four scenarios in this documentary

406
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
Equally likely

407
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
Sweetly different future

408
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
That wasn't

409
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,991
Captured by the two variable exercise of this study

410
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:42,623
But the only one that matters to Infowars is the one that paint for the dystopian hellscape they make money by convincing

411
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
Listeners is

412
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,415
Is right around the corner

413
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,207
Alex and Paul wanted

414
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,487
The fear Monger about the stock

415
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
Responsibly

416
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,839
They've an obligation to answer one very basic question with today

417
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
Refuse to

418
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
In the past

419
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
Or in the prison

420
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:55,935
Which is

421
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
What is different about the lock

422
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,031
Except scenario that makes it the global of secret plan

423
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,823
Whereas the other three aren't

424
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,383
Well it's in the

425
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
Other

426
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,455
GMOs

427
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,991
Sure

428
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,039
They're going to

429
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,319
House

430
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,343
It seems

431
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
Kind of like an arbitrary choice

432
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,672
That's the one that

433
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:22,304
It appeals to you you think it's profitable probably that would make sense profit motive

434
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,328
Most of all the thing

435
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,120
Things we talked about

436
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
What's up big

437
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
Achilles

438
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,192
Truck bed basically

439
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,472
It's always been

440
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,104
DNA has been altered to also across sterilization I mean they're getting us on so many fronts

441
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:41,760
And I've got all the government report admitting that the births

442
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,320
Never-before-seen we are being mutated

443
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,160
And many of us that are able to even think it operate today

444
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,768
Are children their children in the children after them are going to be

445
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,304
Deformed monsters

446
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,728
German course that will never even get to that point they plan to exterminate all of us long before then

447
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:10,176
Why do we have to sit here and fight with each other government bureaucrats police military

448
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:18,368
I mean we're all in this together it's a tiny Elite lessons

449
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:24,768
Round analysis that ruled the planet and how it look I'm going to get it all

450
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,072
All news coming up in your phone calls today it's just

451
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,008
Achilles

452
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:39,872
You know this is like this reminds me of the

453
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
The Heaven's Gate

454
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,920
Colt now

455
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,200
Just on account of like

456
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480
I'm worried

457
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,016
That we'd like

458
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,296
Sure

459
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,320
We don't want

460
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
Time to kill all of

461
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,624
But on the other

462
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,440
If we all killed ourselves that would

463
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,976
Take away their satisfaction

464
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,352
This 6000y dozen

465
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,632
The devil just get more peeps

466
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,960
You can only really devil it up with

467
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:11,616
Thousand at a time the devil behind this or not at this point because it doesn't feel like it

468
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:15,456
Administrative plan

469
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:21,856
I will say that we do know that the global is plans are 10 years behind and here we are sure

470
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,624
Translator

471
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,672
It just has the vibe of like

472
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
Definitely

473
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Being

474
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,048
A mortal plan

475
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,120
A little different vibe

476
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,144
Devil get out of it

477
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,424
I don't know

478
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,496
Dykes was the one who found the document

479
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
Across the pond

480
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,128
Which is why Alex is a psychic

481
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,896
Predicted every

482
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,920
Yes

483
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,968
Now here's a little bit about Aaron dykes

484
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:51,552
Stampede found his way to Infowars

485
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,392
There are so many of these reports that Aaron dykes

486
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,512
Only aided by coffee

487
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
What

488
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:03,840
Mini

489
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
Dave's

490
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:08,448
Will not sleep and I have to make him go home after two days of being up here

491
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,288
University

492
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,592
Didn't really believe

493
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:20,480
In what I was doing didn't really buy what I was saying and kind of laughed when I hired him

494
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
That's exactly who I wanted to hire

495
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,880
I want

496
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,184
And he's gone to you

497
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,744
Public Relation School

498
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:35,072
Very good grades when he graduated he was very intelligent

499
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
I said

500
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,656
You are going to

501
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:43,264
Hire me you coward wow

502
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:48,128
If you really want to believe you I've got a candidate for the position

503
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,712
Alex Goforth

504
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:58,112
I do like that idea.

505
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,392
Google person icon

506
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,184
I want somebody who thinks they can

507
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,584
Can see through all of my b******* and I'm going to give him the truth

508
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:12,448
Pictures that we make a lot of money here you can make some too

509
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,776
Integrity is for losers

510
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,848
I heard about a public relations school because

511
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,128
Is journalism school with

512
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:26,016
Not where I find people that work at Infowars nope usually contest

513
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,552
Alex

514
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,368
Sounds like there's so much proof managing so much proof

515
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
Things

516
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,184
These people are so arrogant

517
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,000
But they write policy papers so many of them

518
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,840
That they're producing the policy papers and reports and white papers

519
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,120
So fast

520
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,960
So fast

521
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,008
So Furious

522
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
We could never

523
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,040
Read them all it is Warehouses full of it

524
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,880
It is an open conspiracy against you and your family

525
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:06,208
If there are in fact warehouses full of the proof of Alex's

526
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,232
Conspiracy theories

527
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,792
Then I would suggest you start by producing one

528
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,816
Piece of that proof

529
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:14,144
Everything he's pointed to so far in my experience has been

530
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
Bulshit

531
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,264
Jumpy Holdren's Eco science book doesn't Advocate sterilizing people the riding

532
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:24,640
The water is Rockefeller document doesn't lay out a master plan to bring in a dictatorship through a pandemic

533
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,456
The club of Rome Publications don't prove that they made up

534
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
Climate change

535
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,248
Everything

536
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,576
Specific I've ever heard Alex mentioned doesn't say what he claimed

537
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,624
There is a warehouse

538
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
It's just a warehouse

539
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,440
It's full of books and Publications that Alex

540
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,232
Never read or can't understand

541
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
And he's just using them

542
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,280
Props to

543
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,560
Justify in supported

544
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,584
Is flimsy facade

545
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
Abdominal theories

546
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,656
I'm going to argue

547
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,960
Do that rather than a warehouse

548
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,288
Baby

549
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:56,128
No cuz you know cuz you used to print everything out its fizz

550
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,224
Got to be a filing cabinet or two

551
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,248
I hope they have a

552
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,016
Shredder

553
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,320
That's how important the stuff they print out as

554
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,648
We got to get rid of this the moment Alex printout at

555
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
Sweet

556
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
Be caught with this

557
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,464
Snob

558
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
20 stacks

559
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:17,632
Are there was listening to this episode one of the parts of Alex's 2021

560
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,400
Predict

561
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,424
Action Montage clip

562
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
The Chocolate World

563
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,776
I noticed something really suspicious about how his words

564
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
Represented

565
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:28,384
Here's how this appears in the overly dramatic current date

566
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:36,064
I pray to God I pray to my heavenly father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength and the will build

567
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,464
Give me the strength to carry on because I know while I don't want to look

568
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,352
Information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos are on message boards and I'm a liar

569
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,912
I know because it's scary

570
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,312
You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore

571
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:03,200
You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friend you're not going to be able to just

572
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,040
Go out and enjoy yourself all the time

573
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:07,808
That sounds

574
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
Kind of

575
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
Prophetic

576
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:13,952
I want to sing I want be able to go to ball games or get drunk with our friends at the bar

577
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,720
And that's exactly

578
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,792
Actually like what happened because of coronavirus safety measure

579
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,120
Be intentional this Clippers to give the audience that impress

580
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,400
But Alex's predict

581
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,960
LivingSocial lockdown which if you haven't forgotten

582
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,496
Is a kind of the title

583
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,776
Of this video

584
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,824
Problem

585
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,872
Is there's a slight

586
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:38,272
Edit that whoever made this clip did that changes the entire meaning of Alex's word you mean when he said

587
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,808
That they were going to Nuke us

588
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:43,904
Said that's why we couldn't go to ball games and no that was a that's from another show

589
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:49,792
I pray to God I pray to my heavenly father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength

590
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,352
And the will be able to face this har

591
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:56,704
And to give me the strength to carry on because I know why a lot of you

592
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,080
Don't want to look at this information I just want to comment on the YouTube videos are on message boards and I'm a liar

593
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,640
I know why

594
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,176
Because it's scary

595
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,480
And if you admit this to yourself

596
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,296
You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore

597
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,648
You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends you're not going to be able to just

598
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,768
He'll go out and enjoy yourself all the time and not spend some of your energy

599
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,048
On resisting there

600
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:28,448
Shady you lying piece of s*** f****** liar

601
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:34,848
Saying that if you are available to learn this information that information was so dominant

602
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,896
Be able to go to ball game

603
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:45,856
Five-paragraph rich but I think you expressed it

604
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,928
Yeah that was that was really shocking

605
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:53,024
Wow what a difference a couple words

606
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,584
Make a big difference

607
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,544
The cutting out of those words

608
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,104
Completely Alters the point of what Alex is saying

609
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,944
It makes those images of not being able to go to the ball game or bars anymore

610
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,272
It makes when you cut it out it seems like they're in

611
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
Independent thought

612
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,112
Yeah everything else that he's saying as opposed to be

613
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,648
Part of 1/8 of then state

614
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,416
You got it

615
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,720
This is intensely dishonest and whoever edited

616
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,024
This clip together took those words that because they knew

617
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,304
Did in their original form

618
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,584
They Don't Really Work

619
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,888
To make Alex sound like he made an amazing

620
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,912
But

621
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,192
If you chop them off

622
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,984
It looks like you might have been onto something

623
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:40,128
Using the cheesy score and making selective at it's like this the person who put this together is able to transform something

624
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,152
Pretty meaningless

625
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:45,248
In standard form looks like a fairly specific

626
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,784
About stuff that would happen

627
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,808
Send a text later

628
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,880
They do this because they know they can get away with it

629
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,952
Anyone was acceptable for falling for Alex's s*** is

630
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,024
Probably not going to be the sort of person who goes back to look at his 20

631
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
10 episode

632
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,352
Actually making a prediction back then

633
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:04,448
So this is a safe game of exploitation and manipulation Metallica's free-to-play

634
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,472
And man it's just

635
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
Parents

636
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
Frankly

637
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,800
At this point I would argue

638
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:12,384
You're literally the only person who would go back and

639
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,944
Find the episode that Alex said that

640
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
Kick-Ass

641
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,784
Of course you are

642
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,600
You can't go to the ball games anymore cyclone-hit like

643
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:27,744
If you really did say I still don't think it means anything anything about it it's

644
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,512
Hey buddy would be

645
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,792
Yeah I don't know

646
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,096
You're right it would be interested

647
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,912
I would like to do it for your react

648
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:39,520
That's why you play the game

649
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,568
How to throw baseball right in his head

650
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,640
Happy Spring training of baseball to the brain

651
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
Cheese's

652
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,944
Christ yeah

653
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,344
Battery that is unacceptable. I was sitting alone in my room when I heard that nice of you who asked

654
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,720
Out of context in the clip

655
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:03,840
Infowars

656
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,864
It's not fair

657
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,912
Alex

658
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:12,032
Obamacare and what-have-you until you can't

659
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,848
Eat foods and stuffing Ono it's no good

660
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,920
Tracking how much you want her to do that to the school

661
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
What you can

662
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,320
Put in a child's Happy Meal

663
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,112
So it's okay for McDonald's to put

664
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,720
@cnn

665
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
Extremely poisonous

666
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,840
Illegal in England

667
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,376
Another country

668
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,960
But you can't put a toy in there

669
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,008
It's not so much that McDonald's puts

670
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,568
Silicone in their food which is the impression that Alex

671
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,848
Just trying to give the audience

672
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,872
McDonald's

673
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,920
Use a silicone in the preparation of

674
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:53,248
You can find this information on McDonald's own website

675
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,064
That they use dimethyl Polly

676
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,112
Siloxane in the oil

677
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,160
Use to fry french fries

678
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,440
What a great place

679
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,208
To hide

680
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,232
That information

681
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,792
Right on their website never look there

682
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,328
The reason for this is because

683
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,096
The food grade

684
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,376
Empty foaming agent

685
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,936
Which prevents the oil for bubbling up and burning employee

686
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:16,288
Anyone who's worked in fast-food knows that getting that oil on you is no joke

687
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,616
And with the high incidence of younger employees at places like McDonald's

688
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:23,456
It's really important as a safety measure to do what you can to limit the possibility of evil

689
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,224
Getting oil all over

690
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:30,112
It sucks I got a little

691
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,904
Awful

692
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,744
Alex can't prove that this chemical is dangerous.

693
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,024
People I'm actually interest

694
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,096
In 2018 MLive reported the quotes

695
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,656
Scientist that Yokohama National University in

696
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:45,472
Japan say that a chemical added to the oil to cook

697
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,776
McDonald's french fries could help you were bald

698
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
Listen to humans

699
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
That's right

700
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,408
Some early-stage testing this young that dimethylpolysiloxane

701
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
Who's used

702
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,760
To quote the growth of black hair on the back and scalp of mice

703
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,808
Okay alright

704
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,576
So Alex

705
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,392
His it's his own fault he's losing his hair

706
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,672
Of course

707
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:11,328
People are kind of dumb after this news broke these Japanese scientist had to come out and clarify the eating McDonald's fries would not help you grow back

708
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,376
Of course not it's not

709
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,680
Their lead researcher judge

710
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,472
Bukata told Reuters

711
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,240
Quotes

712
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:21,824
No matter how many fried potatoes you eat you'll never grow more hair

713
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,384
That's a total misunderstanding that's gone viral

714
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
So sad

715
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,480
Besides just have to take time out of their day to say stuff like that

716
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,392
Alex do stuff like this all the time he'll say something like McDonald's

717
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,672
Put silicone in their food

718
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:41,536
And then do nothing more to examine the Claymore help his audience understand what even means

719
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:44,096
If you just listen to Alex you beat you know

720
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,376
Equally easy to

721
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,656
Conclude that McDonald's is using

722
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
Does chemical of the oil

723
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:52,032
As it would be to believe that their Big Macs are half breast

724
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,824
Austin Bryant

725
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,360
Yeah he leaves you

726
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,640
Treading water

727
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,736
I'm in the worst part of that is we are a little bit

728
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:01,760
So much

729
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
2

730
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,808
That type of process

731
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,832
Food that there's

732
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,136
It's almost borderline Ruiz

733
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,416
Isabel to be like

734
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,208
I can see Madonna

735
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,744
Putting silicone in their food

736
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:12,768
I mean

737
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:16,096
We getting so much gas

738
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,656
You know all that's right but it is

739
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,704
And I'm not I'm not blanket defending

740
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:25,568
Use of all kinds of chemicals also different conversation

741
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
From Lake

742
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
But you're

743
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,408
Just sort of out of nowhere brainwood

744
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,432
Pull up

745
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,808
As opposed to something that is a

746
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,856
Food grade antifreeze

747
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,136
No he's

748
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:39,904
Is he's taking a

749
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,184
Advantage of the fact

750
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,720
Pettyville Shady Corporation

751
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:46,816
Attend attend to be evil in

752
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,400
Does not demand any kind of specificity out of them

753
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,424
Yeah

754
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,960
So now we're back to beep

755
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,752
Sure why not

756
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,032
This is so weird

757
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,152
Gulf of Mexico

758
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,992
But we've got screenshots of their

759
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:14,976
Looks like there may be some hanky-panky going on but we are looking into it right now and working on that but

760
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:15,744
Is true

761
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,536
Praise God this is certainly

762
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:21,888
Wonderful news why are you still taking a wait-and-see approach you

763
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,008
You claim to have evidence that indicates there's hanky-panky

764
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,080
Money you got money in oil

765
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:33,408
I don't know I don't try to have something I don't know if it's

766
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,176
That

767
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,504
I don't I don't know but it's weird

768
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,040
That's very weird

769
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:45,440
Well I mean we've seen some screenshots that show something weird is happening but you know

770
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,488
I think in this one

771
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,792
Situation I'm going to last

772
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,072
Corporation

773
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,888
I'm pretty sure that escape pod is

774
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,752
Filled with nobody's there's nobody in there we don't need to fire a laser to blow up that escape

775
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,544
Isn't this company that

776
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,360
Spell millions of

777
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,408
Thomasville

778
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,040
They tell us that it's all good but I saw some evidence there might be some goofing around

779
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,576
Might be some

780
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,112
Chicanery down there

781
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,136
To say that this

782
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,928
This massive oil spill this

783
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,976
Ecological disaster

784
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,536
Trust that they are there out there above board

785
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
We all make mistakes

786
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:28,448
This time frame is

787
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,496
He's going to go to Carl's a lot of time he does

788
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
Like it's babe

789
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,056
It seems more

790
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,336
Consistent that he'll get

791
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,104
It's a call

792
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,872
And

793
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,176
He'll take some calls then jump back

794
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,224
To just doing the show and then

795
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,504
You take some more call chair

796
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:45,600
The fetal of like an actual radio show

797
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,672
He goes to some calls

798
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,208
As opposed to maybe somebody

799
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,768
Who's abused amphetamine

800
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,328
Yeah yeah

801
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,400
Scholar brings up that like

802
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,424
Hey

803
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
You know

804
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,008
Finding out about all this stuff about the evil

805
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,312
The folks around the world and all that

806
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:09,152
Kind of makes it tough for me to be happy

807
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,176
Alex has not seen

808
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:14,272
You hear that you're a talking point that dead

809
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:20,672
Not a lot of times people will bring up and then what you had mentioned this morning earlier before

810
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,976
I got through to talk to you

811
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,096
Once you obtain this information

812
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,632
And the truth

813
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,912
Basically

814
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:31,936
How much

815
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,752
Change your outlook on

816
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,800
How you value your life

817
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:37,824
And then

818
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,872
Ashley said

819
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,944
My life hasn't been the same and then sometimes

820
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:47,040
You don't like I might even be asking for something right here buddy but

821
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:47,808
Sometimes

822
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,856
It's really hard

823
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,136
To find some balance

824
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,672
And it's right here

825
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,232
Even maintain a reasonable amount of

826
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,256
What

827
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,816
My god-given right by the Constitution

828
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,400
Yo my right to be happy

829
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:05,728
We got out of balance

830
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,032
Thomas Jefferson biscuits

831
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:13,664
George Washington Thomas Paine Patrick Henry all said you must guard the jewel of Liberty

832
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,224
You must do everything you can on its defense

833
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,088
Not yet is you going to the prime importance even if you struggle to keep freedom

834
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,368
You're probably going to lose it

835
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,928
And and and you will go into bondage

836
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,744
And the worst elements of society will take over

837
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,752
Now losing

838
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
And so

839
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:44,640
What did Barry Goldwater

840
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,688
There is

841
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:49,248
No such thing

842
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,576
And by my underwear my a

843
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,392
Yeah

844
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,160
Listcrawlers

845
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,464
Expressing this stuff is really

846
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,000
But like you scare me a lot

847
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:00,768
And it's not

848
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,816
Pleasant

849
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:07,168
State of fear and my adrenaline is always pumping which makes

850
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:13,568
Smithfield

851
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,848
But it's like a while

852
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,896
He wants to give this dude a little bit more

853
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,200
Kind of advice in a little bit of like

854
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,016
When I'm with my family will I be okay

855
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,064
When I'm out there fishing with the kids

856
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,088
Kidzoona like

857
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,880
I'm thinking about fighting the gallbladder

858
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,440
Doing this because that's why I'm fighting

859
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,768
He won't be able to go to ball games

860
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,048
I mean you can take your kids

861
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,840
Ball games cuz that's why you're fighting

862
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,376
You got to integrate

863
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,424
Enjoyment of family time with

864
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,448
Your passion to fight

865
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:44,288
Not yet with the Devil the devil

866
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,080
And then this caller

867
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,104
Flip the script

868
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,128
And changes the

869
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:55,552
What's interesting is 10 years ago you know I've been married for almost nine but video 10 years ago

870
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,856
All she beautiful

I would still be I have a lot of Flash and now

872
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,536
Almost all of that is burned away

873
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,864
My wife but it is still

874
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:12,704
Mydrive states are fully survival warn people

875
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,264
Deal with this

876
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,640
Anything else

877
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,176
Yeah

878
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:26,016
Fixing gears out here

879
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,576
You were talking about you.

880
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,392
What people look at as important These Days Inn

881
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
When I

882
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,232
Crack open my Yahoo page which is my homepage

883
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,048
They have this thing called trending now

884
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,840
And you'll see stuff like

885
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,144
Lindsay Lohan American Idol

886
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,192
Aurora wrestling dancing

887
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:44,960
Stars

888
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,312
Saying at the end of the very last

889
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
Article

890
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,128
Guess what it was

891
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,919
Oil spill

892
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,223
That's what kind of priorities

893
00:41:56,479 --> 00:42:02,623
Our country has these days

894
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:09,535
My Yahoo account

895
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:20,543
Couple years away from

896
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,079
Divorce at this point

897
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,103
Going to say

898
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,127
So

899
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:34,623
Yeah you know the internet like the way that he described that that reminds me so much of the way that Douglas at

900
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,719
Describe the Babelfish where is like finally everyone in the universe

901
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,743
Was able to communicate

902
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,303
That caused more and

903
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,327
Bloodier Wars

904
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,095
Whatever in the back

905
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,631
Get out

906
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,655
Oh no

907
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,447
Maybe it was a bad idea

908
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:52,543
It just like at Universal communication

909
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,311
Internet is

910
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,079
F******

911
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,359
It's probably bad

912
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,175
But it does

913
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:00,735
Definitely at very least

914
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,015
Expose some parts

915
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,551
Cursive r

916
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,343
Behaviors in our patterns

917
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,903
Maybe we wouldn't have been aware of otherwise

918
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,951
Certainly trolling

919
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:12,255
Becomes more

920
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:16,607
Noticeable

921
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,191
And then also like the phenomenon that this dude stalking

922
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,215
In about Westlake

923
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,495
Things like

924
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:29,407
American Idol look WWE wrestling

925
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,783
The people's attention that other one

926
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,111
The opiate of the masses I don't know what don't want to

927
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:38,879
I don't know

928
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,183
We're trying to feel Comfort Inn

929
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:46,303
We have Obama in the White House everybody still like maybe we won't have an evil presence

930
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,327
Is good time

931
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,607
So

932
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,887
I had something

933
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,911
Trigger in his brain

934
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,215
Because of what that guy said about his Yahoo

935
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,519
And he is come up with a plan

936
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,591
And you'll see how it's a news item normally

937
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,919
They kind of feedback loop in feet

938
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,295
The Scandal

939
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,087
The media hype so don't look

940
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,879
The number one trend

941
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,975
Facebook

942
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,559
Or Mel Gibson

943
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,351
Or Kelly Osbourne

944
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,679
And the BP oil spill

945
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,775
Is way down the line

946
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,175
Unemployment extension 2010

947
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,967
Is number 15

948
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,759
On Yahoo trends

949
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,295
Are you for or against

950
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,831
That should be number one

951
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,927
LED and Mercury in our children's

952
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,719
Juice drinks

953
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:52,095
And chips and food and soft drinks that's all admitted your children are drinking this in mask

954
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,119
That should be

955
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,143
The top trend

956
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,543
Now what if we

957
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,311
Actually

958
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:05,151
Gained their corrupt system what is every listener of the show

959
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,175
Today

960
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:14,111
Sunday and Monday typed The Obama Deception Yahoo

961
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,903
Google search engine

962
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,927
What have you did it

963
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:21,023
Over and over and over and over and over and over and over again

964
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,327
That would put The Obama Deception

965
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,447
Links to the video

966
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
For free

967
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,519
That would put links

968
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,567
At the top of Google

969
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,847
At the top

970
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,871
I'm Yahoo

971
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,431
Millions more would

972
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,479
This guy's a goddamn genius

973
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:41,759
If

974
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,527
Everyone

975
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,343
Would buy wooden Sheriff's

976
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:53,535
Yeah that's Bill Cooper all over the place

977
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,071
Completely nonsensical

978
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,863
The solving non-existent problem

979
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,679
He's a genius with marketing

980
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,447
Supposed

981
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,239
Problem here is that the news about the

982
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,287
The BP oil spill is not higher

983
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:07,103
Then the internet

984
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,687
20 top trends are about trivial matters

985
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,455
Like celebrities

986
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,223
Cryptids

987
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:15,807
You can easily see how this is an easy argument to get people to agree with

988
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,623
The oil spill is probably more important than pop

989
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,391
Top stories

990
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,183
This isn't the problem

991
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,487
It's just kind of a statement about what attracts people

992
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,255
Attention

993
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,535
The oil spill began

994
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,839
3 months prior so headlines about it

995
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,143
Might not have been all that exciting to people

996
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,423
And just a few days

997
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,959
Before this Lindsay Lohan

998
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,775
Since the 90 days in jail for violating her probation

999
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:39,615
And I believe Mel Gibson was in the news for

1000
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:46,271
Racist I remember I remember that this was not the time he got pulled

1001
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:50,367
Dover

1002
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:55,999
It's fine to save the BP oil spill is maybe a larger story for more people but it's ridiculous

1003
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,279
To complain about the public paying

1004
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:00,095
Attention to those stories and they were pretty serious stories

1005
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,655
You think the BP oil spill should be higher

1006
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,703
Well here's what we do tomorrow

1007
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,519
Make something else to do

1008
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:10,591
Supposed problem

1009
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,359
Just caused by some

1010
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,639
Vague idea about hubby

1011
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,663
The algorithm search

1012
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:20,063
Just working then the solution is that everybody needs to search for The Obama Deception that movie to the top of all sorts

1013
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,391
The results this makes no sense

1014
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,695
Feels like it does to Alex's audience because

1015
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,975
Cuz they've been trained to equate

1016
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,255
Promoting Infowars

1017
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,279
With engaging and

1018
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,095
Activism they've been conditioned to believe that it

1019
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,887
Possible that if the Obama Deception

1020
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,679
Get seen by millions more people

1021
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:39,007
Maybe I'll have an impact on getting people to pay

1022
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:41,055
Spell celebrity gossip

1023
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,615
Why do Hindu Siemens Clippers

1024
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
Phenomenal it really represents

1025
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:48,479
Be Bleak underbelly of what Alex's world is always about

1026
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:53,087
The only solutions that are ever really offered are those that directly profit out

1027
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:57,439
The solution to the collapsing economy is to buy gold from Alex's father Ted Andrew

1028
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,719
The solution to the

1029
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:02,815
Becoming societal collapse is to buy survival food from our to sponsor my Patriots

1030
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,583
What

1031
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,119
Solution to covid-19

1032
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,679
Every other health condition is just to use Alex's

1033
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:08,959
Dissolution

1034
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,751
Do people not paying enough attention

1035
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:13,055
Deepwater Horizon oil spill

1036
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,079
Apparently

1037
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,871
Trick search engines

1038
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,687
The thinking Alex's movie is more popular than it actually is

1039
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,479
Recommending it

1040
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,759
Two more people

1041
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
It's evil

1042
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:29,695
I'm looking back on this is painfully transparent to see what our she's doing

1043
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,463
Great marketing

1044
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,487
Strategy

1045
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,815
I also enjoyed that as Alex was talking

1046
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:38,399
Like as soon as he said The Obama Deception the first time

1047
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,423
You rolled your eyes

1048
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:45,055
Sugar

1049
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,127
So that's that's his big plan

1050
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,455
This is serious plan

1051
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,247
He spent a half-hour.

1052
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,063
Really yeah

1053
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,343
I'm like hey

1054
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,623
Look

1055
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
Sure

1056
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,927
What do the Obama Deception

1057
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:04,255
And then later we can do it without

1058
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,583
What if you all right now

1059
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,727
I-Ready a-listers could just go to Google

1060
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:17,055
Go to Yahoo go to the biggest search engine and type in

1061
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,591
The Obama Deception

1062
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,639
The Obama Deception

1063
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,455
The Obama Deception

1064
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:28,575
This will probably work it'll probably push it to the top and then next week

1065
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:35,487
I can put on a viral video Stay on genetic engineering causing DNA damage

1066
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,447
And then millions of new people

1067
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:47,007
Because of that information Warfare tool

1068
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,031
Will see it

1069
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,311
I like this Tech

1070
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:52,127
Technique

1071
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:55,455
For the Studio's one for me, okay

1072
00:49:55,967 --> 00:50:01,343
This first one is just going to be promoting my s*** and the second time I'll do it about some topic if you want to drop it

1073
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:07,743
What what I want to do is kind of a ladder attack okay just get my name

1074
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,279
First and then I'll put out

1075
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:14,655
Content to go viral Alex has done this kind of thing

1076
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,423
Earlier in his

1077
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,191
Career as well

1078
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,727
Google search

1079
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,543
It's not a new strategy for him

1080
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,311
But it is

1081
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:25,407
Tremendously desperate and weird the way he's acting

1082
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,039
Right there wasn't even playing field

1083
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:35,391
His stuff is most popular everybody knows it shut up everyone knows it

1084
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,439
So the globalist

1085
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,207
Cheated

1086
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,535
Okay so now Alex has to cheat

1087
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,071
So they can't cheat

1088
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,863
Complicated but I just had to

1089
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,935
The clip because Alex is really accepting and admitting they what he's doing

1090
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,543
We won on the Level Playing Field so they cheat

1091
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,359
Before they start cheating the system

1092
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,431
We need to gain their system right now

1093
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:03,039
Now we got a game we got to cheat that system in order to make sure they can't read again cuz

1094
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:09,695
No cuz they cheated before a Level Playing Field

1095
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,231
Popular radio show on the

1096
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,791
So

1097
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,351
I want to

1098
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,935
You stressed you and I hope that still Mariah stammering

1099
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:22,495
He talked about this for a long time

1100
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,847
Because he does

1101
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,127
Jump off to another topic

1102
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:28,895
And that is

1103
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:31,199
Pearl Harbor was a false flag

1104
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:36,319
Okay

1105
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:42,207
From Japan into

1106
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,255
Iguana cross the Pacific

1107
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,279
Here's Japan

1108
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,815
Here's Hawaii

1109
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,887
Here's the West Coast United States they had to come all the way

1110
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:52,447
And the aircraft in the US submarines and

1111
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:55,263
All the islands we control they were coming

1112
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,311
And they are ordered to stand down and die

1113
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:01,407
Can't prove any of that big one

1114
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:06,783
We've talked a bit about his Pearl Harbor conspiracy in the past

1115
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,855
Just to represent that he spends a while on that topic

1116
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:12,927
Because he is made

1117
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,463
Is blank that everyone needs to get to

1118
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,999
Typing in their search engine

1119
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,279
How do you get the call from

1120
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,815
A guy named Angel Eyes

1121
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,583
Okay

1122
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,863
Scares me I'm listening

1123
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,655
I was talked to

1124
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,215
Angel Eyes in Texas here on the air

1125
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,519
You got me how you doing bulldog

1126
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,287
Pretty good

1127
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,079
Okay

1128
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,615
You know Angel Eyes just

1129
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:35,711
Because I think my shave what you know other people don't

1130
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,271
You're freaking me out a little

1131
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:42,111
No do you do a bow dog

1132
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,135
IRA

1133
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,671
Alright maybe if it's

1134
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,463
3 a.m. at a bar and I

1135
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,767
Don't want to go home and if somebody starts with

1136
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,303
I'm Angel Eyes cuz I think I

1137
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,119
Hey baby I'm listening the last one

1138
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,655
On the follow-up anytime

1139
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,703
Before that I can always leave man

1140
00:52:56,959 --> 00:53:01,055
I think I'm going to start episodes now

1141
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,127
Yeah

1142
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,151
A little bit of a

1143
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,687
Amateur Maguey degree tweeter

1144
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,503
Some interesting memories

1145
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,551
He said he wants to try and run by Alex

1146
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,855
I called you about a month

1147
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:14,879
Citgo in regards

1148
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,695
What's to the interview with Chandra Levy's aunt

1149
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,719
With Barbara Walters

1150
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,559
About Chandra called her week before she disappeared

1151
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,583
Headsets

1152
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
Bigfoot

1153
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,911
It's not happening American I can't tell you about it

1154
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,727
You put out the

1155
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:31,775
You know the flag that if anybody had

1156
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:34,079
Recording event that they send it to you

1157
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,895
I doubt anybody would have it that way

1158
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,943
Looks like 10 years ago that happened

1159
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:45,343
I wonder could you find out who concert Levy's aunt is an interview her if

1160
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:46,879
Disappeared

1161
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:50,719
You know died mysteriously

1162
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:54,559
11

1163
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:59,167
You're saying that she said something big is about to happen but I can't tell you

1164
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,703
And

1165
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:03,263
You're saying you saw her say that on what show

1166
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,567
On a Whopper

1167
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:09,407
I believe it was Barbara Walters and it may have been

1168
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,711
Leslie small or one of those

1169
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:12,479
Global

1170
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,759
Reporters but

1171
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,551
Does not spare the details

1172
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,671
Chandra Levy's aunt is named Linda zamsky and the interview

1173
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:25,023
She gave back in 2001 and her statement about her niece's disappearance were widely reported

1174
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,303
The time in every Outlet

1175
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,071
You can imagine

1176
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,887
Who be the easiest thing in the world for this call or do I have to

1177
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,655
Just Googled

1178
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,935
Chandra Levy

1179
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,959
And found articles

1180
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,727
Explain this

1181
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,263
Which kind of illustrates

1182
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:38,335
Illustrate where his memory is

1183
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,359
Failed

1184
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,895
The aunt didn't say that

1185
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,175
The Chandra it said there was a

1186
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:46,015
Bake it was going to happen in America is Angel Eyes as reporting to Alex

1187
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,295
According to the washing

1188
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,319
Newton post quote

1189
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,599
On April 29th

1190
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:52,927
The day before Levy was last seen leaving left a message on Sam

1191
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,695
Lansky's voicemail

1192
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:56,255
Never hear from her knees again

1193
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:00,863
Quote hi Linda it's Shandra my internship is over Levy said in the message

1194
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,447
I'm planning on packing my bags in the next week or 10 days

1195
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,727
Heading home for a while

1196
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,519
Don't know what I'm going to do this summer

1197
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:10,591
And I really have some big news or something important to tell

1198
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,359
Call me

1199
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:14,687
The article goes on to say quote zamsky said yesterday

1200
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:17,503
She did not know what Levy was referring to but

1201
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,039
How did the twenty-four-year-old

1202
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:19,807
Did not seem

1203
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,575
Upset

1204
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,367
According to samsky

1205
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,927
She was chandra's confidant

1206
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,695
Better relationship

1207
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,231
Representative Gerry Connolly

1208
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:30,559
So taking in its proper context as delivered by zanski

1209
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,583
You could use this

1210
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,863
Comment to speculate that

1211
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,911
Maybe Jean read some news about it

1212
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,191
Change in her relationship

1213
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:36,959
Wakanda

1214
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,239
But that's not

1215
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,519
Contacts that angel eyes

1216
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,543
Bring this information

1217
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,311
Alex

1218
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,847
He's saying that the news

1219
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,383
The Chandra had for her

1220
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,663
Something big was going to happen

1221
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,943
In America

1222
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:50,015
Which seems to be him implying that you had foreknowledge about 9/11

1223
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:56,415
Hey Auntie just want to let you know coming home soon I'm not sure I don't know what I'm going to do for the summer

1224
00:55:56,927 --> 00:56:00,767
9/11 about to happen it's going to be a wild couple of my

1225
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,791
I've seen this

1226
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:06,143
Conspiracy floated online before so it's not like a completely new idea to me but it's

1227
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,959
Generalize on connecting Randa

1228
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:11,775
Damn. I'm misinterpreting and misrepresent exams

1229
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:12,543
He's come at

1230
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,567
Kind of shocked

1231
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:15,103
Sing to me honestly that

1232
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,383
Alex would hear this

1233
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,943
Some kind of not know what the guys talking about

1234
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:19,967
It seems like this

1235
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:23,807
It would be something that he would have covered

1236
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,087
It didn't really have leg

1237
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,623
Probably

1238
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,671
So this internet spam

1239
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,207
It works

1240
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,231
WIC

1241
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:35,327
Start working while Alex is still on there

1242
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:41,727
I'm noticing that on Twitter and Facebook it is alive with the Obama Deception thousands and thousands

1243
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,031
Twitter

1244
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,335
Facebook

1245
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:49,151
My posting The Obama Deception from YouTube

1246
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,455
Or just return The Obama Deception

1247
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:56,063
People are also going to Google and Yahoo and typing in The Obama Deception

1248
00:56:56,575 --> 00:57:00,927
Where to try to trim that to the top to show people the power of

1249
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:04,767
But we can't make future films

1250
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:07,071
If you don't purchase them from

1251
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,887
This is been a lot

1252
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:16,799
Yeah it is a few more than I was hoping for that this is all working out great

1253
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,335
But also you need to buy the fit

1254
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,383
I got you

1255
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,663
I got you in the door

1256
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:26,527
Now you got to buy for also or else I can't make another one for us to artificially promote

1257
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,295
This

1258
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,063
War

1259
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,879
Is it over until we defeat the global

1260
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,975
We can't defeat the global is so this war isn't over

1261
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,255
Until you have made me

1262
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,279
Obscenely wealthy

1263
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,583
Beyond obscenely wealthy

1264
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,911
Alex goes back to Carl's and

1265
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,679
This one dude

1266
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,471
Eat wrong

1267
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,799
Matan d.c. your on the year

1268
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,359
First

1269
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:54,943
I just wanted to say thank you for doing what than anybody else in the world to fight

1270
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,735
New World Order

1271
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,527
Okay well.

1272
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:02,623
Actually have to disagree with you when you say that you're not smarter than average

1273
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,415
You're probably

1274
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:08,511
Way above average when it comes to intelligence just based on your discernment

1275
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,535
Yeah that way

1276
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,583
It's the duty of Great Men to leave

1277
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:12,607
Alex

1278
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,167
Most people go cross-eyed when they try to process

1279
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:17,471
Not an input that you do on a daily basis

1280
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,007
That's 343

1281
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,031
We need to know

1282
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,311
When you going to step up

1283
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,615
Run for political office I mean

1284
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,151
Run for mayor of Oz

1285
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,175
Governor attacks

1286
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:28,223
Millions of people migrating

1287
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,271
Just to go vote in that election

1288
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,295
Oh man

1289
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,319
Just a population of

1290
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,879
Texas would explode in order for vehicles

1291
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,927
Cedarland correctly

1292
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,975
If Alex announces that

1293
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,255
He is going to run

1294
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,279
Vermeer of Austin

1295
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:47,679
Whatever length of time you must be a resident in order to vote either some requirements

1296
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,775
So millions of people are going to go to us

1297
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:56,127
Just to put Alex and Ani

1298
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,943
I guess I'll just stay in Austin is

1299
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,807
Keep Austin Weird

1300
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:07,391
But not that weird run away from how weird off today's now

1301
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,159
Yeah

1302
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:11,231
I'm also is a cross-eyed American I resent

1303
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,255
I'm saying people go

1304
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:15,583
Go cross-eyed taking in all the information that you do

1305
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,471
What time Alex was gonna run

1306
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,775
Do you know that he was going to run for office

1307
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,567
Oh yeah but there was a problem

1308
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,847
He was too busy filming

1309
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:27,871
Guardians of the

1310
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:33,759
2 popular

1311
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:45,279
Legal campaign rules

1312
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:47,583
That way they can selectively enforce against

1313
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,703
At this point

1314
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,383
True

1315
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:03,455
I just here covering the news in the information

1316
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,271
Millions of people

1317
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:08,063
Millions

1318
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,855
It's growing exponentially

1319
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:13,439
Why should we stop with working and broke don't fix it

1320
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,767
Well I don't think you have to stop you could just

1321
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:19,583
Do what you're doing and then have people coming in for you

1322
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:20,607
I mean

1323
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,191
It's not understand wrong I completely agree with everything you say

1324
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,983
Wells Fargo

1325
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,799
Because we do have a hundred percent election fraud

1326
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:32,895
Iproven Infinity on the paper

1327
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:38,783
And again in 2010

1328
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,927
It's also the most wealthy per-capita that's why the bloodsuckers are here

1329
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,351
What

1330
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,911
What are you talkin about

1331
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
Business income

1332
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,615
Sleep 100

1333
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,383
Percent

1334
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:06,687
Election

1335
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:10,015
Got stolen this for ten years at least

1336
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,807
Father

01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,831
Much

1338
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,599
No

1339
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,647
I'm confused as to why

1340
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,183
Oh cuz he's

1341
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:17,951
Full of s***

1342
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,743
Oh that would makes you just talkin

1343
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:23,839
I was going to say I feel like I would probably be like I don't want to

1344
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,119
Live here any longer

1345
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,935
Scared

1346
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,031
What a little time with Lori Lightfoot did he like

1347
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:35,103
I don't want to live here anymore

1348
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:38,687
If you really believe this revolutionary s*** that Alex

1349
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,455
To talk about

1350
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,735
It really seems

1351
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,271
Like he would be

1352
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,807
Not a radio host

1353
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:44,575
Stevia Terror

1354
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:48,671
He would be here running a cell

1355
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,439
Indicating that

1356
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,463
People do something crazy

1357
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,487
If you like

1358
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:55,327
Storm the Capitol Building living in a city where there's

1359
01:01:55,583 --> 01:02:00,191
Broadland elections for 10 years there's nothing real in all the leadership

1360
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,471
You can't vote him out because

1361
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,007
Feel like

1362
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,055
What recourse do you have

1363
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,127
I will say

1364
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,663
I haven't been to Austin

1365
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:10,943
The barbecue is

1366
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,503
Sure is that worth

1367
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:15,551
Ed endlessly corrupt election

1368
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:18,623
No certainly not.

1369
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,903
Alex

1370
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,463
What's really most important those

1371
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,487
You guys got a

1372
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:28,607
And we are having lister's today

1373
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,887
Try to

1374
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:32,703
How many BP is not even the top 10

1375
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,727
Google

1376
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:34,751
And

1377
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,799
Yahoo Prince

1378
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:40,127
So we're trying

1379
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,431
They look

1380
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:44,223
The top

1381
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:47,807
If you put the term The Obama Deception

1382
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,855
The Obama Deception

1383
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,415
Is go into

1384
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,463
Google

1385
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,023
Bring up the results back out again

1386
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,815
Put your cursor on it

1387
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:04,447
A couple minutes

1388
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,799
Search

1389
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:12,895
Then you put your cursor in there click it

1390
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,175
Or change one letter

1391
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,479
Back on it

1392
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:20,319
Guys guys just show about a Google

1393
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:22,367
How to Google things

1394
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:25,439
Repeatedly

1395
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,255
Because

1396
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,815
Again

1397
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:35,167
The BP the oil spill should be number one surprises what we do about

1398
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:39,007
Hundreds of times

1399
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:42,079
Now listen many times

1400
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,359
I have had

1401
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,663
My videos already number one

1402
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,455
And

1403
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,479
Being the top

1404
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,783
Search

1405
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:54,623
We're just artificially doing this

1406
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,159
And Mel Gibson

1407
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,791
You mean you really just

1408
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,071
Got you something it up

1409
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:05,375
But you were yelling over his last clip which is

1410
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:08,703
BP should be the number one Trend why are you doing this

1411
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,751
Yeah Alex is doing this

1412
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:11,775
Because he wants more

1413
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,079
Traffic and more money to come into his business

1414
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:16,895
He also knows that admitting that would look really bad

1415
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,199
He wants the outcome but he doesn't want to

1416
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:22,271
Ask for it so he pretends that his motives are noble

1417
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:26,111
Please actually incense that Lindsay Lohan is getting more attention than the oil

1418
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:27,903
In reality

1419
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:31,231
Alex is pissed off at Lindsay Lohan is getting more attention than him

1420
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:34,303
But being too obvious about it

1421
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,327
Who's pretending

1422
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,119
Concerned about how many people are paying attention

1423
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:37,887
Royal Spa

1424
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,167
I will say that

1425
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,447
It's so

1426
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:45,311
Transparent if you go back and listen to to our coverage

1427
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,079
The Obamas

1428
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,359
What is Upton I will say that I can

1429
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:49,663
Completely lost my mind around the

1430
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,199
Eight or nine hour bark

1431
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,991
So we're the last

1432
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,271
Few minutes of the Obama

1433
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,319
Caption about a BP oil spill that was

1434
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:58,111
Going to happen for a couple years I don't know

1435
01:04:59,391 --> 01:04:59,903
Certainly

1436
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,463
So

1437
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,743
Alex's

1438
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:04,511
Get on there

1439
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:05,535

R5

1444
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,471
Time today

1445
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,495
Check their stuff

1446
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:17,823
Then they get up and leave they're probably not going to think about

1447
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,103
Doing a search

1448
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:19,871
For you

1449
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:24,735
There are however really really simple to use add-ons

1450
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:25,759
For just about

1451
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:26,783
Any browser

1452
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,831
Out there that can automatically

1453
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,623
He searches for them or refresh

1454
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,159
Current searched at they have

1455
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:38,303
Google

1456
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,863
Yeah that and like

1457
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:41,887
Extensions Lake

1458
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:47,007
Just for example Google has one and I use it for this exact purpose

1459
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,543
Call

1460
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:51,103
Siri load every nuts Firefox

01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,479
And it can set up a refresh

1463
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,015
For you

1464
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,063
Randomly or everyone

01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:00,831
10-second or

1466
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,599
10 seconds

1467
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:02,623
10 minutes

1468
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,415
However often you want to search

1469
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,183
Search for you

1470
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:10,303
Lindsay Lohan

1471
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,607
The media is already doing this themselves

1472
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,399
Direct

1473
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,191
It's cool that info Warriors and

1474
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:18,495
Patriots you just leave their computers on

1475
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,519
Did they

1476
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:25,919
Install on are there browsers that will help

1477
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:30,015
Matt Ryan do it so I'm going to do is I'm going to get a list together

1478
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:33,343
Bots we can artificially inflate

1479
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,623
First first

1480
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,695
Are you telling me that you want

1481
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:42,047
Non computer-savvy people to start downloading add-ons to their browser

1482
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:45,119
Box generally speaking that does not work well

1483
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,143
No

1484
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,423
Seems irresponsible

1485
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,495
And yeah just seems like

1486
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,543
They know what

1487
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,567
Traffic look

1488
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,871
Looks like

1489
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:58,175
Not hard to figure out

1490
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,199
Also like

1491
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:05,855
Euron are planning a scam

1492
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:11,487
All right so if we are going to go rob this back and I know we are we've already

1493
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:14,815
Confirm that we will be robbing this Bank

1494
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:21,215
Call her

1495
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,519
Cars to get away

1496
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,823
Do you want to drive for it to use

1497
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,359
Specifically

1498
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,639
Right now that you have

1499
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:31,199
Very strange

1500
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:33,247
Bob Chapman

1501
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,271
Chose up

1502
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,551
Great the the

1503
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,343
Snow forecast for Bob Chapman

1504
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,647
Yeah

1505
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,951
Guy sucks but it's really all that in

1506
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,487
Borgesen Alec

1507
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,279
Give this time

1508
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,559
Don't buy gold

1509
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,863
It's all about buying gold

1510
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:52,447
Getting gas a copy of hard copy or an email copy

1511
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,215
Or

1512
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,007
You can get a free one year

1513
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:55,775
Subscription

1514
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:56,799
By getting

1515
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,103
Small gold coin

1516
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,503
So here's the point I want to make very clear lake

1517
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:06,783
If

1518
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,063
You're like sort of

1519
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,111
Expert on the economy

1520
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,671
And the radio show host

1521
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:17,279
And the guy who syndicate's the radio show who also runs the gold company

1522
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:21,631
Are all intertwined in a bizarre business relationship

1523
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:25,727
Don't get involved might be untrustworthy

1524
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:28,031
It might be that shady

1525
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:30,847
Fiesta forecaster recommends buying

1526
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:33,919
The exact amount of gold that I sell

1527
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,711
Perhaps this is not a good

1528
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:37,503
If the forecaster like his

1529
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,271
Business

1530
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:39,551
He's doing a newsletter

1531
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:43,647
You can get a free year of it if you buy gold

1532
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:47,999
It does seem like he hasn't affected by the forecast

1533
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:51,583
Cast of Rosie maybe people might bore

1534
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:57,983
But buy more gold or not Rosie

1535
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,287
He does work at school

1536
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:01,567
Usually

1537
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:02,847
It's it's

1538
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,175
You might have forgotten

1539
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:09,759
By now but this was supposed to be about the Rockefeller you remember that

1540
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:10,783
So this is the last

1541
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,551
Clip from

1542
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:18,975
I'm on Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. I'm going to cover this in more detail remember disrespectful video this weekend

1543
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:37,919
Future dictatorship

1544
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,199
To the environment

1545
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:42,527
Total control martial law

1546
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:46,879
Quarantine checkpoints biometric ID to travel to live

1547
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,439
Read what these monsters are planning for you

1548
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:51,999
It's the same thing in hundreds

1549
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,863
It's about food now

1550
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,655
I don't know what's going on

1551
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,679
I heard that

1552
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,703
Atmos like well

1553
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:01,983
You're going to get into it on

1554
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,775
So we better

1555
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,567
Better check in on Sunday while we're here

1556
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:06,335
Alright

1557
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:08,639
So we're going to be covering also the July 18th

1558
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,919
2010 episode

1559
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:13,759
I have

1560
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:14,527
To tell you this.

1561
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,575
This is a bit I got to warn you in advance

1562
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:19,135
Alex comes in a little

1563
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,415
To the show

1564
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,207
On Sunday okay he's got a head of

1565
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:28,863
Alright let me Adam Lenny Adam I am fired up

1566
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:35,263
Control myself throughout the next 2 hours it is Sunday the 18th

1567
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:46,015
We're here six days a week Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central vac Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.

1568
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:50,111
We have a lot of news in Mexico

1569
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,159
Part of the drug war down there

1570
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:57,279
How they climb now therefore days into a successful cap I pray this is the truth

1571
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:00,351
In the past but let's cross our fingers

1572
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,887
And say a prayer

1573
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:05,471
These are the same headlines

1574
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:10,591
Are you still just wait and seeing with PP

1575
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:11,615
What happened

1576
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:12,639
I don't know

1577
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,407
Okay

1578
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,431
It's very strange

1579
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,967
These are the reasons our

1580
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:17,759
Sure the reason is Maddie

1581
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:18,527
Is because

1582
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:27,487
Cover all the news today

1583
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:31,327
Security

1584
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,095
The web

1585
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,399
Friday

1586
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,423
A listener

1587
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:40,287
Pointed out the top searches were Lindsay Lohan Mel Gibson and

1588
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:49,247
Just do.

1589
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:52,831
Top search should be depression because we're going into

1590
01:11:57,951 --> 01:12:01,023
And Friday and Saturday was number one

1591
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:04,863
More than 20 newspapers and blogs

1592
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:06,399
Email sent out for year-and-a-half

1593
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:12,799
There are hundreds of versions of it up on YouTube

1594
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:18,175
We don't have

1595
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:20,991
6 years ago people that have them still have them

1596
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:26,111
And so

1597
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:35,839
Had gotten 6.5 million views at 6000 change Friday

1598
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:38,655
Saturday

1599
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:43,519
Well above 6.5 million about to be 6.6 million

1600
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,567
Well that sucks

1601
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:51,199
6.4

1602
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:03,487
Barack Obama or Obama or President Obama

1603
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:06,047
Not the number 3 like it's been like that for a year

1604
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:11,167
The number one ranked on the world wide web

1605
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:12,959
Mega viral video

1606
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:16,287
What's 6.5 million in growing no f****** way

1607
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,055
No

1608
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,359
Who is the first

1609
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:22,431
If you search for Obama Alex

1610
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:24,223
Absolutely

1611
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:25,759
McKay's

1612
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:30,111
It's only on Alex's browser

1613
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,135
Yeah

1614
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:33,183
Yeah I don't know I don't believe any of this

1615
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:34,463
But it worked

1616
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:35,743
Apparently

1617
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,535
I was just playing work

1618
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:40,863
You got more traffic I would like to know more about the people who pose

1619
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:41,887
Reviews

1620
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:42,655
Oh

1621
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:45,215
Could only find one or two

1622
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:45,983
That doesn't surprise

1623
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:49,823
And they were complementary

1624
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:52,127
I would like to have

1625
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:55,455
Examination from a film student

1626
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:56,479
Yeah

1627
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,247
So

1628
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,039
Melo news is Rosie

1629
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:01,087
I mean we got definitely

1630
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:01,855
More traffic

1631
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,623
Make the plan

1632
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:03,391
Shake It Off

1633
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,695
Sure we got the money and ran

1634
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,231
But unfortunately

1635
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,559
The FED might be on

1636
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:17,215
College professors politicians news people whatever

1637
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:17,983
You type

1638
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:18,751
Obama

1639
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:22,079
President Obama Barack Obama

1640
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:23,615
It was hacked

1641
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:31,807
And it it shows you're done by user that's what the heck is that go in and once it's deleted

1642
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:34,623
It's gone the 6.5 million views is gone

1643
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:37,695
All the tens of thousands of websites that are linked to that video

1644
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,975
It's dead link now

1645
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:42,303
And of course

1646
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:45,375
It's the Obama girl at the White House it's not our video

1647
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:52,031
It's an inside job from YouTube or Google

1648
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:22,751
Or as soon as I heard that my first thought was

1649
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:26,847
This Fiasco somehow involves the audience doing more free advertising

1650
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:29,151
Yeah probably

1651
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,735
Apparently according to Alex

1652
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,271
This guy

1653
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:37,343
Website that's B users Channel on YouTube.

1654
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:41,951
Must be an inside job

1655
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:45,535
Partially inspired by how jealous Obama is

1656
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,303
Of

1657
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,863
Alex

1658
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,655
Yeah

1659
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:52,447
Yep yep Obama

1660
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,471
Obama

1661
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:55,519
President President Barack Obama

1662
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:57,823
The most

1663
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:00,639
Well known Pat man on the planet

1664
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,407
Yep

1665
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,175
Jealous

1666
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:04,223
Widely widely respected

1667
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,271
Alex's

1668
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,063
Starpower

1669
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,855
Is reach

1670
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:17,023
Yeah man it's like it's like people get petty over download numbers you know or like YouTube views

1671
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,071
Alex and Obama were beefing

1672
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:24,447
They have the White House YouTube channel and they weren't in the same kind of traffic that Alex was getting

1673
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:29,311
I mean I would say they thoroughly fun

1674
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,591
F*****-up Healthcare at this

1675
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,639
Point so maybe Obama was like look

1676
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:38,271
I just got to focus on everything else

1677
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:43,135
So we'll get along but I want to get out in front of this in advance

1678
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:45,183
I don't believe that this even happen

1679
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:47,743
The most that I believe is that there was a

1680
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:53,887
Temporary Tech glitch or something with being blown out of proportion or conversely I could believe that this is all made up

1681
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,447
Hear my reasons for having that position

1682
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,471
1

1683
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:00,031
The video Alex is referring to on the chain

1684
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,823
The channel YouTube channel

1685
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,103
He's still up

1686
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:06,687
Active in the year of Our Lord 2021

1687
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,735
It still has the original publisher

1688
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,807
Date it didn't lose a 30-count nor did any of the

1689
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:12,575
The comments dis

1690
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,111
There's over

1691
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:20,511
200000 comments on it so I couldn't go through all of that but I was able to find some from the time. Of around 10 years ago

1692
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:26,399
And not her saying hey so glad to see this got put back up

1693
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,191
Thing to also is because

1694
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:31,263
There have been a couple people who have been having a running argument

1695
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:32,031
And for the last cup

1696
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,847
Couple months all right all right I like that

1697
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:40,223
Individual competition

1698
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:44,831
Possible to navigate still like if they both sound stupid

1699
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:47,647
Took two I was able to find some blow

1700
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,671
Who's covering the alleged

1701
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:52,255
Take down to this video and none of them can actually confirm that the video is too

1702
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,023
Taken down

1703
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:54,303
All of them rely on

1704
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:56,351
Entirely on claims the trace back to Alec

1705
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,119
What's himself

1706
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,143
Which seems sketchy

1707
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,679
It just so happens

1708
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:06,079
Is that the evidence that Alex had a lost and they were already dead I'm sorry

1709
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:08,127
Redan a true breed

1710
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:11,199
Are we able to find a forum thread on Gamespot about

1711
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:12,735
The claims of the video was taken

1712
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:16,831
Can down as an attempt to silence Alex and some of the poster little interesting

1713
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:18,879
Angry Pelican comment

1714
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:21,695
Quote I'm watching that video right now on YouTube

1715
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,719
It's not deleted

1716
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:25,791
Another user chimed in quote I have it on the background

1717
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:28,095
ARS one guy has a good analogy

1718
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:32,191
There seems to be a lot of people who work

1719
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:33,983
Confused at the link that was post

1720
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:36,799
The Twist supposedly

1721
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:41,151
Delivering them to a page that began playing a documentary about Obama

1722
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:43,967
So I believe that this is a

1723
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:44,735
Continuation of

1724
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:46,015
The traffic

1725
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:48,831
Began when it's Friday show with cheese now heightening

1726
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:49,599
On Sunday

1727
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:54,719
I can't say for certain that the video didn't have an error loading or something like that at some point but

1728
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:56,767
There's literally no part of my being

1729
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,047
That believes

1730
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,839
Hackers got into a YouTuber

1731
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:01,375
Accounted took down the Obama

1732
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,167
It almost

1733
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:05,983
The most unbelievable thing I can imagine

1734
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:06,751
It look now

1735
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:07,519
Alex

1736
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:10,079
Improve-it see when he went to YouTube

1737
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:14,175
Page opened up and it said you have internet connectivity

1738
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,199
Issues which

1739
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:16,223
Clearly mean

1740
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:18,527
That the YouTube page was

1741
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,551
Taking down

1742
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:24,927
Obviously if you get if you get that kind of message there's only one explanation

1743
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:28,767
So this is a federal crime

1744
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:33,119
The name, or President Obama Barack Obama in

1745
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:36,447
It was the number one link on Google and Yahoo

1746
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:43,871
That was before we had lister's promote the term The Obama Deception to make it the number one Trend search Friday and Saturday

1747
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:47,199
A whole bunch of newspapers reported on the film

1748
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:56,671
That film The Obama Deception of my newest film

1749
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:58,207
The rise of FEMA

1750
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:04,863
Luckily we were Twitter / by listeners and were able to call the director who runs the director Channel

1751
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:09,215
To get him inside their change the passcode before they took off

1752
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:14,848
The point is this is a serious federal crime

1753
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,664
This is an attack against everyone's free speech

1754
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:21,248
The other thing that I want

1755
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:24,064
This is that if you

1756
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,880
Had deleted the video which I don't believe they did

1757
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,928
I think they would have been within their rights

1758
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,024
Alex is clean the engaging in manipulative rack

1759
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,560
Necklaces to artificially game there

1760
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:39,936
He's openly discussing that is his plan and there's even been conversation on a radio show

1761
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:41,472
Groups of people using

1762
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:43,520
Box to boost Alex's view couch

1763
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:47,616
I could easily see an argument being made that this is an abuse of the platform and against the

1764
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,384
The terms of service

1765
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:51,968
That said you didn't delete this video and there was no hack

1766
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:54,784
I just wanted to point out that even if this was realize

1767
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:55,552
Still wouldn't care

1768
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:58,880
It is a federal crime for YouTube to enforce

1769
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:02,720
Terms-of-service policies Dan at stroke

1770
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:05,280
So Alex Shadows video the night before

1771
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,304
On Saturday night

1772
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,072
He's pissing

1773
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,352
So serious

1774
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,400
But he had to shoot a video talking

1775
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:14,496
Sing about how this video got taken down

1776
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:20,896
Google bomb in the video about how people make Google

1777
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:21,664
Beach

1778
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:26,528
My friends there has been an assault on the First Amendment and Free Speech

1779
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:30,368
The Obama Deception has been erased obliterated

1780
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:34,208
Don't know why is this important

1781
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:36,256
Well it deals with the First Amendment and Free Speech

1782
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,560
This hack was illegal

1783
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:43,168
And somehow got our passcode

1784
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:49,312
This film and other documentaries I've made so that you don't have a right to watch it

1785
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,592
And make up your own mind

1786
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,128
You don't have the right

1787
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,712
Alright so it still hasn't been taken

1788
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:57,760
No it's still up

1789
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,528
Yeah that's

1790
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,552
Definition of logic

1791
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,392
This

1792
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,672
Was so funny

1793
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,952
Alex describes

1794
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:06,976
What it was like

1795
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,000
2

1796
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:08,768
Experience

1797
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:10,816
This hack this is still from the video from the night

1798
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:11,584
Before

1799
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,400
And I got not his YouTube channel though right

1800
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:16,960
No it's another guy

1801
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:20,800
If they work together apparel a

1802
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:21,568
Jeffrey Wright

1803
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:23,360
And I got to say I don't like this

1804
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,384
This is where things

1805
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,664
Reached a level of like

1806
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,200
Bad movies

1807
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,224
Farce

1808
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:31,040
Luckily one of my webmasters

1809
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:35,904
I have to be writing a story about the fact that the Obama Deception was getting hundreds of thousands of use a day

1810
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,184
Number one

1811
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,976
Trend being searched

1812
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:41,024
On major search engines

1813
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:46,400
We were getting Twitter pink telling us it was down

1814
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:52,032
And I said hey

1815
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:54,592
He drove in from a barbecue

1816
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:56,640
William of the hour of the starting

1817
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:59,712
And was watching someone live in the interface

1818
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:08,160
Release date for the rise of FEMA and The Obama Deception and thank God we can change the passcode

1819
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:12,512
Saw a little guy creeping around inside the YouTube account

1820
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:28,384
That's up to

1821
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,688
It's good day sir that's good days

1822
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,248
That's another that's actually reason for

1823
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,784
I don't believe

1824
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,088
But I didn't want to spoil the fun

1825
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:40,160
It said that he has a way to fight back

1826
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,952
And so in this report that he's playing

1827
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,744
He has the solution

1828
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:46,304
Here's the good news we can fight back

1829
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:50,656
And the destiny of this documentary is now in your hands you can do several things

1830
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:51,936
Number one

1831
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:57,056
Go find the links on YouTube Google and other sites

1832
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:59,872
And send that link out to everyone and tell them

1833
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:01,664
This is a censored film

1834
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,968
This is a film that the establishment

1835
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:05,248
Doesn't want you to see

1836
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:11,648
This is a number one that was deleted

1837
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:17,280
Century book-burners

1838
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,304
An expression

1839
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,328
The American

1840
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,144
And the people the world are going to strike back

1841
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:25,216
To The Obama Deception

1842
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,752
Out to everyone you know

1843
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:34,432
The Google and Yahoo and other major search engines The Obama Deception

1844
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:40,832
And let's keep it at the top of the trench art let's make it the number one searched term in the world

1845
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,368
That it was

1846
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:45,696
Let's have The Obama Deception Rise From the Ashes

1847
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:48,512
Like a Phoenix carrying the light of Liberty

1848
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,536
And freedom

1849
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:51,840
It is up to all of you to carry this torch

1850
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:53,120
Wow

1851
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:54,912
Wow

1852
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:55,936
Can I throw a base

1853
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:56,704
Baseball Beckett

1854
01:24:57,472 --> 01:25:00,032
I don't know you can't do I have the arm strength

1855
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,056
I don't

1856
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:04,384
Think so I can reach 88 miles an hour I know that for a fact

1857
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,408
You can

1858
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:09,248
See how Alex is doing the exact same thing gear as he did on Friday

1859
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,272
Super height

1860
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:17,184
He's creating fake problem and he's made it emotionally resonant to the audience and then he's made sure that they know the only way for them

1861
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,976
Don't really fight back is to do more

1862
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:21,280
Free promotional work for Alexandra's website

1863
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:26,400
Instead of appealing to the audience is understandable feeling that the oil spill was more important

1864
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,424
Celebrity news

1865
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:29,728
Then co-opting for his own benefit

1866
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,264
This time houses made this

1867
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,800
Supposed deleting of his videos

1868
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:35,104
Attack on the audience themselves

1869
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,128
And freedom

1870
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:38,944
This is psychopath levels

1871
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,528
Yeah yeah so so what you're saying

1872
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:45,856
Is that you've manufactured this lie about the

1873
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:46,624
The video being

1874
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:48,160
In downtown

1875
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,184
Convince your list

1876
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,208
Nurse 21

1877
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:54,816
Share other versions of the same video

1878
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:58,144
If the video where censored dad

1879
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,960
Well it censored on that one that had all the

1880
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:01,728
Reviews

1881
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:02,496
Haha

1882
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:03,776
Yeah so we need

1883
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,568
Me to pump up the other views

1884
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,360
On the other ones

1885
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,384
Which

1886
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:10,432
If that is the point

1887
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:13,760
Those will be taken down in the same way

1888
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:14,528
Right

1889
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:18,112
And then we'll do it again

1890
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,672
So I remember

1891
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,208
Hearing

1892
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,744
Pretty regularly

1893
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:27,072
That the reason that Alex was embarking on this was

1894
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,096
Cuz he was a fender

1895
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:30,144
Did the BP was not higher

1896
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,168
Up on the trend

1897
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:34,752
Important story where is Lindsay Lohan and Mel Gibson

1898
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:35,776
Not important

1899
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:37,312
I think we may have lost sight of

1900
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,080
That

1901
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:38,848
Particular

1902
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,664
Okay no but Alex is about to

1903
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,200
Turn heel on TV

1904
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,992
The establishment

1905
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,784
Could not put up

1906
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:50,368
Friday and Saturday with the number one search Trend in the world

1907
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:52,928
Not being Lindsay Lohan or Mel Gibson

1908
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,000
BP oil spill

1909
01:26:57,792 --> 01:27:01,376
It was The Obama Deception because

1910
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,680
And the video

1911
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,216
That was the top

1912
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:07,520
Going on for at least a month

1913
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,568
When you type in the name Obama

1914
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,128
Any variation thereof was this filmed

1915
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:16,736
Chanel BP oil spill is an example of something that the gold was too wanted to

1916
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:20,320
Trend over Alex as opposed to the reason he's doing

1917
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,600
Hahaha

1918
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:22,880
This is silly

1919
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:23,648
It is

1920
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:24,672
Slippery

1921
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:31,072
You literally went over Lindsay Lohan in the

1922
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:33,120
They're trying to make it number one over

1923
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:35,168
Everything's like Lindsay Lohan in me

1924
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:36,960
Terrible

1925
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:44,128
Is it outrageous it's censorship of the highest order that they're trying to make BP the number one tutorial

1926
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,688
Was advocated for yesterday at Alder

1927
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:50,528
Justifying things

1928
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,344
Bigger than that it's about me

1929
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,904
Dealer show

1930
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,440
Not the video you chop tonight

1931
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:59,232
For this is where I

1932
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:02,304
I think I would say this reaches its natural can

1933
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:08,960
These sensors are going to have their way but let's not stop there let's make the second surgeon case they blacklisted

1934
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:10,240
Blacked out

1935
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,568
Obama Deception

1936
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:16,384
McCarthy

1937
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,992
I want you to search the term infowars.com

1938
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,528
No ww.w in front of it

1939
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:25,088
Just infowars.com

1940
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:27,904
Over and over again

1941
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,184
We'll see how they like it

1942
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:35,072
This is you naked

1943
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:35,840
Manipulative

1944
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:36,608
Piece of s***

1945
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:37,888
What

1946
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:40,448
Can you listen to that and not go

1947
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,728
F*** you

1948
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,008
It's

1949
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:47,616
The kind of thing that I see like I'm offended by how manipulative

1950
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:51,200
How is you are someone who took him seriously this would be a really tough

1951
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:52,480
Thing to experience

1952
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:54,528
But

1953
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:57,088
Looking at it now from the 10 years later

1954
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:57,856
Perspective

1955
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:59,136
Hard not to laugh

1956
01:28:59,392 --> 01:28:59,904
Ed Howard

1957
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:04,000
Embarrassingly and cleared

1958
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:07,584
Charade he's putting on in order to try and gain more traffic

1959
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:11,424
Yeah it would probably not work if you just said hey

1960
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,752
Hey guys I would like you to artificially inflate by traffic

1961
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:16,288
So I can become more well-known

1962
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:18,848
Open if you put on a patch

1963
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:19,872
The government

1964
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:24,224
Suburban all of this stuff

1965
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:30,880
Celebrities are trending what it should be serious stories like BP and so what we need to do is we need to get

1966
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,648
Get my

1967
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:35,488
Documentary about Obama

1968
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:36,512
So we do that

1969
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:39,840
Can we pretend that it gets inserted

1970
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:43,680
Then

1971
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:49,312
I didn't work the first to buy a new house

1972
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,336
Parkside

1973
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:53,408
So Alex now gets do what I would describe as a v

1974
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:55,968
Yelling face

1975
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,248
To eat up all of

1976
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:00,832
Dallas and I made the film

1977
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:05,952
I'm a Level Playing Field of ideas I won the Superbowl

1978
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:11,584
Shut up here didn't work 7 days a week

1979
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:17,984
To make this documentary and fly all over the country it's been hundreds of thousands of dollars to make it and I gave it to you for free

1980
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:32,320
Google girls boots

1981
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:38,976
I can't sell this video and I put up with it we wrote an article about it 6 months ago but left it at that

1982
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:45,888
And now they won't even let me give it out for free when they put their stinkin ads on it and I know they're the ones that

1983
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:47,680
I think

1984
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:48,960
The problem with the teacher was like

1985
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:50,496
Copyright

1986
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:52,032
Because he steals G

1987
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:52,800
Just about every

1988
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:56,384
He doesn't seem to understand for someone who's really a property rights

1989
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,688
Property seems to be a complicated

1990
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:00,224
Not interested pickle

1991
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,760
Intellectualism the name

1992
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:03,040
Sober

1993
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:06,880
He spent a little bit of time freaking out and yelling

1994
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:07,648
And

1995
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,000
Blown Away

1996
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,280
Listening to this like

1997
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:15,072
Like how clear it is that it's

1998
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:15,840
Just like

1999
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:17,376
Everything is driving

2000
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,400
Towards just like

2001
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,424
Self-promotion

2002
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,472
I need all of you to be my street team

2003
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,008
I need you to do this

2004
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,032
Yep

2005
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:30,688
Web but I

2006
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:38,368
American even make up some hanky-panky is every time they file false complaints against me

2007
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:39,904
I just filed in federal court

2008
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:46,304
Behind the scenes I've had to file in federal court no fewer than eight times in the last year-and-a-half to keep that stinking video

2009
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,888
I had to go in there and file

2010
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,984
Against false copyright claims and tell people put up or shut up let's go to court

2011
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:04,224
Barack Obama really is I am busting my butt here to bring this information I'm not complaining

2012
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:17,024
I know you understand that you're upset out there with lifter so I'm going to beg you

2013
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,328
On my knees for all of our few darts

2014
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:28,544
We caught him inside the interface deleting videos where they weren't able to

2015
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,080
No you lying

2016
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:34,688
I want you because that's basically part to The Obama Deception and quite frankly even more power

2017
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:36,224
Viral

2018
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:39,040
I want you to get that video

2019
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:41,856
The homework if you choose to take this mission

2020
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:46,464
Over and over again Obama Deception censored

2021
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:49,792
Infowars.com

2022
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:51,840
The Republic

2023
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:53,888
All of the Republic

2024
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:55,168
Yeah so now he's promoting

2025
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:55,936
Sequel

2026
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:57,728
Oh man

2027
01:32:58,752 --> 01:32:59,520
Oh boy

2028
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:01,568
Is this

2029
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:07,200
Is this how movie should advertise from here on out should we should we have more movies just being like

2030
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:10,016
This movie is coming out on

2031
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:12,064
January 21st

2032
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,856
And you are going to love it

2033
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:16,672
What they don't want you to see it on January

2034
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:20,512
21st so what you all need to do to see this movie is Google

2035
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:23,328
The name of this movie on January 21st

2036
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,120
Because they're censoring it

2037
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:28,192
Hankinson in Africa

2038
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:29,472
Campaign

2039
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:33,568
I don't know if it would be effective outside the context of a very

2040
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:36,384
Cracked audiobook Alex has

2041
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:39,200
What happened

2042
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:39,968
With the Snyder cut

2043
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:40,736
Or whatever

2044
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,272
I choose not

2045
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:44,832
Not to know anything about that smart

2046
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:49,440
I just know that a couple times

2047
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:53,024
I'm going to go the other way

2048
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:53,792
So they took

2049
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:54,560
Is downright

2050
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:56,864
This documentary

2051
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,400
I don't believe it either

2052
01:33:58,656 --> 01:33:59,424
But they did it

2053
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,192
In order to keep

2054
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:01,216
Are you okay

2055
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:02,496
Cuz they they were afraid

2056
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:06,336
I understand these Trends it would have gotten a million in the next week

2057
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:09,152
Probably next week they know we hit the zeitgeist

2058
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:12,224
Quintin

2059
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:18,624
And they shot this video down so you don't have access to it and so you don't have a right to see it

2060
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,672
They're going to decide what you get to see

2061
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:24,512
This is 21st century book burning and then I've got stacks of news

2062
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:26,048
Right here in front of me

2063
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:30,912
I mean here's one that's ignored due process First Amendment shut down thousands of blogs

2064
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:37,056
That should be the number-one 73000 blogs were shut down last week no judge

2065
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:39,360
No jury no nothing

2066
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:44,736
Vice President Biden and intellectual property enforcement coordinator Victoria espinel

2067
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,528
Gave an order

2068
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,344
And they've got quotes here

2069
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,952
The DMC takedown actions were direct violation of the First Amendment under prior restraint

2070
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:57,024
However explains law professor Wendy seltzer

2071
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:05,728
They have not received constitutional scrutiny despite the high risk of error seltzer'ade

2072
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,032
White House

2073
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:10,848
Now issuing 70

2074
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:11,872
3

2075
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:12,896
Thousand

2076
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:14,176
Take down orders

2077
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:14,944
This week

2078
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:19,552
Mainly of blobs critical of Barack Hussein Obama

2079
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:22,368
So Alex is talking about the blog platform

2080
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,136
Blog entry

2081
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:24,160
Hiiraan

2082
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:27,488
It was there was some initial theories that people were kicking around

2083
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:29,280
The platform was taken down due to

2084
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:30,560
Dcri dmca

2085
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:31,328
Complaints

2086
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,352
That was just pure released

2087
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,120
Speculation

2088
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:36,448
It came out a couple days later the reason the server that

2089
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:40,800
House blog entry kicked it off and just removed 73000 torso blog

2090
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:44,384
Was it someone was using the server to host an Al-Qaeda recruit

2091
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,152
Provement website

2092
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:47,968
Complete with a hit list and instructions on bomb make

2093
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:51,808
Marquetry was hosted on servers on by burst. Net

2094
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,856
Who got contacted by the FBI regarding

2095
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:54,880
Terrorism stop

2096
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:57,184
Emily decided to stop working with baggage

2097
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:02,304
Apparently there had been some past terms-of-service violations that are unspecified

2098
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,584
Must have just decided

2099
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:08,192
If they were allowing an al-qaida site to stay up at they may represent too much of a risk

2100
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,216
To stay on the

2101
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:16,128
I'm not sure in the end what happened with all this but as of July 21st 2010

2102
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:19,712
There was an article on scene at about burst. Nets effort

2103
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:20,480
To try to get

2104
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:22,272
The data from people's blocks back

2105
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:26,880
So they can have their blog shortly would not rehost blogatog

2106
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:30,976
You shouldn't lose all of your car

2107
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:36,096
That to the extent that was possible they were saying they were

2108
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:38,144
Find a way to make

2109
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:38,912
That happened

2110
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:41,728
There's no indication that any of these affected blogs

2111
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:46,080
You're critical of Obama or if anyone had anything to do with these acts

2112
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,872
I was just making that up

2113
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:48,640
Because it's a

2114
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:52,480
Concurrent headline that can be used to strengthen his Obama Deception censorship patch

2115
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:56,064
They are taking down 73000

2116
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,600
Block the no one's talk

2117
01:36:57,856 --> 01:37:01,440
Talking about it which is why you need to Google The Obama Deception

2118
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:02,720
Right now

2119
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:06,304
Also to be clear that stuff about Biden and Victoria espinel

2120
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:08,608
Unrelated story from

2121
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:09,632
Dune where there was

2122
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,656
Discussion about it

2123
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:12,704
The massive economic cost of copyright

2124
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:15,008
The Infowars story about the

2125
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:16,032
Roblox being removed

2126
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:19,616
Just kind of assumed that the reason that they got taken down with copyright violation

2127
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:21,152
So the whole angle is that

2128
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:22,176
But it's not true

2129
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:22,944
And also

2130
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,480
You just tell Alex's like

2131
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:27,296
He doesn't even know how the story on Infowars

2132
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:28,832
Kidstogether

2133
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:31,648
Just finding bits and pieces of it and I needing it madly

2134
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:34,464
Using it in a way to adjust

2135
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,488
Supply whatever the

2136
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,536
The story already is

2137
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,072
So luck

2138
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:40,096
What the internet

2139
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:44,448
Do you know will be hard to censor

2140
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:45,728
The internet

2141
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:46,496
The real world

2142
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:53,408
All the free links

2143
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,200
With the expanded actress

2144
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:56,992
And make copies of this

2145
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:00,320
We making a hundred copies of this might cost you fifty bucks

2146
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,088
Thank you

2147
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:04,160
Give it out to everybody you know

2148
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:05,696
Your local church

2149
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:09,536
The system doesn't want you to see The Obama Deception

2150
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:14,656
Fall Republic

2151
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:17,728
We are part to here

2152
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:20,288
Absolutely one-hundred-percent

2153
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,824
That is

2154
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:22,592
Yeah

2155
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,408
She was little

2156
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:27,968
But you need to know that this is

2157
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:30,272
Sprint

2158
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:32,832
Need to get this

2159
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:35,392
That you are converting people to the word

2160
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:38,208
This this next trip is a little jar

2161
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,232
I found his

2162
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,768
Switching to a little bit weird

2163
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:43,840
They can arrest all of us it's over

2164
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:46,144
It's over we're done

2165
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,680
Rolling over

2166
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:49,216
Dungiven in

2167
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:51,264
I got a deal right now

2168
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:56,384
Infowars.com you click on both of shopping carts

2169
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:58,944
For films for 1995

2170
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:02,784
I don't even make money on that because I put a free Pocket Constitution and every order

2171
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:08,160
Okay with the cost of the filter thing else that comes out to less than $5 for film

2172
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,696
If you get 10 films

2173
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:11,488
3995

2174
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,768
That's very weird

2175
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,048
Wow that's

2176
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:21,984
241

2177
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:23,520
Sales right now

2178
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,080
Ideal baby

2179
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,872
Oh man

2180
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:29,920
So Alex throws to break

2181
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:31,456
Really really patch

2182
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:33,504
He's freaking me out a little bit

2183
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:37,856
The underlying message here is that the only thing you need to do

2184
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:40,928
To break the will of the NWO

2185
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:44,512
Is support Alex's stuff and give him

2186
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:45,280
Free Press

2187
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:52,448
You print up an image of Obama is a joker and you say Google Obama Deception and you never stopped and

2188
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:58,848
You left these Nazi blood-sucking anti-American parasites that want to make you and your family slaves

2189
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:14,976
I'm not downtown everyday

2190
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:21,376
Better to be who I am

2191
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:47,488
Yeah

2192
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:53,888
There's a little boy it sounds like on Thursday of her dues it was Alex we

2193
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:55,680
DVD sales

2194
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,056
And then you can hear this is like

2195
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:02,592
This is like after a comic

2196
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:04,384
He's been on the road for a year

2197
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,152
And they bought

2198
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,432
200 t-shirts

2199
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:13,088
And they got 190 in the Box I took a bath on this printer

2200
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:14,368
Give these away

2201
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:20,000
Better turn families

2202
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,024
Continued existence

2203
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:25,120
If you something it's conditional I'll buy it yesterday I'll get this s*** out

2204
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,680
So

2205
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:28,704
Just more of this

2206
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,592
They know what we're doing is effective

2207
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:40,480
They have all these statistics

2208
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:46,624
And taking down my film The Obama Deception

2209
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,256
White House live

2210
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:55,584
Barack Obama or President Obama Obama

2211
01:41:58,656 --> 01:41:59,680
What's the number one link

2212
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:03,264
Are the number one searched term last two days

2213
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,800
What's not let them stop us

2214
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:08,128
What search the term father Republic my newest film

2215
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,408
What search

2216
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:12,224
The term police state for the rise of FEMA

2217
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,552
Infowars.com

2218
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:21,952
We can't be stopped

2219
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:23,232
It doesn't

2220
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:24,768
Keeps going doesn't

2221
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:25,536
Tires

2222
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:30,912
Just doubling down on this side this

2223
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:33,984
We need to remain organization

2224
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,264
Obama's

2225
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,288
Policies

2226
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:41,920
And I I don't know what any of them are and you're were about to take control of the Senate because

2227
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:44,224
Is the Democratic party is s***

2228
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,552
I'm going to have to say the only way to stop him is to make him

2229
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:50,112
Feel bad when he Google's his own name

2230
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:52,160
In my imagination

2231
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:56,256
I'm a guy and he's trying to

2232
01:42:56,512 --> 01:42:59,328
Pump It Up about doing free Street teamwork for him

2233
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:02,400
Are hitting everybody right now is a test because

2234
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:04,192
The bottom fell out of Obama

2235
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:06,752
He is their front man

2236
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:09,312
He was supposed to bring us

2237
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:13,152
We oughta be happy

2238
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:16,480
And just lets me know the effect we're having so what are we going to do about it

2239
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:17,248
Antonio

2240
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,784
Are you coming by tonight

2241
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:25,184
Are you going to send everybody the links to The Obama Deception that are still online are you going to make copies

2242
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:29,024
Going, Drive-In and at the top of the France

2243
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:31,328
Yeah they're only making us mad to do it more

2244
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:36,448
No sir

2245
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,288
His collar is so close to recognizing the dynamic that's happened

2246
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:44,128
When Alex asked if he's going to burn the DVDs and send out links

2247
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:45,408
All sorts of free Street

2248
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:47,712
Teamwork for Infowars the caller says

2249
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:51,040
They're only making us mad to do it more yep

2250
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:52,320
That's totally correct

2251
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:56,416
Except the imaginary globalist aren't the ones making him mad in order to get him to post more

2252
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:57,440
Infowars

2253
01:43:57,952 --> 01:43:58,976
Alex's doing math

2254
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,280
Yeah you didn't stop

2255
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:02,048
Open thing

2256
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:07,424
Will the globalist be mad about this more will Alex just

2257
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,448
SP morfema

2258
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,520
Yeah I might

2259
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:12,288
Be wrong

2260
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:14,336
Yeah this one could

2261
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:17,152
Beyond me you know what I'm going to stick around

2262
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:18,176
And I'm going to stay listen

2263
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:21,760
And for the rest of my life bet

2264
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:23,808
Everybody who took the races them

2265
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:27,392
I could either engage and self-reflection or

2266
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:32,512
Can send out links yet and did you know I'm definitely going to keep sending these links to people who have

2267
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:33,792
Long ago

2268
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:34,560
Put my

2269
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:36,352
It filtered into the

2270
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:40,448
Forward forward forward no

2271
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:42,752
So I asked if another caller

2272
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,032
And this guy is weird

2273
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,360
He seems to be a fan of some

2274
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:48,640
Financial broadcast

2275
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:52,224
And that lead people on this

2276
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:52,992
Does broadcast

2277
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:54,272
I've been wanting to have added

2278
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:55,808
With Alex about something

2279
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:56,832
Sure and Alex has been

2280
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:59,136
Or something along those lines

2281
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:06,816
This past Saturday on the webcast from Financial sense online Jim puplava who's the proprietor said that

2282
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:10,144
Your office hasn't gotten back to him yet another issue

2283
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,080
We have sponsors and very white shirt

2284
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:24,480
I'm sorry what. You guys coming here on Sunday as well

2285
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:30,368
Probably 10-15 interviews a day I can't do them all physically

2286
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:33,440
And Beyond

2287
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:37,024
I tried to recruit other people I'm trying to find other host I can promote

2288
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,840
Problems

2289
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:41,376
Are they can't handle the power

2290
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:44,448
I can't do it all as my problem

2291
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:47,264
Do they turn it on go maniac

2292
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:49,568
I just can't afford to at

2293
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:51,360
Advertise

2294
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:52,640
You guys do it

2295
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:55,456
I don't understand what this is that this isn't complicated

2296
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:58,272
No I mean like you responded to exactly the point

2297
01:45:58,528 --> 01:46:01,344
Of that clip that made me angry

2298
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:05,184
He's like I have a plug but like 30 seconds on the show heard everything

2299
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,720
You have Plugged In The End

2300
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:11,328
Hires everything mad

2301
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:13,888
BB laugh

2302
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:17,216
Two episodes of the show the Friday and Sunday show

2303
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:17,984
Have been

2304
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:20,288
Protracted nonstops

2305
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:23,360
You're a mental long-form advertising

2306
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:26,176
Impressive advertising

2307
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,480
I do think

2308
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:30,272
Did this possibility that Alex

2309
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:31,040
Doesn't

2310
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:32,064
Experience

2311
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:33,600
Is plugging

2312
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:34,880
Or whatever but

2313
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:35,904
Take and take

2314
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:36,672
Confirm lichen

2315
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:37,952
External viewpoint

2316
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:38,720
Like that's all he

2317
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:39,488
He's doing

2318
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:40,512
Everything

2319
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:42,560
It yeah yeah I know this is

2320
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:43,328
Complaining

2321
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:44,096
About

2322
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:45,376
Not getting enough

2323
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:46,656
Views

2324
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:47,680
All this is

2325
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:51,264
I'm being mad.

2326
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,032
Mel Gibbs

2327
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:53,312
Is racism is more interest

2328
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:57,408
Sing the news Angelo hands more famous than him

2329
01:46:58,432 --> 01:47:02,016
Unless and until the show ends on Sunday okay

2330
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:03,040
Boy it's familiar

2331
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:09,952
Shortwave

2332
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:18,656
Doing let's count

2333
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:23,776
Obama Deception out to everyone and infowars.com out to everyone God bless you all

2334
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:26,336
Is this

2335
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,688
Episode

2336
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:34,016
Hold and also kind of tickled

2337
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:34,784
Confused

2338
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:35,808
Because I went

2339
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:37,600
Back trying to find the

2340
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:38,624
The coverage of the

2341
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,648
The Rockefeller

2342
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:48,352
The most important document of all time was all over like

2343
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:51,424
Plan he reveal Roblox

2344
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:55,008
They got the information out to everybody now I might be

2345
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:55,776
Cynical

2346
01:47:56,032 --> 01:48:00,128
I might be a little Jaded by my time covering Alex but I will say that my

2347
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:03,200
Experience of listening to these episode

2348
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:06,528
Football's altogether you barely cared at all of us

2349
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:09,344
Feels like he even told people not to worry about

2350
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,368
About it so much

2351
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,136
Yeah

2352
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:18,048
Let's get better reception out there

2353
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:20,608
Okay so what we re contextualize that

2354
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:23,168
Dumb f*** video as yeah

2355
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:23,936
First off

2356
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:25,472
He's a lying piece of s***

2357
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:26,240
Enterprise

2358
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:29,056
If he isn't

2359
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:29,824
Align peace

2360
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:30,848
Piece of s*** if he is

2361
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:32,128
Claiming that he predict

2362
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:33,920
This entire thing

2363
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:36,224
He failed on a level

2364
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:39,296
So incomprehensible

2365
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:40,832
I had to listen to

2366
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:44,672
For f****** hours of him tell people to Google The Obama Deception

2367
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:49,792
I'm warning the Free World we're all about to die

2368
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:52,864
If he had come into the possession of this plan

2369
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:55,680
Document that was a good laid it all out there

2370
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:57,984
Yeah you do

2371
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:00,800
More time on it

2372
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:01,824
Then he did

2373
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,640
Probably more time talking about the

2374
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:06,688
The BP situation and how

2375
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:08,992
Lettuce

2376
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,296
Which is not hard-hitting news

2377
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:12,064
Oh yeah

2378
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:15,392
I think there's very little by way of the

2379
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,440
That's why

2380
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:19,488
The present day 2021

2381
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:20,768
Video about

2382
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:23,328
Coverage of the Rockefeller document is so thin

2383
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:25,632
So where we even touched nothing

2384
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:28,192
Another headline

2385
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:28,960
