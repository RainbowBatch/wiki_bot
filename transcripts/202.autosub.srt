00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:48,384
Opening one for a long time that was terrible now I'm searching

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,176
For the questions

13
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:55,040
Yeah I know that's why you kind of have to ask question

14
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,368
I don't know what I was doing

15
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,136

51
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:54,240
Discount to no possibilities as being the case

52
00:03:54,496 --> 00:04:00,640

00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
Congress vodka was the

70
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,495
The cheapest how much was that

71
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,591
2 bucks for a pint maybe in Missouri

72
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,639

00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
An entire pint

76
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,879
Congress vodka in one talk

77
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,071
Me and my buddies were going to go bowling

78
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:00,191
And I'm the only way to deal with the

79
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:06,591
Before You Go-Go

80
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,919

So we just got booked.

84
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,463
The whole thing today

85
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
Very drunk

86
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:32,703

87
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
We just got drink

88
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:43,455
Jordan how do you feel about the question up atop that would have led to that story as opposed to some dumb s***

89
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,759
What about Sunday

90
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:50,367
See if I can be edited

91
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:59,327
I sat down to get this episode together and because of the events of the last two days Alex Washington out

92
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
Getting banned from

93
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,167
Twitter I knew that we would have to do is do a present-day episode

94
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,703
As much as

95
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,239
My heart and soul

96
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,079
You got to do what you got to do

97
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:16,991
Okay well I know Owen Shroyer was hosting on Wednesday

98
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
So I

99
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,951
So I thought for sure Thursday show would also be Owen Shroyer

100
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:32,095
So let's go check out

101
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
Around

102
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,679
Before all of this from that

103
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Now

104
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,519
Through that I realized

105
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
Based on

106
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
Interaction

107
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,895
How much is in studio here on Thursday

108
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,479
He went to DC for a day

109
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,503
Just to do that

110
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,575
The show on Thursday

111
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,367
So

112
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,927
I suppose so

113
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,999
I have a few clips that I want to play

114
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:09,471
And then most of this episode will be going over Thursday show

115
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,751
Being f***** with Marco Rubio

116
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,031
So

117
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:18,431
And it's kind of fun because we all know that a couple hours later to get picked up with her and he doesn't know it at all

118
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
Bear

119
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
But

120
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
Here is an out-of-context drop

121
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,063
Today

122
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:38,911
My favorite DJ call

123
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:43,775
There should be a police for specifically for that

124
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,311
On the Wheels of Steel

125
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
So great

126
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,455
So we'll start here on Tuesday which is the

127
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
Mistaken

128
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:02,207
Most of the show is about Alex being mad that everyone is saying that he doesn't have a lot of fat

129
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,511
Right it's really petulant

130
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,791
It's really Petty

131
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
And it takes up

132
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,703
A very large portion of the episode malignant narcissist

133
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,567
So he's rambling about how the media is weaponized trying to

134
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,103
To destroy your will

135
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
Trying to break your back

136
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,671
But Alex uses this as his example of how the media is

137
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:43,679
Demoralize you just military

138
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,103
Let's find out

139
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,135
Text Alex Jones

140
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:11,327
Anymore

141
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,911
Lawyers

142
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,271
What we're talking about

143
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,879
Full shots

144
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,767
This is what we're talking about

145
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,863
They know this

146
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
So is that it

147
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,127
What are you talkin about

148
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,919
This is highest traffic ever

149
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,967
So what

150
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
Fair

151
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,319
But he's just not telling the whole story

152
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,927
Alexa

153
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
Like

154
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,743
You had a massive spike in traffic

155
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,055
Drop off

156
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:30,687
Immediate drop-off back before or roundabout

157
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,271
Telling the truth but he's just using a sort of

158
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,063
Cheating

159
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,599
Great I mean

160
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
The New York Times

161
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,927
Whatever they're talking about this time talking about what happened

162
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
After

163
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
He's got kicked off stuff

164
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,791
He's using the immediate thing as like

165
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,071
Forever

166
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,167
Then the same way that whenever he got kicked off everything his app

167
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,239
Shot up the rank

168
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,335
Town after that immediate push

169
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,383
Because there is like that

170
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,711
Oh where we going to get this from let's all migrate

171
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,247
And then you see diminishing returns

172
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,295
You're not getting penetrate

173
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,671
Well not least of which nobody has any f****** attention

174
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:19,839
Celeb becomes non-existent two days later everywhere

175
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,031
When everybody you

176
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,591
We spent a good couple of days tweeting about it

177
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,919
And then it was

178
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:42,623
Talking about this he wants to tell you more about how is traffic

179
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,903
Check is better than everyone says

180
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:50,303
Surprises

181

00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
Aber

192
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:56,607
Relic they want to take you just talkin about his own

193
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
Traffic

194
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,311
He's the boy

195
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,151
Award Woods

196
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,367
I feel like he has done something superlative

197
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:22,975
Maybe it was a good soccer player gets a trophy

198
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,815
Player of the year

199
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,887
I don't know if I ever read any of his like biography

200
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
Know about his

201
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:37,567
Extracurricular skills

202
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
You know there's a relative

203
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:46,015
Actually not even in the realm of cannibals he's really not in the top 10

204
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,999
The Fine Young Cannibals

205
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,119
Play ever actually

206
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,239
It's driving me crazy all right all right

207
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,079
I'm so it is next one

208
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:17,247
No you get half-life alyx

209
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Continues with the theme

210
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:24,159
What's wrong

211
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,303
Tubalcain

212
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,935
Demoralize you

213
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
What

214
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
Doggy style

215
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,663
News flash

216
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:50,527
Rick Moore

217
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,319
About that

218
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:58,719
That hurt

219
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:09,215
What rtj1

220
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,799
AutoZone rtj2

221
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,807
No idea what he's talking about that

222
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,391
Most of what we would have ended up

223
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,535
Talking about is traffic

224
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,839
How everyone says it's worse than it is

225
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
Just because

226
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
You know

227
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,751
It's fairly it's relevant

228
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,847
I listen to it

229
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:28,319
Still give you the insinuation that he needs more money is in

230
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:34,719
But they're also causing record expenses and

231
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:49,823
Or else the game is up master of physical Judah

232
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:55,711
We're winning the no one is motivated needlessly give him

233
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,503
If it's a

234
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,831
If it's also a tie

235
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,623
It'll be like we're destroying them

236
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,439
You have to walk the fine line with both of them or else his business

237
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,743
And rhetoric model don't match

238
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
I don't work

239
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
Until

240
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
Just about

241
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,175
Talking about

242
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:30,271
Disruptive

243
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:36,927
I can't imagine you don't know what happened

244
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:43,327
The only one who doesn't know what happened I'm the only one who doesn't have any

245
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:49,727
Avoid hearing and Marco Rubio

246
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,823
Really stupid okay well I'll just give you a little bit of a breakdown thank you

247
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:04,575
Alright good work

248
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,111
Cassandra Fairbanks

249
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:12,511
And of course Charles notable recent

250
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
Trying to push those fake

251
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,607
I doctored documents

252
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,423
About Chuck Schumer having sexually harassed

253
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,983
Along with Mike cernovich

254
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,031
I don't know if

255
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
Or disproven

256
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,383
That they may have made those fake documents

257
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:32,735
So they were trying to work in a propaganda campaign

258
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:39,135
Suicide Squad

259
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:45,791
He has tweeted while all this is going down

260
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,839
Gotten out of public life and life

261
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,911
Beast

262
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:57,311
This is a f****** kind of like I'm glad I'm not there

263
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:03,711
Hey you guys you guys do that work right now

264
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,807
Disrupting screen but house

265
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:21,631
Yeah I heard about that kicked out

266
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:26,495
Don't make a scene in the actual courtroom during room

267
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,031
He knows that he would also.

268
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,663
Has he waited in the hall

269
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,503
Marco Rubio is getting interviewed Quest

270
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
James Adam

271
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,575
General strategy

272
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:45,439
Conspiracy theorist yell at you and then expect

273
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,487
Respond to all of them or one of them

274
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:51,327
If you respond to the other 29

275
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,887
You respond to none of them

276
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,679
You can't handle my question

277
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,751
Set a trap for Marco Rubio

278
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,055
As much as I hate

279
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,871
He could then there's nothing you can do in that situation

280
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:09,503
The hours for coming in to try and initiate a situation where he gets to make a video that you look

281
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,319
Or Alex looks like a big man

282
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,416
Who are you

283
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,536
Time to do in that situation

284
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,328
Tweet something in support of

285
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:27,680
Conservatives being censored immediately after Alex Jones was kicked off Facebook

286
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,704
I don't I don't know

287
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,496
Like

288
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,568
Aren't you recognizing with the beard

289
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,872
That's possible

290
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:42,272
Like there's 100 possibilities

291
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:48,672
Is this a walking version of that weird magnet game where you have little

292
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:52,512
Beard on a little plastic

293
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:56,864
Alex

294
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,960
Juvly Pat's Marco Rubio on the shoulder

295
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,240
Which is inappropriate

296
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
You shouldn't touch

297
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,824
B-ball

298
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,592
Senators

299
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:12,992
Well it's because they are no better than the rest

300
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:19,392
Probably an issue that we should talk about

301
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,696
Class that is more likely to be attacked

302
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
Then a normal citizen

303
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
Generally

304
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,536
Like a remora

305
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,584
Politician

306
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,144
You consider that the sultan murders

307
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,032
Humans don't

308
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,360
Unless they want to be totally across the Spectrum

309
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
Always

310
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,968
Zpacks Alex on the patio on the shoulder and said don't touch me

311
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,528
Like. Like not like

312
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,064
Memes

313
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,464
Alex Alex

314
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,280
Rubio's

315
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
Take care of myself

316
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,376
Oh you're going to take care of me

317
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,496
Graphite is another trap

318
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,568
He touched him intentionally or some sort of

319
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
Thing like that where they

320
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
Get into a macho apostrophe

321
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:16,224
So he does that propaganda piece good on him

322
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,344
People that like the sequel to Lilith Fair the Macho Foster Fest

323
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,440
Not really relevant

324
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,488
So you don't that it works

325
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:31,072
Congratulations on your

326
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:38,752
You know publicity stunt

327
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:45,408
There were no consequences whatsoever

328
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,968
Reporter for CNN in the hall

329
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,504
49

330
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,552
How the camera on his face

331
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,856
I told him that he had evil eyes

332
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,416
He was a monster

333
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,696
Destroyer

334
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,280
History would remember him as a horrible monster

335
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,888
Understand

336
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:11,008
He was one of the people who was pointing out winter came out and said that Alex would be kicked off

337
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,080
He did the things that you've done in the past in the present

338
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,104
Yeah

339
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,664
Violated

340
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,200
I believe he was pushing

341
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:25,600
The listless

342
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:35,072
So Alex is like telling him that looks like a possum that came out of a cow's ass

343
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:41,472
He calls them boys you should know I know I know

344
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:46,592
Really funny cuz I kind of like

345
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,152
Alex

346
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,480
I got his camera off taking him to

347
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:57,600
What else more exasperated

348
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,976
I think this probably was the bigger problem

349
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:10,912
Read this and then also straight-up just yelling at those are real

350
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:15,776
Marco Rubio

351
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,616
Racially tinged

352
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,896
Targeted harassment

353
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,968
No other purpose

354
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,808
To have been there for 9 minutes yelling

355
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,880
With not getting anything back not having a debate

356
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,184
Not having an interview of any kind

357
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,976
It it just harassed

358
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,560
It's like a it's like a

359
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,096
Is that like a

360
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:47,008
There's some sort of crime

361
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,360
It was like

362
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:57,760
Your contention is that Jeff was on the up-and-up when he said that the reason that got kicked off with

363
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,344
But I don't put those words in my mouth

364
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,184
Apologize

365
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,560
That's that my interpretation

366
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,864
I don't think that

367
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Alex

368
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
Harassing

369
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,448
Jack Dorsey in public

370
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
I don't think

371
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
Would be like

372
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,544
Oh my God he's

373
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,408
Come close to my face or something like that and then been like

374
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,200
Yeah I do believe

375
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:33,600
Based on the statement the Twitter put out it does make sense to me that the nine minutes of him straight up

376
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
Harassing

377
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,416
Individual

378
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,976
Who didn't deserve any of that kind of treatment

379
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:45,376
And broadcasting it over Twitter's service Periscope right

380
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,960
That's the sort of thing

381
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:54,848
Yeah you have the idea that

382
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,920
He's using this platform the twitter-owned

383
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:04,320
In order to broadcast that harassment in the people listening

384
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,392
Turn around and send me messages to Oliver

385
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,184
You have a situation where it's like

386
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:13,536
Okay this is absolute abuse

387
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:17,376
I don't say I'm not here

388
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,680
Trust his motives at all

389
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
They

390
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,776
Save

391
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,080
And I'm willing to accept that as a reasoning

392
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:30,944
With the caveat that he should have been thrown off long ago and we can just order

393
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:37,088
My personal reaction to a space on the report

394
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
Jack

395
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:43,232
Personally intervening to make sure that Alex stays on the platform

396
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:49,376
I am going to leave after

397
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,656
Personally

398
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,216
That's right that's my opinion

399
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:58,080
Absolutely recognize yours

400
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,128
It's it's 22 oz

401
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,224
I guess they didn't if he hadn't have confronted Jack

402
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,040
And he still did that I would probably be

403
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,344
Far more likely to agree with you

404
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,488
Feeling is my sleeping on it is that I would assume

405
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:19,840
That there was a robust conversation going on with Twitter

406
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,608
World

407
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:24,192
Yeah I am back was he like he was being like well

408
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,776
You know let's not kick him off you know he was personally

409
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:34,176
Vetoing Alex interaction with

410
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,992
I would not be surprised if it was enough to be like

411
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,784
Alright you guys alright f*** this

412
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,600
Let's just do it if you want hundred percent

413
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,928
And no matter what reality is Alex

414
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,464
Blue wall

415
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
Spectrum

416
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,072
Silence

417
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,864
Conservatives or anything like that

418
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
Action

419
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:59,008
Now be back for the problem that I bring up every time

420
00:28:59,264 --> 00:28:59,776
Something like this happen

421
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,336
Twitter's entered dangerous territory

422
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,896
Do is you have to

423
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
Enforce these sorts of

424
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
Rules uniformly

425
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:11,552
And you can't do that. The world's pretty all right

426
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,392
The people at the hangers on the lingerers of the

427
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,696
You're opening up

428
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,000
An opportunity for them to cry

429
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,024
Every time

430
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,048
Someone does something

431
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,584
Similar

432
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,424
Pretty much that's exactly

433
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,824
Kicked off of Twitter campaign where everyone is posting

434
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,200
Racist harassment

435
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,504
Pledging my love

436
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,112
If Milos case study is any indication

437
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,136
It doesn't matter

438
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:56,096
Anymore now we have this President's Day

439
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:02,496
That is almost certainly going to be racist

440
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,848
Stop Twitter I believe in wholeheartedly with a world

441
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,384
Wheels

442
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,528
Did the other the other thing

443
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,600
I lost my train of thought

444
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,976
Mdcu analysis

445
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,256
They're obviously

446
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,048
No extraneous

447
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,632
Being a jackass

448
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,168
With his cameraman

449
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
I do remember the

450
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,944
Yeah it's just like

451
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:50,880
Nothing wrong

452
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,000
Kick you out of places

453
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:56,768
For doing

454
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,536
Things that are

455
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,560
Appropriate there

456
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,328
Fight

457
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:04,192
Restart the narrative is by comparing himself to the people who are protesting

458
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,984
Cavanaugh's

459
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,264
Confirmation

460
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,056
I also

461
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,872
By the way

462
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,152
If a lot of

463
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
Distract

464
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,200
The Kavanaugh

465
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,248
Also

466
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,296
This

467
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,576
Look

468
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,624
Let's hear it

469
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,184
This is exactly the outcome Alex

470
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,256
The reason Alec behaved the way he did in DC was

471
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,792
To either push the limit

472
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:34,144
To show that I can show up wherever I want do whatever the f*** I want

473
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,424
Or get kicked off

474
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,192
To further his person

475
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,520
Narrative

476
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,568
Preferred cuz the other ones no fun

477
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,128
Cuz then you push the envelope to an extent where

478
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,432
All of your cries of like censorship

479
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,200
I'm being

480
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
Forced out

481
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
They don't

482
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,808
Doesn't hold water that's true

483
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,624
So did he got exactly what he wanted out of this whole thing

484
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:03,072
I agree with you I agree with you I would normally not agree with you if we were talking about any rational human being

485
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,352
I would not agree with you because

486
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,168
Twitter's ability to spread his message

487
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,984
Absolutely Central to his ability

488
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,664
He's got to do that because he has

489
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,296
NFL on Twitter

490
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:29,696
Twitter accounts dummy account

491
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,512
Who actually give me they get lots of

492
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:36,352
Traffic is artificially on Twitter

493
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,120
False account

494
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:40,960
So I don't think that is reach will necessarily be all that diminish

495
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,496
By him and not being there

496
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,544
Hilda said martyr status to him

497
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,664
People still talk about stuff that Milo does on

498
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,760
To Twitter through other people using

499
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:58,112
Lester and the differences in also then put out

500
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,648
4 hours of radio.

501
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:04,000
So she has an operation in place

502
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:10,144
That will feed the content all these other accounts on Twitter will then push

503
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,216
Disagree with you on anyone

504
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,264
The timing of it is very suspicious

505
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
Considering

506
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
That

507
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
Kavanaugh is

508
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:29,344
Confirm

509
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,368
That's coming out about it

510
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,672
And stuff like that

511
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,256
To the point where we pretty much proved into things

512
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:40,096
That he has stolen documents

513
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:46,496
That he is going to overturn Roe v Wade

514
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
Opportunity

515
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,336
Types of braces

516
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,896
The only reason

517
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,432
That he was appointed

518
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:58,272
The only reason that he is the choice as we talked about

519
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
Earlier today

520
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:03,392
Is because he will do everything in his power to

521
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:08,512
To keep Trump from being indicted we believe that aurox presidential

522
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:15,168
What was the quote we should not bother the presidency with

523
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,192
Frivolous

524
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,472
All of that.

525
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:23,616
Frivolous of course

526
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,152
Why he was

527
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:25,920
Respect

528
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,992
And of course he knows that's why he was pick

529
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,016
So that's

530
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:30,784
Troubling

531
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,576
And that's the only reason that I have you

532
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,416
Conspiracy theory about this like I can't prove it and I'm not

533
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,744
Him becoming

534
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,048
Supreme Court Supreme Court Justice

535
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,096
What's the most important things to

536
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:47,424
Surviving

537
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:53,568
By extension Alex survive in a lot of stuff Rodger Stone surviving all of this stuff

538
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:57,152
So it makes the outlet

539
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,200
Completely buckled into Donald Trump

540
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:02,016
And having Mutual spiteful interest

541
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,296
Yeah

542
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:07,648
In order to get a ton of media attention

543
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,440
The hearings are going

544
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:13,792
So I don't know if that's the case but from a strategic Viewpoint I could see it kinda

545
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,560
Being

546
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,840
I mean

547
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,728
It does make sense

548
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,032
But it doesn't make sense because

549
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,848
Doesn't get

550
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,896
Trump is not going to help him

551
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,664
I think he does

552
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,480
You think so

553
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:38,624
Legal fees

554
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,928
Doesn't get hurt

555
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,536
I said Cookie doesn't give a f***

556
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,584
I think they still see that as

557
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,632
Last Hope for status quo

558
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:53,216
Bi-Rite field end the Mueller

559
00:35:55,776 --> 00:36:01,152
Rogers can

560
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,552
And stuff like that is going to go away to

561
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,160
Rodger

562
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:16,000
How dare you insinuate that this

563
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,072
Gentleman

564
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:23,680
Rodger believe in trouble

565
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:28,544
The truth is that if the investigation goes away the possibility of them going to prison

566
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:35,968
Spaghetti

567
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,528
For Rodger Owens up the door

568
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,576
To Infowars business model Everlast

569
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,952
So will the whole plan is 1 sessions is gone Trump is going to

570
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,256
Find somebody who's going to end the molar

571
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,792
Almost

572
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:56,192
There's no other way

573
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,240
You can't get in trouble for that exactly

574
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,264
Sweet

575
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,288
Anyways

576
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:06,688
Guys it was nice having a republic that was good stuff for awhile like Crisco

577
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:11,808
Doing that election studies

578
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,368
You have every reason to go trying

579
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,160
Really cheat

580
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,840
Refuse to recuse himself from his own recounted that weird that that guy

581
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,376
Would want

582
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:29,472
Indications of really undemocratic Behavior going on

583
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,848
Very responsible of us

584
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:39,712
This is what's happening but you got bored of real possible

585
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,248
Well unlike

586
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,064
Do not believe it is

587
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:49,952
I believe that the Nazis are on the cusp of America

588
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:55,328
And it's really probably going to happen like this

589
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:59,168
And we need money and we don't talk about it

590
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:06,080
Pieology

591
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,384
We're just we're just fatalist

592
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,784
We're going to lose we're going to lose

593
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,696
Southern Glazer's being depressed

594
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:26,816
And he Compares himself to the people who were protesting

595
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,352
The Kavanaugh hearing

596
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:32,192
Have a kernel of something

597
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,752
Conspiracy

598
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,288
But I can explain it

599
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:43,456
11

600
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:47,808
The First Amendment

601
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,496
Disruptive

602
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:15,968
George Soros group

603
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,784
Alright

604
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,320
In the parking lot

605
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,880
And then video and photos of the disruptors

606
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,904
Smoking Gun

607
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,744
Caught a leftist Soros Bloomberg

608
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,536
Huh

609
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:36,192
You didn't know about him 17 years ago we know that's what Ali says alive

610
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,288
I looked into this

611
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,920
Do you have pictures of

612
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,968
The people who were protest

613
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,272
From someone

614
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,088
Bite proof

615
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,392
The issue is the connections are super 10

616
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,232
People who had money

617
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,792
Because they knew

618
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:08,192
Network type

619
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,264
Able to help you take care of

620
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,592
The fees that you're incurring by your civil disobedience

621
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,384
It's not a thing where they were getting thousand

622
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:20,736
A protester types

623
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:24,832
Now the guy is connected to some guy who works

624
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,880
For an organization that

625
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,648
We got some fun

626
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:32,000
Sure

627
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:38,656
You can just you can just dance on that Ballroom floor all day long

628
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:41,984
But the colonel truth is there's someone was getting money but

629
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,776
I think that's the dura Gore

630
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,824
I think that's pretty normal in terms of like

631
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,848
Co-op

632
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,456
Take the ideas like people helping out with Eva's legal fees

633
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,504
Very very normal

634
00:40:54,016 --> 00:41:00,160
Yeah that's one of those big things that the Civil Rights Movement water

635
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:06,560
GoFundMe for his legal please he's trying to get paid for doing a wedding

636
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:16,032
Liquor store

637
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:22,432
Never never have ever had

638
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,248
What kind of crazy person would say that

639
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,320
So

640
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
Weber

641
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,904
Sleeper Patriots

642
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,672
For sure

643
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,304
Not asking question

644
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:50,336
Journalists don't do that

645
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,783
Alex looked

646
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,367
Just run

647
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,391
Well for Alex

648
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,671
Trophy

649
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,999
Well he was playing in the US Open

650
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:14,399
But I just don't they just don't buildings Arthur Ashe

651
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,495
Serena Williams

652
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,895
This Mexico if I'm going to say I give

653
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:29,503
I think it's bulshit but at the same time I think there's a kernel of Alex having a sign

654
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,295
So I'll give

655
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,087
Preemptive

656
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,671
Show up

657
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,999
In the front of the USA

658
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:44,863
Concerning

659
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,055
You called something new baby

660
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,639
Quotes quotes

661
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,527
Obviously

662
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:07,647
I love next

663
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,463
Everywhere the snakes

664
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,559
These motherfuking snakes

665
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:17,631
Awesome lighthouse

666
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,191
Set the point that I think is fair is that Alex

667
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,751
Like it's weird that I was there

668
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:26,079
I do think that's kind of fairs ever criticism

669
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,127
He would go

670
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:35,295
Domino's

671
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,831
Unbecoming of an adult

672
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:42,719
I do get like a they're talkin about stuff that I yell about all the time

673
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:49,887
I'm going to go just like him at the inauguration

674
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:56,287
Really pay attention to when this hearing was

675
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,895
Would Alex be there be like

676
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
Absolutely

677
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,015
WhatsApp

678
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,023
I thought maybe after Laura Loomer scream

679
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:17,791
Court

680
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,327
I think it was

681
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,887
It was really interesting

682
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,703
For me to listen to those hearings and have them be like

683
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:29,055
All the Republicans after you explained

684
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:32,895
Algorithms

685
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,711
And then somehow more like hey

686
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,015
You know how people are harassing women

687
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:44,415
What are you guys doing

688
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,695
Extra

689
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,487
Come on man you better

690
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:50,815
So a little bit of

691
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,095
A portion of the show

692
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,631
Where Alex

693
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:54,911
Is a b

694
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,983
Super weird

695
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:03,615
Groundwork for the narrative blossom

696
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,151
Wonderful

697
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,431
McDon

698
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,711
Okay

699
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:11,551
You never really never get

700
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,599
Exactly he wants to say

701
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,135
He's going to tease the throughout most

702
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,671
To the show

703
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,951
Need to sort of falls off in

704
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,487
The train goes off

705
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,095
The big takeaway

706
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:27,423
What's the big tackle

707
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,151
Level

708
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,967
Planning

709
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
Then being able

710
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:09,407
You don't know it's Dominic

711
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,575
Hammers about to fall my friend

712
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:21,695
Interesting Godzilla because

713
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:24,767
Godzilla Richmond retail

714
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:31,935
Result of overuse of nuclear weapons

715
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:34,239
Resulting destruction of

716
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:37,823
Japan that is altered and changed every part of

717
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,359
Japanese pop culture Everson

718
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:47,295
I'm further just settling the metaphor for the parts of America

719
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:57,279
Disaster that happens to the rest of the world when America is left

720
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:03,679
Nuclear fallout of

721
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:06,751
Create a monster that we have no control over

722
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:13,663
Rampantly destroys everything

723
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,271
We meet

724
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,319
Go back to a time like I'm not

725
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:23,135
I'm not saying shut down

726
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,511
We just

727
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
I have no time

728
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,351
Four arguments that we've already had in the past

729
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,399
And besides he has decided or distasteful

730
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,167
We have to

731
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,959
Get to the point where it's not

732
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,239
Like

733
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:42,079
We need to I hate to say this because I'm a guy

734
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:42,847
Who

735
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,383
Has a dirty f****** room

736
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:56,671
Until we do this like

737
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:59,231
Alex is Godzilla and he's right

738
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:04,095
Well and caused a huge

739
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,167
What

740
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:14,335
That's what I've been saying is that I think part of the

741
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,639
Investigation

742
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:19,455
Whenever the Koch brothers

743
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:25,855
Created the tea party going to be able to control this movement and then

744
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:32,255
Whatever they were able to get Greg ulation and everything and all of a sudden

745
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:38,655
It's gone wild and the Koch brothers still don't even understand that it is their fault that Trump is there

746
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:44,799
And now they're probably

747
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,567
Public

748
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,895
Alex

749
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:52,991
I'm living in a spy movie what happened

750
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,039
I f***** an assassin

751
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,319
Heed

752
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,903
He does sort of spell out what happened but he doesn't get into

753
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,671
Specifically

754
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:03,743
Threatening

755
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,815
Being Russian agent

756
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:10,399
But that's not that's not boring

757
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,703
That's a narrative

758
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:17,567
And we have a clip

759
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:22,175
I don't get it I got a Russian come on guys

760
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,759
It's a fuking idiot Alex comes back

761
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:28,319
From break and he does what I would describe as a

762
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,623
But not good

763
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:37,023
Pro wrestling promo

764
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,303
GameStop

765
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,423
It's a great song actually really interesting further wrinkled

766
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:49,823
His roots and forth back his hat when he was on on radio

767
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,615
What's called the final Edition

768
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:55,967
Because this might be the last time they allow me on it

769
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:04,671
For him like two or three times every episode

770
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:11,071
I'm not going to lie to you when I was in when I was in high school I was a drummer in the

771
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:16,447
To The Final Countdown I used to play that like a goddamn

772
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:20,799
Like to listen to the drums on that track you haven't listened to me

773
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,687
I don't even I don't even know if anybody else was

774
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,271
While

775
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:33,599
Because

776
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,623
Specific instance

777
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,671
This is the final

778
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:44,863
We went over the last time he was broadcast on kjfk

779
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,631
Kalb

780
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:51,263
Klbk

781
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,103
Jeff

782
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,687
Perfect

783
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,111
The last time ever broadcast

784
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:07,903
So

785
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:14,559
It is fun this is The Final Countdown Alex you're finally appropriate in playing this song

786
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:20,959
61 days

787
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:36,831
Robert Mueller dishonorable evil Wicked people with so many crimes somebody

788
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:43,231
Music

789
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:49,631
What is morals the North Star

790
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:53,215
All these lies and propaganda to try to turn you against

791
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:59,615
Has a push for the 25th Amendment to remove

792
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:09,343
And they're now him

793
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:17,023
That Red Wave is going to be woman's Blood on the streets who died trying to get illegal abortions

794
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:23,935
Will wind up getting women killed

795
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,727
Feather crazy

796
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:29,823
To just go down the line of conservative policies and think

797
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,407
Holy cow every single one of these will get more women kill

798
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,967
That would be ridiculous

799
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:42,367
Can't be based entirely upon

800
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,583
Envisioning

801
00:52:53,887 --> 00:53:00,031
Take me to get you charged Final Countdown

802
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:06,431
Where I switched this is when you use the Bell on the ride cymbal

803
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:12,319
And a little bit of a drumroll on your left hand

804
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,879
Great

805
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,903
Produced by Mannie Fresh

806
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,183
I love it

807
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,719
Mariah

808
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,535
Help me get a job

809
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,351
I heard he got a job at Staying Alive

810
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:29,215
Young Jeezy better than

811
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,591
You know

812
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:39,711
There's a there's a weird sort of wrestling metaphor

813
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,503
All of those

814
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,295
Kingsbury said

815
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,063
It might last

816
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,343
Minute-long

817
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,391
Where all the things

818
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,415
He's built

819
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,695
Throughout the last

820
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,231
You know year

821
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,255
6 months

822
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,815
Certainly ramping a lot of some of the

823
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:55,839
Particular things up

824
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:56,863
For the last couple months

825
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,399
Would you eat what he's doing

826
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:02,239
Building towards the mid-term which is essentially his paper

827
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:06,335
You know this or like this

828
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,943
Between between wrestlers

829
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,991
Dead people voting

830
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:18,111
But he's built yet and the payoff is going to be whenever

831
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,135
Claims that

832
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:27,583
Enough Republican politician

833
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,591
So

834
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,919
Steelers Criminal

835
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,967
Grimes

836
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:49,855
Got some crimes up there I don't want to not have that conversation but I'd like to have it on better terms

837
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,391
Alex

838
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,159
This about

839
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,535
That bad

840
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:01,631
New York

841
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,271
A good

842
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:23,391
No these are connected

843
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:25,695
To Russian authorities

844
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,999
On the request of both governments

845
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,559
It was uranium that was

846
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:34,911
Confiscated from people who got caught with it

847
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,983
Would you call it a mutual investigation

848
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:40,287
On the Russian intelligence

849
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,055
United States

850
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,079
Intelligence

851
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:48,479
Agreement

852
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,271
In a very serious

853
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:03,839
International investigation

854
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:06,911
Uranium one thing we talked about at nauseam

855
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:13,567
Mikey went there with you on the tarmac for Clinton

856
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,591
25

857
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,127
Uranium to the Russians

858
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,687
This isn't those are you got to separate

859
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,223
Call The Offspring

860
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:24,831
Kim separate sorry

861
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:28,159
You have to do better even if your propaganda

862
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,951
Good enough

863
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:36,607
In literally every uranium narratives that he's got and say that it was all done

864
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,143
Like if you Jello cake

865
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:44,543
Yeah if you just if you just start saying that he was Merv uranium one time so now everything that I've

866
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:50,943
Whatever said about being near uranium is involving him you're undercutting your own conspiracy theory in a way that

867
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,991
Other conspiracy theorists Ruby like

868
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,271
Dude

869
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:56,063
You're making us look bad

870
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:56,831
It's clunky

871
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,367
Real real funky

872
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:03,231
I don't know I just think that

873
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,767
Uranium 911

874
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,559
That's who did it

875
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:09,375
And who also worked in the government

876
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,055
You know what I learned the other day

877
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,615
I learned that Jim Comey

878
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,639
Was the prophet

879
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,943
Secutor in the case against Martha Stewart

880
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:25,503
I don't know if that's true

881
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:33,183
Possibly he's never worked as a lawyer

882
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:37,791
For New York

883
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:50,591
It wasn't I mean if it's

884
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,359
Not true

885
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:55,711
I read it so I found bobcat

886
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:59,807
I found Bob Chapman

887
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:06,207
Newsletter

888
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:09,279
Everybody who's not I'll tell you that it is true

889
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:16,447
It is true it is true James Comey prosecuted Martha Stewart

890
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:22,847
Prosecutor is the lead prosecutor in welding

891
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:29,247
Leave her alone

892
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,831
He also

893
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:35,903
We predict that she's going to get off

894
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:39,487
And then like couple months later obstruction of justice

895
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:44,607
I know that Jim Comey was very wild

896
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:51,263
A whenever our history books are burned and then in 100 years whenever the fish

897
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,543
People rewrite our history

898
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:57,151
It's going to be a nice little factoids the guy who

899
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:59,455
Legitimately

900
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:04,831
Obstructed Justice with brave

901
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:11,231
Here's the main story and then there's that tiny little boxes like

902
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:14,303
That's fun

903
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:19,167
Also fun in that

904
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,919
It's very weird.

905
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:30,943
Very current

906
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,711
Players in

907
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,735
Context

908
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,783
How is How is

909
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:44,511
Is the white race

910
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:50,655
I tilted my cards a little bit too early cuz I forgot

911
00:59:56,031 --> 01:00:00,127
That I know of always finding new

912
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,407
A Russian agent

913
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,015
Yep

914
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:16,511
Out of context which that on understanding.

915
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,839
What are they going to do

916
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,399
Pick you up Twitter

917
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:37,503
Couldn't

918
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:41,087
The folks

919
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:42,623
Oh yeah

920
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:56,959
Twitter

921
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:59,263
You better believe you got one

922
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:09,503
Somehow I know I know it's not

923
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:15,135
Free calling and Pollux

924
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,183
Pollock

925
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,463
Some good invention

926
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,767
Those polish tree

927
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,655
I'm looking I'm looking this up here

928
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
Pollux

929
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,471
You don't know what a pole

930
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:34,079
It's a it's a very long as it's

931
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,103
Oh

932
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:37,919
It just means

933
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,967
Yep that is at

934
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:48,671
I kind of thought that it might be some sort of like archaic language for like I was flummoxed

935
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:55,071
Flummoxed is to Experian

936
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,679
Flomax

937
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:02,239
Absolutely

938
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:08,895
I thought Parallax came into my mind

939
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,455
Not connected

940
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:17,855
Could be some sort of old-time word that no one uses anymore

941
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:24,255
No one else

942
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:45,247
Bull crap you

943
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,087
Not true

944
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:49,855
Disagree

945
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:52,159
Anyway

946
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,719
I would say that

947
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:57,023
This idea

948
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:59,583
Let loose

949
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,399
I don't think that's a big story

950
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:04,703
He's going to let loose with an Eldritch Polack

951
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:10,591
I don't think it doesn't like I don't first of all I don't believe

952
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,359
Is telling a bit

953
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,663
Inversion of like

954
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:18,015
I'm going to reveal something about someone accusing me of being

955
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,599
Because he's already read about that all the time

956
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,415
About that

957
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:29,535
Forever people accuse me of being a Russian agent all the time

958
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:30,815
Narrative so

959
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:37,471
Could you could you reveal about somebody

960
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:43,871
The interview where he got tricked into talking to Russian intelligence I mean about a person

961
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:54,879
I'm serious like black

962
01:03:55,903 --> 01:04:00,511
Remind

963
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:07,935
Yeah

964
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:11,007
He's so narcissistic

965
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:16,895
You make any kind of bread again

966
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:23,295
Married to my wife pregnant

967
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:29,695
Don't know we have an understanding

968
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:32,767
Aldi

969
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,815
IWatch

970
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,167
That's what I do

971
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,495
He is

972
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:43,519
So

973
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,343
Small drink right about when you

974
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:06,303
Capabilities

975
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:18,079
I already already mentioned it's my position

976
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:21,151
I watched the entire video of his

977
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:24,735
Which is what it must be classified

978
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,807
It was very hard to watch

979
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,599
Just further

980
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:34,463
I'm in second because he had nowhere to go with it so we just kept

981
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,487
Consulting is a.

982
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,511
Kept being

983
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,047
Like a little baby

984
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,839
Call Cupcake

985
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,375
No he's not a woman

986
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,399
So

987
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,959
It was tough and I do believe that's one of the reasons

988
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:45,983
In trouble now

989
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:46,751
Now

990
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,031
I don't think

991
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:52,127
Text wife is going to make things better cuz this is the next day

992
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,919
Home of Austin

993
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:10,303
Dishonest eyes the biggest betrayal at weakness

994
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,359
Is it

995
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,663
To deception

996
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:28,991
I never said take you off no one ever took you

997
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:34,623
Just at that enjoyment

998
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:43,071
You might be insane

999
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,607
Have you considered that

1000
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,407
You responded

1001
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,175
Almost

1002
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,223
Entirely accurate

1003
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:03,807
And the reason that you should have that response is

1004
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:07,647
When he talks about his interaction with Marco Rubio

1005
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,183
To talk about is how like

1006
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:15,583
He said he didn't know who I am pretend I don't exist

1007
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,375
Manifesting

1008
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:19,167
World

1009
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:19,935
Where is like

1010
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:20,959
I think

1011
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:23,519
Marco Rubio probably doesn't know who Alex Jones

1012
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,055
Might not have recognized

1013
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:28,895
Deserved it

1014
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:32,223
That's absolutely a deserve it respond

1015
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:33,759
Al Jones interpreted as

1016
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,807
Personal himself

1017
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,343
Like I don't exist

1018
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,367
Like I don't exist

1019
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:43,743
You you think that you can just make me not exist by not knowing who I am well if no Alex

1020
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,023
You're misinterpreting

1021
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:49,119
I believe him

1022
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:55,519
Because I believe

1023
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:00,383
That he believes that those guys said those things

1024
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:06,015
Yeah I believe they can hear he heard those things in what they said

1025
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,551
Even though they didn't say it like

1026
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:13,183
No I don't think it's that

1027
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,719
He has no ability to

1028
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:17,535
Subjective and

1029
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,303
Subjective

1030
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:22,143
Do you know Alexis

1031
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,679
I had to wrestle with

1032
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,447
Does a whole bunch

1033
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,031
Didn't like me

1034
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:33,663
Because they didn't treat me the way I would like people to

1035
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,527
This world for me to recognize like

1036
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:43,647
Bearded exactly how they should

1037
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,695
Right

1038
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:48,255
Booked

1039
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,023
Hang out with them

1040
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,071
It makes total sense

1041
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,375
Experience

1042
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,679
And pretending it's an objective

1043
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:59,007
Has this running with Marco Rubio

1044
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,543
His objective

1045
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,567
Experience of it is

1046
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,335
He's trying to

1047
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,687
And the reality

1048
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:07,711
Experience

1049
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,735
Marcos

1050
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,015
Just trying to do is interview

1051
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:13,599
Alex is trying to make it about himself

1052
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:15,391
And Marco Rubio

1053
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:17,951
Treat it like

1054
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:18,975
A heckler

1055
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:21,279
And he's not good at dealing with hecklers

1056
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:23,071
So he left Alex Jones kind of

1057
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:24,863
Yeah

1058
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:26,911
Steve hofstetter

1059
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:33,311
Looks like my dad

1060
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,919
Oh my God

1061
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,199
Comedian 42nd

1062
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,247
Management great

1063
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,623
I mean the first

1064
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,671
I'm a very strong

1065
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,951
Support

1066
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,231
Like

1067
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,535
You need is Alex Jones comes in Fox

1068
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,839
Let's say we ever have a live show or anything

1069
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,631
Sing like that

1070
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,167
Because that's the worst

1071
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,191
Impossible

1072
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:03,519
Handle the idea people actually accept

1073
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,823
Yeah especially people who he wants to

1074
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,871
So you accept him

1075
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,919
You just like

1076
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,015
That's your first ride

1077
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:19,903
I got to do something

1078
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:20,671
View

1079
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,231
Maybe don't know about any of that

1080
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,023
Tell me more about that

1081
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,327
Get him to talk more about

1082
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,351
The headlines

1083
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,399
Eventually

1084
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:33,983
Lotaburger

1085
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,775
Thirdly that doesn't work

1086
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,055
Go to the

1087
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,079
Ways to

1088
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:41,663
They're very

1089
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,967
There's a ton of things that we found

1090
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:44,991
Over the course of doing

1091
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:45,759
Podcast

1092
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:48,319
I wish everyone knew about

1093
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,599
Things like

1094
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:54,719
Did your mom throw you off

1095
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:56,767
Can you talk more about that

1096
01:10:57,023 --> 01:11:03,167
That would be that would be more fun version of Thoroughly research everyone who heckled

1097
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,615
If you would have no idea how to deal with that

1098
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,383
You Alex

1099
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:14,431
Do you feel

1100
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,455
Comfortable with your life

1101
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:18,527
Right

1102
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:24,159
I don't know why I don't know where we jumped off on

1103
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,463
This road but

1104
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:31,071
I guess

1105
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:41,567
I've never been a fan of the comedian destroys Heckler videos like by my dream has always been to

1106
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:45,919
Comedian comes to terms with Heckler and they both leave his friends

1107
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,711
That was always my strategy

1108
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:51,295
Like to the point where I even like

1109
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,831
No one should

1110
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:53,855
Like

1111
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,647
I don't know how to tell the story without you

1112
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,023
Call the store

1113
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,559
Okay I'll try

1114
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:05,631
Okay

Featuring Anza

1116
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:18,431
I was great

1117
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:24,831

Kind of

1121
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:33,791
Right

1122
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:36,095
So I brought on stage

1123
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,191

Prozac

1127
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,543

01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:13,567
Basically understand

1248
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:21,504
The real reason I'm provoked

1249
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:25,344
It's because there was a plan operation prepared

1250
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,136
Reduce world population

1251
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,928

01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:04,256
All of it all of it

1263

That's where we eat that's where I'm at

1264

A world to work

1269
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,928
You're insane

1270
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,720
Every

1271
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,072

01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:47,520
Also they need

1276
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:48,800
Food

1277
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,200
You know that you're the real issues

1278
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:59,552
The globalist

1279
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,856
Is so worse

1280
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,392
For the globalist

1281
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:05,184
Then the current state

1282
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:10,304
Pretty much

1283
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:16,704
For the globalist in that scenario right

1284
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,800
Is there to fill the hole

1285
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:23,616
Google garbage

Whatever unreal about of money he has

1289
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:36,672
Why would you want the world to be different

1290
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:38,720
That's insane

1291
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:40,768
What can you do

1292
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:43,840
Climate change is going to do to humanity

1293
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:51,776
He's literally just his version of what the globalist want to do is actually what the global

1294
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,360
That is going to happen because

1295
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:58,432
20 signor in the reality of climate

1296
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:02,272
Where

1297
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:10,976
If it actually address

1298
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:17,632
Better.

1299
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:24,800
Look and if it got even if it came to it

1300
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,080
If Trump

1301
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:30,176
Completely took over the United States and turn it into a fascist

1302
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:39,392
Boiled eggs at least 100 years from now

1303
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:45,792
We will be able to solve any remembered as a weird ass f****** monster

1304
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,560
Hero

1305
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,096
Baby crazy

1306
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:54,496
He's only he's only going to 60

1307
01:23:54,752 --> 01:24:00,896
Destroys all of the world population out of their goddamn home

1308
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:03,712
Creating an even larger Refugee crisis

1309
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:10,112
Which will then of course we do more f****** Nazi fascists

1310
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:17,280
I kind of look at it the opposite way glass-half-full kind of

1311
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,376
Do you know do you know me

1312
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,144
Wait

1313
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,936
I'm good I'm good

1314
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:29,312
Both both

1315
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:36,736
Positive like probably inevitable

1316
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,552
But I honestly

1317
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:46,976
People are going to die definitely that's not good

1318
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,536
But we're not going to go

1319
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:56,960
Around the world and national stick

1320
01:24:57,216 --> 01:25:01,312
Real awful

1321
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:02,080
Fine

1322
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:03,616
But a lot of that stuff I think

1323
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:05,920
Will be nipped in the bud visy Global emerging

1324
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,456
From

1325
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:08,736
What climate

1326
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:11,040
There's a decent possibility

1327
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:13,856
They used to get as like that will exacerbate

1328
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:14,880
VI

1329
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:16,416
The Troubles of

1330
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:17,696
The

1331
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,768
I think there's a decent chance of humanity

1332
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:22,304
Just take a stand up and say like

1333
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:23,840
Enough is enough

1334
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:26,144
People are struggling

1335
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,168
Get the business

1336
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:33,568
And I'm wrong manufactured Alien Invasion is going to

1337
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:35,360
To bring Humanity together of climate

1338
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:36,384
Acceptance

1339
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:43,296
No I know I know I'm just saying we talked about

1340
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:47,136
How people ultimately help each other

1341
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:53,536
Crisis makes a lot of sense

1342
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:54,816
Seeing large population

1343
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:58,144
We all go f******

1344
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:58,912
A******

1345
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:03,008
Of course

1346
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:10,176
Yeah but they didn't just perform a coup and control all three facets of American government

1347
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:10,944
Right

1348
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,712
Right

1349
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:16,832
How was we not f****** just started

1350
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:19,648
Leech

1351
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,672
Is that

1352
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:26,560
I don't know what you're trying to express

1353
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:28,864
What are the ways to solve the disease

1354
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,032
Maybe get a little better.

1355
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,592
You're dangerously close

1356
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:41,664
To territory we can't abide by

1357
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:43,712
Political

1358
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,368
Climate change is probably wrong

1359
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:58,048
You know what it is maybe anytime

1360
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:01,888
I am not everybody

1361
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,216
Guides on my

1362
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:08,288
I know but I just feel like empathy is what

1363
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,312
Makes us lose

1364
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:10,592
Yep

1365
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,480
This is a clip that I considered sending to Alex

1366
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:20,832
Because in the middle of the show Iran this Thursday

1367
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:22,368
Gaunt

1368
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:29,280
We should send it to Martha Stewart f*****-up about how we interact with

1369
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:30,816
Oh no that's not

1370
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:32,864
I don't

1371
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:33,632
You know

1372
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,400
It's not my business

1373
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,448
I'm not going to send it to her

1374
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:42,848
Who wants to let her know you know you know how

1375
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,152
Wonderful beautiful listeners would never

1376
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:47,200
She deserves to know this

1377
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,736
I got but you probably already

1378
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,320
Disappointment schools morning

1379
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:06,144
Okay.

1380
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:11,264
You going to pick me up at 3:30

1381
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:15,104
You know

1382
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:20,224
Even more because we're facing

1383
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:23,296
Unadulterated.

1384
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:27,392
Terrorizing

1385
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,280
School in like

1386
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:35,072
Insinuating that he's going to

1387
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,352
Todai

1388
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:43,776
Listen I hope you have a good day at school I know your math teacher has been riding you pretty hard lately

1389
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:50,432
But that's really immaterial compared to the fact that you're about to lose your father

1390
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:53,760
Is going

1391
01:28:54,016 --> 01:29:00,160
Murder

1392
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:01,440
Murder my dad

1393
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:03,744
She probably get you a path

1394
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,280
It's not the plot of a book

1395
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,304
That's

1396
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,584
Really really

1397
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,752
As you saying it on air

1398
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:17,312
As if it's somehow gives him a boost of

1399
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,128
Real

1400
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:26,528
Don't I tell my kids that I'm going to die everyday at least heavily appliances

1401
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:31,392
Kids turned out alright

1402
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:32,160
Don't think

1403
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:39,072
So earlier Alex called trump super glad that he's hanging out with him

1404
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:40,352

1415
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:21,312

1421
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:01,504
Rodger Stone

01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:14,560
Okay Trump

1423
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,728
A person

01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,032
I mean this isn't new

1425
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:26,080
Before

1426
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:28,640
It's so stupid

1427
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:30,944
We're going to do Kim

1428
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,736
Also

1429
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,016
How do you nuke

1430
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,112
Involved not just him

1431
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:43,488
What is are there any Target

1432
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:45,024
That only have

1433
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,816
The capability to kill

1434
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:49,120
Are you sure

1435
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:55,520
Okay nuclear material

1436
01:31:55,776 --> 01:32:01,152

So I mean that's not new Palladium

1438
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:05,760
Yeah anyway speaking of the devil

1439
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:10,368
Ricky devil Rodger Stone

1440
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:13,184
You can't be here

1441
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:16,512
They're talking about that it was published

1442
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:19,840
I'm inside the campaign

1443
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:23,936
No time for that

1444
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:25,216
Kind of

1445
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,776
I understand why the New York Times

1446
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:30,080
Publish it but not interested

1447
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:32,896
Got to love New York Times

1448
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:39,296
Do anything are you providing any sucking value know you're just providing a f****** b****

1449
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:46,720
I don't even care 100% true that's a self-serving

1450
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:53,120
Piece of s*** trying to assuage of conference is conscious in a way that you should not allow it

1451
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:55,168
I should have received that in been like

1452
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:59,264
F*** you come on this or go home and cry like a little bit

1453
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:05,152
Oh you're trying to save the country well at the same time you're letting everyone f****** died

1454
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:08,224
No time for it anyways

1455
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:16,672
I just want Rodger Stone shows up

1456
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,744
If this

1457
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,560
New York Times editorial

1458
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:25,632
I did it was written by

1459
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:32,032
Read Chinese

1460
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:36,128
Longest serving member of The George W bush cabinet

1461
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:39,456
Why you would appoint such a person is an odd question or

1462
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:49,952
Russia

1463
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,232
No I think

1464
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:03,264
Is Donald Trump

1465
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:05,056
I say God I wish

1466
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:08,640
God I wish

1467
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:10,688
My my bigger issue is like

1468
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:12,480
You don't know shitt Rodger YouTube

1469
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,248
Talkingshit

1470
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:14,784
This is just nonsense

1471
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:25,280
So it's not be cool

1472
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:28,352
Cast a little bit of Suspicion

1473
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:29,888
Alex's

1474
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:31,168
His narrative

1475
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:35,264
But his version of it

1476
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,104
A professional writer for the New York Times

1477
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,896
Okay using a

1478
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:41,664
Composite

1479
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:42,944
Leekers

1480
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:43,968
I don't like

1481
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:45,504
McMasters

1482
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,040
I like all the old Lakers

1483
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:52,416
I would actually buy that more than

1484
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:55,488
If I wanted to do that

1485
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:59,584
Fiction writer

1486
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:00,864
Essentially the same

1487
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:03,936
Between fiction reality

1488
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:07,776
The New York Times

1489
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:09,056
Knows who that person

1490
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:16,480
Well then what the f*** are they doing you don't betray our entire f****** country by doing

1491
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,808
Holding up journalist

1492
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:24,160
Has a journalistic

1493
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:24,928
You protect

1494
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:29,792
Published

1495
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,072
If you don't know who the person

1496
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:39,520
You do know who the person is and they refused to put their name on it I'm not going

1497
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,360
They can't tell you who it is

1498
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:45,408
I stand by that

1499
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:51,808
This is Livin a journalism

1500
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,600
Journalism doesn't work

1501
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:54,368
Now

1502
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:58,464
No

1503
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:01,024
That the New York Times knows who

1504
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:02,304
Yeah

1505
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:03,840
It's Anonymous to the

1506
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:05,632
Public it's not anonymous

1507
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:08,192
So now

1508
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,008
The only reason I got up

1509
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,056
Is because Rodger Stone

1510
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:16,384
Likes to play with the idea of anonymity

1511
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,176
And he does so in this

1512
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:20,224
So now we have the

1513
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:27,392
New York Times anonymous

1514
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:30,208
But it's official

1515
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,024
Hillary

1516
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,328
Tell the women down Wild Bill Draper

1517
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:41,728
Cool man

1518
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:48,128
That's actually pretty funny that's a salad move on his

1519
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,920
Credit for that

1520
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:56,320
Anonymous

1521
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:58,112
Ever said is true is true

1522
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:02,720
Anonymously

1523
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:09,120
Whatever works

1524
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:12,192
Now he's abusing

1525
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,216
Feel that way

1526
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:15,264
He's abusing that mentality

1527
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,800
Did Morrill Surak

1528
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:22,176
Conversation

1529
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,736
That's the reason why it's important

1530
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:25,760
For journalism Outlets

1531
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:27,040
Who hold themselves

1532
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:28,064
Post-Standard

1533
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:30,112
To follow

1534
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,648
Because people don't

1535
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,184
Like Rodger Stone

1536
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,720
He's just he's just talking

1537
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:37,280
He doesn't have some sort of

1538
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:41,632
Alex

1539
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,424
Right

1540
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:46,240
Who comes on

1541
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:48,544
Right

1542
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:52,640
I really don't I don't know if I

1543
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:55,456
Concur with your evaluation

1544
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,224
Bye

1545
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:56,992
Stan

1546
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:59,552
Anton that was

1547
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:02,880
F*** whoever wrote that Anonymous op-ed

1548
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:04,672
And then

1549
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:05,952
Published

1550
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:08,768
I don't understand what it is you think that I would say

1551
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:16,192
It's in the equal and opposite reaction being that me saying that we should do what

1552
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:16,960
Doing there

1553
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:19,008
Timeout

1554
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,800
You just said

1555
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:25,152
And then you elaborated

1556
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:28,480
F*** the person who wrote and published

1557
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:32,064
I agree with the first part I don't agree with the second

1558
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,112
And that's what I

1559
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,648
Text to IKEA

1560
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:37,440
3 Maiden

1561
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:42,560
The other option is don't

1562
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:45,376
Event don't print

1563
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:47,168
Also beef

1564
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,728
But they've chosen

1565
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:51,776
No

1566
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:52,800
Because it got them

1567
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:54,848
And it got a ton of

1568
01:38:57,664 --> 01:39:02,016
What position wasn't made clear

1569
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:07,392
The double-crosser

1570
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:12,768
Is writing an anonymous op-ed

1571
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:18,912
The

1572
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:19,680
By Ed

1573
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:23,520
It is not like

1574
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:29,664
We should make up bullshiter or anything like that it is that if you are working with a known

1575
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,456
Bad face operator

1576
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:37,600
Then and he says

1577
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,392
As long as you print it anonymous

1578
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:43,488
Double-crosser double-cross the s*** out of him

1579
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:48,608
He's writing it bad faith since you acting bad faith

1580
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:49,376
You don't know that

1581
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,912
I don't care

1582
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:51,680
Fine

1583
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:54,752
You'll never be a journalist

1584
01:39:55,008 --> 01:40:01,152
I'm just doing this

1585
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:06,784
I'm just a piece of s***

1586
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:12,416
I get the emotional part of it and I agree with that but

1587
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:14,976
But yes absolutely

1588
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:17,792
F*** the person who wrote it

1589
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:23,168
Double-crossed them

1590
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:24,192
Absolutely

1591
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:24,960
No

1592
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:26,240
Oh absolutely

1593
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:30,080
Reparable damage

1594
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,104
Do yourself

1595
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:31,872
As

1596
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,688
Could you now on

1597
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:40,320
And that source is in the Trump Administration who gives a f***

1598
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:45,696
I would say is that

1599
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,584
You're going to draw the line of like

1600
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,632
Deserves

1601
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:55,168
To disrespect

1602
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:59,520
Where are you going to draw that line

1603
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:02,336
Right

1604
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:06,176
No I completely accept

1605
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:08,736
The whole

1606
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:13,600
However

1607
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:17,184
Right in the White House

1608
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:21,024
You revealed that you have no compunction

1609
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,840
This m***********

1610
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:27,680
So then now Pence's gone

1611
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:31,776
What are you going to give the f*** right now your argument

1612
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:33,824
Your argument then is now

1613
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:37,152
Sources within the White House can no longer trust the New York

1614
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:44,064
No argument is that sources in the future from other places

1615
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,344
Could be concerned

1616
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:49,952
With whether or not the New York Times going to burn them based upon a moral decision that

1617
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:50,720
They make

1618
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:51,744
And that

1619
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:54,560
Bulshit cuz it's the New York Times

1620
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:56,096
What are they going to do

1621
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:57,632
What do you say

1622
01:41:57,888 --> 01:42:00,704
I'm saying that water what are you what are you talkin about

1623
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,984
The New York Times

1624
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,592
Of this level

1625
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:10,432
And then people in the future going to not talk to the New York Times

1626
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,456
Maybe not

1627
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:13,760
What

1628
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:20,160
What hundred year history of not doing exactly what it is we're talking about

1629
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:25,792
Music matters so much more

1630
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:29,632
Means it is real real face means that it is not a cup

1631
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:36,032
Frisch's acted is not aged an activity

1632
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:41,920
Hypocritical of you

1633
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:43,200
Drawing this line

1634
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:44,992
For someone who loves whistleblowers

1635
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,528
Like this is

1636
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:47,296
Freezing

1637
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:51,648
Institutions should be able to

1638
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:53,696
Go back on agreement

1639
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:55,232
Protect their anonymity

1640
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:57,536
Baseline

1641
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:59,328
Of Journalism

1642
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:00,864
Against the Baseline

1643
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:01,888
Of Honor

1644
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:03,168
If you're not

1645
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:07,776
If you're not willing if you're not willing to accept that there's a difference

1646
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:10,336
Between an Edward Snowden and a reality winner

1647
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:12,384
Compared to a

1648
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,664
Hypothetical

1649
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,688
Mike Pence

1650
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:17,504
As a whistleblower

1651
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,272
It's Mike Pence

1652
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:24,672
The reason is the writer uses a word that

1653
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:26,208
Didn't speeches whatever

1654
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:34,144
If you don't accept that there's a difference in a whistleblower who needs to be

1655
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:39,520
And a whistleblower who is pretending that they're doing the right thing

1656
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:40,288
The same time

1657
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:41,312
Facilitating

1658
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:44,128
The very thing that they're pretending to be against

1659
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:46,944
I don't see how that makes

1660
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:48,992
I don't see how that's hypocritical

1661
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:50,272
Because I don't think

1662
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:52,576
Journalism

1663
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:54,112
The principles of

1664
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:55,136
Protection

1665
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:58,208
Have to do with whether you think the person's an a****** or not

1666
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:01,536
An apple

1667
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:04,096
You have no idea who this person is

1668
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:07,168
All your complaints are that they are in a

1669
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:13,824
That's all it boils down what are you talkin about

1670
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:14,592
Blame for this

1671
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:20,992
Exactly. a****** that's all you're saying no I'm saying that they're what they're the ones who are saying weird

1672
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:24,576
Taking the bills that were keeping him from

1673
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:27,648
The trade agreement with South Korea

1674
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:34,048
We're not from his immigration policy avoiding war with Iran

1675
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:36,352
We're not stopping him from

1676
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:42,752
We are the ones who are doing all of this s*** but we're not stopping

1677
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:45,056
Actual harm that he's really doing

1678
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:51,456
Apocalyptic

1679
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:53,248
Maybe he should be made

1680
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:56,832
But I am saying that outing that person doesn't help at all

1681
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:01,184
What do you mean

1682
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:04,512
You take one of those

1683
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:13,472
That's that's a ferret counter-argument however

1684
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:16,288
Imagine impact

1685
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,848
Imagine the difference in Impact between

1686
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,128
Anonymous

1687
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:23,200
Op-ed written by a nebulous

1688
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:23,968
Trump

1689
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:24,992
Administration

1690
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:27,040
Versus an actual

1691
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:27,808
Op-ed

1692
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:28,576
Naming

1693
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:30,624
A person in the administration

1694
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:31,904
Who is admitting

1695
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,184
B a r a

1696
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,744
Sibley sabotaging the Democratic process

1697
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,304
Alright now let's

1698
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:41,632
Field day that the already violently

1699
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:44,192
Threatening to murder journalist

1700
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:46,240
Alright Alex Jones

1701
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:48,288
Pacific Mike cernovich world

1702
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:51,616
Of propaganda imagine the field days they would have

1703
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:55,200
When the New York Times doesn't honor their agreement to keep

1704
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,552
How different is it from what they're doing now

1705
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,344
It would be

1706
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,368
They would be right

1707
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:03,904
Oh so they kill a guy

1708
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:10,816
How are they know how is your foot doing

1709
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:13,632
Letty's outside of their Epic

1710
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:20,032
But their argument argument is always that the media is doing something outside of their

1711
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:29,248
You can't let them know what is that what is the difference between them saying that they're doing something

1712
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:31,552
And then actually doing something

1713
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:37,952
Alright that's a fair argument

1714
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:43,328
I'm not I'm not just guide

1715
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:47,936
Hey let's let everything burn while we stand by we did everything right

1716
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:52,032
I'm not yet

1717
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:56,896
Let's uphold all of our norms and yeah yeah

1718
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:58,176
I'm not on that

1719
01:46:58,944 --> 01:47:00,736
But I do think that there are

1720
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:02,528
Like pieces of

1721
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:03,296
Just

1722
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:04,320
Integrity

1723
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:06,624
And the way things are John correct

1724
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:08,672
That cannot be

1725
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:09,952
Impune

1726
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:12,768
All you do

1727
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:14,304
Is allow people

1728
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,840
Who has bad faith

1729
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:16,864
Hey bad will

1730
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:17,888
To win

1731
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:20,192
In that circumstance

1732
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:25,056
Is that date was anonymous

1733
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:26,848
All you would do

1734
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:29,664
Is verify every single narrative

1735
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:31,968
The New York Times

1736
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:34,784
Tricom globalist

1737
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,344
Weapons Systems against the American people

1738
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,392
The enemy of the people

1739
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:40,928
Look at them not allowed

1740
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:42,720
They went back on their deal this

1741
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:44,000
Is dishonorable

1742
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:45,792
Right now so much of that stuff

1743
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:47,072
So that's a negative

1744
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:50,912
You don't

1745
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,448
To continue to do the work

1746
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,472
The Way You Lie

1747
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:57,056
So

1748
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:00,128
I really do really all you said

1749
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,408
You game

1750
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,712
Is one of them is dead

1751
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:07,040
Changes the game

1752
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:09,344
I really do

1753
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,880
I really do

1754
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:12,160
How because

1755
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,696
Once you show

1756
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:16,512
Look if you have somebody

1757
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:18,048
If you name this song

1758
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:20,864
We don't give a f*** about the agreements that we've

1759
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,144
Offered

1760
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:23,680
Anytime

1761
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:25,216
Future

1762
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:29,824
Yeah

1763
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:33,152
I get that that's not

1764
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:36,480
No I mean the benefit of people not being able to escape

1765
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:38,528
But that doesn't

1766
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:42,112
I feel like you changed

1767
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:43,904
The conversation on Main

1768
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:44,928
I don't like

1769
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:47,744
I'm following the thread

1770
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:48,512
You're making it

1771
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:49,536
Defend my

1772
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:50,816
Maybe

1773
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,352
Position

1774
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:54,400
But

1775
01:48:56,448 --> 01:49:02,592
Let me let me try and start back from where we from from where I

1776
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:05,664
Felt like you skipped off I will okay

1777
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:06,944
You just a really quick

1778
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:07,712
Vicky

1779
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:09,504
Getaway

1780
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:10,528
He's not

1781
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:13,600
Ago you would have

1782
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:19,744
I'm sorry I reacted to quick that's not the point

1783
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,024
That I was looking

1784
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:24,096
Warehouse

1785
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:25,632
Your contention

1786
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:28,704
We can't let the alt-right be right

1787
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:29,728
About

1788
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:30,496
Journalist

1789
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:31,776
Journalistic integrity

1790
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:33,568
Right small point

1791
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:35,872
We don't exist in the world for that matter

1792
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:38,944
Because to the people who are alt-right

1793
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:40,224
They are

1794
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:42,528
Regardless

1795
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:45,600
The people who are right are alt-right

1796
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:49,184
Already believe that they're right

1797
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:53,280
It doesn't matter if they actually are or not

1798
01:49:53,536 --> 01:49:56,096
Because you have now allowed the

1799
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:57,376
People like Mike cernovich

1800
01:49:58,912 --> 01:49:59,424
Text realize the word

1801
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:01,472
You've allowed them to Define

1802
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:04,544
Because you're there right

1803
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:11,968
May I feel like you're cutting me off and on

1804
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:13,248
Maybe truth

1805
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:14,528
People who follows

1806
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:16,832
I'm not talk about perception

1807
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:18,624
Where the people are f****** killing us

1808
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,416
I'm talking about the reality

1809
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:22,720
The Catwoman their reality

1810
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,328
Perception of stuff will always be

1811
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:29,376
Asians are evil and they do evil stuff

1812
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:32,960
Is not true but it is true

1813
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:33,728
Follows

1814
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:37,568
When you behave the way they accuse

1815
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:39,360
Behaving

1816
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:43,200
You validate

1817
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:44,224
Other argument

1818
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:48,064
I don't track

1819
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:54,976
Best Bets when they go low we go high

1820
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:56,256
It's not

1821
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:57,792
Not bad at all

1822
01:50:58,048 --> 01:50:58,560
How so

1823
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:00,352
How does that not

1824
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,376
Track

1825
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:04,448
I don't know I don't know if we're even talking about our showing

1826
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:07,008
I feel like we're getting into a little bit of a person

1827
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:08,288
We're not

1828
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:11,616
Go back to your main point

1829
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:13,920
When

1830
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:15,200
The New York Times

1831
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:18,016
Takes a real stand

1832
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:19,040
Like this

1833
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:20,576
Where they say

1834
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:23,648
This is a guy who is saying

1835
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:27,744
Exactly what we all kind of knew was going on

1836
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,536
And he wanted to say it enough

1837
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:32,096
I apologize

1838
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:33,120
I apologize

1839
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:35,936
What stop one second

1840
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:37,472
How many species are in the

1841
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:39,776
F*** yeah exactly

1842
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,616
Makes it even more likely that it is a she

1843
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:47,968
Will kill her

1844
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:50,016
Politically

1845
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:53,600
If they were to finally take an actual

1846
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:59,232
That is a more than it is a

1847
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:02,048
Moment of their entire track record

1848
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:03,584
It is a

1849
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:04,864
Point of staying

1850
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:06,912
Enough is enough

1851
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:09,728
We're going to finally do this

1852
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:12,544
That does not mean that they're going to burn

1853
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:13,824
Every Source going

1854
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:15,104
Resource

1855
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:16,384
Concerned

1856
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:17,408
Doesn't

1857
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:19,968
It gives every source

1858
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:22,016
Every single source

1859
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:24,576
Like there

1860
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:26,112
Confidentiality before

1861
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:28,672
This one time where and administration

1862
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:29,952
Is f******

1863
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:33,280
Performing what is essentially a right-wing coup

1864
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:36,352
Formerly Republic Nation

1865
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:40,448
And they are they're finally burning a source

1866
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:46,848
That is going to invalidate every single thing going

1867
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:50,432
Maybe it's fine until you're a Nazi

1868
01:52:56,576 --> 01:52:57,088
Talk all this

1869
01:52:58,112 --> 01:52:59,904
Yeah I don't know it's not the path

1870
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:02,208
It's not the right path I know

1871
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,768
It doesn't Chiva thing

1872
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:07,584
I don't really disagree with it.

1873
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:10,400
I don't disagree with you

1874
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:11,424
Their process

1875
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:12,960
Confirm

1876
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:14,752
Vague

1877
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:19,360
It's not

1878
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:20,128
I'm sorry like

1879
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:22,432
I don't I'm not mad at you

1880
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:23,968
And I don't think that you're dumb

1881
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:26,016
Or anything like that

1882
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:27,296
I think it just lying

1883
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:28,576
Not it's not

1884
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:29,344
Productive

1885
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,112
It's not

1886
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,648
It doesn't help

1887
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:32,672
There are other things

1888
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:33,696
Certainly

1889
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:36,512
The can be broken

1890
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,536
Helpful

1891
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:39,328
But this one

1892
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:42,656
It's important

1893
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:47,520
Which they clearly

1894
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:51,104
Of course

1895
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:53,664
I mean like if someone just sent

1896
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:56,224
Request that this is off the Record

1897
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:03,904
Yeah we already

1898
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:04,672
BuzzFeed

1899
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:05,440
Elon Musk

1900
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:08,000
But the fact that

1901
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:09,792
Crossword

1902
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:11,840
So

1903
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:13,120
You can't

1904
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:14,912
It's not worth it

1905
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:16,960
You don't

1906
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:17,984
I get

1907
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:19,008
I get the

1908
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:21,312
The outcome

1909
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:23,872
And like I said

1910
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:24,896
Kind of agree with it

1911
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:27,456
But it would be better if you were worried

1912
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:29,504
That would be great

1913
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:30,784
B

1914
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:32,576
The real outcome

1915
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:33,600
Is that

1916
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:34,624
People like Alex

1917
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:37,440
They're confirm

1918
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:38,720
They're reinforced

1919
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:42,048
Think that's worth

1920
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:44,096
Knowing who wrote it

1921
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,752
I'm going to fundamentally do

1922
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:51,520
Disagree with you

1923
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:54,336
I'm going to accept that

1924
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:56,384
That is not a

1925
01:54:56,640 --> 01:55:00,480
Free on this

1926
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:01,760
Jordan

1927
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:06,112
God I love our Joe Dan

1928
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:08,416
It's so good

1929
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:10,208
I totally disagree all the time

1930
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:10,976
And I love you

1931
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:13,536
I love you too

1932
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:15,584
Discount your opinion

1933
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:20,704
Find some middle ground but if we can't

1934
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:25,824
There's a lot of times call for violence

1935
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:34,272
Incorrect

1936
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:37,088
Three assholes

1937
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:43,488
Kill your hotheaded a milquetoast

1938
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:44,512
Anybody could do

1939
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:46,816
You're right

1940
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:49,120
I mean I'm emotionally right

1941
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:55,776
Intellectually you are f******

1942
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:57,312
Emotionally I make

1943
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:59,360
I feel good

1944
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:02,176
Journalistic

1945
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:04,992
Rodger Stone

1946
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:05,760
Here on out

1947
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:08,320
The day after

1948
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:09,856
Right

1949
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,160
Rodger hazard

1950
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:14,464
About how Marco Rubio

1951
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:16,768
Himself

1952
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:24,192
Is Marco Rubio

1953
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:32,640
URL

1954
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:34,688
Rodger saying there but I

1955
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:35,712
Kind of joking

1956
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:39,296
Kind of despondent about the idea

1957
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:40,832
No we was

1958
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:49,536
What's going on with Chief

1959
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:53,376
Marco Rubio Rubio is allegedly

1960
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:54,400
Easter

1961
01:56:57,984 --> 01:57:02,336
Maybe censoring

1962
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:13,088
Is actually

1963
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:17,184
In Congress and doing the work

1964
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:19,232
But he doesn't know who you are

1965
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:20,512
You're f****** pissed

1966
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:23,328
Yeah

1967
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:25,376
Jordan

1968
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:26,400
I told you earlier

1969
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:27,936
Did Alex keeps playing

1970
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:29,472
Final count

1971
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:31,520
Right

1972
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:32,288
Which

1973
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:33,824
I've speculated it

1974
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:35,104
Harkening back to

1975
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:37,664
In the same way that we heard him sing along

1976
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:39,200
Azteca

1977
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:41,248
Couple weeks again

1978
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:45,344
Coming back and I think of is next

1979
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:47,136
To hear another

1980
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:51,232
Much more very legitimate returning to his roots

1981
01:57:51,488 --> 01:57:53,792
We get to hear The Offspring cover of the final

1982
01:57:57,888 --> 01:58:00,704
In terms of Alex Jones his future to Jeffrey Idaho

1983
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:01,728
Erode

1984
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:04,800
And this one still describes the more preferable

1985
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:14,784
Nipsey Hussle album

1986
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:19,392
Had they kick ass off cyberspace

1987
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:28,096
We want

1988
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:30,912
Rodger

1989
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:37,824
GoFundMe

1990
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:44,736
2BR with voices

1991
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:49,600
Alex is going back to his bullhorn route

1992
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:55,232
Tyranny Crushers 3 through 405

1993
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:56,768
Like legitimately at this point

1994
01:58:57,792 --> 01:58:59,072
Kicked off of Twitter

1995
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:01,376
He now has like gab and Mike

1996
01:59:01,632 --> 01:59:02,656
Mike Adams has his

1997
01:59:03,168 --> 01:59:04,192
Real.

1998
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:04,960
Video where some

1999
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:08,800
Watch the video

2000
01:59:09,056 --> 01:59:09,568
Thousand

2001
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:15,712
Yeah there's no like Market

2002
01:59:15,968 --> 01:59:20,576
Penetration there's no encroachment or anything

2003
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:27,488
Violent

2004
01:59:28,512 --> 01:59:29,536
Coming to God MoMA

2005
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:31,584
Like him realizing

2006
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:33,120
I've been holding back

2007
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:35,168
I'm just going to start throwing and words around

2008
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:41,568
She's not

2009
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:42,848
Already

2010
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:46,176
Just diminishing what

2011
01:59:46,688 --> 01:59:47,200
Forever like

2012
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:47,968
Like it's just going to be

2013
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:50,784
No

2014
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:52,576
He always does

2015
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:57,696
And how many how many viewers does Stormfront have or whatever

2016
01:59:57,952 --> 01:59:59,488
Well yeah then why not just

2017
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:03,072
Migrate to that after he's been kicked off everything else

2018
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:12,544
That's true there

2019
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:13,312
But

2020
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:18,176
White supremacist are genetically Superior they don't need Super male vitality

2021
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:19,200
What time does no

2022
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:20,736
Great Lake

2023
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:23,552
Lose the song

2024
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:25,600
Right like Edison

2025
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:27,392
He has enough of an audience

2026
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:29,184
Milk them

2027
02:00:29,696 --> 02:00:30,208
For money

2028
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:31,744
Yeah do a

2029
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:33,792
Small-scale version

2030
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:35,840
But the unfortunate thing about that

2031
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:40,192
Become basically what you

2032
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:40,960
You were into

2033
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:44,288
So fun

2034
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,360
Is your boss

2035
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:51,712
More down

2036
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:52,992
Ladder

2037
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:54,016
Little bit further

2038
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:55,552
You're back on the

2039
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:57,088
The bullhorn

2040
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:01,696
Fun situation

2041
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:06,048
It's the most natural course

2042
02:01:06,304 --> 02:01:08,352
For his career to have gone

2043
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:10,144
He flew too close to the Sun

2044
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:12,960
He behaved in such an appropriate ways

2045
02:01:14,752 --> 02:01:15,776
He blew all

2046
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:16,544
The things

2047
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:19,360
Yeah

2048
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:20,128
Creating

2049
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:21,664
Creating

2050
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:26,528
That but

2051
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:27,552
He was

2052
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:28,320
Part of

2053
02:01:28,576 --> 02:01:29,088
Creative

2054
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:31,392
Talked it all up

2055
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:33,184
Midday

2056
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:35,488
Trump

2057
02:01:38,816 --> 02:01:39,584
I would love

2058
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:41,888
Come back to

2059
02:01:43,168 --> 02:01:43,680
Because

2060
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:46,240
He couldn't afford his mortgage

2061
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:52,384
Yeah probably not right now is

2062
02:01:52,896 --> 02:01:56,736
Alex has so much more fun being the underdog who does

2063
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:57,760
Don't have anybody

2064
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:07,232
Scrambling with with gold as in with racist as Bob Chapman throwing everything around

2065
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:13,888
Sure

2066
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:16,704
Got a mortgage.

2067
02:02:17,216 --> 02:02:19,008
It's different for us

2068
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:20,032
This position where we like

2069
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:24,640
Yeah come back baby come back to this low roof for someone to

2070
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:26,432
You have tasted gold

2071
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:27,968
You know like

2072
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:31,040
Truffles

2073
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:32,064
Oh man

2074
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:33,600
My bullshittin live

2075
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:39,232
MSNBC

Big difference

2082
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:27,360
Between like

2083
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:31,200
Being cool with the

Still preferable to me then him

2089
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:48,608
Unleashing the demon that's within him

2090
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:50,656
Nationalism

2091
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:51,936
Outright

2092
02:03:52,448 --> 02:03:53,216
Horrible

2093
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:54,752
Is there

2094
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:56,032
But I don't want it

2095
02:03:57,056 --> 02:03:57,824
Become like

2096
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:03,712
I centered myself cuz I was on all these

2097
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:06,528
And if you kill yourself

2098
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:09,088
If you f****** killed yourself for a second

2099
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:11,392
And think that Genesis communication

2100
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:13,440
Will kick him off

2101
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:17,024
If he starts throwing words around

2102
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:18,304
Or it

2103
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:20,352
Becomes an outright White

2104
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:23,680

Viewpoint

2113
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,352
This is from the August 2000

2114
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:55,168
Reissue you put that like four issues

2115
02:04:56,448 --> 02:04:57,216
This is

2116
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:57,984
This is one of these

2117
02:05:00,032 --> 02:05:00,544
To be clear

2118
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:04,128
You guys are not heard the ships

2119
02:05:05,152 --> 02:05:06,176
Buy steel and gold

2120
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:07,456
Apartheid South Africa

2121
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:11,552
And like a good guy started falling apart

2122
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:12,576
He fled the country

2123
02:05:12,832 --> 02:05:15,648
You know like a good guy

2124
02:05:15,904 --> 02:05:18,208
South Africa

2125
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:21,792
The entire social system is

2126
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:23,840
Like

2127
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:26,400
So in this issue of his

2128
02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:27,168
His journal

2129
02:05:28,192 --> 02:05:29,472
Advises people

2130
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:31,008

2131
02:05:31,264 --> 02:05:31,776
African gold

2132
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:33,312
The remaining

2133
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:36,640
Starting to eat there

2134
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:40,224
Destroy labor National Mine Workers Union

2135
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:47,648
Only another way of saying

2136
02:05:47,904 --> 02:05:49,184
Communist takeover

2137
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:51,744
Yeah

2138
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,024
That sounds right

2139
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:57,120
You know how

2140
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:05,312
Three put outside

2141
02:06:05,568 --> 02:06:06,080
A journalist

2142
02:06:06,336 --> 02:06:09,408
You talk about immigrants

2143
02:06:10,432 --> 02:06:12,992
Unfortunately mr. Bush's return

2144
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:14,784
3911

2145
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:15,552
Paralegal next

2146
02:06:18,112 --> 02:06:18,624
The guys of

2147
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:20,672
Controlling a regulating illegal immigration

2148
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:27,072
Arizona representative Jim Kolbe

2149
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:28,352
Residence residence

2150
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:31,168
Status over a period of years to illegal aliens already in

2151
02:06:33,216 --> 02:06:39,360
86 all over again only this time we're looking at

2152
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:44,480
Most illegals have a third grade education and don't speak English

2153
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:47,296
We are told by sources in Washington

2154
02:06:47,552 --> 02:06:49,344
This is Pastor Republican

2155
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:53,696
Speargun

2156
02:06:53,952 --> 02:06:54,464
So also

2157
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:56,768
Bob Motz talk about

2158
02:06:57,024 --> 02:07:00,096
We know that you lived in apartheid South Africa

2159
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:03,936
Became a Zimbabwe

2160
02:07:07,776 --> 02:07:08,288
About a gross pay

2161
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:17,248
Be cool

2162
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:27,744
A few years ago is 8

2163
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:33,120
You can accomplish this when you have a dictatorial Marxist

2164
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:34,144
Tribal government

2165
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:35,936
You may choose to disagree

2166
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:37,472
We see America heading in

2167
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:38,496
Direction

2168
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:40,800
Yeah

2169
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:43,616
Really don't think he meant like

2170
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:44,384
Governed by

2171
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:45,152
Tribes

2172
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:51,296
Now you're talkin about a flag for like a

2173
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:52,576
You know what I'll stop right there

2174
02:07:53,088 --> 02:07:55,648
I can't presume to judge somebody else based on their work

2175
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:56,928
I mean

2176
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,208
I would say that

2177
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:01,536
Rhodesian government

2178
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:06,144
Dictatorial doesn't matter

2179
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:07,168
Distance

2180
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:08,192
It doesn't matter

2181
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:09,984
Alex could

2182
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:11,264
Just start expressing

2183
02:08:11,776 --> 02:08:13,312
The most overt

2184
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:16,384
Frederick in the world

2185
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:23,552
He's totally fine

2186
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:24,320
All of this

2187
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:25,344
Where all this world is

2188
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:26,368
Totally fine

2189
02:08:27,136 --> 02:08:28,416
They just want

2190
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:30,720
Yep

2191
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:32,000
Exact

2192
02:08:32,512 --> 02:08:34,048
It's like they own NFL

2193
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:43,264
All right of course

2194
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:44,544
Actually you know what

2195
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:45,824
Of course it does

2196
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:47,616
I brought up the connection

2197
02:08:48,384 --> 02:08:52,736
Why would ice be silly enough to think that that's beyond the pale

2198
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:54,272
Anyway

2199
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:57,088
Alex is in trouble basically because of his

2200
02:08:57,856 --> 02:08:58,880
Harassing of

2201
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:00,416
What you've already talked

2202
02:09:01,184 --> 02:09:03,488
Yep Transit Rogers

2203
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:15,008
Crawdaddy really is

2204
02:09:15,264 --> 02:09:21,408
Mr. Jones Goes to Washington moment

2205
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:24,992
And confront that

2206
02:09:26,528 --> 02:09:28,576
Rodger is right on

2207
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:31,648
In trouble

2208
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:32,672
Weird

2209
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:35,744
Cold

2210
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:37,024
Oliver Darcy

2211
02:09:37,536 --> 02:09:38,048
A possum

2212
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:42,144
I believe that's how we free

2213
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,448
I haven't

2214
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:46,752
But Alex has

2215
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:51,104
He has like a possum

2216
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,408
But just climbed out the carcass of a dead cow

2217
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:56,992
You already said that

2218
02:09:58,016 --> 02:10:04,160
What you look like

2219
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:14,144
I love you also answer

2220
02:10:15,424 --> 02:10:18,240
Exactly the thing is probably the most

2221
02:10:20,032 --> 02:10:23,360
The most dog Wesley of it all

2222
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:26,176
You know what

2223
02:10:30,016 --> 02:10:30,528
Rake

2224
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:37,184
What I can't let go is that he seen a possum climb out of a dead cows ass before

2225
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:43,584
Not explained by back always know they've done something wrong

2226
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:48,960
No one. He's like

2227
02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:55,104
Just finish it

2228
02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:59,200
You've not heard of the video of Alex

2229
02:10:59,712 --> 02:11:00,992
Confronting

2230
02:11:02,016 --> 02:11:03,296
Darcy

2231
02:11:03,552 --> 02:11:05,600
So now we're going to listen to a tiny clip

2232
02:11:05,856 --> 02:11:09,184
Small taste of obligated not to

2233
02:11:54,752 --> 02:12:00,896
I understand that that's 45

2234
02:12:01,152 --> 02:12:02,176
Five seconds of

2235
02:12:02,432 --> 02:12:06,272
Is there interaction foot 8 indicative of the entire 9 minutes

2236
02:12:06,784 --> 02:12:09,344
It's Alex harangue

2237
02:12:11,904 --> 02:12:18,048
I don't like

2238
02:12:18,304 --> 02:12:19,584
How's the wife

2239
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:26,240
Microaggression

2240
02:12:26,496 --> 02:12:28,544
Although is a leftist

2241
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:29,824
Got offended by that

2242
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:32,640
Call them triggers

2243
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:34,432
Took that I just want to play

2244
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:35,712
Give some sort of an idea

2245
02:12:36,224 --> 02:12:38,016
That's the vibe of that

2246
02:12:38,272 --> 02:12:39,296
Tire thing

2247
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:40,320
This is a guy being

2248
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:41,856
Yeah right

2249
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:43,136
It's not it's not like

2250
02:12:43,648 --> 02:12:49,024
Haha

2251
02:12:57,216 --> 02:12:58,496
Are you staying there silently

2252
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:18,720
Yelling

2253
02:13:18,976 --> 02:13:23,072
Children in

2254
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:28,192
Have you ever taken a red-eye flight

2255
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:31,520
Teleological

2256
02:13:31,776 --> 02:13:36,896
Jet lag

2257
02:13:37,408 --> 02:13:38,432
Do you want book

2258
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:40,736
How many hours I'm

2259
02:13:40,992 --> 02:13:46,880
Am I in the doctor brought small log

2260
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:51,488
Why can't I get on red eye on malaria

2261
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:55,840
Can I get

2262
02:14:03,008 --> 02:14:05,056
Oh my God

2263
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:07,104
Let's just the time to shows up

2264
02:14:10,432 --> 02:14:10,944
And then

2265
02:14:11,456 --> 02:14:11,968
I think I want to do

2266
02:14:13,248 --> 02:14:14,272
What you've never done on the show before

2267
02:14:15,552 --> 02:14:17,856
It's kind of in forwards roulette

2268
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:19,136
Okay

2269
02:14:19,392 --> 02:14:21,952
I have the video of Alex's response to him

2270
02:14:28,096 --> 02:14:29,888
9 minute video

2271
02:14:30,656 --> 02:14:31,936
That we are going to watch a

2272
02:14:32,192 --> 02:14:35,008
These last two

2273
02:14:37,568 --> 02:14:39,104
Yeah probably

2274
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:42,944
Guarantee it'll be like

2275
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:45,504
We're still on Thursday

2276
02:14:47,552 --> 02:14:48,064
Like

2277
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:49,344
I can't stress

2278
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:51,136
I don't have any clips

2279
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:52,160
Because it's

2280
02:14:52,672 --> 02:14:53,440
Embed

2281
02:14:53,952 --> 02:14:55,488
Really boring long

2282
02:14:56,768 --> 02:14:57,536
Alex

2283
02:14:57,792 --> 02:14:58,304
Does Express

2284
02:14:58,816 --> 02:14:59,328
Couple time

2285
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:00,864
Admiration

2286
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:05,216
He expresses his ideas at like

2287
02:15:05,472 --> 02:15:07,520
He's not as bad as Facebook isn't kicked

2288
02:15:09,056 --> 02:15:09,824
He doesn't realize it

2289
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:11,872
A couple hours for then he's cooked

2290
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:12,896
Copper

2291
02:15:13,152 --> 02:15:15,712
It's only interesting

2292
02:15:15,968 --> 02:15:16,992
To be in as much as like

2293
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:19,552
You would later probably say like we knew it

2294
02:15:20,832 --> 02:15:23,392
Blindsided by this like crazy

2295
02:15:23,648 --> 02:15:25,696
Earlier

2296
02:15:25,952 --> 02:15:26,464
Episode

2297
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:27,232
For the episode

2298
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,048
Ticked off

2299
02:15:30,304 --> 02:15:30,816
Eventually

2300
02:15:31,328 --> 02:15:32,608
I know that

2301
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:35,680
Skating on

2302
02:15:36,704 --> 02:15:38,240
What do you think

2303
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:40,544
Because he is

2304
02:15:41,056 --> 02:15:41,824
Keeps testing

2305
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:44,128
Break

2306
02:15:45,408 --> 02:15:47,712
Hey I know you hit the wrong patch

2307
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:48,992
F****** straight through

2308
02:15:50,016 --> 02:15:53,088
He's not interested

2309
02:15:54,112 --> 02:15:54,624
Reason

2310
02:15:55,136 --> 02:15:56,160
Verizon

2311
02:15:59,232 --> 02:15:59,744
Because

2312
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:01,536
Most of the show

2313
02:16:01,792 --> 02:16:02,304
Husband

2314
02:16:02,816 --> 02:16:04,352
Basically a Victory lap

2315
02:16:04,608 --> 02:16:05,376
I'm talking about like

2316
02:16:06,656 --> 02:16:12,800
People suck Seahawks Miller on Godzilla

2317
02:16:13,568 --> 02:16:14,592
Sirius bankrupt

2318
02:16:14,848 --> 02:16:15,872
Godzilla

2319
02:16:17,152 --> 02:16:18,432
Marco Rubio sucks

2320
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:21,248
Bear f*** what they're saying I'm saying this

2321
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:22,528
Dorothy

2322
02:16:22,784 --> 02:16:23,296
Socks

2323
02:16:23,552 --> 02:16:25,856
A clown them I made him look like a cock

2324
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:29,952
Taking risks

2325
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:33,024
Listen to this

2326
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:35,840
This going to make you really mad

2327
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:48,384
I think that like first of all this this is

2328
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:49,152
Wild

2329
02:16:49,664 --> 02:16:50,432
He's

2330
02:16:51,968 --> 02:16:53,760
Then second it's also fun to see him

2331
02:16:54,016 --> 02:16:55,296
Consistently Miss Rippers

2332
02:16:55,552 --> 02:16:56,320
Mispronounce

2333
02:16:57,088 --> 02:16:57,600
Brand

2334
02:16:59,136 --> 02:17:00,160
Something that's really

2335
02:17:00,416 --> 02:17:00,928
Central

2336
02:17:01,696 --> 02:17:06,048
Dish.com

2337
02:17:08,352 --> 02:17:10,400
Infowars.com

2338
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:16,032
Who cares drop

2339
02:17:23,712 --> 02:17:26,784
Generation Z

2340
02:17:27,808 --> 02:17:28,576
Add camp

2341
02:17:33,696 --> 02:17:35,232
Why is this the key to everything

2342
02:17:40,608 --> 02:17:42,144
Because

2343
02:17:42,912 --> 02:17:46,240
The last year

2344
02:17:46,496 --> 02:17:50,592
Hollywood

2345
02:17:52,128 --> 02:17:52,896
Racine

2346
02:17:55,456 --> 02:17:56,736
Real quick

2347
02:17:56,992 --> 02:18:00,064
Depart

2348
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:02,112
The park

2349
02:18:02,368 --> 02:18:04,672
Department that is true in terms of like

2350
02:18:04,928 --> 02:18:09,280
Diminishing

2351
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:11,328
Because of like a different ways to find

2352
02:18:12,352 --> 02:18:12,864
Do you want to watch

2353
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:14,912
It's just a

2354
02:18:15,168 --> 02:18:16,704
Modern technology

2355
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:20,288
Issue in the same way album sales

2356
02:18:20,544 --> 02:18:21,824
Tamarac

2357
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:25,408
Didn't want music anymore

2358
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:27,712
Joey f*** cable and all that s***

2359
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:28,736
So

2360
02:18:29,248 --> 02:18:30,016
Your arguments Pogo

2361
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:34,624
25%

2362
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:36,160
Year after year

2363
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:39,744
For a few shows on MSNBC and fox

2364
02:18:41,024 --> 02:18:42,048
General a v

2365
02:18:42,560 --> 02:18:44,096
Declined mashup

2366
02:18:45,888 --> 02:18:48,448
Drop 34%

2367
02:18:49,216 --> 02:18:53,824
Why is that so important

2368
02:18:54,592 --> 02:18:57,408
7 million-dollar

2369
02:19:05,088 --> 02:19:05,600
Through Time

2370
02:19:13,536 --> 02:19:15,072
He become scared

2371
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:17,632
He had become

2372
02:19:18,144 --> 02:19:18,912
Call

2373
02:19:20,704 --> 02:19:22,752
A little b****

2374
02:19:23,264 --> 02:19:23,776
No

2375
02:19:25,312 --> 02:19:31,200
Anymore so he got basically hired by Soros and others to be this PR person

2376
02:19:31,712 --> 02:19:35,040
Strife and Division

2377
02:19:37,344 --> 02:19:38,368
What is your first amendment

2378
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:40,928
Give you're not on the team

2379
02:19:46,560 --> 02:19:48,608
You can pick up your bike again

2380
02:19:50,656 --> 02:19:55,264
I want this is an audio broadcast Jordan just stood up for most of that and was

2381
02:19:59,104 --> 02:20:00,128
Curious

2382
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:06,528
Chakras

2383
02:20:06,784 --> 02:20:07,296
Pittsburgh

2384
02:20:08,576 --> 02:20:09,856
F****** come on

2385
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:13,696
I want Kaepernick destroy the Bears

2386
02:20:13,952 --> 02:20:15,488
Roy's

2387
02:20:15,744 --> 02:20:17,024
Like it was even a f******

2388
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:28,544
Colin Kaepernick is one of the more talented but not after that

2389
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:34,944
You still be better than f******

2390
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:37,248
Whoever you want to talk in there

2391
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:43,136
Colin Kaepernick was

2392
02:20:43,392 --> 02:20:43,904
Good

2393
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:46,464
He's actually good at what he does

2394
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:47,488
Beetle

2395
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:49,792
Cubs

2396
02:20:53,888 --> 02:21:00,032
There's evidence

2397
02:21:00,288 --> 02:21:01,056
Yep

2398
02:21:02,592 --> 02:21:03,360
F****** God

2399
02:21:03,616 --> 02:21:04,896
Here's the is original

2400
02:21:05,152 --> 02:21:05,920
Compliant

2401
02:21:06,176 --> 02:21:08,224
His original

2402
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:09,760
Speech was about

2403
02:21:11,552 --> 02:21:13,088
She's very

2404
02:21:15,904 --> 02:21:21,024
And somehow

2405
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:22,048
That's the point

2406
02:21:22,304 --> 02:21:27,680
Somehow we support the troops or any b******* like that Colin Kaepernick was literally

2407
02:21:27,936 --> 02:21:28,704
Kneeling

2408
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:30,240
As he stated

2409
02:21:31,008 --> 02:21:37,152
Because police were it's very interesting

2410
02:21:40,992 --> 02:21:41,504
I agree

2411
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:42,528
Ivory

2412
02:21:42,784 --> 02:21:47,648
Call Yuri

2413
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:52,512
You've touched on already

2414
02:21:53,792 --> 02:21:54,560
It is

2415
02:21:54,816 --> 02:21:56,352
It is a protest at

2416
02:21:56,608 --> 02:21:57,376
Start

2417
02:21:58,656 --> 02:22:00,192
Very quickly became

2418
02:22:01,472 --> 02:22:04,288
Like if it has all of that wrapped up inside

2419
02:22:10,176 --> 02:22:10,688
I hate this

2420
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:14,272
I hate the idea of the right

2421
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:15,296
Work

2422
02:22:15,552 --> 02:22:19,136
Let me know that I hate the idea of power over their bosses

2423
02:22:19,392 --> 02:22:22,208
And then I also f****** hate the idea that

2424
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:23,488
Uppity dude

2425
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:24,768
Is that

2426
02:22:27,072 --> 02:22:27,840
In his position

2427
02:22:28,096 --> 02:22:29,120
Weird question

2428
02:22:29,376 --> 02:22:30,912
How many NFL owners

2429
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:35,776
I don't know I would assume not many but I don't know

2430
02:22:36,032 --> 02:22:39,360
I would be surprised if I don't know

2431
02:22:42,176 --> 02:22:46,784
Who is the Kool-Aid Man

2432
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:50,624
Through the wall with Colin Kaepernick

2433
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:52,672
I don't I don't know that that that stuff

2434
02:22:52,928 --> 02:22:53,440
Cuz it's not like

2435
02:22:55,488 --> 02:22:56,768
Familiar world

2436
02:23:02,144 --> 02:23:02,656
He's very black

2437
02:23:02,912 --> 02:23:05,728
Imagine he owned every NFL team

2438
02:23:07,008 --> 02:23:09,056
ECW Champion awarded durag

2439
02:23:10,592 --> 02:23:13,152
This is closest

2440
02:23:13,408 --> 02:23:15,200
You were do right

2441
02:23:16,736 --> 02:23:18,016
What

2442
02:23:18,272 --> 02:23:18,784
Durag

2443
02:23:19,552 --> 02:23:20,832
I'm not okay with

2444
02:23:21,344 --> 02:23:22,112
Dark time

2445
02:23:22,368 --> 02:23:25,696
Of his

2446
02:23:26,208 --> 02:23:26,976
Company's history

2447
02:23:32,608 --> 02:23:34,912
I'm sure he's been good with labor

2448
02:23:35,168 --> 02:23:41,056
Because it's clearly a union company

2449
02:23:41,312 --> 02:23:47,456
And it's really about your contact take care of your

2450
02:23:47,712 --> 02:23:53,856
You wouldn't have a show

2451
02:23:54,112 --> 02:23:54,880
I was playing the game

2452
02:23:55,136 --> 02:23:56,416
So you want to make sure that they're taking

2453
02:23:56,672 --> 02:24:01,536
Terabrite you want to make sure that if they get an injury their careers are over and all their money

2454
02:24:01,792 --> 02:24:04,352
Travel between shows

2455
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:06,912
Look

2456
02:24:18,688 --> 02:24:21,504
Play food

2457
02:24:26,368 --> 02:24:27,136
Everyone

2458
02:24:27,904 --> 02:24:29,696
Everytime I try and bring it up at the office

2459
02:24:32,256 --> 02:24:32,768
Come on guys

2460
02:24:34,304 --> 02:24:34,816
Unionize

2461
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:36,352
Frustrated

2462
02:24:39,168 --> 02:24:44,800
I think it's frustrating that I work in an office because

2463
02:24:47,616 --> 02:24:51,456
Are scab labor would destroy us

2464
02:24:52,224 --> 02:24:54,016
Yeah cuz nobody knows what

2465
02:24:54,784 --> 02:24:56,320
Nordstrom

2466
02:24:56,832 --> 02:25:00,160
And tires

2467
02:25:08,352 --> 02:25:09,632
Here's what I want to say

2468
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:13,472
Earlier in the show Alex is talking about how

2469
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:15,520
He got a cost

2470
02:25:15,776 --> 02:25:16,288
Goodbye somebody

2471
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:18,080
Expelled it out later that

2472
02:25:20,896 --> 02:25:21,920
You're all that stuff

2473
02:25:22,688 --> 02:25:23,968
And here is why

2474
02:25:24,736 --> 02:25:25,760
Him being kicked off

2475
02:25:26,016 --> 02:25:27,040
Twitter the next day

2476
02:25:27,808 --> 02:25:28,320
King Soopers

2477
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:30,368
I don't think it's

2478
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:34,464
You need to do it you should have done it earlier

2479
02:25:34,976 --> 02:25:35,744
But the timing is

2480
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,024
Really f***** up

2481
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:40,608
Because Anna's on his show today

2482
02:25:42,144 --> 02:25:42,656

2483
02:25:42,912 --> 02:25:43,424
Validate

2484
02:25:43,936 --> 02:25:44,448
For the next

2485
02:25:45,216 --> 02:25:46,240
Tomorrow at least 6 months

2486
02:25:47,264 --> 02:25:48,032
Tuesday

2487
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:51,616
Wednesday

2488
02:25:52,896 --> 02:25:54,688
We're going to have some big news

2489
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:55,712
Big news

2490
02:25:56,992 --> 02:25:59,040
Zbigniew Brzezinski

2491
02:25:59,296 --> 02:26:03,136
I just gave you the facts

2492
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:07,488
Come hell or high water

2493
02:26:08,256 --> 02:26:10,304
Release the information on air

2494
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:11,072
Do it

2495
02:26:21,824 --> 02:26:22,336
But

2496
02:26:25,152 --> 02:26:26,688
They're making their move on this country

2497
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:28,480
No doubt now

2498
02:26:28,736 --> 02:26:29,248
Oh yeah

2499
02:26:29,504 --> 02:26:32,064
Stop that

2500
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:40,000
Trump has to remove that special office that the clintons Left Behind with Obama

2501
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:42,304
Department

2502
02:26:48,192 --> 02:26:48,704
Whatever

2503
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:49,984
But it doesn't matter

2504
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:53,824
This is just what he does all the time we can look back to our

2505
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:55,104
Podcast history

2506
02:26:56,896 --> 02:27:00,224
Jerome corsi is going to be killed for the information that he has

2507
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:02,016
He does going to be honest I've never listen

2508
02:27:02,784 --> 02:27:06,624
He does this all the time that sort of like weird T's of like

2509
02:27:07,136 --> 02:27:13,280
I'm going to do this afternoon we're going to but unfortunately

2510
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:15,328
We stopped the global

2511
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:18,144
Right yeah

2512
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:19,168
Because it unfortunate

2513
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:24,288
Tomorrow I'm going to f****** do this

2514
02:27:24,544 --> 02:27:26,336
As if he had done that a hundred times

2515
02:27:26,592 --> 02:27:28,384
Because you said it on this

2516
02:27:29,408 --> 02:27:30,176
I think that he's going

2517
02:27:32,992 --> 02:27:34,784
But Alex is going to be

2518
02:27:37,088 --> 02:27:37,600
I was right

2519
02:27:38,112 --> 02:27:38,880
That's why they kick

2520
02:27:39,136 --> 02:27:41,696
Ticks me off

2521
02:27:43,488 --> 02:27:44,768
Which is

2522
02:27:45,792 --> 02:27:49,888
But it's like it's like if all of the time

2523
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:52,960
Terrorist attack is going to happen in the next 3 months

2524
02:27:53,472 --> 02:27:59,360
It happens like

2525
02:27:59,616 --> 02:28:00,896
Unfortunately

2526
02:28:01,152 --> 02:28:03,968
Coincidentally

2527
02:28:06,528 --> 02:28:07,040
Because

2528
02:28:08,064 --> 02:28:09,344
Will it happen

2529
02:28:09,856 --> 02:28:16,000
That is going to happen

2530
02:28:16,256 --> 02:28:17,792
His prediction was

2531
02:28:18,048 --> 02:28:18,560
Cuz they're going

2532
02:28:19,072 --> 02:28:19,584
Take me off of

2533
02:28:20,096 --> 02:28:20,608
Twitter

2534
02:28:22,912 --> 02:28:29,056
Then he would have been accidentally right

2535
02:28:29,312 --> 02:28:29,824
Be like

2536
02:28:31,360 --> 02:28:35,712
Tomorrow we're going to have to do an emergency

2537
02:28:36,224 --> 02:28:37,248
But for now

2538
02:28:38,016 --> 02:28:40,832

2539
02:28:41,344 --> 02:28:45,184

2573
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:49,600
If he actually knows

2574
02:30:49,856 --> 02:30:53,184
If she has the sense of

2575
02:30:53,696 --> 02:30:54,208

2647
02:34:37,184 --> 02:34:39,744
He's he said much more things that were like

2648
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:44,352
These are demons

2649
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:49,216
If you talked about have your battle rifles ready by your bed cuz

2650
02:34:49,472 --> 02:34:49,984
Cuz they're coming

2651
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:51,008
Yeah

2652
02:34:53,824 --> 02:34:54,336
Do you need

2653
02:34:54,592 --> 02:34:57,152
Kill them when they come in your house

2654
02:34:57,408 --> 02:35:01,248
But it's still in your house

2655
02:35:05,088 --> 02:35:06,624
It's one of the rare things that I'll defend

2656
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:15,584
I'm not going to say that like

2657
02:35:19,936 --> 02:35:20,960
He was trying to f*** with

2658
02:35:25,824 --> 02:35:26,336
Call to respond

2659
02:35:26,848 --> 02:35:27,872
Course

2660
02:35:28,128 --> 02:35:29,664
I'm done with this response

2661
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:32,224
This response is stupid really sucks

2662
02:35:32,480 --> 02:35:36,064
It's Bora bummed out cuz I have the video in front of

2663
02:35:36,576 --> 02:35:37,856
I hate looking

2664
02:35:38,368 --> 02:35:39,392
Beard is okay

2665
02:35:39,648 --> 02:35:42,720
What is a duck boat

2666
02:35:43,232 --> 02:35:44,512
Here here

2667
02:35:44,768 --> 02:35:45,280
Jordan

2668
02:35:47,584 --> 02:35:51,424
The final point that I want to make

2669
02:35:53,472 --> 02:35:54,496
Alex Jones

2670
02:35:54,752 --> 02:35:57,056
And the people who are against Alex Jones

2671
02:35:57,824 --> 02:35:58,336
Quote unquote

2672
02:35:58,592 --> 02:35:59,104
Yeah

2673
02:36:02,944 --> 02:36:03,968
More than the other side

2674
02:36:04,992 --> 02:36:05,504
Exist

2675
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:07,040
Only because of cintra

2676
02:36:08,832 --> 02:36:11,136
They only exist and they're only able to

2677
02:36:11,904 --> 02:36:12,416
You being what

2678
02:36:12,672 --> 02:36:13,184
Because

2679
02:36:14,464 --> 02:36:14,976
Forward

2680
02:36:15,744 --> 02:36:17,792
But they don't realize that the moving forward

2681
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:20,864
Just a tornado

2682
02:36:21,376 --> 02:36:22,400
And they're counterbalance

2683
02:36:22,656 --> 02:36:23,680
The other person

2684
02:36:25,216 --> 02:36:25,728
So

2685
02:36:25,984 --> 02:36:27,520
The other side

2686
02:36:28,032 --> 02:36:30,848
Yeah yeah

2687
02:36:31,616 --> 02:36:32,384
And the force

2688
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:33,664
Create

2689
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:34,432
Forward keep

2690
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:35,712
Watched

2691
02:36:35,968 --> 02:36:36,992
Together right

2692
02:36:37,248 --> 02:36:38,784
And that's how Lux

2693
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:39,552
Skywalker

2694
02:36:39,808 --> 02:36:40,832
Created a force ghost

2695
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:42,624
To fight against

2696
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:44,928
What I feel like you're goofing on what I

2697
02:36:45,184 --> 02:36:46,720
I think was a

2698
02:36:46,976 --> 02:36:49,536
Decent know it was that easy

2699
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:53,888
I'm sick of this s*** I don't think it's okay

2700
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:57,728
I think it's nonsense

2701
02:36:58,752 --> 02:36:59,776
I think that

2702
02:37:00,544 --> 02:37:01,056
His

2703
02:37:01,312 --> 02:37:01,824
His response

2704
02:37:02,848 --> 02:37:03,360
Twitter is

2705
02:37:04,128 --> 02:37:05,152
Exactly the same as

2706
02:37:12,064 --> 02:37:13,344
He has nothing else left

2707
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:14,368
To rebound

2708
02:37:15,648 --> 02:37:16,928
Like he has no

2709
02:37:18,208 --> 02:37:18,720
Person

2710
02:37:20,768 --> 02:37:21,280
You know

2711
02:37:21,536 --> 02:37:22,048
You got

2712
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:24,096
Yeah he's absolutely

2713
02:37:24,608 --> 02:37:26,144
There is no Jack Dorsey

2714
02:37:26,656 --> 02:37:27,168
Telling him

2715
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:29,216
Hey you can't do xyr

2716
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:30,752
Now he is

2717
02:37:31,008 --> 02:37:31,776
Is just his own

2718
02:37:32,032 --> 02:37:33,056
Media operation

2719
02:37:33,824 --> 02:37:35,104
Infowars.com

2720
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:37,664
They have their ability to stretch

2721
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:38,432
Newswars

2722
02:37:38,944 --> 02:37:40,224
Newswars.com

2723
02:37:45,088 --> 02:37:45,600
Now he can beat

2724
02:37:45,856 --> 02:37:46,880
Purest Alex

2725
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:51,232
I will guarantee you that's not going to be

2726
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:52,512
So

2727
02:37:53,024 --> 02:37:54,304
Here's my point

2728
02:37:55,072 --> 02:37:57,376
F*** him

2729
02:37:59,424 --> 02:38:03,264
Jackson done it long ago

2730
02:38:04,544 --> 02:38:05,312
Ivan nope

2731
02:38:05,824 --> 02:38:07,104
Trying so hard to

2732
02:38:07,872 --> 02:38:09,664
And I just don't it's been a

2733
02:38:10,176 --> 02:38:11,968
It's been a struggle I just don't I don't care

2734
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:13,760
He did things that he

2735
02:38:14,016 --> 02:38:15,040
He should not have done

2736
02:38:15,552 --> 02:38:16,576
Not honor like

2737
02:38:17,856 --> 02:38:18,880
On a human level

2738
02:38:22,208 --> 02:38:22,976
He has four

2739
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,280
He was not punished for it

2740
02:38:25,536 --> 02:38:26,304
Now he is

2741
02:38:28,096 --> 02:38:28,608
Didn't

2742
02:38:30,400 --> 02:38:30,912
Great

2743
02:38:31,424 --> 02:38:31,936
So now

2744
02:38:33,728 --> 02:38:34,752
Do you know where you can

2745
02:38:35,008 --> 02:38:35,520
Can't find

2746
02:38:35,776 --> 02:38:36,288
Alex

2747
02:38:37,312 --> 02:38:38,336
I'll tell you the numbers

2748
02:38:39,616 --> 02:38:40,128
Or website

2749
02:38:40,384 --> 02:38:44,736
You can't find it at our website

2750
02:38:44,992 --> 02:38:50,368
No you can't acknowledge underscore fight

2751
02:38:50,624 --> 02:38:53,952
Where else could you find a stand

2752
02:38:54,208 --> 02:38:57,280
Could you find Alex on ice

2753
02:38:57,536 --> 02:38:59,072
No

2754
02:38:59,328 --> 02:39:00,864
Prssv

2755
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:07,264
Can you find Pokemon my

2756
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:08,032
Shut this down

2757
02:39:09,568 --> 02:39:10,592
Fun

2758
02:39:12,128 --> 02:39:13,920
You know what

2759
02:39:14,176 --> 02:39:17,504
It's been very fun but I just don't give a s*** about this

2760
02:39:18,016 --> 02:39:19,296
Modern stuff

2761
02:39:20,832 --> 02:39:21,856
Goal of this

2762
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:24,672
This is

2763
02:39:25,184 --> 02:39:25,952
Diminishment

2764
02:39:26,208 --> 02:39:26,720
Of Alex

2765
02:39:26,976 --> 02:39:28,256
A force

2766
02:39:28,512 --> 02:39:29,024
Which

2767
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:30,304
I do fight all that interest

2768
02:39:32,608 --> 02:39:34,400
Him becoming in

2769
02:39:34,656 --> 02:39:35,168
Outright

2770
02:39:35,424 --> 02:39:38,752
Avatar of neo-nazism in white supremacy

2771
02:39:39,264 --> 02:39:42,848
Not like I was an amazing Avatar

2772
02:39:43,104 --> 02:39:44,384
Wait what

2773
02:39:44,896 --> 02:39:50,528
I was not here with corocoro was it amazing avatars

2774
02:39:54,112 --> 02:39:59,488
Oh my God

2775
02:39:59,744 --> 02:40:00,256
Trouble

2776
02:40:00,768 --> 02:40:06,912
Brian Kinney ask you let's get this s*** solved right now can you have a race Bender that's not okay

2777
02:40:07,168 --> 02:40:07,680
How dare you

2778
02:40:07,936 --> 02:40:14,080
Great jokes over what was it

2779
02:40:14,336 --> 02:40:19,968
Amazing joke I apologize if you wanted the three of us

2780
02:40:20,224 --> 02:40:23,808
Absolutely f****** supplicating

2781
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:28,928
I don't find any of this

2782
02:40:30,464 --> 02:40:31,488
Did the end result

2783
02:40:31,744 --> 02:40:32,256
1

2784
02:40:33,792 --> 02:40:34,304
And the other

2785
02:40:35,072 --> 02:40:35,840
Be scared of that

2786
02:40:36,096 --> 02:40:37,120
But we'll keep an eye on

2787
02:40:37,376 --> 02:40:38,144
We'll see what happens

2788
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:38,912
Future

2789
02:40:39,424 --> 02:40:39,936
Hope it's not

2790
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:41,728
Probably will bake

2791
02:40:41,984 --> 02:40:47,104
Cuz it's worth more money is probably really doesn't matter

2792
02:40:47,360 --> 02:40:47,872
Because we need

2793
02:40:48,384 --> 02:40:53,248
Remember specific about Alex Jones

2794
02:40:54,016 --> 02:40:58,624
That maybe we should always have in our consciousness

2795
02:41:03,488 --> 02:41:07,328
