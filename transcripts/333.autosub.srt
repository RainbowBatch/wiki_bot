00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,136
Dot-com

3
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,424
What is

4
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,448
The weirdest

5
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,800
Ever had I know you were across the world

6
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:50,176
And you have received terrible candies

7
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,200
Stick out in my mind

8
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:54,272
I erase them never exist

9
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:57,856
I don't want

10
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:02,208
The worst one that sticks out obviously Orange

11
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,000
Black rapper

12
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,584
Taffy's that you would get on Halloween

13
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,120
But something rather discuss

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,192
Butts

15
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
Pick out the most for me

16
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,568
Gabbar is one of the best

17
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:18,848
Fantastic

18
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,896
The graham crackers

19
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,176
It's a good texter

20
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,480
Great chocolate tastic work Willy

21
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,808
And then the other one is the the

22
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
Honeycomb

23
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,464
Is 1

24
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,864
Crunch maybe I don't know it's a honeycomb

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,888
Chocolate

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,544
So good absolutely I ran into

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,568
Like my dad would go.

28
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
Conferences

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,664
Sherwood have conferences and

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,456
Various countries

31
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,480
Honeycomb

32
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,112
Honeycomb candy

33
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
He's from some foreign

34
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,184
Market

35
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,536
We were all looking for

36
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,560
Like an arrow

37
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
The aerated chocolate

38
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
Has a really nice Tech

39
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
Extra

40
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,080
Because you've just returned from your trip

41
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,408
To South Africa

42
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,296
What looks like probably the most disgusting thing ever

43
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
Candy bar

44
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,184
I'm looking at it original

45
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:42,048
Original original

46
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,840
Basically

47
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,632
Gummy bears inside a white truck

48
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
Play Kodak

49
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,192
I have no idea how it's going to

50
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,240
Damn your first fight

51
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,384
Good opening review

52
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,408
If I can

53
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
The jelly tots

54
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
Have a very unhappy

55
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,112
First review

56
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,720
If you're going to make a white chocolate think I think it's

57
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:16,096
You know you're behooved to make it a little bit less overpowering flavor

58
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192
I'm not into it

59
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
How about that that's my review

60
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:29,152
It's not as bad as I thought it was going to be based on V jelly thing and white

61
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
Spit this out

62
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,688
Bro I just

63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,736
It's a bad texter

64
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,528
That's what I was saying

65
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
That

66
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,136
You are eating white chocolate

67
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,440
It's not a

68
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,464
It's not it's not

69
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,120
I hope you had a great time over there

70
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,144
Think too much about the

71
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,912
The song

72
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,752
Africa by Toto

73
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,544
Because of your text

74
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
Successful

75
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
Remembrance

76
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
Until you text

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,016
Multiple times

78
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,320
Whatever you do

79
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:14,720
Hope you'd be out enjoying

80
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,047
Don't worry I'm not reading your diary

81
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,351
Yeah I know it was

82
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:25,983
I was amazed we were actually if we weren't staying in

83
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
We were actually

84
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
Which was

85
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,175
Truliant credit

86
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
Even that was a was tainted because

87
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
Cuz we went out

88
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
On a drive

89
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
The park rangers

90
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,391
At night and as where

91
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,207
And I on the way back to the

92
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
He literally turns around

93
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,815
We're not really big

94
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
Taking care of here

95
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
I've been here for

96
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
For 23 years and they're going to

97
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
Make me retire

98
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,471
And there's no replacement

99
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
And so he's going on on this whole thing and I'm

100
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:05,919
Once again

101
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,991
It really awful unlike

102
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Where are you now

103
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,087
Bolsonaro selling off the Amazon rainforest

104
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
Loggers and

105
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
Like that

106
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Government is just

107
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
Starving this place

108
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
So I assume it'll go out of bed

109
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
It's nightmare

110
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,471
Spider-Man car

111
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,007
Did see a lot of grapes

112
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
Wildlife

113
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,079
Oh yeah I was I was

114
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,175
Unexpectedly 25 ft away for a minute

115
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:44,575
Encounters of elephants to be expected repair for

116
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,647
Startling elephant

117
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
We couldn't see it

118
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
That wherever

119
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
25ft.

120
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Road

121
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,815
And then later on.

122
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,375
We heard that the elephant

123
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
Figured out

124
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
That nobody was

125
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,447
In the camp

126
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Eating

127
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,495
All of the foods in

128
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
So the elephant

129
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,871
It started going into the camp during the middle of the day

130
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:14,271
Elephants are sneaking in WoW

131
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:19,903
Cuz elephant tiptoeing grab the sandwiches

132
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,719
Well I'm glad you had a great time

133
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,791
Everybody who has the

134
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
Clamoring

135
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,399
How to get back to work I don't

00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:36,543
I don't like to say an apology and our friend friend

00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,847
Who came and we recorded episode on Monday

138
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,383
Or to put out for Monday

139
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,431
And I had to take difficulties in terms

140
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,735
Get out

141
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,527
How to release it at some point down the line

142
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,087
But in order to keep moving forward with the process

143
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,623
Releasing

144
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
Episodes in

145
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,183
Keeping up with the show

146
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
Forward workload

147
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,767
But I do hope there will be a

148
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,303
Will do that and I apologize

149
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
For the inconvenience

150
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
For being so kind

151
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727

Being up until 4 a.m. with a

156
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
Computer

157
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,527
Impossible to get it out on Monday

158
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,855
I shouldn't complain

159
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,135
Okay

29

163
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,095
Episode of The Alex Jones Show

164
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
As you may know

165
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:40,031
Alex Jones went on vacation at the same time you went on vacation

166
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:46,431
Vacation was announced ahead of time.

167
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,991
Gone away on vacation

168
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,807
For all of last week on Friday

169
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
In the meantime

170
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,159
You'd been putting in little video reports

171
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:00,767
Hand popping in while other people were hosting the show

172
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,607
As he is known to say

173
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,887
Albert

174
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,471
Do a lot of his own show until Friday

175
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,495
When he was actually back

176
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,311
It will be picking up the threads there

177
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,103
And it'll be at

178
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
I don't think it's

179
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,431
Like what anybody would expect

180
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,479
Which is now

181
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,039
Expect the unexpected

182
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,087
There are some very very weird

183
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159

Appreciate it very much

198
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,439
So I did thank you so much

199
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
Lodi

200
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
Thank you so much

201
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,071
And thank you so much

202
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,375
You're all wonderful techno

203
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,431
Heroin

204
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,271
Freakishly large

205
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
We would appreciate

206
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:22,079
Probably clamoring to find out what's that Alex

207
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
Does take on.

208
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
Death of Jeffrey up

209
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,943
Steven is an I knew going into

210
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,735
It was probably

211
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,063
He's not going to have a good take on it

212
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,855
Benefit stuff from the week

213
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Exactly what you

214
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,487
Everybody said that this

215
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
Speculation about

216
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,303
Conspiratorial

217
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
Actually make any sense

218
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,983
And it's reasonable to assume that this effect

219
00:10:54,591 --> 00:11:00,735
Number of documents had been released

220
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
Before

221
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,783
His dad

222
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Jeffrey Epstein

223
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:09,951
Please document exonerated

224
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:15,071
Jeffrey Epstein was no longer useful to the cabal and so they killed him

225
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,375
Basically Alex

226
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,423
Position

227
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,007
It's a it's a situation where I I just I don't have the patience

228
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
To get in

229
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,615
Intuit quite frankly not large part of

230
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
When he comes back

231
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
The duty on the 16th

232
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
A

233
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Minor

234
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
Thing for him

235
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
I don't know it's just

236
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,319
It's not it's not

237
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
Particularly compelling

238
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
His take on it

239
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,927
I honestly

240
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Auto Value Inn

241
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
And I was going over it

242
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,815
Which is why I'm not going to go over his little guest appearances on his own show while he was on

243
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,143
Vacation

244
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Stupid

245
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
I'm kind of

246
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
I don't know

247
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,543
The time

248
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
Absolutely

249
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,919
Around to it another and there's more information

250
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
Actually be looked in

251
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
Into down the road I'm willing to

252
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
Explore this topic

253
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,343
But for now the recovery

254
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,623
See that it's barely any

255
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
SUV

256
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,487
Which seems like it should be

257
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
But it's not

258
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
Don't look at me if you look it up

259
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,423
The connection to Trump and the bless you talk about FC

260
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,703
Sing the less you talk about

261
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Trump be in Ankeny

262
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
It's weird

263
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
Journalism

264
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
A little bit

265
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:45,439
Journalism

266
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:13,343
Oh good love that I f****** love that just

267
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:18,719
Again

268
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,279
Coming up holyshit

269
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:27,679
All the truth and import

270
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,239
Give his opinion probably on my court date

271
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:35,359
F*** you

272
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
Yep that's fun

273
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,967
I like that I like that complaint

274
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Literally

275
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,551
Say why you shouldn't do what we are doing

276
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,903
Yeah like I said sure we get things wrong all the time because we were

277
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,719
Journalism used to happen

278
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,791
That is really what

279
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
Look

280
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,631
Normal places it's been a long time on this

281
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,215
We don't really care so where's could speed through

282
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,519
We've not do a good job

283
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,591
But we walk cuz he's not really saying that they do a month

284
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,943
Worth of work in the day or whatever

285
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,247
You saying we don't work that hard or that long

286
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,831
So I Norma's coming in and it's actually not really

287
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
To talk about Ali

288
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,719
It's about another case that Norm might be represented

289
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,143
Ice officer this morning

290
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,007
Regardless of what happened

291
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
Rhode Island

292
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,687
No he pulls up around the corner doesn't see him

293
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
Even told

294
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,423
Attempted murder

295
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,031
Foaming at the mouth

296
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Freaking

297
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:16,223
Screaming Alex would be if a truck almost ran over a second amendment protester

298
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:20,319
Can you f****** imagine

299
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,391
We're not putting

300
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,255
Champion of freedom

301
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
Tyranny

302
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Wood

303
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,351
Died with a state employee

304
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,447
In any way driving a car through a line of protesters

305
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,519
Who were expressing their First Amendment right to free speech

306
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,823
Three congregation prank

307
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,127
Airing of grievances

308
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
This is crazy

309
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:49,759
Charlottesville one of the cops

310
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,807
Accidentally

311
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,695
Rear view window out and accidentally touched one of the Second Amendment

312
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
People

313
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,327
Alex

314
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,655
To shoot on Cops

315
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
Yeah

316
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,263
I I just I mean it's just so indicative of this slide

317
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031
Pizzana

318
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
Pretend

319
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,455
A present

320
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:24,319
A piece of s***

321
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:29,951
He still deserves a day in court as a lawyer

322
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,719
2

323
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
2

324
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:37,887
The representative was wrong for him to whether or not he's represent

325
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,007
It's a great

326
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:49,407
The only real reason that I think

327
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,943
You can have any kind of wiggle room

328
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,991
He hasn't officially taken on the case

329
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,295
According to Alex

330
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Presentation

331
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,367
Search still sort of Schrodinger's

332
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,719
Lawyer

333
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,791
If he was qualified to both work criminal defense

334
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
And

335
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
Ideas

336
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:13,215
Cuz he's representing that guy who may or may not have murdered his wife

337
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:18,335
Like he does do some criminal cases as well

338
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
For the good guys

339
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,223
Always

340
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:29,855
An indication that I might have been a little bit too

341
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,647
Quickly

342
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,439
The piece of s***

343
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,767
Just because he tried to calm Alex down when he was screaming

344
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:45,215
So if we get into what I would describe as the main

345
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,751
Theme of this episode

346
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,799
I August 16th episode

347
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:53,151
What you might expect it's not

348
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,967
About any major world news

349
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
It's about Vivaldi

350
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
The Rites of Spring

351
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,575
Interested in hearing how to take on that

352
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
It is actually

353
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,183
Weirdest

354
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,719
Defending Trump

355
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,511
Positions I've ever heard Alex

356
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,215
Purchasing

357
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
With an X

358
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,663
Dollars of oil

359
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,479
Oh you never want to buy that for a few billion bucks

360
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Greenland

361
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,087
200

362
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,695
Almost

363
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,071
From North

364
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,007
Politicians

365
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,759
Where are you going

366
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
What is this

367
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
Tobiko

368
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,207
What

369
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,255
Tipsy

370
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:22,751
Terrible horrible purchase what the f*** is that

371
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:29,151
What the f*** out episode is he trying to rationalize

372
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:35,551
Trump wanting to buy Greenland

373
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:48,351
The first idea of a president suggested that they might want to buy another country that is completely

374
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:52,703
Bill Clinton or Obama recent George W bush

375
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,775
Suggested by Ireland

376
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:00,127
Do you think Alex would be like

377
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,991
What do I got to do to get Fortune

378
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,807
What do I got to pay

379
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,623
Second the population isn't in the hundreds of thousands

380
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
Closer to 50

381
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:17,535
Greenland is very sparsely populated because a lot of the country is uninhabitable

382
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
Partially because

383
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:22,143
The Greenland ice sheet covers approximately 81% of the island

384
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:26,751
Start a good investment to get it now

385
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,823
Approximately 40% of Greenland is protected land

386
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,359
The Northeast Greenland

387
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
National Park

388
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,687
Largest national park in the world

389
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,479
And the area around

390
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,039
The coast are the only place

391
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
That they can have

392
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,087
Permanent human resume

393
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,159
Outside of the coverages

394
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,463
Explains why they're such a low population

395
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,511
You can only really

396
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,095
But it's important to remember that just because there's a

397
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
The small number of

398
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,703
He doesn't make their connection to the land

399
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,775
Legitimate or any less of a factor when considering whether or not

400
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,383
I'm pretty sure we've

401
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
History books on colonialism

402
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
It works out

403
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Lynx

404
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:14,367
Appealing to a low number of people affected by this sort of decision is really no different than just saying that their feelings don't matter

405
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,440
For their own good

406
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,488
All the other justifications

407
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
Colonialism

408
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
Existed over history

409
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
Oh yeah

410
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,120
About 90% of the population of Greenland are Inuit people

411
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:31,264
Parliamentary government and there have been moves made towards

412
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,336
Complete independence from Denmark for years but they aren't autonomy

413
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,616
In the way that Alex

414
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,384
Suggesting

415
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:42,528
Just about everything that I own

416
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,832
Of jumping from Denmark to the United States

417
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
4

418
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:51,232
Enrichment of the United States

419
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Stalinesque

420
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:52,768
97 /

421
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:59,936
Also what the f*** did the Inuit population by saying they move their 800 years ago but that's okay

422
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:06,336
Three times.

423
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:10,688
Don't you

424
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,368
We've only been here for a fraction of the time that the Inuit have been in Greenland

425
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:22,720
Won't stop screaming every day about how immigrants are coming into

426
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:26,560
Do not think that a full-scale strip mining operation in Greenland would bring it

427
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,888
Does he not care about the address

428
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,168
Basically something like that might

429
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
I'm sure he doesn't

430
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,080
I need to make this point

431
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:44,736
It's hard to hear what I'm saying and not think that he's advocating for a return to colonialism

432
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,808
Pretty much every single thing he built his career on

433
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,880
I don't know if

434
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
He was saying there

435
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,744
Yeah he is

436
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,536
Thinks that if we somehow just

437
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,304
By Green

438
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,096
Will their time from

439
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,168
Groenlandia

440
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,752
So they'll just take a parliamentary vote on whether to sell

441
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,312
Yeah so it's like a housing Administration

442
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:15,712
All getting together and being like well we'll get this I don't know how has it been

443
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:25,440
And then Greenland citizens will then be allowed to vote again on whether or not

444
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,720
Become the 51st state

445
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,512
As though that is in there

446
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:34,144
Yes I assume so

447
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,192
I don't know if he does

448
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:42,848
American about

449
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:48,736
Specifically

450
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,528
Because when you really get what is Ark

451
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,320
Is this

452
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,880
Is even appeal to a little bit there by bringing up Alaska

453
00:23:55,136 --> 00:24:01,280
Buy a bunch of invest

454
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,608
Let's talk a little bit about this purchase

455
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
Just of Alaska

456
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:11,008
Purchase Alaska in 1867

457
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:15,360
Autonomous

458
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,152
It was a piece of the Russian Empire

459
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,688
And we bought it from them

460
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,736
At least partially because they didn't

461
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,320
So do is way too hard to defend from their positions

462
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,112
Even if great natural resources

463
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:30,464
Discovery was so vulnerable to capture that it wasn't worth the effort it would take

464
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
Protective

465
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,560
Completely wiped out the otter populations they were killing

466
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
Prefer

467
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,656
So maintain colonies there's wasn't profitable for them in any way

468
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:43,264
We paid the Russian Empire and then without the people who lived in Alaska

469
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
It was then part of the United

470
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,128
Even when the Russian Empire arrive in

471
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:52,992
There were approximately 100,000 and what happened

472
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
And their auntie

473
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,136
Alaska native peoples are we're not allowed to citizenship until 9

474
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:04,256
1824 mean that they had no right to vote and at the time had no ability to formally on property

475
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,536
Bereavement file claims

476
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,840
Mineral deposit ask you a

477
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
Yeah

478
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,680
Would be something along the lines

479
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,520
Without

480
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,896
For sure

481
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,944
What America is

482
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,736
They were against it

483
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,320
The Bureau of Indian Affairs

484
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,600
Destabilize native life

485
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,648
I made efforts to do away with the indigenous

486
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:36,256
Cultures of the peoples whose like the United States

487
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,792
Concerned for the natives of Alaska

488
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,632
We the People

489
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,960
The US didn't even make Alaska a state until 1950

490
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:49,312
Benign and some progress had been made for the seeding land vaccinated population

491
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:53,152
Absolutely it was not a primary concern when we bought Alaska

492
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,968
My point here is that Alex Jones is a f****** monster

493
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,856
If you were alive in Belgium in the late 1800s Road out that he would have been going around yelling at everybody about how

494
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:05,440
It was a great idea what king Leopold

495
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,512
I get insane what are you saying is is is crazy

496
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,072
Manifest

497
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:17,472
Well I mean it's it's a little bit because he has this f****** nonsensical idea about paying

498
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,616
If you put it in slightly different context

499
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,664
He would scream but there's being bribed

500
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:33,088
Well I'd say we were trying to

501
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,624
Steal the land from Denmark

502
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,720
Right

503
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,496
Dollars

504
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,592
Amalfi's 1000% increasing profit

505
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,408
All the resources the tourism

506
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,200
The development

507
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,992
He's going to be in the Arctic

508
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:08,672
The first thing first

509
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
So I can purchase

510
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
Says because Alex can never used

511
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,400
Pacific's correct

512
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,472
It's going to be very bad

513
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,568
His plan to pay off the people of Greenland

514
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,104
Is f****** stupid

515
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,128
He's suggesting

516
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,944
U.s. government to pay each person in Greenland

517
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,224
220 million dollars

518
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,272
Prophet

519
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,808
And it's a f****** Terrain

520
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:40,160
Leave aside the fact that he thinks of the population is in the hundreds of

521
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,744
Global number of 15 million

522
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:49,632
If you gave that amount to each person in Greenland that would be 840 billion dollars

523
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,680
That is an insane amount of money

524
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,544
Someone advocating for 840 billion dollars

525
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
Greenland

526
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,872
Is not a fiscal conservative I would argue

527
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,664
By any stretch of the imagination

528
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:08,064
Avoid giving Americans 100

529
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
Billionaire

530
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,696
Stimulus

531
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,488
Where's Alex

532
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,768
He's coming from

533
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,792
I might ask

534
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:21,888
Does he realize

535
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,496
Are batshit idea for him to justify the

536
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,288
I was kind of s***

537
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
Physicians East

538
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,360
Pretended to support for the entirety of his career

539
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:36,736
Can you imagine Ron Paul advocating for 840 billion dollars to buy Greenland

540
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,016
Alright

541
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:41,088
Look I know this sounds like a lunatic idea

542
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,672
Just spent 40% of our GDP

543
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:52,608
I have three proposals all foreign aid

544
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,680
Get rid of OSHA

545
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,032
You just got yourself a standing ovation

546
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:04,640
Now that the second matter to consider and that is what he thinks there'll be thousands of percent profit

547
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,968
Now in order for that to be the case you need to see about a tenfold

548
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,088
So now we're talking about bringing like 8 trillion dollars and tourism and resources

549
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:18,208
Play 100 days of owning Greenland

550
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,536
Trillion-dollar bad news about his plan

551
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,864
Currently the GDP of Greenland is 2.7 billion dollars

552
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,400
If the United States were just

553
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:30,496
Steal all of that it would still take us about 3000 years to make 1000

554
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,288
The percent profit on the purchase Alex's

555
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:43,040
Make Moscato purchase profitable required almost unimaginable lengths time or an almost unimaginable level of

556
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,320
Destruction of nature

557
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,856
In pursuit of these resource

558
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,392
Oobi horrible things

559
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,976
To do and there's no reason to destroy every piece of

560
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,000
Protected wildlife

561
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,560
Dude end up with the kind of return on investment Alex ism

562
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:01,216
Colonialist equivalent of John Wall's NBA contract

563
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,056
You don't know John Walsh

564
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,848
The worst contract

565
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,128
Entirely

566
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,016
Pretty close

567
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,368
So like I said I love the idea that

568
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,136
Don't try to use this

569
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
Because I need to make this clear

570
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,232
He's talking about

571
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,768
The idea of perch

572
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,352
He sang everyone

573
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,632
Trump is stupid

574
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,424
For wanting to buy Greenville

575
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,568
What is going to be look at all these other times presidents have bought land

576
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,848
Or whatever

577
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,384
And it was so stupid

578
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,200
The argument hinges on the idea that the

579
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,736
These people bought the lamb

580
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,040
That's import

581
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:50,368
Is okay

582
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,648
The Louisiana Purchase

583
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:58,048
Yes of course

584
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,680
So let's not let him get into the Louisiana Purchase

585
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,968
Colonies by

586
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,648
Dollars

587
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,232
Equivalent of about

588
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,304
Purchase

589
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:34,400
Hundreds of trillions of dollars

590
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,128
That's so like

591
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,920
Strange

592
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:52,576
The president during The Louisiana Purchase

593
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:58,976
Because I do right now

594
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:05,376
Someone who Alex

595
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:10,240
The foundation of a tunnel

596
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:16,640
Joseph Thomas Jefferson what the f***

597
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,968
Whoever was President back then

598
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,736
Jesus

599
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:26,880
What is wrong with this guy

600
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:33,280
Liberty grown without the guarding of firearms

601
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:38,912
From a purely Financial standpoint turn out to be purchased

602
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,472
But other factors make it a bit more of a complicated

603
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
Situation

604
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:48,128
Again we were out buying the land from the people who actually live there

605
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,944
We weren't buying autonomous areas

606
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,648
And everybody knows that

607
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:06,304
The area that was bought in the Louisiana Purchase slaves it was colonized by the French bought it from them there was no consent

608
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,608
Who lived in the area there was no vote about it

609
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:11,936
It was just a negotiation between two colonizing powers

610
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,216
F*** about the

611
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,544
List of the people who lived in the areas they control

612
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:20,640
It doesn't

613
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,968
It's impossible to argue with the purchase wasn't a really good investment

614
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,504
It's for the US

615
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,320
But it also sent into place a lot of

616
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,112
Really long lasting problems

617
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,392
Still resonate to this day

618
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,952
There was the disruption destabilization of

619
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,744
Displacement of native peoples that we enact

620
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,792
There was the ensuing war of

621
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
12

622
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,840
Caused by its artifacts

623
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,936
Obviously

624
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,496
The international response to American expansionism

625
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,776
As well as the British

626
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,800
Support of Native America

627
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,848
With the United

628
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,408
Because the United States was disruptive destabilizing

629
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
Displacing

630
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,712
So those were factors that

631
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,272
Direct result

632
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,808
Of our expense

633
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:01,856
The British wear

634
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,048
So I could be made

635
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,632
Out of this Louisiana Purchase either be free or slave state

636
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,680
Which would disrupt the balance between

637
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:20,544
Compromise of 1820

638
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:26,176
That compromise likely postponed the outbreak of the Civil War but it also gave an air of legitimacy to slavery

639
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:31,040
It also made official that anti-slavery progress was not going to extend

640
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:34,880
Past that barrier remind me

641
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,416
You can't compromise

642
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,208
I'm certain issues you know you

643
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,024
You're compromising with

644
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072
You're really just

645
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:50,752
You allowed to exist

646
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,848
There are a lot of serious factors that go into looking at the history of Louisa

647
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,408
Whether or not we made a lot of money

648
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,712
Unimat kind of simplistic logic

649
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,504
With Alex Feel-Rite

650
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,040
You know

651
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:07,136
Will you be all right with pretty much any kind of Oppression in the name of a good return on

652
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,720
Like let's imagine a super-rich Communists wanted to buy Texas

653
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,256
Have United States cold

654
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,048
Shouldn't he have to be okay with that

655
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,888
I get the super-rich common is paid people so they would vote to sell him Texas

656
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,472
How to never stop screaming but how it was rigged to vote and bribery

657
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,264
That's exactly what he wants.

658
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
In Greenwood

659
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,528
A monster like a monster thing

660
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,808
I just got the

661
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,344
His vision of both of us in a bar

662
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,440
Conversation

663
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
Goodbye

664
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:48,608
So

665
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
So Alex

666
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,912
Forgot that ghost

667
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,448
His next

668
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,240
Example

669
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,008
Access from the max

670
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,056
Know where it got a little while till we get

671
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,384
Is not as good

672
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,408
Have an example of a perch

673
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,528
River Valley Church

674
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,184
The Red River Valley purchase is not something that

675
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,768
We didn't buy the Red River Valley or the Red River basin

676
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,376
18 at the end of the war of

677
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,424
12th and actually the treaty involved

678
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,704
Eating a bunch of land

679
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,264
From the Louisiana Purchase

680
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,848
The Britain since the treaty established the northern border in that area for the

681
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:35,968
Cummins making s*** up here or reading off a hastily compiled list

682
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,248
Territorial expansion

683
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,528
United States history

684
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:42,112
Are there probably one of the interns but together we bought

685
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,952
Concession of land to the British

686
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:52,352
We fought the War of 1812 and at the end of it we had a treaty that negotiated this borderline Ed we lost

687
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,376
Poncho liner

688
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,656
Robert Ely

689
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,472
Losing the Civil War everybody knows this

690
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,264
So

691
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,544
Now we get to another one

692
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,384
I mean again

693
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Very repetitive

694
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,432
But he's wrong about it

695
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:15,904
For $5

696
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,696
Present

697
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,744
President

698
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,096
You tell me

699
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,912
Where he's actually doesn't go

700
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,472
I don't think he does

701
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,776
It was Thomas Jefferson

702
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,200
Doesn't make him a great guy

703
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,784
The Florida purchase only happened because Spain didn't want to spend so much

704
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,648
Job maintaining the colony wanted to make a deal with the United States

705
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,416
Treaty of 80

706
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:53,280
People often misleadingly say that the u.s. paid $5000000 to Spain

707
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,304
A Florida at Alex

708
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,400
$5000000 was part of the Adams Onis

709
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:04,800
Where in the u.s. agree to pay for the legal claims of US citizens against up to the amount of 5 million

710
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,568
Dollars

711
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,872
It was more an issue of accepting bureaucratic

712
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:12,224
Responsibility for claims of the territory if the territory was ceded to the United

713
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,760
You realize this is

714
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:14,784
Sew-ins

715
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,320
Insanely like Howard profession

716
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,344
Call sportsworks

717
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,744
There was no actual payment for Florida

718
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,560
It was a negotiation of the resulting agreement was 1

719
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,840
That was not

720
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,120
Fun fact

721
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
Because what he's talking about

722
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,728
The Florida purchase

723
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,872
Explicitly made the US relinquish all claims had on most of Texas

724
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,664
USA

725
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,968
Steve to his Catholic Majesty that's

726
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:49,344
Renounce forever that all their rights claims of

727
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,368
Pretensions to text

728
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,464
Among other areas that would end up becoming part of the United States somehow I'm not tired

729
00:38:55,488 --> 00:39:01,632
We didn't buy Florida and the agreement that brought Florida into the United States involve language

730
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,912
Alex's Homestay

731
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,728
Again his team is very very sloppy

732
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,776
Any idea what he's talking about

733
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,568
He's only reason to exist

734
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:13,408
In the present day is to justify whatever dumb s*** Trump does

735
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,432
An agitator

736
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
Authoritarian

737
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:15,968
White National

738
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,248
At this is a piece

739
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,528
Yeah absolutely

740
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:21,600
Also mentioned James Monroe was president

741
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,136
19 am.

742
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,928
He wasn't a great guy

743
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,952
It's also

744
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:32,352
Just f****** hilarious that this noted student of History nowhere of all things a reader of 1,000 books

745
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,912
I literally have no idea

746
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,192
President when these great

747
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:39,008
Expansions of the country love song

748
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:41,824
This is embarrassing

749
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:45,664
Read a lot about American history

750
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,736
I guess just it's B pretty he's not equipped

751
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,272
To have the conversation he's trying

752
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:54,112
You have absolutely no

753
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,160
Actually learning

754
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
VA

755
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,328
Haier American Education

756
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,120
Is built around

757
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,424
No one knows out

758
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,192
Utterly in

759
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:08,960
Completely

760
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,496
American hits

761
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,544
. ended

762
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:13,824
To create this

763
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,104
American Myth

764
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
A constant

765
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,968
Push and pull between

766
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,992
Stupid and

767
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,808
Yeah yeah that's a huge

768
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,112
So

769
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:26,880
Purchase

770
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:31,232
Check it off the list that helps us that makes sense rationalize

771
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,560
Turn on Louisiana Purchase

772
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:39,936
Just we have the non-existent Red River Valley Fair

773
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:45,568
These are not great job

774
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:48,896
Here goes now with some more example

775
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,608
How much did we spend

776
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,680
Another

777
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,568
So at this point I'm not sure Alex

778
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:21,152
It sure what he's even arguing anymore

779
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:24,992
Purchase involve the u.s. territory from another colonialist

780
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,576
Force examples of literally nothing to do with the point he started

781
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,880
The Red River Valley purchase isn't a thing

782
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:35,744
Florida purchase wasn't a purchase and the Texas annexation was again not us buying Texas

783
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,816
The territory that's now Texas was colonized by Spain

784
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
It 1821

785
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,400
Steve Austin's father Moses Austin

786
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,680
Was granted permission to

787
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,216
Settlement with a population

788
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,752
300 in Spanish

789
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:53,407
After Moses died Steve kept up his work but the number of American immigrants into Texas did not stop at

790
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,175
300

791
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,711
The Americans

792
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,735
We're in charge

793
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,551
Which quickly gave way to Santa Clara

794
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,095
And finding themselves unable to

795
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
To defend themselves

796
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,423
Texas asked to join the United States in the USA

797
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,191
Cool

798
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,007
Mexico albino an independent country

799
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:22,847
Texas that would mean War

800
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,895
The USA let's do this thing

801
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,455
Does the history books now get to include a little

802
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,991
About the Mexican-American War

803
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,343
6 million Lego

804
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,743
I don't know I mean

805
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,815
To from within Spanish territory

806
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,607
And then toward the cost thousands

807
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,375
Supplies

808
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:50,239
If this is what Alex is using as an example of what to expect from trying to get our hands on Greenland

809
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,007
I think he's making a

810
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,031
Terrible argument

811
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,311
And also by the way

812
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,127
We have plenty of options for 51st state already

813
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:02,527
I know Trump supposedly said something about Greenland and everyone's making fun of him so Alex just needs

814
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,831
The fuel doesn't need to go on the defensive but

815
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,623
Before we start trying to grab up parts

816
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,903
To Denmark maybe we should

817
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,463
Get our own house in order and recognized the statehood of

818
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,487
These territories

819
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
We've got that we've been

820
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,559
Then they would have rice

821
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:21,215
That is a problem

822
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,775
If they did

823
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:28,127
So I was really pissed off that I couldn't

824
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,431
Bottom line

825
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:34,527
Call Don.

826
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:39,903
There's a 300 maximum amount and that's the bottom line I was going to go there

827
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,231
Alex

828
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,023
This is really

829
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,071
Because in this clay College

830
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,095
The Louisiana Purchase

831
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:48,863
He doesn't

832
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,143
In this clip

833
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,167
He actually

834
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,703
Uses the word

835
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
Call vinod

836
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,519
When he's talking about Greenland

837
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,287
But

838
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,079
What he says about Alaska

839
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,103
Is

840
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
F*****'-a

841
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,407
Alright

842
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,319
Government resources in Alaska

843
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,207
2

844
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,191
That's

845
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,799
The position that they're in currently

846
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,103
Idaho

847
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,895
Alex Jones at the stupidest mother

848
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
F***** in the planet

849
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:38,527
His entire current brand is built on being opposed to socialism in any form of welfare

850
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:42,879
He hates the idea of a universal basic income because it

851
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,159
Well guess what

852
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,719
That's exactly what the Alaska Permanent Fund is

853
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:50,559
The Alaska Permanent Fund

854
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:54,143
The oil revenues

855
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:57,727
Hit a very basic said is recognizing to all residents

856
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:02,079
The state are part owners of the natural resources

857
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,383
And they recognize that and pay people for it

858
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,919
Everyone gets a check

859
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:10,271
Just by virtue of that the state is able to raise tons of people out of abject poverty

860
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:14,879
All the social welfare programs to Alex's

861
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,183
Children could be enrolled as soon as they're born

862
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:20,511
Heather dividend checks are placed into an account so by the time they're 18

863
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,791
They could easily have like

864
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,071
$40,000

865
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,887
To put towards college or trade school or whatever they want

866
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,191
The oil company still making same profit

867
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,471
But some of that has to go back to

868
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,519
It's a very singing model

869
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,847
Alex doesn't even seem to be against

870
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,383
Weird

871
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:41,247
What a dumb motherfuker

872
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:43,807
The more you think

873
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,623
Leaving anything

874
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,159
No I think

875
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
You're just

876
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,767
Making bad faith argument in order to smoke

877
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:58,911
And it's almost like the things that they actually complain about not what they care about

878
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,471
Jupiter something without actually

879
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:07,871
Play off quite really

880
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:10,943
In Alaska this is a state-run

881
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,967
And owned program

882
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,503
Right into Alex

883
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,551
B socialism run-amok

884
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:20,671
It should be something that he sees an intrinsically evil and exactly opposite to everything he staying

885
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,975
And yet here you seemingly endorse

886
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,303
Just I guess to say Alex doesn't really hate socialism as much

887
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,863
And here's the real kicker

888
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,167
Studies have shown that the dividend checks

889
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,191
Have had almost

890
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,215
Non-existing

891
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,239
Defect unemployed

892
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,055
Which is to say that given a free check has

893
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,871
That made them just decide to stop working and live off the state

894
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,919
There's some indications that it's increase

895
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,943
Part-time employee

896
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,247
Results of people having

897
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,551
The freedom to work Less hours and not starve

898
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,831
Which societally Speaking

899
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,855
Is it good thing

900
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,135
You remember

901
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,159
1840s

902
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:53,951
Had all those like

903
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:02,655
I mean I don't remember it ever heard of it

904
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,679
Keep going back

905
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,471
And every one of those like what the

906
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:06,751
Future is going to be like so

907
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,519
Scenarios

908
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,543
Everybody is always

909
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,567
Well

910
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,591
We won't

911
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,615
Have to work

912
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,807
Still be able to explore our interest

913
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,575
In a greater way

914
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,855
And now people have

915
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,879
Take a nap in the

916
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,159
Opposite directions

917
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:27,487
You want the future to be

918
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,279
You lazy

919
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,071
Believing

920
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:31,839
The only

921
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
Incentive

922
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,375
To do anything

923
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,399
Is

924
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,679
Financial

925
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,703
Or something along those lines

926
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
Stupid

927
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,495
I get it

928
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,263
What it is

929
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,311
If you don't really believe in

930
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,335
As much as you think

931
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,663
Hi Galaxy human spirit

932
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,711
Everyone getting

933
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,247
Payday basic

934
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,807
Survival

935
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,647
Vigorous an inflamed the human

936
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
Spirit would be

937
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,719
People create so many amazing things

938
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:02,559
Another one

939
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:05,375
Resources in Most states don't share that kind of abundance

940
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,423
It's been seen as a difficult challenge

941
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:10,751
The drain replicate disorder program

942
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,519
Dumb

943
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,639
Successive

944
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,407
Program

945
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,431
Could be enacted

946
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,199
Through taxes

947
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,991
And it would make everyone's life

948
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,271
Substantially better I would like

949
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,551
Something along

950
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,831
These lines be explored

951
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,623
You're not just you know

952
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:30,719
Let's throw it up and see what happened right

953
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,255
System we could put in place

954
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:39,423
Do my advocate for Universal basic

955
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,775
Competition thank you

956
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,847
250

957
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:47,871
Stupid

958
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,639
Stupid

959
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,663
Call Steve

960
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:52,223
Unless there are

961
00:48:54,271 --> 00:49:00,415
I think socialism is out of the program in Alaska and also drop

962
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,207
Papa's going to bring it to Green

963
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,511
Cool but not

964
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,047
To the 48

965
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,327
Not today

966
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,119
The contiguous 48

967
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,167
We just can't be trusted

968
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,007
You can only give it to Alaska Greenland

969
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,799
And I suppose Hawaii the

970
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,567
Because it's also.

971
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:26,015
Examples of purchases

972
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:32,927
Most of the episode

973
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,655
It was a tree

974
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,823
He does get kind

975
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:56,223
Close to that you can't exaggerate

976
00:49:56,479 --> 00:50:02,623
The Oregon country was established as a dual occupied area where the United States and British settlers could freely setup

977
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:08,767
Is mostly there for the fur trade in the local species became more scarce from over

978
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,303
Dentistry took a downturn

979
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:15,423
In that situation in the 1840s the British weren't really all that interested in maintaining their occupation

980
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,447
End of The Oregon Territory

981
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:20,799
Especially considering that the US was super interested in it and there were way more

982
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,335
American stairs in British

983
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,919
The ripples of the Missouri Compromise were being felt

984
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,687
In Aldie

985
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,223
Expansionist territories the United

986
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:35,135
Every new area that was coming under our Sway With subject to the new slave state vs. free state debate

987
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,439
And The Oregon Territory was no different

988
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,463
He always has

989
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:49,215
When I go she ate again for the precise boundaries of what the US would eventually own it in terms of Northern

990
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:54,079
Slavery people wanted more territory

991
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:58,687
Because it was a in the north and if there was more territory it may become Moore's

992
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,223
Which of them penon slaves

993
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,039
The self didn't really want to fight with the British over

994
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,575
Expanding the Northern Battery tonight

995
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:08,671
Because they were aware that exact same Dynamic actually work

996
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,439
Interest

997
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,743
The preserving the power that slave states held

998
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:16,351
Again this is not an instance of the United States purchasing land to expand its territory

999
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:20,447
This as best as I can tell has literally nothing to do with the point Alex

1000
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,727
Just trying to make about Greenland

1001
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,775
Unless the only point you strike

1002
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,823
Make it into colonialism

1003
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,407
And existing population should just be made to submit to and

1004
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:32,479
Assimilate to the culture you're bringing in with your colonization

1005
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,015
This is really discussed

1006
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:40,159
Open stuff to hear coming from the same guy who spends all his time yelling about Muslims and South American refugees coming

1007
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:46,303
. so ready to celebrate the prospect of doing exactly that to someone else because he thinks it's a good investment

1008
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,583
Because do the monster

1009
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,863
His argument about

1010
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,143
Colonize in Greenland

1011
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,167
Clear he's stupid

1012
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:54,495
These examples are not analogous in anyway

1013
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,519
Except

1014
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:58,335
In adding more territory to the United State

1015
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:03,967
That's the only similarity that they have his only

1016
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:08,319
Hey look at all these other times we've had a territory we should add more territory

1017
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,903
Here is my main point

1018
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,975
It doesn't justify the idea that people are making

1019
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:15,999
King fun of trump for

1020
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,791
Which is B buying it

1021
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,607
We're so far away

1022
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,775
And the Archimedes

1023
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,055
Nothing to do with it

1024
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,103
You lost the thread entirely

1025
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,455
I don't know if it's Unique but it is

1026
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:38,783
A very strong dislike overriding manaphy

1027
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,319
You believe in

1028
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,111
That's so many

1029
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,135
Let's go with

1030
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,159
Incredibly

1031
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,695
People have I've just like

1032
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,463
I would

1033
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,743
Die I would

1034
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:51,071
Kill everyone that I've ever met before I allow someone

1035
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:52,607
How to take an inch of my life

1036
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,655
And I will absolutely have

1037
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,447
0 understanding of how

1038
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:58,751
Similar that it would be if I was on the other

1039
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,311
I'm going to take your land

1040
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,359
With no consequences and no in

1041
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,407
And your reacts

1042
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,175
Whatsoever

1043
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:06,943
But if you even come

1044
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,551
That is just how it's so many of these guys

1045
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,575
Without ever

1046
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,415
Similarities

1047
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,487
But

1048
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,775
Arizona

1049
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,591
Again

1050
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,663
So we purchased it right

1051
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,319
He's our purchases

1052
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,623
The purchase that was taken by force you can't buy something

1053
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,207
Cancel station is the max

1054
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,023
High-speed land to the United States

1055
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:58,655
So this isn't part of the purchaser shrewd investment

1056
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,215
As a result of the war

1057
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:05,055
Do u.s. Subs are absorbed a lot of the territory that is now the West in the Southwest

1058
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,615
As part of the treaty Mexicans who decided

1059
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,175
To stay were granted citizenship

1060
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,711
Except we didn't stick

1061
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:16,063
If us almost immediately began snatching Uplander was already owned by Mexican

1062
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:23,487
Estimates put it around 20 million acres of land property in Mexican American

1063
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:26,559
Which absolutely at a massive ripple effect through history

1064
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:29,119
In terms of Capital Property and generational wealth

1065
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,911
But I was interested in that it was a

1066
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:34,239
Great Park California

1067
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:37,311
California

1068
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,247
Really

1069
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,855
He was totally all about the annexation

1070
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,623
Crabiel

1071
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,671
It's very similar

1072
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:55,487
There are similarities

1073
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,839
To be like treaties that ended Wars Order

1074
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:02,399
The treaties that were negotiations last

1075
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,423
Purchases

1076
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,727
And none of them took into account

1077
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,519
People who are living

1078
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:10,079
Already imperialism is a

1079
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,103
An awful terrible

1080
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:15,967
Interesting Lee Alex gets to another actual purse

1081
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:16,991
Okay

1082
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:23,135
Pro-mexico $2000000

1083
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,975
The valley South

1084
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,959
Arizona

1085
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:42,335
Dollars

1086
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,455
Stop

1087
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,735
Again he doesn't know who present

1088
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,783
The record Franklin Pierce

1089
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:51,551
Was president

1090
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:56,671
I know I know he was a one-term guy he was only president when the Nebraska

1091
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:59,231
The Kansas active Pastor really exacerbated relations

1092
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,511
Between slave and free states

1093
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,559
It was an office during The Bleeding Kansas

1094
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,607
Is Border Wars between Kansas and Missouri

1095
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,679
That's really easy to not know much about it Beverly

1096
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:10,239
You know what you've read dozens of books about the Civil War

1097
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:16,639
Stepping out to the claim to read dozens of books about the Civil War should know a lot of this kind of

1098
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,199
But I doubt his books about the

1099
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,991
The Civil War really go into

1100
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,527
Larger

1101
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,295
Economic input

1102
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:29,695
If I like Confederate sympathizers

1103
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,719
Close to

1104
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:33,791
They might just be about how like

1105
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,559
The Southwest

1106
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,607
Jefferson Terrace

1107
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,631
Cool

1108
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,935
So finally we have a

1109
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,263
This laundry list of non purchased

1110
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:46,847
Alex is trying to use to justify these stupid idea of buying Greenland

1111
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,127
First things first

1112
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,663
This has nothing to do with the

1113
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
Send flag

1114
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,735
That was designed by a guy named Christopher Guest

1115
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:56,319
Sit back in the late 1700s where is this purchase is named after the chief

1116
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,111
Negotiator of it James Gad

1117
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,671
JK James Gadson is Pittsburgh

1118
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,719
Grandson

1119
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:04,255
So it kind of doesn't

1120
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:08,607
It was a real piece of s***

1121
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:15,519
President of the South Carolina Railroad

1122
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:18,847
Bro company 1850 advocated for South Carolina

1123
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,127
Secede from the Union

1124
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,175
Because they admitted California as a free

1125
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,223
You see

1126
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:28,063
A social blessing

1127
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:31,647
But of course as we know the choice to see that.

1128
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,463
They definitely didn't put it in the

1129
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,023
216

1130
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:37,791
Secede

1131
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,375
California too far south

1132
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:43,423
Geographically for his taste

1133
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,959
Because it should have been a slave state

1134
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:46,751
Sure

1135
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,639
Carolina

1136
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:54,175
And up go ahead

1137
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,199
Feedback

1138
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:58,783
He decided to his new plans going to betray breakup California

1139
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,087
And make the southern part of Italy

1140
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,367
Giant slave colony

1141
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:09,023
What are the plans for the California slave colony was to use slave labor to build a railroad

1142
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,559
After all that was the business

1143
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:16,703
It 1853 Franklin Pierce sent Gadsden to Mexico to negotiate for more land along the border

1144
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,727
And the reason he was

1145
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,055
Was because we wanted that land in order to build a southern

1146
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,079
Continental Railroad

1147
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,639
Gadsden was successful in his negotiation

1148
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,175
Drip and now the land of the Gods

1149
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,455
Austin purchases 12 large

1150
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,479
Rail hubs in the car

1151
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:34,623
Now I would also be remiss if I didn't tell you the James Gadsden was also involved in the negotiations

1152
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:37,951
Is the u.s. made to remove native tribes from their land

1153
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:41,279
This of course was during the time of Andrew Jackson and the trail of

1154
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:45,119
So you know that this dude was not a very cool guy

1155
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,399
Where do you have

1156
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:53,055
Tried to start a slave colony in a live-in

1157
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,335
Both on your resume

1158
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,383
You really aren't replacing history of the check

1159
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:57,919
Yeah that's

1160
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,455
That's something that only

1161
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,735
And like

1162
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,271
Half of our president

1163
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:07,903
Example of a plot of land

1164
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:11,999
Kind of Follansbee exact same problem is and if the other perch

1165
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:15,839
And that the move was never the will of the people who lived in the land

1166
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,911
I like that the land that was in question

1167
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,215
Also that ten million dollars went to

1168
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:24,543
Anna who Alex knows as the villain of the story of the Alamo

1169
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:28,383
Probably shouldn't be so thrilled that we gave $10 to one of his greatest

1170
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,175
Historical art villains

1171
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,199
His Heroes

1172
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:36,319
Negotiate with a tyrant like Santa Ana

1173
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:43,231
Didn't say nothing about what he's talking about

1174
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,255
Too much about American

1175
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,047
In history you'll hurt your

1176
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:48,863
Just believe what you want to believe about

1177
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:49,887
That's the best way

1178
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:51,935
It's almost

1179
00:59:56,287 --> 01:00:02,431
We got developed a progressive colonialism

1180
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,999
Stop

1181
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:20,607
So if Alex just directly is advocating

1182
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,375
A colonizer

1183
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:30,335
Investments

1184
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:41,855
Huge migraine

1185
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:04,895
Incredibles

1186
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:08,991
Photo of Greenland

1187
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,015
4 something

1188
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,039
Wow

1189
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,575
This is

1190
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,111
Stupid

1191
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,903
Bums me out to hear a grown up

1192
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,511
Although on the other hand I bet

1193
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:24,095
Pompeo is talkin to Boris Johnson about something

1194
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:24,863
Barry Schimmel

1195
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:30,239
Whatever Scotland and Northern Ireland leaves

1196
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:37,407
What if we just bought England but you got to be we used to be your Colony now you can

1197
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,175
Full circle

1198
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,455
Commander Dove Circle

1199
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:42,271
I mean it is it is

1200
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:45,343
Necessarily be within the realm of realistic

1201
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:51,743
In line with the start of conversation

1202
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,047
Box that he's opening

1203
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,887
Suggest

1204
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,423
Any country

1205
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,703
Could just

1206
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,239
Vote to become

1207
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,007
State

1208
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,543
And if we pay them

1209
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,335
I do think you

1210
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,663
Yeah

1211
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:12,991
Middle Eastern

1212
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:13,759
Because you'll be very

1213
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,063
If if

1214
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,599
Just was like

1215
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,903
You know what we want to become a United States

1216
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,951
States

1217
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:22,975
Give us

1218
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:34,495
Everyone suggesting that other states could process

1219
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:38,335
Jamaica

1220
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:51,135
On a very basic level what do you dipping his toe into is expansionism

1221
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,439
It is Empire

1222
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:58,303
It's not good when you have a guy who deeply deeply white supremacist

1223
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:02,399
White identity

1224
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:05,471
And then you add in expansionist

1225
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:11,871
Interested in Empire corollary or historical parallel at

1226
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:16,991
He's advocating for taking over the world yet

1227
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:22,367
Not language you like to see out of that kind of guy

1228
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,671
Have we considered invading poll

1229
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,719
I think it might be a good way

1230
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:28,255
I mean

1231
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,279
Step one

1232
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,559
Creek that Blitz

1233
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:35,935
What kind of get into how this rhetoric is very easily molded wanted

1234
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:36,703
Established

1235
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:39,519
Which I think is important but we have to wait for him

1236
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,287
To play out his

1237
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,311
Is his thoughts

1238
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,191
There you have it

1239
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,215
What

1240
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,495
They're Superior

1241
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,055
The ideas were Superior

1242
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:16,383
Over all of this stuff

1243
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,431
Yeah I mean

1244
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,199
So I mean

1245
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,223
IPic

1246
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,759
I think you get all you need

1247
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,527
From that

1248
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,599
Just can't go that neck

1249
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,367
Next step of being

1250
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,135
Blackwell

1251
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,159
If I ride

1252
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,695
Where is our ideas where's to

1253
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,255
So we get to conquer

1254
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,535
Did that

1255
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,559
Should someone

1256
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,327
Have ideas to

1257
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:36,863
Is now

1258
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,447
Well I mean Ben Alex and probably need

1259
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:42,751
Do a lot more work and trying to refute

1260
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:45,311
The yard ideas

1261
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:50,687
Yeah she feels like they're trying to conquer him

1262
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:57,087
To him yeah

1263
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,791
So Alex Talk cell

1264
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,095
About the people of

1265
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,311
War

1266
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,359
What

1267
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,151
Billion dollars

1268
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:33,951
So you know that is Greenland is just a bunch of shacks

1269
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:37,535
Is wild impressive the 2.7 billion dollars

1270
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:41,887
There's capital city has a population of about 19,000 that's a

1271
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,911
Tanoshi

1272
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:46,239
Your other airports like to call them

1273
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:50,591
Flying Shack

1274
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,687
This rhetoric is f****** insane

1275
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:56,479
This is the language of colonial is

1276
01:05:56,735 --> 01:06:02,367
And because it's coming out of Alex's mouth and speak used to describe people that he wants to pillage resources from

1277
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:05,183
This is the language of white supremacist colonialism

1278
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:09,023
There's no difference between the sentiment that holds up with Alex's saying

1279
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,327
And the notion that the people of Africa was Savage

1280
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,607
Needed to Europeans

1281
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,631
It's coming it's civilized

1282
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:16,447
Oz talking about the people who live in Greenville

1283
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:17,727
The same despain

1284
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:19,519
In discussing his plans for what he wants

1285
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:22,847
To do with their country expect to hear from

1286
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:26,175
From some shill for the colonial powers to do back then

1287
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:31,039
This is Empire ship this is exactly what I would say

1288
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:33,599
Now he is also the chief propaganda

1289
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,135
It's for the East India oil

1290
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,351
Recognize anymore

1291
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,911
But the reality is that at no point is Greenland

1292
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,679
Ever been in

1293
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,703
Interested in being bought

1294
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:53,311
Greenland Market

1295
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,591
Bensalem to f****** country

1296
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,615
Cuz of course there

1297
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,943
The Sydney Morning Herald interview residents of Tesla

1298
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,735
Who were uniformly

1299
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,015
Laughing at Trump

1300
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:06,111
Once it quote I think it's a ridiculous idea I think it sounds stupid

1301
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:12,511
It wasn't just the Democrats or Trump political enemies it was the people that he wanted to buy

1302
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,535
Buck over

1303
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,839
And here's why this conversation is half

1304
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:20,191
This is a means to warm up to the idea of future Adventure

1305
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,215
Colonialism

1306
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:24,543
50 idea with Trump

1307
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:29,151
But I get the very strong sense that Alex wants it

1308
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,431
Your suggestion

1309
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:36,575
He wants he wouldn't be spending so much money

1310
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,599
Actually pursued

1311
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:41,439
He is absolutely unequivocally using the language of colonialism

1312
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:43,999
22c in the world

1313
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,791
Namely that the United States becomes a

1314
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:49,119
He's using dehumanizing and delegitimizing

1315
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,399
Descriptions and imagery to

1316
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:52,703
Describe the people who would be affected by

1317
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,471
The colonization

1318
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,263
Listeners care less about them

1319
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,847
He's describing the wonderful outcomes that would be the result of condoms

1320
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:01,407
He's implying that expanding your country

1321
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:05,503
I'm gaining wealth is absolutely the thing that freedom does

1322
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:09,087
This is a profoundly dangerous development now it's his rhetoric

1323
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:12,159
Up to this point listen to Alex I've never heard anything

1324
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:16,511
And that's probably because we never had a president stupid enough to want to buy green

1325
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,303
But the point is still in Port

1326
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:23,423
Either Alex has been waiting forever for a president to seemingly endorse American expansion

1327
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:29,823
Or he's been so warped by the Trump rise to power that he no longer realizes that his primary brand for his entire career

1328
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:35,711
Has been explicitly opposed to foreign intervention regime-change meddling in Affairs all that other s***

1329
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:39,039
This is so essentially opposed to what he's supposed to stand for

1330
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,063
Did it really worried

1331
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:45,183
Clear I get that he's not saying we should go and invade them right now in Greenland

1332
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,975
But what if the situation is

1333
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,743
Slightly

1334
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,535
What if we needed

1335
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:52,095
Resource that they have and they don't want to sell

1336
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:57,727
Once you've introduced the idea that it's totally great in the positive thing to buy countries to pillage the resources

1337
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,775
How easy is it to escalate that rhetoric

1338
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:00,543
Conquest

1339
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,079
It's very easy

1340
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:05,919
You can even use the preliminary rhetoric that you already done to build your

1341
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:11,807
We tried to bill by this very important thing that we need from them but they want us to go without it

1342
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:14,623
If you really think about it amounts to an act of war against

1343
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,671
We basically have to invade

1344
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:22,047
It's a very dangerous road to walk down and I really really don't like what it implies

1345
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:24,351
About what Alex is now capable of

1346
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,655
Is it seems like a departure

1347
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,959
Well let's say

1348
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,031
Greenland has as resources

1349
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,055
Really really

1350
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,871
Just a couple of years

1351
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:36,895
Prior to this year

1352
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,271
And you know what I found out

1353
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:43,807
The green land cover

1354
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,343
They have

1355
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:50,719
That they're hiding from us all of these these weapons

1356
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,767
And we got to save the people

1357
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,559
Really they're already United States

1358
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:59,423
Either way the yeah

1359
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:02,239
It's it's really not far it's not

1360
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,287
From Preparatory

1361
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:09,151
It's Morse

1362
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,687
During the Iraq

1363
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:16,319
Did the lead up to Iraq

1364
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,599
Exactly

1365
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:19,647
Regime-change

1366
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,927
Change over colonialism

1367
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,951
Is that sometimes

1368
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:22,975
It goes your way and then some

1369
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,511
Sometimes it goes the other direction

1370
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,303
Like with Iran we were like

1371
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,607
And then it all went

1372
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,655
Douche it real quick always goes

1373
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,423
Of course

1374
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:35,007
So f****** stupid and I think

1375
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,543
Like a lot of those other things

1376
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,079
That we found that invalidate

1377
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,103
Pieces of his

1378
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:39,871
Rhetoric

1379
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,919
You know like the now being cool with camps

1380
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,967
4 people Posse Comitatus Act

1381
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:47,807
Got out the window

1382
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:48,831
Pretty bad

1383
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,111
It really damning

1384
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,647
Dostoevsky

1385
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,439
Geopolitical

1386
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,463
Location

1387
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,743
I find one

1388
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:59,071
I find I find that to somehow be worse

1389
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,607
Is it really a fact

1390
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,887
The world

1391
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:04,447
Yeah

1392
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,727
About

1393
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:11,615
Ridiculous military might that the Earth has ever seen

1394
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,663
No that's no good we don't want to know

1395
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:14,431
Imperialist cut

1396
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:19,807
You know whatever

1397
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,831
Cute drawings

1398
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:25,183
Trump wants to buy Greenland

1399
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,975
And Alex has more examples of perch

1400
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,023
Really

1401
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:33,631
There's more purchases

1402
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:38,751
Trump's attorney

1403
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:45,151
47.2

1404
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:55,903
We already talked about Alaska

1405
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:02,047
What airport what the f*** is a island

1406
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,327
Midway Island

1407
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,607
Literally

1408
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,375
I mean

1409
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:06,911
Literally

1410
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:10,751
No one living on it when it was discovered in 1859

1411
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:14,591
It was discovered by a captain who is trying to mine or Birch

1412
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:20,735
Ain't playing the island for the United States which is acceptable because it was unclaimed completely on it

1413
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:26,623
And before anyone gets the wrong idea about this Midway Island currently has a population of about 40

1414
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:28,415
And no economy or government

1415
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:35,583
It was initially used by the commercial Pacific cable company is a stop in a project to lay transatlantic

1416
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,375
Cable lines in the early 1900s

1417
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,655
After that point was a

1418
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,679
Cheapest location for

1419
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:41,471
For the Navy to set up radio towers

1420
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,775
Of course as World War

1421
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:44,799
Crucially important

1422
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:45,567
Refueling

1423
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:47,871
Sunday was halfway between the United States and

1424
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,151
Hence the name

1425
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:49,919
Midway

1426
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:52,735
In the sixties and seventies there were a couple thousand people

1427
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:55,039
Station bear what was the Vietnam War going on

1428
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:59,135
But outside of that there's never been a relevant population permanently living on the island

1429
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:01,439
And nowadays it's a bird refuge

1430
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:07,583
So if you're keeping score this one wasn't ugly to be a 51st state

1431
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:09,887
Whataburger

1432
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:14,751
This was an uninhabited Island was claimed by the United States and no native population

1433
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:19,359
This wasn't a purchase and no one is ever really lived on the island

1434
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:22,943
There's no culture of the two distinct the island it's never had existed

1435
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,735
Accepted as a US base

1436
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:25,759
Unless you're a bird

1437
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:28,319
This is literally nothing in common with Alex's fantasies

1438
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,855
Trump colonize in Greenland

1439
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:33,695
The stupidest a****** in the world these so terrible at making

1440
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,743
This is almost embarrassing to listen to this

1441
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:40,351
And I absolutely wouldn't care at all except for the office of

1442
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:43,423
He is advocating for the return of colonialism

1443
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,727
That is very bad

1444
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,543
So you have to

1445
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,823
Pieces that he's using.

1446
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:50,591
Enforce

1447
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,359
That shift

1448
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,127
Towards that

1449
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:52,895
Mentality

1450
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:55,455
It's important to understand why these are terrible example

1451
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,991
F****** Midway

1452
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,039
The f*** out of here

1453
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,319
So

1454
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,855
Being without

1455
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:03,647
Constant Contact

1456
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,183
Mill

1457
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:05,951
For the past

1458
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,023
Has been

1459
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,071
Very nice

1460
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,351
It really has

1461
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:14,399
But it gives it gave me this

1462
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,423
Perspective Wild

1463
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,191
August

1464
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,215
Papa's going to buy grave

1465
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,799
That I didn't

1466
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,639
Of course he's not going to

1467
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:26,943
Even talking about

1468
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,223
Is pretty f*****

1469
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,271
It's just s*** for the con

1470
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:33,343
What fascinates me about that

1471
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:36,159
Is that if we hadn't brought this subject

1472
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:40,767
Colonial is

1473
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:46,655
81

1474
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,727
Were it not for a b*******

1475
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,007
Content

1476
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:57,407
Yeah and you never you never would have had a reason for it to be something he needs to do cuz he needs to defend Trump and the only way

1477
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,247
Is joy.

1478
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:06,111
So the more Trump does dumbshit the more they reveal exactly what's underneath

1479
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:08,159
That is that has been there the whole time

1480
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:10,207
Yeah I guess that's

1481
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:10,975
You think about folks

1482
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:12,767
Croissant

1483
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:13,535
Less

1484
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,327
Interesting the trumps edx

1485
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,351
It's more interesting

1486
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,119
How Alex

1487
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:17,887
Response to

1488
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:18,911
And how it makes

1489
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,191
The people who love Trump

1490
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,263
Yeah it's it's fascinating because you like

1491
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,567
I would never have even expected

1492
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:26,847
People to really think

1493
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:27,615
Colonialism

1494
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:28,383
Was still okay

1495
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,711
A lot of people

1496
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,039
It's troubling

1497
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:38,111
So here's another example

1498
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,159
That was the worst

1499
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,951
How to purchase

1500
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:52,191
ISO respect some years of his childhood growing up in Hawaii I can tell you firsthand there are still some. Feeling

1501
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:55,519
About the process in which the island nation was brought to the United States

1502
01:15:56,031 --> 01:16:00,127
I love fun memories of my dad taking me out of school early so we could go to the courthouse

1503
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:02,431
Apps for the Big King Kamehameha Day celebration

1504
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:04,479
Legitimately some of my best memories

1505
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:07,039
My time living on the island of Oahu

1506
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,831
Taking apart in Celebration

1507
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:12,671
A culture that was not my own but I was welcomed into the celebration all the same

1508
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,487
That was not the full experience of growing up white

1509
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:20,095
Hawaii there's definitely a good amount of racism thrown my way just because I was

1510
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,375
And that's never great

1511
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,399
But as an adult

1512
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:24,959
I kind of understand it in a little bit of a larger

1513
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:30,591
The early history of the Hawaiian islands is difficult to get into basically because

1514
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,615
All the island

1515
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:32,383
Have their own story

1516
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:37,503
We're completely like a United thing through a lot of history conflict

1517
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,527
Between each other from time

1518
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,295
The time

1519
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,343
Because getting into that is endlessly comp

1520
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:44,415
Placated

1521
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:46,463
I'm going to choose to start our story today in

1522
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,487
22

1523
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:51,583
Is that the owner of the Hawaiian pineapple company

1524
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,631
Come Dole bought the island of Lanai

1525
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:55,935
When I became almost

1526
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:56,959
Entirely a pineapple

1527
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:01,567
We're not allowed to go to Lanai

1528
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,615
Because it was wholly owned by Dole

1529
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:08,991
Imagine

1530
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:13,855
We're Leo accidentally stumbles into a giant marijuana Farm on an island but this would be with

1531
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,671
It wasn't

1532
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:20,767
Closed off to people anymore but it might have been when I was there

1533
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:24,095
Pineapple plantation operation

1534
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,887
Until the time I lived in Honolulu

1535
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:28,447
I was more like Leonardo DiCaprio in Django in

1536
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:34,847
By then the library Plantation with a smaller operation

1537
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,383
Domino's run B El Monte

1538
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:38,431
Does do Landslide Hawaii

1539
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,199
Cheaper labor

1540
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:42,271
The pineapple business in Hawaii was very big

1541
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:46,623
And when I posted the largest such Plantation in the world

1542
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,415
Stole a very powerful position

1543
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:49,183
The island

1544
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:51,999
1795

1545
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:54,815
King Kamehameha was unite has United the islands

1546
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:58,143
Is descendants rule until 1870

1547
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:01,727
Was King Kamehameha

1548
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:05,055
With no air chaos descended on the process of

1549
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:05,823
Determining

1550
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:06,591
Text ruler

1551
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:08,895
When things got a little bit of Western

1552
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,687
The force has stepped in to quell the violence

1553
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:14,271
Ultimately leading to the Ascension of King Tahlequah

1554
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:16,831
Although initially on friendly terms

1555
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,855
Western interest

1556
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,647
In time, cool

1557
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:23,487
Ideas of creating a federation

1558
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,255
In state

1559
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:27,071
Each independent and Sovereign but Cooperative in there in

1560
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:30,143
This was not something that the Western business

1561
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:30,911
Centrist wanted

1562
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:31,679
Happen

1563
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:33,727
Things are all right for their business

1564
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,751
What are interest

1565
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,775
As it was

1566
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:40,639
But if politicians States got together they could ultimately jeopardize their corporate power through export

1567
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,687
Labor union

1568
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:43,711
Yeah yeah

1569
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:49,343
61887 King literally forced at gunpoint

1570
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:52,927
Substitution for wife that was written by the White

1571
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:56,255
Disenfranchised native population

1572
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,791
And make it easier for their businesses

1573
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:02,911
It's remembered by its appropriate name

1574
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:03,935
The bayonet

1575
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:09,823
The Constitution were members of a group called the Hawaiian

1576
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:12,639
Which is comprised of sugar and pineapple business

1577
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:13,919
Missionaries

1578
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:14,687
And lawyers

1579
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:17,503
This was legitimately a white secret society

1580
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,783
The angel overthrowing the

1581
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:19,551
Kingdom of Hawaii

1582
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:21,343
The gay. Getting to us

1583
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:22,367
XP Island

1584
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:26,975
They are controlled by joining up with a local militia called the Honolulu rifle

1585
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:30,815
Who are literally the one pointing the gun during the signing of the bayonet

1586
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,631
The new constitution took much of

1587
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:36,447
Power away from the Monarch and gave that power to the

1588
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:40,287
Generally democratization what it's not forced at gunpoint

1589
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,055
Is it good

1590
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,079
But discounts

1591
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,615
Tucson also specified

1592
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:45,407
Put in place new

1593
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:49,503
They were disenfranchised most of the native population of the island

1594
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:54,879
Leaving only the white settlers and business owners as the ones who could elect the members of the

1595
01:19:55,903 --> 01:20:00,511
To get elected even one had to quote on real estate within the kingdom of clearvalue

1596
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:03,839
Calicos

1597
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,375
Some fleeing the country

1598
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,911
And under

1599
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,959
Feelings that they were going to be killed

1600
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,311
Possibly

1601
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:17,152
The cabinet was then replaced by members of the Hawaii

1602
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,200
This was not democratization

1603
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,224
This was a coup

1604
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,760
Hello Georgia

1605
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:24,064
Died

1606
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:25,088
Brian Kemp

1607
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,368
Oh yeah

1608
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:31,744
Calico died in 1891 and was succeeded by his sister Queen liliuokalani

1609
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:35,072
Who is recognized as the last monarch of Hawaii

1610
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:37,120
Weed delivery

1611
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,424
The throne she made it clear that was her intention

1612
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,448
Restore power to

1613
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,216
To the monarchy

1614
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:43,008
Specifically targeting the business center

1615
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:44,800
The original

1616
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:50,688
That scared the s*** out of the business owners and members

1617
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,968
Came to the committee of safety

1618
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:55,808
The gold the gold the actions of the white settlers up to

1619
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,088
Compass Pointe at always been

1620
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:59,136
Name to the annexation of Hawaii

1621
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,672
I really wanted the United

1622
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:02,208
To take over one

1623
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,256
Most of the momentum

1624
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,536
Suppressed people whenever

1625
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:06,560
Holy

1626
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,912
Most of the momentum was coming from Americans wanted to take the island

1627
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:14,496
But they also use the fear that if the British

1628
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,288
Would rally politicians

1629
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,056
To their side

1630
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:19,104
Nationalism being used in a

1631
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:19,872
Negative

1632
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:20,640
I don't know

1633
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:24,480
Ability to achieve their goals

1634
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,552
Liliuokalani was clear in her position

1635
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:31,136
Members of the committee for safety

1636
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:33,440
Knew that they have to actually overthrow the queen

1637
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:36,256
Which is what they paved the way to do

1638
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:40,096
In order to help pave the way for the United States to have no reason

1639
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:45,728
On January 14th night 1893 Queen liliuokalani

1640
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:48,288
Indicating her intention to invalidate

1641
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:50,848
She made clear she would not

1642
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,640
Speak to quote deprive one white man

1643
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,920
And of any legitimate right

1644
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:56,992
But you quite accurately also pointed out that quote

1645
01:21:57,248 --> 01:22:00,576
Any newly arrived white man without interest or intention of residue

1646
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:02,368
This place does a voter above the heads

1647
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:03,648
The thousands of my subject

1648
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,976
God given these islands and no other

1649
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:09,792
She presented cabinet ministers with the new Khan

1650
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,328
Constitution that you wanted to Annex

1651
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,608
Which I refuse to sign

1652
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:14,144
Before fleeing the government building

1653
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,680
Afraid of crowds

1654
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,448
Good gather.

1655
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,216
Support the queen

1656
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,544
The committee of safety held a meeting on January 16th

1657
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,848
Where they decided to frame they're coming action

1658
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:23,872
Purely amines

1659
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:25,408
To protect the lives and property

1660
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,432
Of white citizen

1661
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:29,504
Noble reason for their clearance

1662
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,272
Conspiracy

1663
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:36,928
The reasons for the situation like this was because they knew that the US military would not openly support their efforts to overthrow the queen

1664
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,976
But they would intervene.

1665
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,000
Text US citizen

1666
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:45,632
If you lose it was created what they were like that's what they were needed for you could get the military into play

1667
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,192
Charles Burnett Wilson

1668
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:52,288
The Marshal of the Kingdom

1669
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,312
For the members of the committee

1670
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,360
Government

1671
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:57,920
But because they were all well-placed businesspeople with K'NEX

1672
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:58,944
10 to the legislature

1673
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,224
The requests were denied

1674
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:02,528
What is closed at the time with

1675
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,320
I don't think they're really

1676
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:09,952
Interested in safety at all guys I think this hold of this no more

1677
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:13,536
There was trouble Brewing Wilson started Gathering opossum

1678
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,304
Protect

1679
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,328
Queen but it was

1680
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:18,656
The committee abused their narrative to bring the US military into

1681
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:20,960
City of the Defenders of the throne no match for

1682
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:21,728
For the forces behind

1683
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:22,496
Baku

1684
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:24,800
Lily okalani surrendered

1685
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,080
Conspirators took over the government

1686
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:26,848
Installing

1687
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:27,872
You guessed it

1688
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,664
Stanford ol as the Press

1689
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:31,200
Who is the cousin

1690
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:37,856
Plantation

1691
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,904
Intertwine

1692
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,952
Political business cards

1693
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,000
It's a good thing that America

1694
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,024
Grew out of all

1695
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:46,304
Now where the champions

1696
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,328
The Democracy abroad

1697
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:51,680
Freedom free number.

1698
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:52,960
These groups

1699
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:54,752
Or at least was a like a big

1700
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:56,032
Agitator in

1701
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:56,800
These groups

1702
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:59,616
His brother

1703
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,384
Owned

1704
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:03,968
Plantation impresario

1705
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:09,856
With adult

1706
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:12,416
Uncharged is time for the us to come in Annex

1707
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:13,696
Unfortunately

1708
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,976
Play Grover Cleveland

1709
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:17,280
Set the timer.

1710
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,048
S***

1711
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:21,632
Cleveland actually advocated for Lily Alcala needs to be restored as Queen

1712
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,936
So he was of no help to these plotters

1713
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:30,336
Hey guys real quick I'm going to try and do the whole America believe the b******* that we say about ourselves

1714
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:33,152
Real quick so business owners I'm sorry I'm not

1715
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:34,176
Get your back on this

1716
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,736
Please make sure that my terms Arkansas

1717
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,784
All their coup work

1718
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:39,552
Seem to be four

1719
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,904
Not one to be discouraged old declared Hawaii an independent republic

1720
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,976
Waited a few years until McKinley came to office who agreed

1721
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:50,560
And that Jordan is Hawaii came to be part of the United

1722
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:52,864
It was a sneaky brutal series

1723
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,424
The plots carried out by white settlers a business interest

1724
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,496
For the express purpose of disenfranchised in the native population

1725
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:00,032
So their business could process

1726
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,872
A gorgeous and Rich history and culture subjugated to the interest

1727
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:04,640
The higher profit

1728
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,176
An increased sugar

1729
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,456
Exports

1730
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,736
God Bless America

1731
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:09,504
Before everybody

1732
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:12,832
It's pretty much exactly what Alex wants for the Inuit people

1733
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:17,952
On the one hand I didn't enjoy the kids at my elementary school would call me haole

1734
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:19,232
Why was that

1735
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:20,000
Hawaii

1736
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:22,816
History a little bit better it kind of makes

1737
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,912
King Kamehameha Queen liliuokalani

1738
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:27,936
I take this opportunity

1739
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:29,216
Alex Jones

1740
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,496
Your goddamn house

1741
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,288
You f****** a******

1742
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:35,360
Go swim with the humuhumunukunukuapua'a

1743
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:39,968
And I wish you a merry Kalikimaka

1744
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:40,992
I come close to trying to

1745
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:46,112
The state fish

1746
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:48,416
Kalikimaka

1747
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:49,696
Merry Christmas

1748
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:51,744
Cuz there are song

1749
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,792
Those are about all the

1750
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,216
You know that one

1751
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,496
It was a little bit

1752
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,288
Boras a terrible exam

1753
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:05,568
Alex

1754
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:07,616
Just because of how explicit it is

1755
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,920
And how would I can own the history

1756
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:11,456
Like it's not something

1757
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:13,248
Like eating legit conspiracy

1758
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:17,856
Read out to overthrow the monarchy

1759
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:20,416
For the explicit purpose of helping with the

1760
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,696
Sugar

1761
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:22,720
Plantation

1762
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,768
The pineapple plantation

1763
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:25,536
The missionaries

1764
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:26,560
It was

1765
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:27,840
It was a coup

1766
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:32,448
It's something that Alex should not be in favor of it as a great example

1767
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:34,240
Of American expansion

1768
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,568
The coup already occurred

1769
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,384
2016 election

1770
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,664
Like

1771
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:45,248
Why didn't

1772
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,832
Is because of voter suppression

1773
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:52,160
Control over who was allowed to vote

1774
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:58,560
Because of voter suppression because we were electoral college system

1775
01:26:59,072 --> 01:26:59,840
Stupid

1776
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,120
Buhl election

1777
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,656
Why did George Bush

1778
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,960
Steal election

1779
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:14,944
Purchase a bunch of atoms

1780
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:21,856
Terrible idea about getting that was a terrible idea cuz we bought them

1781
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:22,624
From Spain

1782
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:27,488
Is not true at all

1783
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:37,984
We didn't buy them after the Spanish-American War

1784
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:41,568
On the island

1785
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:48,224
Does naturally year-long philippine-american War

1786
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:51,296
Just because we were the one calling

1787
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:52,576
You're really

1788
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:57,952
Certainly not I really would like to hear more positive

1789
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:03,584
White people brought up examples

1790
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,608
Horrible time

1791
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:08,704
10000 Filipino soldiers as well as civilians were killed in that contest

1792
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:13,568
The list of war crimes committed by US forces in that war is a very long one

1793
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:17,408
I don't want to get into it but it definitely did not include killing entire villages

1794
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,176
The people

1795
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:23,552
Whatever the case the war resolved that the u.s. put in a transitional government that would give way to the Philippines

1796
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:26,880
The country which was achieved in 1935

1797
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:31,744
This lasted a few years until they were occupied by Japan in World War II

1798
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,512
Exile

1799
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:34,816
After that the country went on to become

1800
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:40,192
Then of course came the rise of the brutal dictator Ferdinand Marcos

1801
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,216
Excuse me

1802
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:44,544
I meant to say brutal us back dictator Ferdinand Marcos

1803
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,568
Excuse me

1804
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:49,920
I meant to say brutal usbank dictator and Rodger Stone client Ferdinand Marcos

1805
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:54,784
Marco's world the country for 21 years and terrorizes people and stole a shitload of money

1806
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:57,344
Alex is citing the Philippines

1807
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,416
Citing it as some kind of example of positive u.s. involvement in

1808
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:03,744
Zero idea what he's talking about

1809
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,512
Or

1810
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:07,328
Super into people like Ferdinand Marcos

1811
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,864
And honestly these days

1812
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:19,104
For the exam

1813
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:25,248
They took the princess to the end of this list and I mean like I don't think he's made any cogent

1814
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:27,552
But here in terms of why it's not dumb.

1815
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:28,832
Chester Jeff to buy green

1816
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:30,624
Most points purchase

1817
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,416
Most of them were

1818
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:33,440
Brutal

1819
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,464
Exploitation

1820
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,232
Native people

1821
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,560
They did

1822
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:43,168
They were profitable I don't disagree with that angle

1823
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:45,728
To determine whether or not this was a good thing that happened

1824
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:47,264
You are going to justify any

1825
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:48,288
Let's

1826
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:50,080
Not even get into

1827
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,360
For whom were they

1828
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:55,200
Say okay so you say

1829
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,224
Just was profitable

1830
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,832
Definitely wasn't profitable for the people who are already living

1831
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:05,952
And frankly it's not even that proper profitable

1832
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:09,024
Is profitable for the giant people

1833
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:09,792
Owners who

1834
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:18,496
So am I when I started to cover like Friday Sunday Monday

1835
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:21,312
Event in Olathe

1836
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:24,128
It was like

1837
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,432
What's so crazy

1838
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:37,952
Just because his hero said something

1839
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:41,280
Just a defense that he has to go all the way

1840
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,072
To advocating for colonialism

1841
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:45,376
For the United States

1842
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:46,912
In a in a terrifying

1843
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:50,240
Can we get to just

1844
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,008
Some dumb

1845
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:52,544
Defending Trump but other stuff

1846
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:54,336
Is really stoop

1847
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:06,112
He said the Trump supporters are like

1848
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:11,232
Lowered the flags half-staff

1849
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,256
Kyle

1850
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,024
Hitler

1851
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:28,896
Prisoners

1852
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,296
Really

1853
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:43,744
Small group of prisoners believe that I like

1854
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,840
That's me nicely does protest too much

1855
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:50,400
Justin Smoak prisoners Alex

1856
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,424
Right

1857
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:55,520
I could get into the numerous times that

1858
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:58,592
Aztecs

1859
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:02,688
It's about 1488

1860
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:04,736
Leave that alone for now

1861
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:06,528
Was good

1862
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,624
It's made by Franco

1863
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,440
11th Hour

1864
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:18,816
This dude the former counterintelligence guy for the FBI and he spend time researching

1865
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,352
I'm studying extremist groups

1866
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:26,240
He pointed out that lowering the flags

1867
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:29,824
The flag on 8th

1868
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,664
That would be interpreted as he

1869
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:36,992
What's deliberate

1870
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:41,600
What was the extremist community on the right currently it's stuck

1871
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:44,672
It's something like this will likely be seeing is some indication of

1872
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,440
Tacit support

1873
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:48,000
The Loren was meant to

1874
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:50,048
About the El Paso

1875
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,096
Which were on August 3rd and 4th

1876
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:52,864
Respectively

1877
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,704
Essentially was that it would have been a wiser or safer PR move

1878
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:58,752
If the flags would have been chosen

1879
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:00,800
To be raised on any other day

1880
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:02,080
Since it wasn't a

1881
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:04,384
It wasn't a speed

1882
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:08,480
It wasn't like we got it

1883
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:13,344
If they understood the white supremacist movement

1884
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,392
Country

1885
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:17,696
Someone would have advised him against doing it on

1886
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:23,072
Really the main criticism seems to be the drop his people seemed unaware the reality of extreme

1887
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,096
Miss movements in the country

1888
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:27,680
It doesn't seem to be criticism that Trump is racist or not senior anything

1889
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:29,984
Like that's just that he's not getting good advice

1890
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,520
They could possibly avoid

1891
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,544
Sending the wrong message

1892
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:38,688
The former deputy director of the FBI is on TV calling Trump supporters

1893
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:40,224
I feel like you wouldn't

1894
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,016
Make that kind of misleadingly

1895
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,088
Generally unless

1896
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:46,112
There's a part of you that was

1897
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,648
Was worried about people rightly

1898
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:48,416
We calling you and I

1899
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:53,280
This is Adolf protest too much thing

1900
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,816
Defensive to fat

1901
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:57,120
That's when you know what you're

1902
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:57,888
Actually afraid

1903
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:03,520
What year was the idea that any criticism of you is your race or not

1904
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:05,568
Because you know eventually valid criticism

1905
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:08,384
Are you being a racist

1906
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:12,224
Preemptively

1907
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,552
You revealed that

1908
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:17,088
You're just to open

1909
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:19,904
Does a big part of Alex

1910
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:22,976
So Alex

1911
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:25,280
Has this is a little bit of an ad

1912
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:28,864
Do you have and you'll see how he's trying to raise my

1913
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,544
Because of you

1914
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:47,040
Democratic Party

1915
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:50,880
Because

1916
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,160
Coming up games

1917
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:54,208
The Democratic party hasn't done

1918
01:34:58,304 --> 01:34:58,816
Parents

1919
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:01,120
Suggest that

1920
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:03,680
Actually more lawsuits is a very bad

1921
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:04,704
Alex

1922
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,264
Because these parents would be filed a lawsuit

1923
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,824
If it looked like the other ones were going to fail

1924
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,872
The only reason

1925
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:16,992
Add more lawsuits is like

1926
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:20,320
Yep terrible sign Pharrell

1927
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:22,624
Of course that's what he would use trying

1928
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:28,256
I got bored

1929
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:33,632
And that's why we got Norm pattis onto actually directly ask you for the money that I'm going to

1930
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:38,240
I want to let people know that

1931
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:43,616
Try to drive over people

1932
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:44,896
Subway

1933
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:46,688
Yay

1934
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,480
On the show

1935
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:52,064
Norm was on earlier but his

1936
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,344
Is so boring

1937
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:05,632
Broadcasting worldwide thank you so much

1938
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:19,456
The sky is blue

1939
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:30,720
Among which are political bias

1940
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:33,024
Search results for specific websites

1941
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:36,096
Google CEO Sundar pichai

1942
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:37,632
And other questionable

1943
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,216
This size

1944
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:43,264
So we got this guy

1945
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:44,544
Great Coppola

1946
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:48,384
Future

1947
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:51,712
I heard Alex was going to have this dude

1948
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:52,992
Come on

1949
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:56,320
Jack talk about Google is trying to crush conservatism

1950
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:58,112
I was let out an exasperated

1951
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:58,880
B i

1952
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:02,464
I'm so tired of these Comcast M2 journalism from James O'Keefe

1953
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,744
I just can't stand him

1954
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,792
They're all equally bad and

1955
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:06,560
Exhausting

1956
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:08,608
Exhausting to get into

1957
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:09,632
Yeah that's what he's

1958
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,656
That's what he's doing

1959
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:12,192
Yeah the more times you have to

1960
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:12,960
Suspend react

1961
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:15,520
Doing something

1962
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:17,056
Right

1963
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:23,968
I decided instead of even caring but Alex's interview with this guy I was going to watch the project

1964
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:26,016
Guys claiming to be whistleblower

1965
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:29,856
Namely that Google is trying to election metal by silencing

1966
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:30,624
Conservative

1967
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:34,976
I legitimately had to turn off the video long before it's done because this guy is saying

1968
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:36,000
F****** nothing

1969
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:41,376
He says that the way Google is censoring conservative

1970
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:45,216
A small number of sources for their news category

1971
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:46,496
News results

1972
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:49,312
Services are quote

1973
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:50,848
Vitriolically against

1974
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:54,688
President Trump which I considered be interference in the American election

1975
01:37:55,456 --> 01:38:00,320
I decided to put this to the test by just Google and Donald Trump putting on the news Tab and seeing what comes up

1976
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:01,600
The second result was

1977
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:02,368
Fox News

1978
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:03,648
The 3rd results

1979
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:10,048
News from USA Today headlines

1980
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,072
New haircut

1981
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:15,680
A little further down the results just so you know I am rooting now for climate change

1982
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:24,128
A little further down the results from the National Review the outlet founded

1983
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:29,760
There's another article from Fox News Heather McDonald

1984
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:32,576
Israel's are obsessed with quote white privilege

1985
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:38,976
And another one there's another Fox News article declares Trump is greatest president of the century

1986
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:46,400
Okay Publications that are included in Google's news

1987
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,448
Footwear news

1988
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,984
Sporting News

1989
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:53,056
WebMD

1990
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:54,080
And of course

1991
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:54,848
Fish stripes

1992
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:58,176
The only podcast to know about if you're saying

1993
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:58,944
Miami

1994
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:03,040
All of these sites and tons of others show up in Google's news

1995
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:06,368
So I kind of suspected this guy just might be talking s***

1996
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:10,208
If people like James O'Keefe really want to listen whether or not what you saying

1997
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:13,024
I'm really not comfortable with this

1998
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:13,792
Is pro Marlin

1999
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:20,704
Comfortable with no I do not endorse this

2000
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,984
Dubai every Marlins

2001
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:24,288
Maybe

2002
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:28,128
But their podcast shows up in the news section of Google

2003
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:34,528
Great the second thing is that this dude says that 20% of all searches for Donald Trump go to an article from CNN

2004
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:39,392
Jordan results do you think I found in the first page of Google News by searching

2005
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,160
For Donald Trump

2006
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:42,464
First page

2007
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,256
15 results 7

2008
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,536
700

2009
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:46,816
Zero-zero-zero

2010
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:51,168
There were two results from Fox News on the first page though so I do two stories

2011
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:54,752
2 out of 7

2012
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:55,520
Is more than 20

2013
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:56,800
Nothing like the

2014
01:39:57,312 --> 01:40:00,896
2 out of 10 stories on the second page were about about Trump

2015
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:01,664
I'm from Seattle

2016
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,504
If it weren't for the first page because now we're up to

2017
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,784
2 out of 17

2018
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:11,392
After that point there about two stories for page

2019
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:13,440
MCI

2020
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,208
Nefarious

2021
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:18,560
I looking through the search results

2022
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:20,608
And where they come from

2023
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:22,912
The places to put out a lot of material

2024
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,984
Simple pop-up most frequent

2025
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:28,800
Fox News Politico Washington Post

2026
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:31,872
CNN De Pere orders the hill Guardian

2027
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:33,152
USA Today

2028
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:35,456
Some of the other folks sprinkled in

2029
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:38,784
A rolling stone article National Review article

2030
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,320
I don't really see much that

2031
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,160
Quite honestly without what I would call proof

2032
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:48,512
I think it's perfectly reasonable assessment for why there's a whole lot more content

2033
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:49,536
Be naked about Trump

2034
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:51,072
Is that he's doing a lot of naked

2035
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:57,472
No one would write a story about it being an idiot for wanting to buy Greenland if he hadn't said he wanted to buy Greenland

2036
01:40:57,984 --> 01:41:01,056
There wouldn't be stories about him getting into a petty fight with the mooch

2037
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:03,616
If you hadn't gotten into a petty fight with the boots

2038
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:06,944
Asking for the media to cover negative things that Trump doesn't

2039
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:07,968
Positive way order

2040
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:09,248
Crying that they don't

2041
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,320
You're mad.

2042
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:13,856
The Press isn't controlled arm

2043
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:14,624
The states

2044
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,928
And I don't really have a lot of time for that thank you

2045
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:23,584
Right as you're demanding positive coverage of things that are

2046
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,864
Pretty good

2047
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:30,752
I don't like what do you want

2048
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:37,920
Is great

2049
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:42,016
I wrote your CNN article next

2050
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:47,648
Give me another headline I really I really didn't see anything worthwhile in this guy's comment

2051
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:50,464
Couch and all of his answers questions

2052
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:54,816
Instead of saying that there was bias

2053
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:56,096
You think he believes

2054
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:59,168
He seems actually resistant to saying anything

2055
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:01,472
It's something that people could nail down

2056
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:07,104
There's also one point where we actually know what Google is doing

2057
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:09,664
Aubrey says but what they do do

2058
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:13,504
Have any smarts at the camera almost cracking himself up cuz you said doo doo

2059
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,040
Which is photography

2060
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:18,368
This is not something I'm going to take

2061
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:24,512
Help me not take him too seriously when I don't have a Smoking Gun

2062
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,560
Putting away too strong

2063
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:29,120
You don't have anything except Notions

2064
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:35,776
O'Keefe basically got a guy who works at Google to say other than my own thoughts but I think all of your

2065
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,824
Panda is totally right

2066
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:40,384
It's possible that this guy is pranking

2067
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:45,760
He seems really Squirrely and constantly do it looks to the camera and smiling like he's Jimmy Fallon

2068
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:49,600
Trying to keep it together in an SNL sketch

2069
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:54,720
Hey I don't know if there's a there's a weird vibe he's giving off but that just could be like social

2070
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:58,048
Ability

2071
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,584
It's probably not

2072
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:03,424
The other possibility which is way more like

2073
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:10,336
Is it this guy is just a right-wing weirdo who believes all the propaganda put out by the extreme right-wing media like Alex

2074
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,872
Project Veritas and Tucker Carlson

2075
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:15,200
Witcher 3 places I've seen him pop-up for interviews

2076
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:16,736
Some of my reason

2077
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:24,672
He seems to think they shouldn't because Trump is called a quote very fake news

2078
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,720
He also suggested

2079
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:29,792
It would take to skew the results

2080
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:32,096
If you people working in a secret project

2081
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:37,728
But he doesn't anyway indicate that he's aware that such a project exist just speculating talkingshit

2082
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:40,544
In the same way that Alex does and all this other right-wing

2083
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:48,224
He says quote I think the way that Google works the way the Democrats work their way out with their allies work in the meat

2084
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:51,040
They don't really want a lot of question

2085
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:54,624
There's want to call people names and get them to tow a certain kind of lying

2086
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,416
Man it sounds like I've heard almost that

2087
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:57,440
Word for word for

2088
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:58,976
From other places where you might have

2089
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,768
I heard that front brake

2090
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:04,864
The way there

2091
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:09,472
And he says that immediately after saying that at work at Google on a day-to-day basis

2092
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:13,056
But everyone knew that you like Trump and no one cared said nobody's responding to

2093
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:19,968
The guy isn't it up is that this is yet another project

2094
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:22,784
These tech companies absolutely do need to be address

2095
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,064
Bastard series problems

2096
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,344
The need to be taken care of

2097
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:29,184
But I know these guys well enough to know that I cannot find common cause with

2098
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:32,256
They're superficial agreement with what I would

2099
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:34,048
Position I would have

2100
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:37,120
About what the problem is

2101
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:38,656
Describe the problem

2102
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:41,472
That covers up a massive disagreement underneath

2103
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:43,008
About why we thinks

2104
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,032
Another problem

2105
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,056
So f*** all this

2106
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:48,896
It bothers me

2107
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:51,456
Because either they know exactly how carts

2108
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:54,016
They're being because literally what they're doing

2109
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:57,856
You saying okay we need content that says what we wanted to say

2110
01:44:58,880 --> 01:44:59,648
Can't get that con

2111
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,952
So we'll make some content and just

2112
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:02,720
Say it

2113
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:06,560
Cartoonishly

2114
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:09,376
That's cartoonish manipulations

2115
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:10,912
To work

2116
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,848
Yep

2117
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,128
Planet episode

2118
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:22,688
And somehow people are not realizing that

2119
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:25,248
The bad guy is a guy who looks like a giant rat

2120
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:27,808
Yeah that guy seems like he's got the

2121
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:29,088
Good ideas about the entire

2122
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,416
Yeah it's weird it is it is weird when you

2123
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:34,976
Step back and look at it through wider prison

2124
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,792
So I said I wasn't going to

2125
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:39,072
Recover it all

2126
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:40,352
This guy's interview with Alex

2127
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:43,936
Because I really felt like the chances are this is

2128
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:47,008
This guy just has a bunch of paranoid Notions about elaborate

2129
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:49,824
Conspiracies a probably got them from Alex to begin

2130
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:55,712
Alex Alex can say I was right all along

2131
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:56,480
Is the feedback when

2132
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:02,112
Interview I watch the project Veritas videos

2133
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,184
Actually goes a little bit off the rails

2134
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,976
Miami Marlins

2135
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:08,000
No

2136
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:11,584
Will cover it

2137
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:18,496
Alex is talking to this

2138
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:20,032
Because they don't have enough followers

2139
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:26,432
Nothing I mean I got 9,000 followers in the first two hours and I haven't had any more

2140
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:29,760
Even after I went on Tucker

2141
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:33,088
Even after the President Trump retweeted me

2142
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:34,880
I think they're getting

2143
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:39,744
We don't have transparency so it's kind of

2144
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:46,144
Hours

2145
01:46:54,848 --> 01:47:00,992
I don't believe that for a second baby those 9000 10010 ar-ab out the market that is interested in following

2146
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:01,760
Twitter

2147
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,552
Like maybe

2148
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:05,344
There's a lot of like

2149
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:10,720
Older people who read the watch Fox News Tucker Carlson on Twitter

2150
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:12,768
Maybe the people who are

2151
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:14,560
Yep there's there's plenty of

2152
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:15,840
Maybe the

2153
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:17,120
Cubot Networks

2154
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:19,424
That over-inflate a lot of people

2155
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,216
Pre-workout

2156
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:23,776
For workouts maybe they have

2157
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:24,800
Picked up on you

2158
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,360
Plenty of reasons

2159
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:31,712
Buy like followers for you. A project

2160
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:33,760
It has like maybe two thousand likes

2161
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:36,320
The project Veritas

2162
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:39,904
Okay so your video got 2,000 likes from the main

2163
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:42,976
Account is it put it out you ended up with 9000

2164
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:44,768
Unfollowers Matt that seems

2165
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,560
Like normal

2166
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:47,328
Metric

2167
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:51,936
They're being blocked

2168
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:53,728
I do like that ability

2169
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:54,496
To blame

2170
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:55,520
Any amount of

2171
01:47:56,288 --> 01:47:58,080
Success or lack thereof on

2172
01:47:58,848 --> 01:47:59,360
Secret

2173
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:00,128
Conspiracies

2174
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:03,456
Eddie's really really comforting like

2175
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,248
Could just stay at my,

2176
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:07,040
The reason that I'm not on

2177
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:09,088
TV is because a large group of people

2178
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:09,856
I've been depressed

2179
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:18,048
Yeah that's true you do your lotto Drive

2180
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:20,352
Very appealing

2181
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:22,656
Mindset to have

2182
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:27,008
Long. Of time where no one was listening to our show

2183
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:30,336
We didn't come to that sort of rationale for why

2184
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:31,360
No one would listen

2185
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:37,760
Honestly I think we're still coming to the opposite of conspiracy

2186
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:39,040
Ourselves for a little bit

2187
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:40,064
Is this a Make-A-Wish

2188
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:42,112
Situation

2189
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:42,880
Yeah yeah

2190
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:49,024
Weird alien race

2191
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:52,352
So in the next life Coppola

2192
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:53,888
Absurd

2193
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:59,264
I mean I honestly like being able to go viral is almost twenty-first-century so

2194
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:01,312
Transparency around

2195
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,384
Why certain things can buy some things can't

2196
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:08,480
Amazed by that level of Human Rights

2197
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:10,528
Argument

2198
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:13,856
That argues against a lot of really basic human rights

2199
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:18,976
First of all having a social media account even

2200
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:20,000
And is a human right

2201
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:22,560
This crazy idea that you have the right

2202
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:24,096
To go viral

2203
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:25,376
Is insane

2204
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:26,400
That's not

2205
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:28,448
Bat

2206
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:29,984
That's astonishing

2207
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:35,872
Yeah

2208
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:39,456
This is from this Google

2209
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:40,224
Wow

2210
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:45,344
Where is everybody at the human rights we're going to be really inundated

2211
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,368
With a ton of

2212
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:50,976
Terrible content definition of delusions of

2213
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:54,560
Isn't it it doesn't get more grandiose than like

2214
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:58,912
If the only possible reason the world does not

2215
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:00,704
Instantly all

2216
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:02,496
Shout out to my whim at

2217
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:03,264
After

2218
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:04,800
Whistleblowing video

2219
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:06,848
Is because somebody is suppressing

2220
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,640
And they're destroying my

2221
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:09,408
Human right

2222
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:11,712
Viral viral

2223
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:13,248
Wolfgang

2224
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:16,064
So Alex complains about

2225
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:19,392
The social media game by bragging about his appearance on Rogan

2226
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:25,024
But it's

2227
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,328
The platform

2228
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,864
Elon Musk

2229
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:31,936
What about Bernie

2230
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:35,776
But because it's the biggest thing ever

2231
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:40,128
Most popular now

2232
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:42,176
Humans agree with

2233
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,808
He did go back on Road

2234
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,368
I don't

2235
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:54,464
This is crazy we should be allowed to outlaw

2236
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:55,488
Clearly fake

2237
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:57,280
Indicted for bulshit

2238
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:58,048
Shadowbanned

2239
01:50:58,304 --> 01:50:59,584
If you say shadowban

2240
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,608
Get the f*** out

2241
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:06,496
What does a real thing

2242
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:09,568
Contended there it sounds f******

2243
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:10,848
Space

2244
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:14,944
Shadowbanned

2245
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,528
This interview is largely

2246
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:23,136
The project Veritas video and it is exactly that like

2247
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:25,184
Character

2248
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,976
It's not interesting it's

2249
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:27,744
What year did

2250
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:29,024
Alex trying

2251
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:31,584
To validate is victimhood through

2252
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:35,168
This guy who doesn't seem to have any real information

2253
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:39,008
That's not good

2254
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,312
And this next clip is why

2255
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:42,080
It ended up

2256
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:43,872
To talk about

2257
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:45,408
And that's because Alex brings

2258
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:46,432
Another guy

2259
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:47,200
From Google

2260
01:51:58,464 --> 01:52:01,536
Directions to work

2261
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:04,608
Put on

2262
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:12,288
Or so far

2263
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:17,664
Put on

2264
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:18,432
Alcatraz

2265
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:23,296
Voorhees

2266
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:26,880
Is another Google whistleblower who project Veritas is promote

2267
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:30,464
He was interviewed by James O'Keefe and almost immediately journalist

2268
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:31,232
Ran into some

2269
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:34,560
Unproblematic information

2270
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:36,352
Someone putting back

2271
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:40,960
Looking through the Zack guys Twitter account

2272
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:45,824
People queuing on has been more accurate than any news Outlet

2273
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:51,456
Disqualifying audits

2274
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:52,224
Judgment

2275
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:52,992
And discern

2276
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:59,136
You look at more of a social media

2277
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:00,160
You're the big

2278
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:02,976
Pizzagate guy and has made numerous accusation

2279
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:05,792
Immediate government are controlled by

2280
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:08,096
Write 3 as an unimpeachable track record

2281
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:10,400
He's even gone so far as to say that Zionist

2282
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:16,800
Killed Andrew Breitbart

2283
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:24,224
He accuses quote Israel and designers cabal for doing 911 which is insane since we all

2284
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:24,992
Leo zagami

2285
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:31,648
Dog which stands for Zionist occupied cover

2286
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:34,464
Commit multiple times and that is a huge problem

2287
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:37,280
Zog is not a term the Casual folks use

2288
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:38,560
It hasn't.

2289
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:41,888
Steak place in The Fringe worlds of anti-Semitism and white supremacy

2290
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:44,960
His use of that term is a very strong indication

2291
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:47,264
Mickey himself isn't outright white supremacist

2292
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:48,032
Or

2293
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:49,312
He takes in information

2294
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:53,408
White supremacist sources so regularly

2295
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:55,200
If either of those he's not good

2296
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:55,968
It is

2297
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:56,736
It is

2298
01:53:56,992 --> 01:53:57,760
Occasionally heart

2299
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:04,160
You know a lot of people when you perceive a Google

2300
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:05,184
Employ youth

2301
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:06,464
Somebody who's this

2302
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:07,488
Brilliant

2303
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:09,280
Top of their field

2304
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:12,352
Level

2305
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:14,144
Talent

2306
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:16,192
And then you see this guy new like

2307
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:24,128
If you know what you're talkin about any idiot could be

2308
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:27,456
Compressor

2309
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:29,248
It's probably a very good it whatever Tech

2310
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:34,368
Stuffy. Also occupy the same brain

2311
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:35,648
There's Azog

2312
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:37,440
Yeah

2313
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,976
Probably no

2314
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:42,816
I put this down to a dichotomy of him being an anti-semite or take

2315
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:44,096
White supremacy

2316
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,168
Absorbs it

2317
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:48,960
I think it's probably more the quesadillas

2318
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:52,288
Parentheses

2319
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:53,568
Around words that you want

2320
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:54,592
Totino jewishness

2321
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:58,176
Like when he put them around the globalist media

2322
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:01,760
I think that's a case where

2323
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:09,952
When these parts of Voorhees belief system started to come up project Veritas accused sites like The Daily Beast

2324
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:11,232
Messenger instead of a message

2325
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,792
They were engaging an ad hominem attack

2326
01:55:14,048 --> 01:55:16,352
Because they were scared of what Voorhees brought

2327
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:17,120
To the table

2328
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:18,656
That's a dad project veritas

2329
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:21,472
You know his believes that nothing to do with the message

2330
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:23,008
Also interests

2331
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:27,104
Immediately went back and started

2332
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,408
Scrubbing is social media to erase

2333
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:31,712
Because of course

2334
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:32,480
Yeah

2335
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:36,320
It's not true or fair to argue the bring up the stuff is just

2336
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:38,880
It's very relevant

2337
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:40,928
The documents he is releasing

2338
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:47,584
Publicity stunt fraud operation for Port to show that there's a grand conspiracy against conservatives in the media

2339
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,864
Criminal fraud

2340
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:53,984
It's very relevant that this guy also believes that the Jews control the media and the government

2341
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:57,824
So when you tell Sookie that they're tampering with elections overthrow the government

2342
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,616
It's important to realize he believes

2343
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:05,248
The message being put out on Project Veritas is overtly anti-Semitic

2344
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:07,040
Because of this guy's beliefs

2345
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:10,112
We have prior context to understand what he believes

2346
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:12,928
But because O'Keefe doesn't mention that aspect of his store

2347
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:15,232
He's able to slightly obscure that reality

2348
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:17,536
Just presenting information is unbiased

2349
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:18,816
Coming from credible source

2350
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:21,632
What do you might as well just be reading from a new high-tech version

2351
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:23,168
The protocols of the Elders of Zion

2352
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:26,496
This isn't some extraneous piece of trivia about the guy

2353
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:31,360
It gives content and shows why he might be trying to go out of his way to prove his theory

2354
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:34,688
To be used by project veritas

2355
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:35,456
To do so

2356
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:38,784
Like if it documents reported what they claimed they did

2357
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,088
Absolutely get a platform to release them on

2358
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:41,856
The intercept

2359
01:56:42,112 --> 01:56:43,136
Are any number of places

2360
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:44,928
Other media Outlets zodiac

2361
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:45,952
This kind of story

2362
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:48,256
You only go to Project veritas

2363
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:49,536
If what you have isn't

2364
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:50,304
Great

2365
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,840
But you want to make a splash in the right way

2366
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:54,656
And also if it is your

2367
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:57,472
And if it is a human right for you to go by

2368
01:56:57,728 --> 01:56:59,264
Absolutely

2369
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,592
I looked over

2370
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:04,128
That Voorhees release

2371
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:04,896
Project bear

2372
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:06,688
And

2373
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:13,088
Pieces of evidence that he brought to the table is a list of blacklisted sites

2374
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:14,880
Support to be included in news search

2375
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:19,744
These included Google Drive

2376
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:24,608
They're on Google

2377
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:27,936
EBay results were exploded right make some sense

2378
01:57:28,192 --> 01:57:30,496
Because they have their own

2379
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:37,920
The only other site that isn't one of those types

2380
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:39,200
Are black

2381
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:41,504
Is the daily Stormer

2382
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:43,552
Then there's another sex

2383
01:57:44,576 --> 01:57:45,344
Which is quote

2384
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:47,648
Hi user block race

2385
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:49,952
User block race

2386
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:53,536
Which is to say users of Google block these sites themselves

2387
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:58,144
And they're noting oh there's a really high a way above average

2388
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:58,912
Gotcha

2389
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:01,472
Okay sounds good pressing the search result

2390
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:03,264
The people are

2391
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,800
Choosing not to see the

2392
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:05,568
These results in

2393
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:08,384
And possibly they're on a list because of that

2394
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:11,200
Yeah this is a list of states that consumers

2395
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:14,272
Missy pop-up and results

2396
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:16,832
Angry Patriot movement.com

2397
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:18,880
Girls Just Want to Have guns.com

2398
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:21,696
Admittedly this site this list is large

2399
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,256
Butthole is

2400
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:26,560
Overtly

2401
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:28,608
Choice lights to

2402
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:30,656
It's not just all conservative

2403
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:32,960
It also includes

2404
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:35,264
Sites like liberal america.org

2405
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:38,848
Or modern liberals., organization

2406
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:42,432
Media Matters

2407
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:44,480
Occupy Democrats

2408
01:58:44,736 --> 01:58:47,552
And that horrible conspiracy message board above-top-secret

2409
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,088
The end of the document

2410
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:52,672
Include sites that have been flagged because they tried to create fake version

2411
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:53,696
The real news sites

2412
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:56,512
Like abcnews.com. Co

2413
01:58:56,768 --> 01:58:59,840
Or cbsnews.com. Co

2414
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:03,168
From this document I don't

2415
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:04,192
Any indication

2416
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:05,984
There's some kind of an internal sensor

2417
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:08,544
What I see is an internal decision

2418
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:09,312
The block

2419
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:10,592
And the daily Stormer

2420
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:14,432
And then a giant list of sites that users of blocked at above-average rate

2421
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:16,992
With no indication that those sites are at all Blacklist

2422
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:19,296
Said to I mean I know for a fact that above 2

2423
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:20,576
Top secret shows up in search

2424
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:22,624
Results since I regularly run into

2425
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:23,904
The site when I'm looking at the

2426
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:24,672
Camelot

2427
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:27,744
So that piece of information doesn't seem

2428
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:32,352
One of the big pieces of evidence

2429
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:33,632
I say no

2430
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:34,656
Yeah well

2431
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:39,008
Is that the free market

2432
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:41,056
Means they'll be allowed to

2433
01:59:41,824 --> 01:59:43,360
Because they're obviously the most pop

2434
01:59:44,896 --> 01:59:46,176
If the free market

2435
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:46,944
Is saying

2436
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:48,224
They don't want us

2437
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:50,016
That means that Google is

2438
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:52,320
Manipulating those people in

2439
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:53,344
That

2440
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:55,136
Because the only explanation

2441
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:56,416
Is that there

2442
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:59,232
Supposed to win the free market of ideas

2443
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:00,768
And somebody is

2444
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,840
So that idea of

2445
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:05,888
You know user block

2446
02:00:06,144 --> 02:00:08,704
Versus internal blocks

2447
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,800
Obviously users wouldn't

2448
02:00:13,312 --> 02:00:14,848
Lock them

2449
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:21,760
Program

2450
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:22,528
The coverage

2451
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:25,088
What immediately jumped from this

2452
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:27,648
Screenshot is very clearly says quote work-in-progress

2453
02:00:28,416 --> 02:00:32,512
Who knows if it was even implemented or even followed through on

2454
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:37,376
The other thing that jumps out is that that there's a list of example

2455
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:38,400
Screenshot contain

2456
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:41,984
The Wall Street Journal tops the list at 8.53

2457
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:42,752
For their rating

2458
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:44,544
Indicating a low level of Fringe

2459
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:48,640
You got Alex Jones down today -1.5

2460
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:50,176
Which makes sense

2461
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:50,944
Yeah

2462
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:51,968
The Young Turks

2463
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:54,784
And The Huffington Post have substantially lower rate

2464
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:55,808
Then Breitbart

2465
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:56,576
And Fox News

2466
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:59,648
Indicating that their coverage is seen as more Fringe

2467
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:03,744
This document of anything demonstrates a lack of political bias

2468
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,560
Against conservatives

2469
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:09,632
Status quo heavily skewed towards old white people

2470
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:10,400
Perhaps

2471
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:14,752
They're apparently thousands of documents that Voorhees release

2472
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:17,056
But I'm absolutely not going to read all of

2473
02:01:17,824 --> 02:01:23,712
You clearly I do believe the Jews control the media and government

2474
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:30,880
To promote the idea that government

2475
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:33,952
Who chose to highlight those two documents that I have

2476
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:35,744
Pointed out.

2477
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,024
Preaching to the Forefront

2478
02:01:37,536 --> 02:01:41,632
Then they show absolutely nothing close to what being touted as what they're showing

2479
02:01:41,888 --> 02:01:45,216
All in all this is exactly what I've come to expect from Project veritas

2480
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:49,824
Pyle of thousands of documents

2481
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:53,152
John is a terrible job of presenting

2482
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:56,224
Are b*******

2483
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:58,528
40 sucks

2484
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:01,088
Occam's razor at this point

2485
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:05,440
If there is a Smoking Gun or if there is any evidence

2486
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:06,208
All that

2487
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:08,000
Google Facebook in all this week

2488
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:09,536
People are going out of their way to

2489
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:12,096
It would

2490
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:13,632
Come through someplace

2491
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:15,680
Even if you know some pizza

2492
02:02:17,728 --> 02:02:19,008
Highmark

2493
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:21,312
Intercept The Intercept would totally put it

2494
02:02:22,848 --> 02:02:25,152
Glenn Greenwald would jerk off to the notion

2495
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:30,784
He could prove that they were the only ones about

2496
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:33,088
Not necessarily your CNN or whatever

2497
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:34,880
Problem

2498
02:02:35,136 --> 02:02:35,904
Hear about it

2499
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:39,744
Who believes in his dog

2500
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,304
I'm going to hear about it from the intercepts

2501
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:45,632
The Interceptor somebody like that comes through with this

2502
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:47,680
I'm going to let the Zog I go

2503
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:55,616
But it's important to recognize

2504
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:58,944
That he has clearly demonstrated by his social media presence

2505
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:00,224
Put out the world

2506
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:01,504
Is disqualifying

2507
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:03,808
About

2508
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:07,136
I don't know

2509
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:09,696
Because we already know it

2510
02:03:10,464 --> 02:03:10,976
It's a big

2511
02:03:11,232 --> 02:03:13,280
You're at you're out immediately

2512
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:15,072
I don't need to read any of you

2513
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:17,632
If you're also the guy who

2514
02:03:18,144 --> 02:03:20,704
And the Dinos rondomedia

2515
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:24,544
So at this point Alex decides

2516
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:28,128
He's going to let these two have a bolt-action and let them take over the

2517
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:39,648
That perpetual

2518
02:03:41,952 --> 02:03:43,744
You guys have a discussion here

2519
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:46,048
Talk to each other

2520
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:46,816
I don't have

2521
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,352
What

2522
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:49,632
Hey Zach what's up

2523
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:50,656
How you doing

2524
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:00,896
But he keeps biting me

2525
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:02,176
Because

2526
02:04:02,432 --> 02:04:04,992
He thinks this is some kind of like world-changing

2527
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:07,296
Stop it brokered on the show

2528
02:04:07,552 --> 02:04:08,320
He says as much as

2529
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:15,744
Who all runs during the break people's office they said

2530
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:16,512
We've got

2531
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:35,712
Exist

2532
02:04:38,528 --> 02:04:40,576
Information dominance

2533
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:46,208
Stalin Churchill and spr

2534
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:46,976
Is this is the

2535
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:50,304
Lincoln Douglas debates

2536
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:54,144
Cuz what's going on with amazing history.

2537
02:04:54,656 --> 02:04:56,960
Appearance on Alex Jones is f******

2538
02:04:57,216 --> 02:05:01,312
Stupid

2539
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:02,336
Nixon

2540
02:05:07,712 --> 02:05:10,272
Greg

2541
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:14,368
Everybody hates social media

2542
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:16,416
So why aren't other ones

2543
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:22,560
America's really being kind of antagonize bipartisan not happy at the same thing in every country

2544
02:05:23,072 --> 02:05:23,584
So

2545
02:05:25,888 --> 02:05:32,032
Just getting to other people if you know there really wasn't free market or others.

2546
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:41,760
OK Google

2547
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:44,576
I can actually tell you why this hasn't worked

2548
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:45,856
It's because

2549
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:48,928
The people who don't like the social media Network

2550
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:50,208
I do still want

2551
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:53,024
Social media networks people don't like them is like

2552
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,840
Get off this go live my life

2553
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:59,680
But the ones who leave early

2554
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:01,216
And

2555
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:02,240
White supremacist

2556
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:04,800
I went out there on Facebook

2557
02:06:05,056 --> 02:06:06,848
Free from the censorship of Facebook

2558
02:06:07,104 --> 02:06:09,408
They generally turn into violet

2559
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:10,432
Awful

2560
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:11,200
Shitholes

2561
02:06:11,712 --> 02:06:12,480
Full of people

2562
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:14,784
Survival ship in the world

2563
02:06:15,296 --> 02:06:18,112
But you see it you see it doesn't work

2564
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:20,928
Which

2565
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:22,720
You are one of those

2566
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:24,512
Kind of look at that as a

2567
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:27,584
The microcosm of the nation that you would create

2568
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:28,608
Would you have your

2569
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:31,936
It seems like you should take you have your way

2570
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:33,216
It will look

2571
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:35,264
Like when you have a white nationalist

2572
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:39,360
That's not good it looks like a place

2573
02:06:39,616 --> 02:06:40,384
It's going to tear itself

2574
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:41,664
Because the only people

2575
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:42,432
But within your white

2576
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:45,248
Are the people who want to tear everyone apart

2577
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:47,808
It does seem like it'll go that direction

2578
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:50,368
Pictures of loving

2579
02:06:50,624 --> 02:06:51,392
Have you two guys

2580
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:54,208
There's not a ton of

2581
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:56,256
Clips of avocados that because

2582
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:57,024
Conversation

2583
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:57,792
Was that interesting

2584
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:02,400
But Alex pulled one of his

2585
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:03,424
In the middle of the counter

2586
02:07:07,776 --> 02:07:09,056
Once a week whatever you want

2587
02:07:09,568 --> 02:07:12,896
A two-hour show to say whatever the hell you want with no strings attached

2588
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:16,224
The listeners love this that level discussion

2589
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:20,064
Alex just love giving people Jose

2590
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:26,464
He offers everyone show he offered Barnes the show he's offering these two guys

2591
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:32,608
Offered colors shows it's just insane

2592
02:07:33,632 --> 02:07:36,448
Where's old man house phone

2593
02:07:38,496 --> 02:07:39,520
Rapo

2594
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:42,592
Admit

2595
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:43,360
Cuz I'm Petty

2596
02:07:50,784 --> 02:07:55,904
How to draw montucas

2597
02:07:57,440 --> 02:08:03,584
Black Knight

2598
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:14,080
I loved it so consistent to he says that all the time you know till we watch Monty Python

2599
02:08:17,664 --> 02:08:20,736
So Zack

2600
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:22,784
Voorhees

2601
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:24,320
Talks about how

2602
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:25,856
He was part of occupied

2603
02:08:29,696 --> 02:08:30,208
Possibly be

2604
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:33,792
Yeah you know I was I was attacked by antifa

2605
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:35,328
Because

2606
02:08:35,584 --> 02:08:37,120
One of their events

2607
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:39,424
Occupy Wall Street

2608
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:41,472
And you know

2609
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:45,056
TV deathreats and it's really funny

2610
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:47,616
I've done more

2611
02:08:48,384 --> 02:08:50,432
Fascism than all of them combined

2612
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:51,456
Wow

2613
02:08:51,712 --> 02:08:56,832
You believe in as when did

2614
02:08:57,088 --> 02:08:59,136
The group that we've

2615
02:08:59,392 --> 02:08:59,904
Consider that the

2616
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:00,672
Conservatives

2617
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:01,440
Considered to be

2618
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:03,744
Build their own

2619
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:04,512
Time machine

2620
02:09:05,024 --> 02:09:09,376
And go back to Occupy Wall Street

2621
02:09:09,632 --> 02:09:13,984
It existed for a long time

2622
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:20,384
It's absurd it is absurd

2623
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:26,272
Occupy Wall Street is conflating things I think of right-wing propaganda

2624
02:09:26,784 --> 02:09:28,576
Which is not a good sign and again

2625
02:09:28,832 --> 02:09:30,112
He believes in US.

2626
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:32,672
Interview wraps up

2627
02:09:33,184 --> 02:09:34,208
Kind of

2628
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:40,352
Towards the end of it he starts to get into like the spirit the spirit

2629
02:09:41,376 --> 02:09:44,192
He wants them to talk about how they back when they worked at Google

2630
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:45,216
And YouTube

2631
02:09:45,472 --> 02:09:45,984
They felt like

2632
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:50,080
Downtrodden and like ugly everything is bad but once they started

2633
02:09:50,336 --> 02:09:50,848
Speakingout

2634
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:51,872
Spirit

2635
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:55,456
Sure he wants to introduce a spiritual aspect of the fight

2636
02:09:55,712 --> 02:09:56,224
That they're in

2637
02:09:56,480 --> 02:10:00,320
Sure and that leads to a long esoteric ramble about

2638
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:01,088
How

2639
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:03,648
If you if you just get into God everything is

2640
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:04,416
Is great

2641
02:10:04,672 --> 02:10:07,232
Which again I think highlights this thing to Alex's

2642
02:10:07,488 --> 02:10:08,256
Express himself

2643
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:10,560
He's fit

2644
02:10:10,816 --> 02:10:12,864
His show is primarily Evangelical

2645
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:15,168
These right-wing

2646
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:18,240
In order to get people in that direction

2647
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:19,008
Accepting

2648
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:20,032
Jesus

2649
02:10:20,288 --> 02:10:21,312
Or his verse 13

2650
02:10:21,824 --> 02:10:24,896
Here's a little piece of that esoteric ramble that

2651
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:26,432
Hilarious

2652
02:10:27,456 --> 02:10:31,040
There's something wrong with something wrong with beautiful women there's nothing wrong with a

2653
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:32,832
Horsepower car

2654
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:36,160
Doesn't come close

2655
02:10:39,488 --> 02:10:40,256
And promoting

2656
02:10:40,512 --> 02:10:41,024
Puma future

2657
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:43,328
It's so rewarding to stand up

2658
02:10:44,608 --> 02:10:45,632
The show Force

2659
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:46,912
And

2660
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:48,960
Show me people singing show enslave

2661
02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:50,240
If they have never tasted

2662
02:10:50,752 --> 02:10:51,776
I have never imagined

2663
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:56,128
Darla

2664
02:10:57,152 --> 02:10:57,920
Love you just

2665
02:10:58,176 --> 02:10:59,456
Watch ever touch

2666
02:11:00,224 --> 02:11:02,272
You'll never want anything else yet

2667
02:11:03,552 --> 02:11:06,624
It's not like Christians

2668
02:11:18,656 --> 02:11:21,216
Why why even throat

2669
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:25,056
And

2670
02:11:25,824 --> 02:11:27,872
Universal

2671
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:31,456
Something's happening here

2672
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:37,600
We held the course you held the course

2673
02:11:41,952 --> 02:11:46,048
Researcher of God

2674
02:11:55,008 --> 02:11:59,104
I don't want that number to everytime Leo zagami is adjective

2675
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:05,504
Leo zagami been waiting for 28 hours now to have him on in just a second there is true comedy and just

2676
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:09,344
Resume playing this

2677
02:12:10,624 --> 02:12:13,440
Standard Alex talking about religion thing

2678
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:19,840
Rambling forever in

2679
02:12:20,352 --> 02:12:23,936
Now let's get to him he's Mio usually do

2680
02:12:30,336 --> 02:12:32,896
So they are the Grammys on

2681
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:35,200
Care but I just want to play this one clip

2682
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:35,968
That he has

2683
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:39,552
F***** up

2684
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:41,600
Is it

2685
02:12:58,752 --> 02:13:00,032
So the Infowars

2686
02:13:00,544 --> 02:13:02,336
Is brought together by prayer

2687
02:13:08,992 --> 02:13:11,040
We already know from the last time we talked about this

2688
02:13:11,296 --> 02:13:13,600
Is very clearly Trace back

2689
02:13:13,856 --> 02:13:16,672
Do anti-semitic ideas about the

2690
02:13:16,928 --> 02:13:21,536
The Jews creating a demonic entity

2691
02:13:21,792 --> 02:13:22,560
Inspires them

2692
02:13:22,816 --> 02:13:24,352
Is Brian Kemp communism

2693
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:27,680
You know that really makes me rethink that Jimmy James line

2694
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:29,472
The new news radio

2695
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:36,128
That's what I thought

2696
02:13:36,384 --> 02:13:37,408
Unfortunately

2697
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:42,016
The great joke is

2698
02:13:42,272 --> 02:13:43,040
Again yui

2699
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:54,048
You get Leo Leo Leo

2700
02:13:54,304 --> 02:13:55,840
This episode was crazy

2701
02:13:56,096 --> 02:13:57,376
I really wanted to cover more

2702
02:13:58,656 --> 02:14:00,704
I couldn't I couldn't he

2703
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:06,080
Justifying trying to buy Greenland by appealing to a ton of horrible thing

2704
02:14:06,336 --> 02:14:08,640
Purchases

2705
02:14:10,944 --> 02:14:11,968
It's absolutely ludicrous

2706
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:14,016
And then also this Google

2707
02:14:14,272 --> 02:14:15,296
Cheddar's a little bit why

2708
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:16,832
It's worth at least

2709
02:14:18,112 --> 02:14:20,416
But there's really not a ton of

2710
02:14:20,672 --> 02:14:21,952
There's a little bit of life

2711
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:24,512
We need to overhaul

2712
02:14:24,768 --> 02:14:26,304
Our education

2713
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:29,120
And I'll tell you who did it

2714
02:14:29,376 --> 02:14:30,144
Chairman Mao

2715
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:35,008
He really overturn the whole educational system

2716
02:14:37,568 --> 02:14:38,336
It's just it's little

2717
02:14:40,640 --> 02:14:44,224
Cuz of this being so

2718
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:45,248
Weird

2719
02:14:47,552 --> 02:14:48,064
For Friday

2720
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:54,208
Just a little closer up on

2721
02:14:54,464 --> 02:14:58,048
Other days

2722
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:00,096
On this day maybe I don't know

2723
02:15:00,352 --> 02:15:02,912
So we'll see and will be back on Friday

2724
02:15:03,168 --> 02:15:04,704
We will see that but scrapes be back

2725
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:07,520
Mr. Jordan miss doing this

2726
02:15:09,824 --> 02:15:11,104

2727
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:14,432
People can check out the website

2728
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:21,856

You could go to I

Homepage.com

2733
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:37,216
That's no longer on the homepage

2734
02:15:37,472 --> 02:15:38,752
We have so many episodes

2735
02:15:39,008 --> 02:15:40,544
It's very hard for people to know where to

2736
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:43,872
Start the episode

2737
02:15:44,128 --> 02:15:46,176
Where you interview Bob Chapman

2738
02:15:46,432 --> 02:15:49,248
About

2739
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:53,344
I'd heard from bro

2740
02:15:53,856 --> 02:15:56,928
It's a good bottle episode

2741
02:15:57,184 --> 02:16:03,328
Spoiled it but if people are looking for I cuz I don't hear from you

2742
02:16:03,584 --> 02:16:05,120
Amanda Show but I don't know what episode 2

2743
02:16:05,376 --> 02:16:08,192
Some people said that's a good entry point

2744
02:16:08,448 --> 02:16:10,752
If I put that up on the homepage

2745
02:16:11,008 --> 02:16:13,568
Go to the iTunes or so many episode

2746
02:16:13,824 --> 02:16:15,360
Maybe that's a good place

2747
02:16:15,616 --> 02:16:17,152
That's a great idea

2748
02:16:17,664 --> 02:16:22,784
Listen to an episode with

2749
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:23,808
Shocking twist

2750
02:16:30,464 --> 02:16:32,256
But also

2751
02:16:32,512 --> 02:16:33,024
Until 9

2752
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:33,792
Next time

2753
02:16:34,048 --> 02:16:34,560
Ivan the Beast

2754
02:16:39,424 --> 02:16:43,008
Alexandra Thurston color
