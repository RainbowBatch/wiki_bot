Alexandra Thurston color

00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:18,176
Is there a certain

3
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:30,976
There is nothing special going on

4
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:37,376
Absolutely

5
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:48,128
Using out of context

6
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:48,896
Text Rob

7
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,784
That's address to drop

8
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,184
But I believe a year ago I made the pronouncement

9
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,768
Turned on Donald Trump I would bring you a bottle of champagne

10
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,072

00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,568

Very exciting

19
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,688
Also exciting is someone who donated

20
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,248
Specifically in anticipation of the show

21
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:03,648
And therefore I must allow them to cut the line of other people who are waiting to get there

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,952
Butter Patrick thank you so much

23
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,560

I don't want

26
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,432
Jesus Christ

27
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,480
Patrick you are now

28
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,504
A technocrat

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,904
Thank you very much Patrick I assume you inhabited the body of a Whoopi Goldberg

30
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,512
7:45

31
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:46,912

00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:53,312
We would appreciate it very much appreciate everybody literally since I was jumped

33
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:59,200
Got a got a couple of donations the game is about

34
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:04,064
Excited for us to cover it and point out all of the point where he's being

35
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
A complete dumbass

36
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,952
Validating his own narrative

37
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
Cheers my friend

38
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,608
Delicious block of Blanco

39
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,888
Blanc de blancs

40
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,704
Classic white on white

41
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,264
I believe is what it's called so Jordan

42
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,824
We have this 3-hour special report in front of us

43
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,384
There were a couple of false start

44
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,200
Alex Jones Twitter live stream

45
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,760
Did Rob do recording

46
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,344
I am so we will start by listening to a couple of days

47
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,112
Here's the first one

48
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
Kill the f****** feet

49
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,999
You clearly like

50
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:54,399
Morrisville

51
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,959
The passion behind it mostly because he realizes

52
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:05,663
It's a feeling of I'm sick of doing this thing I have now been pushed too far

53
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,967
I have a very clear

54
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
Beery

55
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
It's not a theory

56
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,319
I'm pretty certain I know what's going on

57
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:16,671
Alex.

58
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:20,767
Alex Jones is alliances

59
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:24,863
Allegiances lie with Russian I was Trump butts

60
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,679
What this strike accomplishes

61
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Is not

62
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,495
Alex isn't afraid of the fact that

63
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,543
But he attacks Syria or something like that

64
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
Which

65
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:40,479
Super excited

66
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,807
He's doing

67
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:50,207
But yeah they're terrible but Brian Williams

68
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:55,327
The other thing

69
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,119
Without a massive

70
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
Conspiracy to

71
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:08,127
Nerve agent

72
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
YouTube back it up

73
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
Alex

74
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,455
Has to realize the Trump tax

75
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,247
Reveal to his audio

76
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,551
That he's been lying about Trump

77
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
For two years

78
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,647
Like there's no other way around the idea of like drops on our side

79
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
I mean just the other day

80
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:24,511
Trump came out as like I think we might want to get back into the TPP

81
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:30,911
Which is one of the boxes bigger Banner issues with everything he does

82
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
Which is a good thing

83
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,007
I think she's I think the tpp's going to be for us

84
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,079
I don't understand it fully enough

85
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,103
I've looked into 7

86
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
What are those

87
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,175
Letters larger trade deals

88
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,967
Themselves like that I don't fully understand

89
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Because it's

90
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,063
Another Commerce difficult

91
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,111
Yeah yeah it's all good

92
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
Not for it

93
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,975
So

94
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,791
Start

95
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Didn't work

96
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
He tries again

97
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,615
Right

98
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,895
The secret

99
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
Agreement

100
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,607
It should be

101
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:16,031
Everyone has already captured

102
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,527
Anytime he's like fun

103
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,623
Trump like that's what that's going to take the number one seed

104
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,695
I was listening to him start talking about Madison he's like

105
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,511
That's f****** Mattis Badcock

106
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:42,143
And I swear to God the next thought I had was Alison going to say he's got big full lips

107
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,567
Beautiful I mean

108
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,431
I'd like to apologize slightly for some of the audio Legos capturing this

109
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,503
On-the-fly last night

110
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
I was recording office

111
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,319
BuzzFeed that I don't think was very good

112
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
I tried to a

113
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
Lo-Fi stuff but it's got a

114
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,951
It's got a different flavor to it then a lot of

115
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,071
Yeah and I was pretty worried that

116
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,631
The situation we were going to have it was going to be

117
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Delete all this stuff

118
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
You couldn't have deleted

119
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:23,871
Because those got those went viral as it were like those wherever one is reposting nose

120
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Like

121
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
Little Twitter videos

122
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,223
And stuff like that

123
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
That much

124
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,087
Do most of the actual 3-hour report

125
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
But he does want to eat

126
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,159
Fixies deleted those speeds

127
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:40,511
And get back on air with Owen Shroyer sitting silently by his side

128
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
Which is what we will do

129
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
Disgust will start

130
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,679
And of what he thinks is going on in Syria

131
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,007
I will say that

132
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
Fairy

133
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,471
Okay

134
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,263
The first time of like maybe 6

135
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
DVD says I'm not a rusa file and then say something

136
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:04,479
Also I can't confirm or deny

137
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:10,367
The Tardis is an actual Port but it is a doctor who reference

138
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,303
They like the idea that Alex is icon are being like

139
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
They killed 10,000

140
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
Russian

141
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
Is absolutely

142
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:27,519
The whole reason that they were so very careful because if they killed

143
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:33,919
Evacuated the target

144
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,927
And stuff like that

145
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,975
The strikes are never all that well-targeted

146
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
There's this terrible

147
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:52,095
There's Terrible Things Precision strike means

148
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,703
We're going to try and kill less we mean

149
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,823
The ten thousand Russians

150
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Workout

151
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,615
Bogus

152
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,199
And the only way he could actually believe 3,000 Russians

153
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:11,295
I believe the last report I saw something

154
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,319
3000

155
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Perhaps

156
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
3000

157
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
So that's

158
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,231
Show me number dark lips wrong is one

159
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Before this

160
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,815
Broadcast start

161
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,095
Ivan Alex

162
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
Expresses his feelings about

163
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,295
Go back on the rim

164
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,063
Call train

165
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
That's not good

166
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
No

167
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,639
That's not great none of that

168
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
Also

169
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,967
Is he talking into a shirt on this

170
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,927
Drinking or doing some blow or something but

171
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,999
Deviate

172
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,303
Things are completely underlie that there isn't

173
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
Arrangement

174
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:05,727
Between the military and the Russians and Assad that they're going to kick Isis and Al-Qaeda out of the country

175
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:12,127
Renaissance

176
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
Does Alex

177
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
Conspiracy Theory on

178
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:25,695
Ritsu would be that the British call the British released

179
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
Doing chemical attack

180
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,727
And that's the one everybody

181
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:42,335
You really have to take into account

182
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,127
How much is entire argument that

183
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,455
Making hinges on his idea that the gas attacks

184
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Were fake

185
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
Didn't do it

186
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
The fair play to you

187
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
I guess

188
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,159
Make that sort of claim but

189
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
The facts on the ground

190
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
Indicate that that's not

191
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,255
Given his history

192
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,815
And the ideas

193
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,655
Involved in some sort of a deal that involves Assad stepping down doesn't make

194
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
Expense

195
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,775
Because of money

196
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,567
Drop them backing him up

197
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,431
There's a relationship there that doesn't is not just

198
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
Some sort of benign

199
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,039
Islamic terrorists and then

200
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,599
Have a great day everyone

201
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Do

202
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,975
I don't know what it is but this

203
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,767
Nagging feeling on

204
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
Why

205
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
What Assad

206
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
Spit chemical weapon

207
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,143
Cuz he loves it

208
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,679
Like

209
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Fetishizes

210
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
Mike Mike

211
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,991
First especially whenever I heard that chemical attack

212
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,271
It was more like

213
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,087
I'm guessing that

214
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
Soldiers or whatever

215
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,671
The pro-assad people

216
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:04,511
Just had them kind of lying around they ran out of other ships

217
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:12,959
That sounds more like what happened then Assad actually ordered anybody personally to do it there's two pieces of it

218
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,031
Possibly understand the mind of a dick

219
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,127
The motivation of like oh it looks like

220
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,711
He's winning

221
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,015
I don't know I don't know what that

222
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,295
That mind is like

223
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:31,903
Yeah that's a f*****-up mine let's true barely we're also like

224
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,511
We're assuming a coherent chain-of-command where there probably is not

225
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,327
Assad ordered

226
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
I don't know

227
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,631
I have no idea but

228
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
What you just

229
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,215
Explain to the very very likely possibility

230
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:51,615
And with Israel with those Israeli shoulder soldiers

231
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,151
Sniping

232
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,943
People just added

233
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,479
And laughing about it

234
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:01,343
That's not the Israeli government doing it that these guys

235
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,951
Way too much power and free reign to do whatever it is they f****** want

236
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:12,607
Because I don't know what really is f****** going on Defender

237
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,655
Goodbye

238
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,215
Murder whoever they want

239
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,239
So

240
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,823
This is all to say

241
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151
Alex's Alex's

242
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,223
It's flimsy

243
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,503
But

244
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,295
There's no doubt about it

245
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
You mad at Ross

246
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,287
You are

247
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
Don't think he did that

248
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,015
I don't think so either

249
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:08,415
Did pretty much exactly what his family and his name has always

250
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,255
I got a I got a I got a full explanation for Alex

251
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
In terms of like why you like

252
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
Look up

253
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:20,447
You always good to his word on pppp and on the tax cut

254
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,239
And immigration

255
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,311
And now he's f****** it up here on 6th and I like

256
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:31,967
You got to understand that that all physical here in pattern immigration stuff is cuz you're the f****** racist history of

257
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,991
Minorities

258
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,783
Reverently spindle in the mouth

259
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
For City Treatment

260
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:39,903
The tax cuts are because he's super-rich

261
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,975
In terms of he's dating Texas

262
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:47,583
He hate immigrants and people who are non-whites

263
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,471
Exactly and then the TPP stuff

264
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
Are good

265
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,223
That Trump has done our very very well take

266
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
Can care of through just like

267
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,551
This is his personality

268
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:12,159
Dear Alex last year Trump bomb Syria

269
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,231
It's not a certain point you got to see like

270
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,767
Kind of fine with it

271
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
Also

272
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,143
He's a pathological lunatic liar

273
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
What Trump is

274
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,055
Dishonoring his family name with

275
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,383
Silly fool Alex Jones didn't go to high school he doesn't know math

276
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,455
Doing this makes Clipper Alex Compares himself to

277
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,024
I love that if you call me again I'm going to tell you

278
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
I'm ashamed

279
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,888
So mr. president

280
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:29,216
Have you no decency

281
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
I would

282
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
Absolutely

283
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,736
I defended you what you want to train people out of the military

284
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,368
Starting World War 3

285
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,024
Ellettsville

286
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,584
But sir you have gone too far

287
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,424
By pissing off Russian I guess I don't know

288
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,960
I don't know because like

289
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,264
It's pathetic to watch this

290
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,056
Display cuz there's a couple things that play

291
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,360
Are you going to see this play out over the course of the

292
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,152
This one of them is Alex trying to talk

293
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,688
Himself into skilled

294
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:19,136
Right

295
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,416
I love it

296
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:25,792
Sending Trump's phone calls directly to voicemail

297
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,072
Cubs score

298
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:31,168
If he's mid-coitus he's answering a call

299
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
Oh but the other thing is that's kind of

300
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,496
We talked about this a bit

301
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:38,592
It's kind of like you've negging Trump a little bit

302
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,616
Please call me

303
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,152
Please please I love you

304
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:44,992
The other thing that is in play your see this play out over the course of it is Alex

305
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,296
Trying to get a couple guests on

306
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,368
He's trying to get them to reassure him that he did a good job

307
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,096
Breaking My Heart

308
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
Can you play

309
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,632
Exact

310
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:08,032
Joel skousen on and that is the sort of feeling

311
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,408
Over the last

312
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,480
Two years he hasn't completely s*** the bed just like this whole

313
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:22,624
Alex

314
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,392
Real weird

315
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,184
This isn't like down clip

316
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
This is Mike.

317
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:31,840
This is one of the weirdest things I've ever heard Alex Jones

318
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,144
I don't know what to make of it

319
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,424
It's out of nowhere

320
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:58,720
Girlfriend

321
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,656
What

322
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,576
Oh man that is that is wild

323
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:33,184
Progressive

324
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,496
Minute-and-a-half clip

325
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:52,896
Lead me to a couple conclusions that I've never had before

326
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,040
I think

327
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
I think the most

328
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,112
Amazing thing that he said

329
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,904
Stonewall

330
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,184
Trump's beard

331
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,744
That is weird

332
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,816
No no cuz I think he I think he is

333
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
I think

334
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,984
Right

335
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
Truly

336
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:26,688
Straight but pretending to be gave in Rodger Stone could actors

337
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,992
But if I understand correctly

338
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,552
What's going on is Stone weird

339
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
Is

340
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:35,136
Chilli dating the women that Trump is going out with

341
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,024
No I think

342
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,608
Just bought I think what he's trying to imply is it because Rodger

343
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:50,240
Your stone is a libertine in a sweater

344
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,776
And then it would be an excuse for

345
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,824
For Trump to be seen with them or be around them

346
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,664
Alright

347
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,480
Then at the same time I don't know how that relates

348
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,016
To the allegation

349
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,856
Has not been made

350
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,648
Very weird

351
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,208
This is very very

352
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,584
I could be

353
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,120
Share it

354
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:21,472
That's weird that we don't even have time to

355
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,264
I don't know what he was trying to

356
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,312
How to say cuz he started with

357
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:29,152
Trump's not gay and neither am I

358
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,944
I'm not gay

359
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,248
But what was going on in the middle.

360
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:40,160
Top 7 or 8 Women

361
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:45,024
Then we thought you have babies

362
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,584
Exactly the other thing is like

363
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,400
Will contact in space command Sade from

364
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:57,312
He's trying to also present situation where like the idea that

365
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
Is the worst possible thing

366
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,432
You are possessed

367
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
No

368
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:07,808
No I'm not saying that I'm just saying that if he's like if I liked

369
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,088
I would tell everybody I

370
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,368
Which

371
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
Carnival

372
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:16,256
Possibly his ego

373
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:20,352
Into a man who is who is born gay

374
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,144
Yeah he be like

375
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,960
Rodger Stone

376
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,056
That's all I got info

377
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:34,688
Yeah I don't know either we don't have time to talk about is sex

378
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,968
Claims that's just the same

379
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,040
Go away

380
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:42,112
Send a text to rationalize the situation

381
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,136
And you just really

382
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:06,944
Daria furs

383
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
Got a call

384
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,824
Oh man

385
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,128
I'm trying to work this out but I'm out of

386
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,408
An idiot

387
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
Haggai

388
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
A guy

389
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,248
Welcome welcome to us

390
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,808
2 years ago

391
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
I'm doing the math

392
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,112
How true

393
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,648
Possibly sell it

394
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,952
I just can't

395
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,512
I can't see a situation where

396
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:56,864
Is entire past pattern of selling people out is now hit me

397
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,656
It kept going

398
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:04,288
You got played by a pro Alex and we've always known this this is been a constant

399
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:10,688
You know what I always believed you would never come back on

400
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,648
Very clear that like Alex couldn't get a hold of Rodger

401
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,720
Cuz otherwise Rodger would be on this broadcast

402
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,048
And I know for a fact

403
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,840
50 pechenick isn't answering his phone

404
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,120
Cuz Alex keeps telling

405
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
The crew

406
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,168
Call Steve pieczenik

407
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:38,336
I don't want to do

408
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:49,856
I'm going to be great he's you know he's going to do whatever Trump wants him to do now we have a week

409
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,392
Bombing a country

410
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,160
That's a shock

411
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,952
Do all of Alex Jones is like

412
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
Stalwart

413
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,000
Narrative guys

414
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:56,768
Arnot

415
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,792
Coming to the table

416
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,608
Rodger Stone not answering the phone

417
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:06,752
On the phone telligent store

418
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,592
For this past 24-hour W f****** a lot without

419
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,872
I'm going to Liberty meme

420
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,152
Or he's heading to

421
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,968
The Border

422
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:20,576
You might see the writing on the wall

423
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,392
This late-night drunk girl down podcast

424
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,464
Alex Jones blames

425
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,024
Expresses that Russia is awesome

426
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,688
Is it

427
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,576
Not like Trump did

428
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:09,472
Doesn't bring up any of the shooting of Hannah with ever

429
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,800
Do you make a rapid corruption that we

430
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
I was caught on tape

431
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:21,760
Oh boy

432
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
Kill all those

433
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:29,440
How do you spell shout out to all the people all the stupid assholes who are like Alex Jones works for Israel why doesn't he talk about his really

434
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,488
He's legitimately blaming Israel

435
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:35,840
How do you gas attacks

436
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,656
Oh I was joking about Israel

437
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:42,496
That that is a very very incomplete

438
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,776
This career

439
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:48,384
He's more willing to if he doesn't want to wait

440
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:55,296
Versions of the real world

441
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:00,416
In which is even more funny when you go back and look at the context of him saying

442
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:04,000
Never said he didn't payoff limit

443
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:13,728
Screaming on are about how this is all bulshit in a Witch Hunt and all that stuff for weeks

444
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,104
Very weird

445
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,432
He's very Wayfair nonsensical there's a there's a lot of

446
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,456
Mismatching s***

447
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,272
But pretty much

448
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,456
Politico

449
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:11,072
I know and just doesn't say much

450
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,352
Role in this

451
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,912
Call Sherrod is essentially just being like

452
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,728
Russia is going to attack somebody

453
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,800
And that's his that's his hold like a present a

454
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,336
Basically it's just being there.

455
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,360
Is Alex's going

456
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,384
He's not

457
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,176
Ready to make that kind of a sand

458
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,736
Or anything like that but it's going to be like

459
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,040
I don't see how Russia doesn't respond

460
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,576
They said they're going to

461
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:37,952
I think this moment we're like legitimately Owen Shroyer is kind of realizing I'm in over my head

462
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,096
This is about my grave this is this is a mess

463
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,656
Hours before the show

464
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
On the show

465
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,472
When you change the entire narrative

466
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,264
Exactly what you're screaming

467
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
Trump you drunk a*******

468
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:56,640
Alex

469
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,176
Amanda

470
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,040
What does come in and say want to be funny

471
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,064
If things I've ever heard

472
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
But

473
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:10,976
Something very not true about what the globalist

474
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
So done to him

475
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:50,400
When I turn on Trump like I'm doing right now

476
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,424
So

477
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,496
That leaves little room to interpret

478
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,032
This is what's going on

479
00:35:56,288 --> 00:36:02,432
He's trying to do a face turn special report today

480
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,200
Saturday

481
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:07,296
Imagine we're going to get Rodger Stone

482
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:13,696
I'm pretty sure that

483
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:17,024
Car fender or whatever

484
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,560
Because

485
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:22,144
I mean even today like right before we started recording

486
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,168
Trumpet

487
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,192
Mission accomplished

488
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:30,592
There is a decent chance, we'll see is not more escalation and not an ongoing

489
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,640
And that will make Alex Jones how to be like

490
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:33,920
All right look

491
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:39,040
He just had to send a message

492
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,344
But in a sex club Alex Jones

493
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,160
Anybody who tells you that they re

494
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:44,928
Philosophy

495
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,488
Is a loop when did we get there

496
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:10,016
I know we're on TV off aqua.

497
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,320
Alex

498
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:18,720
You told everybody you read philosophy

499
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,512
What time

500
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,120
I don't really read much philosophy anymore I didn't College

501
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,912
But I started philosophy

502
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:31,776
Much like this Blanc de blancs

503
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,384
We didn't

504
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,504
Vouchers thing at the globalist

505
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,040
The kids from him cuz he supported Trump

506
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,624
Disgraceful but it gets even worse

507
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,528
Is back to

508
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:21,088
3 years ago

509
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,648
He's back to September 25th

510
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,184
Alex

511
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,464
How can you

512
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,304
Possibly run a casino without committing a crime

513
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,864
Yeah

514
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:39,264
Turning into just a pure airing of grievances

515
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,056
This is just all of his

516
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,592
Actual

517
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,920
Emotions

518
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:50,016
Finally coming out and we're getting my favorite Alex Jones

519
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:54,624
I don't understand the world and I have to admit it

520
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,440
Publicly

521
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:03,840
Get it I thought I knew what I was talking about it it turns out I do my God I was lied to me

522
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:10,240
Much support this guy

523
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,056
People are criticizing me because the guy decided to

524
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,336
Sports clips

525
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,104
Brooks

526
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:22,016
Abusive and violent

527
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:28,416
Idiot is going to punish me for that course

528
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:34,304
Oh yeah this is a giant Daddy

529
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,608
My God

530
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:37,888
Rough

531
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,912
I love it

532
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:45,312
I understand look I'm not one generally for schadenfreude I don't appreciate

533
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,848
Other people suffering

534
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:53,248
Pass on me.

535
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,552
Lighting in someone's Misfortune for a second

536
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:58,880
But you have to recognize two

537
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
That like

538
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,744
As much as we hate him and he is a

539
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,560
Complete liar and it is ruined so much

540
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:12,192
He is a human and I do think he's feeling a lot of pain right now.

541
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:15,008
Placed but I still like when he start like

542
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,080
Yours talking about fake tears and people in the chat room

543
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:31,136
The lilting the voice is like that is not fake

544
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:37,792
We weave listen to a billion hours of Alex Jones until when he's actually crying

545
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:43,168
I have no issue with the

546
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:46,240
The schadenfreude

547
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,824
I'm not defending it I'm I'm

548
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,128
Explaining this this

549
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:52,895
Experience

550
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,431
It is just like

551
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,479
When you watch a

552
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:02,111
Serial killer documentary from prison where the serial killer is just talking about

553
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,647
Oh I was victimized

554
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,583
Their history like yeah you know you're the one doing it though so go f***

555
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:16,447
You're an actual psychopath

556
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:21,567
No more human empathy which means you are no longer in the human race

557
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:26,687
I disagree I a little bit I think

558
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,247
Some piece of that is

559
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,271
Is

560
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:32,831
Is fair

561
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,599
I mean

562
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,135
You cross a certain level

563
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,927
Like you don't really deserve that

564
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,207
Used as an excuse

565
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:40,255
Like once you're doing such terrible things

566
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,583
You know all I had it bad isn't

567
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,887
Excuse the same time I don't think

568
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,167
Think it's right to celebrate

569
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,447
Humanity

570
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,471
That way like

571
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,519
Then Bill really terrible

572
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,335
I don't believe I'm celebrating in humanity

573
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:58,687
Like people who were abused or whatever

574
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,223
I have gone down the line

575
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,015
To like they abused other people

576
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,295
As if they are human

577
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,599
For the sake of giving up on some Humanity

578
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,391
I think

579
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
To ascertain

580
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,999
I don't know it's such a thin line to walk in

581
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:12,767
In terms of like

582
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,303
Yes there are monsters

583
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,607
In the world but those monsters are still human

584
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:20,703
And generally speaking in a vacuum this sort of behavior doesn't exist

585
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,799
Like just someone who lives their life and goes along naturally

586
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,847
Bit like an Alex Jones is Not

587
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,871
Created without

588
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,151
Some sort of terrible

589
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:29,919
Trauma

590
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,199
Something bad happen

591
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,015
The path that he is on

592
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,855
Making probably too fine of a point

593
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,671
In episode when we're trying to just laugh at him being an idiot

594
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,975
I love it but he is a human

595
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
And

596
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,839
I am not so out of touch

597
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,863
Humanity

598
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,887
Real Steel

599
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,167
Feel that pain

600
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,959
And it makes me sad

601
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:57,311
But I also still laughs a lot legitimate

602
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,639
And I respect that about you

603
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,175
Don't know how to

604
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:06,015
Turn that part off and really Delight in the monsters.

605
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,575
Are you kidding I do this drink

606
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:13,951
I know but you really got to turn it off I will try to something else

607
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,487
You better have a good sense of humor

608
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,791
For sure

609
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:20,351
In a moment

610
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,887
To Alex Jones

611
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,423
Appearance from his fake

612
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,703
Intelligence or Zack

613
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,495
Reset a bunch of really stupid s***

614
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,311
Before we do

615
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:35,711
Kind of hard little pan under the table I just did that

616
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,271
No you said we'll be back in about 2

617
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
2 minutes

618
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,343
They're back

619
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,183
Zach

620
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,463
Is about to show up

621
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,255
This clip

622
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,071
Show me

623
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,631
He's going to stop time

624
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,703
But

625
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,263
What are the things is really interesting is they're like

626
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,079
Galaxy

627
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,103
To reinforce

628
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,895
His flip

629
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,943
Is is Right turning on Trump

630
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:10,783
Going back to

631
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,135
Exactly do you need to create a situation where

632
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,415
We can go back on

633
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,231
You know like

634
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,767
Sprite

635
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,679
No you shouldn't get divorced you should work on your marriage

636
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:32,031
I understand exactly where you're coming from your spouse

637
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,919
The Lord wants you

638
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,223
To stay married so you need to go back

639
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,271
Go to write

640
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,879
Zac is going to create and bring in the narrative

641
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,159
I have a gun to his head

642
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:52,767
To do this all right and then as we go on

643
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:59,423
But we're going to see why Zach should not be trusted as a legitimate

644
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,751
It plays out pretty clearly that

645
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,031
He might belong on

646
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,871
Donald Trump

647
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,815
Directly work reward

648
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,351
We should have been a long way

649
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:50,879
Politically

650
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:54,463
Own it

651
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,511
Call Sophie

652
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:17,247
Are you talking about what's a lb

653
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,159
Are we talkin about any of the people who act

654
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,071
And was in his entire presidency

655
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:34,399
Looking for the war that would make his name as the president

656
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:37,983
Or the other what's the mythology

657
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,775
It's around the assassination and it's

658
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
Fun

659
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:46,175
Cuz it it creates a more robust worldview where in everything

660
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:50,015
Thing is fake

661
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,039
Oceans of the

662
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,063
The globalist

663
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:52,831
Right

664
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:57,439
Got a gun to his head politically and physically

665
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:02,047
He's got pictures of him getting picked on and then he's got a gun on the other side of the

666
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,887
They got to look back and forth between the tip

667
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:09,471
Look at his eyes and press conference he never hold

668
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:14,335
His head up like that

669
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:19,455
Every time he statement written by him for one of his idiot

670
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:26,111
Idiot doing one of his Planes lally's

671
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:34,559
Everybody

672
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,375
Wii support

673
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,679
Martin Luther King

674
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,471
Who what day is this

675
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:45,055
Whatever Pennywise I prefer senior

676
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,175
Absence exclave Alex explained

677
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:56,575
I wanted to make a Supercut of all the time because he's not a ruse file cuz I'm 25.

678
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:16,543
Mobile

679
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,615
When did you started laughing

680
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,183
So

681
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:33,951
They're perfect

682
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,767
What did Russia do

683
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,327
Russia

684
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:43,935
Joining the Syrian cause whenever Isis

685
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:47,775
And the non-existent al-Qaeda are there

686
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:53,151
Or did they join Assad whenever he decided that any Rebels who thought

687
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:59,295
Maybe living under this f****** autocratic monster who gasses his own people isn't a good idea

688
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,599
When did Russia join in

689
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:07,999
Did Russian join in on the side of the goddamn heroes or did Russia join in on the side of the guy who f****** gases

690
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:08,767
And murders

691
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:11,071
And murders and rapes and murders

692
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,655
They're not

693
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,471
His people he is not of these

694
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,007
He is a f****** moms

695
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,055
His people

696
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:24,127
His people are f******

697
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:29,247
Slobodan milosevic

698
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,295
The monsters of the of our history

699
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:35,903
I think it's a probably are most interested in their investment

700
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,695
The big made it have because they see

701
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,487
Chaos swayable

702
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,255
Government

703
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,791
It's Rhonda autocratic

704
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:45,375
Yep and it's a strategic position on what

705
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,679
Zbigniew Brzezinski

706
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:53,311
The great chessboard it's a hit point in the region and in the greater World in terms of

707
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,079
Influence

708
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,127
And approve time

709
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,687
Anytime. Kind of predatory vested interest

710
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:01,759
In keeping that outside of the sway of a democracy

711
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:04,319
Right outside of this way of liberal

712
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,391
I mean liberal in terms of

713
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,671
Free governor

714
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,463
You're the best

715
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,231
Everything that because

716
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,279
Create a very serious threat

717
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,815
To his ability to run

718
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,839
Oil

719
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,863
Through

720
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:20,959
The country that would cripple him as a as a

721
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,543
Probably more what

722
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,079
Then but I don't know

723
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,127
Ulta

724
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,663
Are there Heroes

725
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,199
I'm so at

726
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,503
Who is Zach his

727
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,063
He's pitched the narrative

728
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,599
The trop as apolitical

729
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,647
Biblical gun

730
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,439
Does a different take on what

731
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,463
Possibly could be going

732
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,143
Okay

733
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:50,911
Okay

734
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:57,311
MK Ultra

735
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:09,087
Could have either become a weird sociopathic monster

736
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,111
Orton Keyes

737
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:13,183
Mary prankster

738
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,231
I mean this is a mess

739
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,023
I mean even for like what

740
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:22,143
How far are you willing to go to excuse this thing you ate Trump for

741
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,167
You probably mind control

742
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,447
Probably

743
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,215
Ronald

744
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:26,751
Ridiculous

745
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,799
It's so weird

746
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:32,383
Tubes not that weird no no I mean

747
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,919
Type of almost

748
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,479
Textbook battered wife syndrome

749
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:42,367
Yeah like that's really kind of what it looks like your Alex constantly say

750
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:49,023
I feel like I just got broken up with I'm not a bruised woman near anything like

751
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:53,887
This is done wrong

752
00:52:54,399 --> 00:53:00,543
Committed

753
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:04,127
I think I don't know we'll see what ends up happening I think you take

754
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,663
I think he probably

755
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,967
Future hold

756
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:11,039
In terms of this video existing

757
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:14,111
But I would say I hope they take it down

758
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,671
And further I think

759
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,207
That whoever allowed him

760
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:18,975
To do this

761
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,255
Gave us

762
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,279
A great boon

763
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,863
Did a very serious just serviced Alex

764
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,679
Whoever allowed him to be on air is like

765
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,727
They might be working at cross-purposes

766
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:35,103
They might be going into business for themselves

767
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:38,175
Cuz he's there in the background

768
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,711
Actress of question

769
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,503
Look at how much bucks

770
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,271
Compressor kit

771
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:48,927
Sure but it's not good it's not good

772
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:54,559
Goes back to work Sunday or whatever today

773
00:53:55,071 --> 00:54:01,215
Start do you know what happened

774
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:05,567
Trump is doing something different this is what happened

775
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:09,151
This is what would happen if Trump was being serious

776
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,431
But I know he's not

777
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:13,247
Now but you know that my principles are intact

778
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,271
What

779
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,319
Would leave him

780
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:25,279
Well there's that but then there's also the existence of this thing as I got

781
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:30,143
Being a total baby on air

782
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:40,127
And it's just like if it was only deep-seated issues are arising because of

783
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:42,943
Trump there Larry there is a way Alex

784
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,479
Could have done this

785
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:46,015
Exact report

786
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,551
And it not be damaged

787
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,575
You know what I'm saying

788
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,855
Like there's a well

789
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,415
There's a way he could have got on air

790
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,719
For the last two

791
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,999
3 years

792
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,047
Already you're wrong because

793
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:58,815
Sounds

794
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,887
Very conciliatory in profession

795
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:05,471
That's what I'm saying he could have been professional about it

796
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:07,007
I have not Galaxy

797
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,103
You know the reasons why I have

798
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:15,455
I've gotten information from people that has led me to believe x y and z

799
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,247
This development

800
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,783
With bombing Syria

801
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,319
He's incredibly troubling

802
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:23,135
To meet because I trust my sources that have told me

803
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,951
Complete bulshit

804
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:30,047
Line about Russia and Assad and our military

805
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,583
Facts behind Obama's back

806
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,119
I believe that

807
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,167
And now what I'm coming to see is

808
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,703
Is that Trump is not a part

809
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:39,007
Of this world view that I have believed

810
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,055
And therefore I must

811
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:41,823
Say

812
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,103
I do

813
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,687
Even now

814
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,967
He is not

815
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,503
Really admitting he's

816
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,319
He's saying he was betrayed

817
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:58,719
Of course which is a very different thing you just described was a man admitting he was wrong

818
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:03,071
Get away from your wrong by saying I believe my sources that I had

819
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:07,423
And I was wrong my sources lied to me

820
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,703
Or my sources had

821
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,471
Something wrong

822
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,519
That they burn all the sources

823
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:15,615
If he flips on Trump he's got a bird a lot of people

824
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:24,575
None of them a real swell.

825
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:30,719
If he if he continues down this road and is anti-trump

826
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,999
Here's a lot of question

827
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:37,119
The desperately need to be asked about Rodger Stone on everyday and co-host

828
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,911
The War Room

829
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:43,519
Like he's a very massive piece of the operation that needs to be explained

830
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,543
Cuz Rodger

831
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,311
Turn on Trump

832
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,175
Rodger can turn on

833
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,223
But just for that

834
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:57,599
If you have to have a good time like legitimately if we're talking about real-world stuff and not entertainment if

835
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,415
He's got to go Beanie Sigel on this s***

836
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,695
Estates property

837
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,255
He's got to get in the witness protection program

838
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:06,047
Because he knows too much

839
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:09,631
Oh yeah

840
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:16,031
With what Rodger stones into Rodger stone is our situation

841
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,311
Just don't polonium poison

842
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,591
That I believe

843
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:25,247
What you mean the times you tried to fake polonium poisoning

844
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,623
So I can Poison by polonium Rob do data

845
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,463
I don't know

846
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,767
But I think it was him because

847
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:37,791
No

848
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:40,863
Rob do because he's got to save the ship

849
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,655
Do you know that Alex

850
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,423
Check his hands dirty

851
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:50,079
This Gathering robbed the fixer

852
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:51,871
Competency

853
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,151
Fixer in the history of the world

854
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:57,503
The more I think about it the more I think there's way more up with Rob do than we even

855
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:58,527
Acknowledged

856
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,551
Cuz he's so boring

857
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:05,695
He's our Kevin Spacey he's verbal Kint

858
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:08,255
Be there usual

859
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,023
Forever

860
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:12,351
Infowars trenches for

861
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,375
Probably

862
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,167
Almost a decade

863
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:15,935
That's crazy

864
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:18,751
I have to assume there's a

865
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,799
On the emails and he knows he's up

866
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:24,383
Nothing he's up-to-date bad works or whatever

867
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,431
I think we might be giving him a pass

868
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:31,039
I might need to look more into Rob do we overlooked him as was his

869
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,319
Goal all along

870
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,855
That's right anyway

871
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:39,487
They're guessing interior was Alex

872
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,511
You talk about it

873
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:53,055
Is like a round over Trump

874
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,383
He's going to bomb

875
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,151
Yeah

876
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:16,351
How do you breathe

877
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,679
Okay

878
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:57,055
I swore on air and

879
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,383
CiCi's paying attention Alex

880
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:05,247
But this is a theme to keep in track

881
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:07,295
You

882
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,855
So

883
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:13,439
I don't know about that

884
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,487
So

885
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:16,767
Releaf

886
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,559
Is

887
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:19,583
Alex

888
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,119
Only one who

889
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:21,887
F******

890
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:22,911
Get it

891
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:35,711
Careful

892
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,479
Alex's

893
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:39,551
The only one who is listening to what Trump is saying going

894
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:41,087
This is f***** up

895
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:42,111
He lied

896
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,391
He liked.

897
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,927
He doesn't mean

898
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,975
Because a liar

899
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:48,767
You doing all this s***

900
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:51,583
I don't think

901
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,631
Feared meaning

902
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,471
Lego

903
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,495
Not there

904
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:00,543
They're all so meaningless and

905
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,823
Nothing

906
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,847
Their own

907
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:05,151
Nothing

908
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,431
Turn on trumpet they want

909
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:11,295
Singular idea and they're f****** head

910
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,319
Sir Alex like

911
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:14,623
Trump is Daddy and I can

912
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:17,695
Like Steve and Rodger Stoner Daddy

913
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,511
To all of his employees Alex

914
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:25,119
There is this

915
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,167
Placate him and calm him down

916
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:31,775
And then they're eventually going to have abusive relationships themselves in order to Tryon

917
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:34,591
And fix it

918
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,639
I like just say really quick

919
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,663
I'm not seeing the

920
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:41,503
The chat so people are pointing out anything that is very

921
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,295
Cool I don't see it

922
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,575
I apologize

923
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,599
What the deal is

924
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:46,623
But

925
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,183
One of the things one of the

926
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,463
Convictions that we have

927
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,487
Express tonight

928
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,255
Standby

929
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,047
Is that Alex's

930
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:54,815
Expressing

931
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,607
But his allegiances lie

932
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,911
Difficulty with Russia not with Donald Trump

933
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,775
Could not be made more clear that in this

934
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,391
So

935
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,695
He wants our government to be like

936
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,767
This is this is actually

937
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:27,071
Probably the best evidence

938
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:27,839
That

939
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,375
Trump colluded with Russia

940
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,679
What they're describing right now

941
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,727
Because what I'm hearing is

942
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,519
The Echoes of

943
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,543
Russia being like

944
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,567
God dammit

945
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:41,663
You f****** a******

946
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,735
Fascinating

947
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:49,599
I didn't even think about that

948
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:50,623
That's

949
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,415
That's

950
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:01,887
He's a f****** lunatic so if we're to believe

951
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,263
Concerned about

952
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,031
The saddest

953
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,847
They were live

954
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,383
Nothing is going well

955
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,151
Technology

956
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,431
Oh no

957
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,223
What

958
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,783
I'm seeing the stream going out of my mind

959
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,807
On my phone

960
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,255
Now you're good

961
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,303
Is a foot

962
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,583
Anyway

963
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,375
Yeah

964
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,167
Brewery

965
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:42,591
You were in

966
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:46,431
Is entirely in line with Russia finding out that they have been

967
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:51,039
Yeah if you imagine if you imagine if you know Alex Jones assertive

968
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,343
Secondary station

969
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,111
4

970
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,415
Did these narratives

971
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,183
That does make sense

972
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:01,791
I never I didn't I not variable of it

973
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,071
Before

974
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:05,631
Expresses impotent rage

975
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:06,655
He is not used to it

976
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,263
In this next clip

977
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,543
Alex Jones

978
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:14,591
Zach

979
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:15,871
Fake

980
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,919
Source is Zack

981
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,711
They talked about what

982
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:23,039
That be great if this was actually

983
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,855
Call evaristo great

984
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,391
Secret Improv

985
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,439
This is

986
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:33,535
Is the moment that I'm making the argument that Zack belongs

987
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,559
Amazon Project

988
01:04:55,295 --> 01:05:01,439
Hold on

989
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,719
Maybe we're not

990
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,359
This is a fight for Mars

991
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:25,503
Okay

992
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,575
Where you go through

993
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:31,647
He goes for Big Stone

994
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:36,767
All right yeah that's right they're trying to keep us back on planet

995
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,559
Dermografo coronavirus real

996
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,447
Okay cool

997
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:47,263
I'm glad

998
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,031
So Gone

999
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,079
So now you get to

1000
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:52,127
Keep track of your dick

1001
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:56,479
If anyone ignores you from now on it's Jordan not me

1002
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,807
But I love that cuz

1003
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,855
It's a way of making it like

1004
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:05,183
Conspiracy really revolves around it's not what you

1005
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:05,951
You think it is

1006
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:10,047
Everything is a distraction with the real thing

1007
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,607
You know when you take it

1008
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:15,679
Would you take it from this is really terrible no one should

1009
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,959
No one's into this

1010
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:19,263
But it's actually about Mars

1011
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,031
You can

1012
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:25,407
This was all actually about Mars

1013
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:31,807
Where did that way better world to live in for all of the all of the geopolitical

1014
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,599
Conflicts that are currently going on

1015
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,367
It look

1016
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,391
You go to Miami

1017
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:41,791
You go to f****** Burma you go to the rohingya

1018
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:47,679
Philippine dealers are just quotes

1019
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:54,079
For people who don't want to go to Mars it's all code

1020
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:58,175
They have a base on Mars and don't want us to

1021
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:02,271
They're working with the Raptors

1022
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:08,671
Course Mark Richardson fight against them from inside Vacaville prison

1023
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:14,559
Here's why and what area

1024
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,863
Pavilion building

1025
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,631
Well

1026
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:20,191
Research Center

1027
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:26,591
Call could be

1028
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,383
That argument but unfortunately it turns

1029
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:30,431
She's an Egypt right now leading a

1030
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,199
Study group

1031
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:32,223
What Stewart's

1032
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:37,343
Egypt with a with a study group and so that's why she hasn't any videos out lately

1033
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:41,439
Go to Egypt

1034
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,487
Enjoy her being

1035
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:44,511
No she's a

1036
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:46,303
She's a tourist it's not like

1037
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:50,399
Conference there anything

1038
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:55,263
Jesus going to go to the pyramids and be like check out all these aliens

1039
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:57,567
Church group therapy bring like that it's

1040
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:03,199
Anyway that's why she hasn't done her Mark Richards update number 8

1041
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,783
I'm excited

1042
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:07,551
Anyway

1043
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:10,111
I told you the exact should not be listened to

1044
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:15,487
And that means there's 100

1045
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:19,583
Use blowing mind pretend torpor

1046
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,607
Presents himself as a

1047
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,375
Someone who's in the most

1048
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,143
High levels

1049
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,167
Military Intel

1050
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:25,215
And you would think

1051
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,751
That is

1052
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:30,079
Being in that position he would know who the Joint Chiefs of Staff

1053
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,711
Frankly at this point

1054
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,479
No one does

1055
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:37,247
Half of them

1056
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,015
Are there

1057
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,039
Joseph Dunford

1058
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,391
Alex starts talking about this guy

1059
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,695
And I tried to get

1060
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:48,255
Owen is no idea

1061
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:51,071
Really should f****** know

1062
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:52,607
Doesn't

1063
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:59,775
On the phone

1064
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:13,855
I don't know

1065
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,751
If you want true comedy

1066
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:33,055
Alex said Dunford at the beginning of the

1067
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:35,615
The clip and is trying to come up with his name

1068
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:39,967
Oh you already said you would do you know who you're talking about

1069
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,527
So I have no idea

1070
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,295
She's established

1071
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,575
I probably should know

1072
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,183
McMaster

1073
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:55,839
And McMasters out which he is

1074
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,567
Eager

1075
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:13,759
Your Source still in play

1076
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,807
The f*** are you listen to this guy for

1077
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:22,207
Insights that he can bring that nobody else can

1078
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:22,975
Battle For Mars

1079
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,279
So this first guess not great

1080
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,303
Not great

1081
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,327
Alex

1082
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:33,983
But it does sort of like Trump is being blackmailed or there's a gun

1083
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:37,311
To his head

1084
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,639
God damn phone

1085
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,711
It's over 9000

1086
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,783
Joel skousen is a survivalist weirdo

1087
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,575
Do I also

1088
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:54,463
Disney nephew of w Cleon skousen monster if

1089
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:57,535
Who's responsible for a lot of terrible right wing

1090
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:01,631
World that we will do a whole episode

1091
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:04,447
It does not deserve to be talked about now

1092
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:06,495
Joel skousen

1093
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,847
For Eyes terrible as he is

1094
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,151
He gave up on Trump

1095
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:13,919
Before

1096
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,455
He is

1097
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,247
Clear about this

1098
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:19,039
And that's why he hasn't been on the show

1099
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:19,807
Quarterback

1100
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,855
And they talked about that a little bit

1101
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,135
But Alex asked

1102
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,671
How did they do it

1103
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,975
Skousen has a real

1104
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,615
All right there we go

1105
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,575
Jobs

1106
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:57,695
Well first of all the stuff you said about Trump being smart not true he's a f****** idiot

1107
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,231
First off

1108
01:11:59,487 --> 01:11:59,999
Trump

1109
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:03,839
Is dumb and lazy and he's too busy

1110
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,631
Trump let me tell you something

1111
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,399
Is a

1112
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,215
Boron Alex Trump is the dumbest

1113
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:11,263
F****** president we've had since

1114
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,543
George Jung

1115
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:16,127
He is so f****** stupid

1116
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:18,943
Get the chance to understand a word he f****** said

1117
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:22,271
Skousen goes on to say like

1118
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,903
Curative

1119
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:30,719
You'll notice a certain shift

1120
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:31,487
Prozac

1121
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,255
Narrative

1122
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,023
And Joel

1123
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:35,071
Meredith and Alex agrees with both

1124
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,607
Because he's just

1125
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,143
Lisa malleable Lappy

1126
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:40,447
Piece of s***

1127
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:47,615
Because right now if if he brought low if he had a

1128
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,639
Rajasthan Alex

1129
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,919
Would be a Scientologist

1130
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,687
At the end of this

1131
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,991
Well I'm not sure about

1132
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:56,575
Because there are things that are malleable there's things that are wobbly

1133
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:58,367
In terms of the narrative

1134
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,671
The one thing that is not malleable is

1135
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,439
Is it Alex Jones

1136
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,463
Russia

1137
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:39,071
That sounds exactly like you founded in 2008 when he was on RT

1138
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:42,143
Talking about how he is about America

1139
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:46,495
Dick

1140
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,359
I don't know

1141
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,127
Where

1142
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:53,663
Land

1143
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,967
Achieva

1144
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:01,087
What are your two paddocks

1145
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:03,903
The point that Alex is making is that

1146
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:07,487
Bombing Syria is a bad and stupid

1147
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:12,351
And it is a betrayal of what he thought was an isolationist

1148
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,887
Autocratic

1149
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:17,215
Right right I know nothing

1150
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,031
On one hand

1151
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,823
I agree Alex

1152
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,615
This was a bad idea

1153
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,919
On the other hand

1154
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:28,735
Not because

1155
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,271
We can agree on

1156
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,831
Like we can agree on the

1157
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,879
Conclusion while disagreeing about Prem

1158
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:39,487
That's very easy to do

1159
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:43,071
This thing is bad but

1160
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:43,839
I disagree

1161
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:44,863
The reason

1162
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,887
Right there.

1163
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:48,447
Fine as long as as long as we can

1164
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,983
We can both feel like

1165
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,031
Man I just don't like

1166
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:52,799
Like what he's

1167
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,591
Extol

1168
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,383
Suspiciously

1169
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,431
It's almost 2

1170
01:14:58,943 --> 01:14:59,967
B like I do

1171
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:03,807
Now I'm getting into conspiracy theories on my own

1172
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:17,631
Silly saying that he's not a Rusev I about a Roosevelt

1173
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:22,751
Super good writing you know the one who said

1174
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:25,823
Methinks you Dost protest too much

1175
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:27,615
He kind of knew what was up

1176
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,919
Whatever you said that Alex is a

1177
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,735
Existing in the listen I'm not the

1178
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,503
I love this

1179
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:35,551
Brett

1180
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,343
Rapid fire

1181
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:40,415
Like machine-gunning I'm not a racist but statement

1182
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,207
All over the place

1183
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,351
He's in a broken

1184
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:52,447
How could I have gotten that communicates so fast from

1185
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,471
Any kind of Russia

1186
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:55,519
Handler unless it was Darian

1187
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,543
Any

1188
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,919
Have we looked into robbed

1189
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:06,783
Americans is that where you came from

1190
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,575
Didn't get any word from a sucker

1191
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,599
Can Handler anything

1192
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:12,159
Sing like that. Just been his mode of operation

1193
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:18,303
I think much longer than we realized our investigation

1194
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,071
15 about

1195
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:22,911
One of the things that we noticed was even before he got on board

1196
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,191
He was

1197
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:27,007
In favor of Putin and Russia

1198
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:31,103
I think we might have done a disservice to our listeners

1199
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,639
And to ourselves

1200
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:34,431
By not taking that more serious

1201
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:35,967
And looking back

1202
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:37,247
To wear that big

1203
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:39,551
And I think that is going

1204
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,087
Would be a much more important question

1205
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,367
Ask ourselves

1206
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,647
Because I don't think

1207
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,183
I don't think it boils down

1208
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,487
I don't think it boils down to

1209
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,255
Anything like that

1210
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,279
I think

1211
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,047
He has been

1212
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,327
Hayward

1213
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,095
Ridiculously

1214
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,631
Sweeper

1215
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,423
Pro-russian

1216
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,215
Influence for a very long time

1217
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,495
After you

1218
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:00,287
I don't want to give too much away

1219
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,823
There's some stuff I've been looking

1220
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:07,711
I don't know if we'll ever be able to fully prove

1221
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:11,807
The just the very Occam's razor rethought of like

1222
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:13,087
Maybe he's just

1223
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,647
Of Russia

1224
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,183
Lakemore of autocrat

1225
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:23,583
It's something like that maybe it's just a fanatic movie is just like one of those guys who collects too much World War

1226
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:29,983
Memorabilia like it that's just how he feels about it

1227
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:33,311
Love so much let me relate this back to the episode we're going over now

1228
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:36,895
Does Joel skousen comes in

1229
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:38,175
Lesbian blackmail

1230
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:39,455
And skousen is like

1231
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:42,271
They're not blackmailing him

1232
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,063
If it tried to threaten him

1233
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,343
He would fight back against

1234
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:47,135
That's in his psychology that is

1235
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,159
Character

1236
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,183
He would he would

1237
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:53,791
Flattered

1238
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:57,631
They think of the people who wanted him to behave in certain ways

1239
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:00,191
And got him to do the thing

1240
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,983
I think it's probably

1241
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,543
Name of the game with Alex in Russia

1242
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:11,199
Like he's already gone on Aaron talk about that Artie interview that wasn't an RT interview

1243
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:17,087
That he was a genius and one of the best Americans

1244
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,367
Compromised

1245
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:21,695
Through flattery years and years ago and we realize

1246
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,487
So

1247
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,279
I think what I think

1248
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,303
When the history

1249
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,071
Free books are written

1250
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,095
There's going to be a lot of

1251
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:29,375
Complicated

1252
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,143
Reasonings behind

1253
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:32,447
Find a lot of stuff

1254
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:38,847
I think ultimately the answer to

1255
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,871
Daddy issues

1256
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,175
Call across-the-board

1257
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:43,711
Possibly

1258
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:46,271
I don't know if it's a it's a it's a hot mess but

1259
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,831
Skousen

1260
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,111
Andweknow

1261
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:50,879
But Alex Jones

1262
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:51,903
Entire narrative

1263
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:54,207
2 years

1264
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:54,975
Has been

1265
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,255
But there are good for

1266
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:57,791
Within the military

1267
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:01,631
And We Danced

1268
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,911
Against

1269
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:07,519
Against Obama in the morning Donald Trump

1270
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:11,615
State everything is yours Wisconsin

1271
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,383
Think about that

1272
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:46,687
Ogp when we elected Eisenhower president

1273
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:51,039
Boudoir you here drunky Alex they are

1274
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,183
Leesburg

1275
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:06,143
You shouldn't

1276
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,167
As you say it's all

1277
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,495
I don't need you

1278
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:13,311
I don't like what you've done for the last

1279
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:16,384
Finally admit that you're a f****** idiot

1280
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,176
Do it for me

1281
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,968
Joel f****** skousen

1282
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,064
We live in

1283
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,344
Such a bad world

1284
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,136
What we cover that's like

1285
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,024
Makes it very clear that like

1286
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,048
He gave up on Trump

1287
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,840
A while back cuz he realized

1288
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,608
She wasn't

1289
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:41,984
Competent he wasn't able to think wasn't able to be reliable and shouldn't

1290
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:46,848
Right I don't so he is already on the he's off the reservation and Alex

1291
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:47,872
Is talking to

1292
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,968
Kind of way and it's dislike

1293
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,552
Joel is trying to be like conciliatory in some ways of like

1294
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:56,576
Hey look

1295
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,624
You didn't even do anything wrong

1296
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,416
You you thought

1297
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,440
Did this was good

1298
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:02,464
But

1299
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,512
You got to get real with it

1300
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:05,792
This guy is not

1301
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,328
Trust him

1302
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:11,424
Yeah I've been saying it for a bit

1303
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:18,080
To where it's like you look at these people and you see them the same way that you do like followers of Charles

1304
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,104
Manson we are like

1305
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,384
How did you not

1306
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,408
See this coming

1307
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:23,712
How is this hitting you this

1308
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:28,832
It's hard I think that's our feeling and that's the reasons why

1309
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,904
Heads because like

1310
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:34,976
Welcome. Like I think I seen a couple tweets

1311
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:35,744
Better like

1312
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,024
Welcome to the resistor

1313
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:37,792
Since Alex Jones

1314
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:43,936
No it is it is Ludacris

1315
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,984
You've gotten this far without

1316
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:46,752
Thank God the chats

1317
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,312
It's Ludacris he's gotten the

1318
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,336
This far without

1319
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,104
Like

1320
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,128
Having any moment

1321
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,432
Anyway

1322
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:56,480
Tell you what

1323
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,504
We're about to enter

1324
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,344
Amman

1325
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,392
Alex Jones is about to make a claim that

1326
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,696
He's never talked about on a

1327
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:08,512
And I really don't think this is true

1328
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,328
Here we go

1329
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:09,184
Okay

1330
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,256
Okay

1331
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,304
Alright

1332
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:16,608
So you don't kill Alex

1333
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:18,144
Because he's too public

1334
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,960
But you don't

1335
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:27,360
Family members as a warning letter for record that phone call

1336
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:33,760
Business has been his whole narrative forever is like in the public eye

1337
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:37,600
Or what have you. Bulshit

1338
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,904
The idea that

1339
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,184
Videos of

1340
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,208
Secure

1341
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,768
First of all the Black Ops helicopter

1342
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:46,048
Pilot in Vietnam

1343
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:50,400
Who came back from Latin America and said that what they're doing to the children

1344
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,168
In what

1345
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:57,824
All of Latin America Larry Nichols with lyrics

1346
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,592
Doing of the children

1347
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:00,384
I mean what I did to the children

1348
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:04,480
Little

1349
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,504
For your family to die.

1350
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,576
Pneumonia vaccines

1351
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:09,344
Maybe

1352
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,648
That's interesting

1353
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:15,744
Is no protection against

1354
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:18,048
There there's a secondary thing

1355
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,840
To hear though that's like

1356
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:22,912
I don't believe it

1357
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:28,288
I feel bad not believing someone talking about their family.

1358
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,848
But at the same time I don't

1359
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:31,616
Because

1360
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:33,408
He would have brought this up before

1361
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:35,712
For way before

1362
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:36,480
5 years

1363
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:38,272
That would be in 2030

1364
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,040
13 right

1365
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:39,808
So

1366
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,600
If I'm to understand what

1367
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:45,184
Immediately

1368
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,232
If I'm to believe

1369
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,512
His storyline

1370
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:53,120
They killed three members of his family and his response was

1371
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,424
Start selling weird pills

1372
01:24:57,216 --> 01:25:03,360
Because that's right around when he started doing the dr. Wallach stuff at be started those weird pills could have saved

1373
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:08,480
Maybe this whole weird

1374
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,064
It's possible but they're actually

1375
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:17,184
They're not bad for so many reasons are not dead

1376
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,488
They are sitting right at the desk with him

1377
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,560
Reno

1378
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:28,960
Believes that unertl

1379
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,008
I love Pharrell

1380
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,032
His early work

1381
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,312
Felt like happy

1382
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:39,200
This is

1383
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,480
Terrible

1384
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:44,064
Hyperallergic

1385
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,088
I can't

1386
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:46,368
I can't imagine a world

1387
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,392
Where in

1388
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,672
A globalist

1389
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:51,488
Who has weaponized pneumonia

1390
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:56,352
I killed three of Alex's family members pneumonia a disease which can be

1391
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:58,144
Buy multiple viruses

1392
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,936
Straight bacterias

1393
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:04,544
All kinds of different family members of pneumonia

1394
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,080
And then they call him and

1395
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,104
Hey b****

1396
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:09,664
What's up

1397
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:14,528
We kill we kill three members of your family

1398
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,552
So shut up

1399
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,832
Not like

1400
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:19,136
Say what we want you to say

1401
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:21,952
Comedy

1402
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:23,232
What's considered

1403
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:35,008
Black Ops helicopter

1404
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,384
His uncle was killed on purpose

1405
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,944
Pneumonia like legitimately

1406
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:49,344
Kills old people way more frequently than young people

1407
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,624
Who knows

1408
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:57,536
Did you not know about that secret progress all the globalist

1409
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:59,072
Immortality isn't real

1410
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,864
It's just the government always killing old paper

1411
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,680
River

1412
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:06,496
I think the most important thing I touch on this already but I need to read

1413
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:08,288
He said spider

1414
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,080
No way

1415
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:13,152
No way for his own

1416
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,248
If you wanted to say 4 years ago

1417
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,808
Maybe you can play that game

1418
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,344
Cuz I bet around

1419
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,368
Time

1420
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,136
Ukraine

1421
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:25,696
The Korea situation in 2014

1422
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:27,232
I bet he changes to in a bit

1423
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:28,768
Might of

1424
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:30,304
So I bet he could say

1425
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:34,400
Cuz of Russia

1426
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,960
35 years ago does not work

1427
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:39,008
13 doesn't work

1428
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:39,776
Play narrative

1429
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:41,312
That's possibly call Alex

1430
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,688
We could write such good narrative for him he would

1431
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:47,968
F****** loses mine

1432
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,760
I forgot that we were supposed to make a huge now

1433
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,600
Should we do it or should we wait

1434
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:54,880
We have to now

1435
01:27:55,136 --> 01:28:01,280
Well let's make a hour and a half into the podcast announcement really huge announcement to make

No

1447
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,408
Also I think we could probably get

1448
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,432
A number of people

1449
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:52,992
Tagged

1450
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:55,040
I think there are a couple of

1451
01:28:56,064 --> 01:29:00,672
Knowledge fight episode let's just do an Alex

1452
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:02,720

1453
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,512
Adobe amazing

1454
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:06,816

1455
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:11,424

4 / 6

1458
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:17,568
Plastic

1459
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:20,640
Anyway so we will be in Austin on June

He'll be exciting

1462
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:30,624
Kevin Kelly Hazard guess I can respond to think

1463
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:33,952
Famous equipale explains why the globalists

1464
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:34,720
Harbor Freight

1465
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:41,888
Call Matt

1466
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,656
It's not related to a diode

1467
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:16,960
This is the other theme

1468
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:21,056
I love this little talk easily blackmail

1469
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:23,104
Maybe he's done all of the crime

1470
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:25,920
Or whatever

1471
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:28,224
Or whatever

1472
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,528
Maybe they'll get somebody else who maybe has

1473
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,832
And committed all those crimes that for the past two years

1474
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,112
We have been interesting

1475
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:35,904
And would never come

1476
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:42,304
Absolutely

1477
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:46,656
Exactly crimes that we're talking about

1478
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:50,496
Who knows

1479
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,872
Committed all the blackmail

1480
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:56,896
Right

1481
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:58,944
Yeah it's it's it's

1482
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:04,064
Beetle

1483
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,600
They don't have a thought

1484
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:07,136
Like he can just

1485
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:08,416
Toss that off

1486
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,440
As though it's not

1487
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:13,280
Piece of information that he has been denying

1488
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:14,816
Horse

1489
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:21,216
But with the same thing as being one of the shut up

1490
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:24,032
Are we

1491
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:30,432
Fetishize the truth

1492
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:33,248
Such a nut then

1493
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:36,320
Larry that's really important

1494
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:37,600
Visit the other trends

1495
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:39,648
It keeps coming up on this road

1496
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:40,416
Played a bunch of

1497
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:42,720
34 x

Weather

1499
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:46,816
F****** Trump didn't make us

1500
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:48,608
Trump

1501
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,168
And I'd like to say

1502
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,216
No

1503
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,008
No

1504
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,544
Trump memes

1505
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,080
By coming on your show

1506
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:00,128
Early adopter

1507
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,688
That's definitely true they were early on the Trump

1508
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:08,320
Bad before a lot of people dead but I think that's because they really resonated with that

1509
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:09,600
Talking husky

1510
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:10,368
People out of our

1511
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:11,392
Countrywide

1512
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:14,720
That sort of Vine

1513
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:18,048
Their whole thing is like

1514
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:19,840
You know what

1515
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:20,608
Maybe he is black

1516
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:21,376
Like malleable

1517
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:26,496
Easily blackmail blackmail he said

1518
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:28,544
Anyone with Google could blackmail

1519
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,824
But what about the

1520
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,848
The next time

1521
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,128
What are the next

1522
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:33,664
Guy who comes along

1523
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:36,736
Who's that who's not blackmail bellizza paper

1524
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:38,016
Like her like that

1525
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,648
What happened to Rand Paul

1526
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:46,720
What happened with Ron Paul

1527
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:53,632
I kind of bet those guys are easily black malleable

1528
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:58,752
Put my blackmail

1529
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:01,824
You have supported people and it's been nothing

1530
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:05,664
Even when the Paul Ryan became Speaker of the House

1531
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,432
I was just like

1532
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:12,832
Taking down Boehner we're going to get a patriot in there let's see what's up Paul Ryan.

1533
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:18,208
Read the text, and congratulations on your retirement

1534
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:21,280
You dumbass hole

1535
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:27,680
Massively corrupt politicians are

1536
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:29,216
It's about us

1537
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:30,496
Not about Trump

1538
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,824
F*** that

1539
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,872
The Tea Party Movement is about

1540
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:42,272
People standing up against Obama and tyranny definitely not racism and definitely not owned

1541
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,808
And stoked by the Koch brothers

1542
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:46,880
Not even tea party s*** anymore it's now morphed into like this

1543
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:48,416
The other thing

1544
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,952
Yeah

1545
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:53,792
Video

1546
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:56,096
Create

1547
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:59,168
Good luck

1548
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,008
There's always another redhead

1549
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:07,616
But I look forward to whatever their next play is going to be down this road but course I know that it's

1550
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:08,384
Not going to have

1551
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:09,920
I get back on Trump

1552
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:11,712
Is deck

1553
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,760
Why we live in this moment

1554
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:16,064
Before our

1555
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:17,600
Obvious

1556
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,184
Conclusions are you know what sucks is that like

1557
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:24,000
Even as we're recording this on Saturday

1558
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:26,048
Probably jump

1559
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:27,328
Himself out

1560
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:29,376
What would you do

1561
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:36,800
Your son was at home lying on the floor of the bedroom

1562
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:43,200
Francois

1563
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,296
This is such a gift

1564
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:48,320
For Alex though

1565
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:54,720
SARS

1566
01:34:58,816 --> 01:34:59,328
Can't really dismount

1567
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,888
Here is the redline

1568
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:03,168
Play Jump

1569
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:03,936
Write off

1570
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,472
Become

1571
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:08,032
The warrior that you are always meant to

1572
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:10,848
Superman

1573
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:15,200
The president you become an antihero you be the guy

1574
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:18,016
Turn from a f****** a you're you're there

1575
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:21,856
Clear the trailer that becomes a hero come on man

1576
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,136
It would take

1577
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:28,000
It would take like like I said earlier when we talked about this it would take burning Rodger Stone

1578
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:31,328
It would take burning a couple other sources idiot

1579
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:37,728
He has to disavow season for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce

1580
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:40,800
Disavowal

1581
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:42,592
He has to get rid of

1582
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:43,872
You have to change up

1583
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:46,176
So much as possible

1584
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:49,248
Who is irreplaceable

1585
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:52,832
Other than Rodger Stone and not for the reasons that are beneficial to app

1586
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:55,392
How many show existed before Rodger Stone if it's after

1587
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,952
Will be lost

1588
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:59,488
Stupid boat

1589
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,304
3D wooden

1590
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,584
We would have the strength

1591
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,400
To f****** come up with some even more insane

1592
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:09,472
That's possible

1593
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:14,848
Right now

1594
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:17,920
Stephen Curry

1595
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:19,712
Closer to Project Camelot

1596
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:26,880
What the word like what's up to

1597
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:33,280
Berlusconi

1598
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:34,816
When you're off the Trump train

1599
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:35,840
Or just like

1600
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:36,864
Own it

1601
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:40,192
You know like whenever whenever your car is slipping on ice

1602
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:40,960
You are

1603
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:43,008
You're not supposed to turn against

1604
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:45,312
You're supposed to lean into the axe

1605
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:48,128
Why not just be like

1606
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,664
We love Russia

1607
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:51,456
What up

1608
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:56,064
Publix completely out now

1609
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:59,392
Like Alexander Dugan takes over for Rodger Stone

1610
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:02,464
Why not

1611
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,256
American art

1612
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:09,888
You're already halfway there

1613
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:11,936
There's no there's no reason why

1614
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:12,960
He can't do that

1615
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:14,752
He's halfway there already

1616
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:17,824
No that's what I'm saying that's what I'm saying

1617
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,360
The moment that you would

1618
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:24,224
Created a break point where your audience is actually willing to go along with you like this.

1619
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:26,784
If you're any info Warrior chances are

1620
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:30,112
You are viral ugly pro-trump but at the same time

1621
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,648
Anti

1622
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:34,720
Going into the Middle East and f****** s*** up again

1623
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:37,792
Really

1624
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:38,560
Come

1625
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:43,680
This beautiful new single here's the chance to get back

1626
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:47,008
The credibility

1627
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:53,408
Will it be fun if I show got to turn into something new as well like I would like to follow along.

1628
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:55,712
Fucken Trump s***

1629
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,136
4life

1630
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:05,696
But you can recapture that like

1631
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:08,000
False credibility that he had back when he was against

1632
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:08,768
What's George

1633
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:12,352
Or George W bush do that but

1634
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,120
I don't think he's going

1635
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:17,216
This episode

1636
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:19,008
It's going to be like when Trump broke his heart

1637
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,544
Piratu

1638
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,312
Clips

1639
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:23,104

Now here's the next one

1644
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:22,496
Man that clip makes the inevitable today

1645
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:23,520
Hey I'm sorry

01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:24,544
72 wayward

1647
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,616
The reason why

1648
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:28,896
Might get buried

1649
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:33,248
We already saw that in the you like Twitter clip look like

1650
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,136
Celine was viewing

1651
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:41,440
In the background there a little bit

1652
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:43,744
When I was recording this I don't know why I

1653
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,768
I thought I'd muted the mic

1654
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,048
The mics were on

1655
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:49,632
And not so you here like I might Mouse click every now and again

1656
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:54,240
Making her she wasn't thrilled of this either

1657
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:58,080
But

1658
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,640
Absolutely I'll talk to her about it

1659
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:01,664
I'm so Alex

1660
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:02,688
Cursing is like

1661
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:04,736
Yeah these are

1662
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:06,272
F*** you I'm going to get your ass

1663
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:07,808
He is shoving

1664
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:09,088
Isis

1665
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:11,904
Up his dirty

1666
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,184
Dirty

1667
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,720
He needs a prophylactic

1668
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:20,864
Because he's shoving his dirty asphalt

1669
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,424
Right

1670
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:27,264
Circumstance so creative

1671
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,032
To say

1672
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:34,432
First time I've heard Alex wearing

1673
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:36,224
Hayward

1674
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:38,016
We're on stations are there

1675
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,040
She controls

1676
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:42,880
Answer here is where Owen Shroyer says the only reasonable thing

1677
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:43,904
Entire Brock

1678
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:51,584
Okay

1679
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:56,704
You've been swearing so much

1680
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,240
We're out of delay

1681
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:00,544
Can't

1682
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,080
Delay the show anymore

1683
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:03,360
To bleep you swearing

1684
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:05,664
Maybe we should get off air

1685
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:09,504
Obituaries legitimately that's his play wasting like

1686
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:10,784
You're drunk

1687
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:11,552
We should

1688
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:12,320
Stop this

1689
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:14,112
They do another 40 min

1690
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:15,904
Golf courses

1691
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,440
You maybe maybe like half an hour

1692
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:20,768
Alex tries to stop swearing

1693
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:23,072
In service of stopping swearing

1694
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:27,424
This is a weird clip I don't really even know how to

1695
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:28,704
I don't know how to

1696
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:29,728
Set this up so I won't

1697
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:30,496
What do it

1698
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:29,888
It says that a lot

1699
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:30,912
Get your ass

1700
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:31,936
He loved

1701
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:34,752
Either he loves to kick him

1702
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:43,456
I can't remember the rest of the lyrics to Billy Gunn is being song Mr at from the WWE

1703
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:50,624
Great song

1704
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:55,744
Josiah pre-show

1705
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,328
Batman

1706
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:05,216
Littleton

1707
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:10,336
That's always great

1708
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:14,432
Picture of a pro wrestling intro sogs

1709
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:19,552
I think this rash like that's way up there

1710
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:20,832
With like

1711
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:24,928
Hear the glass break if you do Stone Cold's,

1712
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:28,768
Tops of the charts

1713
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,840
So

1714
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:38,240
People go to Russia because you can murder a Christian

1715
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:40,288
Haitian never murdered

1716
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:42,080
I don't I don't

1717
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:50,016
Pissed off about the

1718
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:51,296
Situation

1719
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:57,696
The geopolitical situation

1720
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:00,256
Killer Christian anymore

1721
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:03,072
I would pause

1722
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,120
If you are rich enough

1723
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:07,936
But you can go on a vacation

1724
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:09,216
It Russia

1725
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:10,240
You can do it

1726
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:16,128
You'd be able to do very similar things

1727
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:16,896
UB about the law

1728
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:21,248
Anyway

1729
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:23,040
We're coming towards the end

1730
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:26,880
This this hot pile of garbage

1731
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:29,440
Ava Alex

1732
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:30,976
I'm loving

1733
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:36,096
I think that what you see if you watched the entire thing which I'm not entirely sure

1734
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:42,752
It's 3 hours long and most of it's really boring in them just repeating the Syrian gas in

1735
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,544
False flag

1736
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:47,872
If you to watch it what you see is like Alex

1737
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:50,176
S*** the beginning of it

1738
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:52,224
Olympic wrestling in the middle

1739
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,784
And it was dead certain in the middle of it as I was watching

1740
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:57,344
Oh he's going to end this with a I like

1741
01:44:59,392 --> 01:44:59,904
We got to give

1742
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:02,208
Or something like that

1743
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:03,232
But

1744
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,000
Here's what he says

1745
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:20,128
That's where he's at

1746
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:23,200
God for the Russian

1747
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:24,736
Thank God for The Rush

1748
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:29,600
That's all I mean I kind of sums up his mentality you probably would like to

1749
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,368
Able to knock

1750
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:31,136
Know that

1751
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:32,160
I would assume

1752
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:33,696
That's really Direct

1753
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:36,256
Doctors that is really pro-russia

1754
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:41,632
Propaganda right there's already said earlier government was more like Russia

1755
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:43,168
But damn

1756
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,728
So in this next clip

1757
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:46,496
We have one more

1758
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:47,776
Is the last clip

1759
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:48,800
I did

1760
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:50,080
Not record

1761
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:50,848
The last

1762
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:53,152
Part of the episode as it goes out

1763
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,432
Because it's just

1764
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:56,992
Shroyer trying to do

1765
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:58,272
Weather like

1766
01:45:58,528 --> 01:45:59,296
Hey maybe the wife

1767
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:03,904
Like I told

1768
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:07,488
Yeah and it's terrible that goes on way too f****** long

1769
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:11,840
But it's more important that

1770
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:12,608
Before that

1771
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:14,400
We get this clip

1772
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:15,680
Alex

1773
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:16,448
Conceding defeat

1774
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:18,752
Being facetious

1775
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:19,520
Subway

1776
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:21,824
But keep your ears open for the hiccupping

1777
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,616
Cuz he is drunk as f***

1778
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:40,928
Explain to me

1779
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:43,232
How you can get to this is the left

1780
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:46,560
Just because they're there

1781
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:51,168
Is there a is there cuz you have to Project online

1782
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:55,264
These are my enemies if I feel bad they must have one

1783
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:59,360
Meanwhile every legitimate left voice that I am aware of it

1784
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:01,408
Very dense

1785
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:03,968
This is not

1786
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,248
And they're not like

1787
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,784
Hahaha Alex

1788
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:08,320
You're stupid

1789
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:09,856
Haha look at you

1790
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:12,416
Look at you look what Trump did it's more like

1791
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:13,952
F****** a******

1792
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:16,000
How did you not get this earlier

1793
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:18,560
LED takes this for you to wake up

1794
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:19,840
You stupid prick

1795
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:24,960
It's more that when it don't know no way I

1796
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:27,776
The AAA

1797
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:28,544
Democratic

1798
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:31,104
Establishments

1799
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:36,736
Posturing

1800
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,856
Bush do whatever the f*** he wanted

1801
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:46,976
It was a delete the whole message

1802
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:50,560
War Powers being tired

1803
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:56,960
I know I don't wait for your left up an escape blame for this phone

1804
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:02,592
Is impotent as f*** I'm not siding with that

1805
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:04,896
But I like

1806
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:07,712
Truly liberal movements voices

1807
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:08,736
That you see

1808
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:10,784
Very clearly expressing

1809
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,064
Themselves

1810
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:15,648
Press releases Through official Twitter accounts

1811
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:22,048
Some stuff like that making their voices clear that like you're not allowed anywhere near Powers course

1812
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:25,888
Allowed to go on

1813
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:26,912
TV

1814
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:30,496
Rory end up with

1815
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:31,264
Region

1816
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:32,800
We can look at this

1817
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:34,336
And I guarantee

1818
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:37,920
Where's a guarantee Iowa I-80 guarantee because who knows

1819
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:39,456
But I strongly

1820
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:40,992
Strongly believe

1821
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:43,040
Chris back within the next

1822
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:50,208
Text h yeah I think once he gets his marching orders

1823
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:54,048
What time is it

1824
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,352
3 Series probably woken up

1825
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:58,912
He's hungover

1826
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:03,776
I give them two hours some coffee if you energy drinks and then he's going to be like

1827
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:04,544
I would like

1828
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:08,640
I'm starting to suspect that most of his products are actually hangover cures

1829
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:10,432
Because like the amount of

1830
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:11,712
Like the level of drunk

1831
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:15,808
Next day and he's not just like

1832
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,904
40 something

1833
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:28,608
No he Alka-Seltzer

1834
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:31,168
His products are hangover cures and that's the

1835
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:34,240
2018

1836
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:37,568
So we can drink as hard as

1837
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,616
I might have to start getting those products

1838
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:41,920
See if they help with hangovers

1839
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:48,320
As a 33-year old man I got trouble

1840
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:49,088
Fun to watch

1841
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:52,160
Alex have an embarrassing crying

1842
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:54,464
Drunk stupid meltdown

1843
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:55,744
Ordered

1844
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,536
Definitely worth remembering

1845
01:50:58,304 --> 01:50:59,840
Is this is a turning point

1846
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:00,608
Hooray

1847
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:03,424
Because this show will be a lot more interesting

1848
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:04,448
Bananas in

1849
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:08,032
Cuz he won't just be he'll turn into a

1850
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:09,568
Secondary source

1851
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:10,592
Supposed to just say

1852
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:11,872
Propaganda wing

1853
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:12,896
Donald Trump

1854
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:14,432
We'll see what happens

1855
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:15,456
But

1856
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:16,992
If you want to follow us

1857
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:19,040
You can find all are busy

1858
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:20,832
Another try.

1859
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:23,904
Absolutely you can follow us on Twitter that knowledge

1860
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:26,720
Four fights final thoughts

1861
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:28,256
I feel like I cut you off by doing that

1862
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:30,304
Plug

1863
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:33,632
My final thoughts on this

1864
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:37,216
This is a wonderful last moment before we all die a nuclear fire

1865
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:43,616
That's what's going to happen that we were all going to die in the wars immediately follow

1866
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:44,896
Devastation

1867
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:51,296
The climate change brings upon our water supply that'll happen but this is that

1868
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:55,136
I don't think world is ending and I'm going to die within the next

1869
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:56,672
Twenty years at least make it quick

1870
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:58,720
I don't think that's going to happen at all I think

1871
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:01,024
I think this is all fairly coordinated by

1872
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:02,560
Russia's not go

1873
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,632
They posture is well in the same way that

1874
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:07,680
