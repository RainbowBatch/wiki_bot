1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:07,424
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:13,312
Voice you will be hearing

4
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,760
The structure of the show is

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,552
I know a lot about Alex Jones

6
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:32,768
In the world

7
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,792
You were joining us

8
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,864
Two of our in-depth

9
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,424
Exploration

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,448
Alex Jones

11
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,008
The 2009 documentary and heavy quotes

12
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:43,776
Documentary

13
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:45,824
If you are

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,896
Just randomly jumping

15
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,432
The first episode before this one

16
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,968
Because otherwise

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,808
Which is always a lot of fun

18
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,344
It's always fun to find those

19
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,624
Is it like

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,488
But where we left off in the last episode was

21
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,256
Was just about to

22
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,024
Introduce

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
Is proof the evidence

24
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
But he has

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,864
Vexed

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,656
New World Order was being announced

27
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,680
Media

28
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,216
Media in 2008

29
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,568
The new world order for all this.

30
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,432
So we'll jump right back into that in a second

31
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,968
Before we do that I want to take a second

32
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,832
Because this is the Thanksgiving weekend in the spirit of thinking

33
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,648
How do people who make this show possible our donors

34
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,184
Who are the

35
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,488
Rescue invest in the first place

36
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,024
Obama.

37
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,328
I thought I would take a little bit of time

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,888
Joined up with the team

39
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,472
We appreciate it very much so

40
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
So much

41
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,800
You are now

42
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,968
Someone sodomites

43
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't want

44
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,912
The world today

45
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
Dust

46
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,544
And let's jump

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,848
To The Obama Deception part 2

48
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
And now

49
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736
After years of denial

50
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,040
The media and the elite themselves

51
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
Are proudly announcing

52
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,112
That not only

53
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,648
World government

54
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,928
What is the answer

55
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,208
To the financial crisis

56
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:46,400
Alex is improving with a carefully engineered

57
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
4

58
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,104
We've talked about in some manner in the past

59
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,504
That all don't say what headlines

60
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,296
A chance for a new world order

61
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,856
The financial times for a world government

62
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,136
Like they're all

63
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,160
Just conversation

64
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,560
Isracann

65
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
Israeli News

66
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
Yeah

67
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,704
But they're all just people

68
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
Hoes like

69
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,568
Possibility of a global government

70
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:29,152
None of them are an announcement that the New World Order

71
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:33,504
Also

72
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,296
Alex

73
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,344
Dominis article say those things

74
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:44,512
Piazza in Obama's new world order

75
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:51,936
Prodo world

76
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:56,800
You're probably arguing that state solution

77
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,360
There should be killed or whatever

78
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,664
Suddenly

79
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,248
The Wall Street Journal

80
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
And the getting rid of

81
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,344
A dollar for a common currency with Canada

82
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
Chicago

83
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:15,488
This is an article a flashes up on screen to Titleist which is how realistic is North America

84
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:21,887
Concurrency we talked about this

85
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,007
The financial times of London

86
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,311
Published by a member of the Bilderberg Group

87
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,383
Tutorial world

88
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
Shadows

89
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,991
And that it was now time

90
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
From behind the curtain

91
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
National Security

92
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,231
This is an article from the financial times called it now for a world government it was written by a guy named Gideon rack

93
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:02,591
Like I said this one

94
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,919
It also sounds like

95
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:12,319
He's a British dude you know it's like that

96
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:17,695
Overworld

97
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,047
2017

98
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:28,959
Trump's Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross

99
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
So did Lindsay

100
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,567
National Security advisor HR McMaster

101
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,223
Contra

102
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,295
I can find evidence of Gideon rackman

103
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
Is he number of times in

104
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
Capacity of the journal

105
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
Not as a

106
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
2000

107
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,327
None of this proves that he's a member of anything

108
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,143
Publicly opposed to position

109
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,543
Such as strongly arguing against the idea of England getting mixed up in the euro

110
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:11,199
Do do something today all globalist therefore

111
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
Wouldn't he be on board

112
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,319
With ditching the pound in favor of the euro

113
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,695
Vociferously defended

114
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Also

115
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
There's no such thing as being a member

116
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,167
The only membership category that exist is member of the steering

117
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,847
Membership

118
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,895
Steering committee is the group that plans

119
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
Meeting

120
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,967
Figures out like speakers

121
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,295
Cast of bunk'd

122
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,367
The rest of the attendees are

123
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
People who have

124
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,695
Prominent positions in business

125
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
The art

126
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,279
Industry dauberman

127
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:02,143
Diplomacy those Arts thing Mingle

128
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,191
That's

129
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
There isn't a member

130
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
Conspiracy blogs

131
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
I was like

132
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,319
$400 a night Hotel

133
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,863
Coffee

134
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,191
Ice cream truck

135
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:42,591
200 dollar a night Hotel

136
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,175
Absurd restaurant

137
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,087
Glorified

138
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,367
Work retreat

139
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Conference

140
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,023
Yeah

141
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
Team building event

142
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,239
Interested

143
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,519
Diplomacy

144
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Apple

145
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
This means nothing

146
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
You never one

147
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
A serious crisis

148
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Go to Waze

149
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,695
You think you could not do before

150
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,839
Absurdly misused quote

151
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:41,983
And Henry Kissinger gave lockbox

152
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
National Television

153
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,591
Economic collapse was a great opportunity

154
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
Bring in the New World Order

155
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,943
You went on to say that Barack Obama was

156
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
Perfect

157
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
Sell it to the world

158
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,319
Images

159
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
Do American foreign policy

160
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
Probably because

161
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,743
Silly

162
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
Hypnotize

163
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
Could be to develop an overall

164
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
Strategy for the medic

165
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
Pick it up Grandpa

00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935

167
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
Attracted

168
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
Because

169
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,367
First of all

170
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,327
You could describe them as people who are interested in

171
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,631
Guava

172
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,191
It integration it's not like a dirty word

173
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:53,151
Then for them generally speaking New World Order

174
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
The intersection of

175
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:01,087
The Illuminati

176
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,647

177
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,487

181
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:26,431
Trump created a new world order

182
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
Trending towards progress

183
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
Always looking

184
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Towards

185
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
Cooperation

186
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,575
And

187
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
Wars

188
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
You're always

189
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
Working towards a new

190
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,303
Influenza

191
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
Something better

192
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
Something

193
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
People that kissing

194
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,471

New Order of the world

196
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
A new ordering

197
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,383
Evil or suspicious

198
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
Weird that he says

199
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
Like

00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Kissinger

203
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,375
You're either hated because

204
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,759
It's either you think you should go there cuz you're right

205
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:41,695
I don't care about the ethical implications of Kissinger's actions or anything like that right

206
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
Cherry into the side of them

207
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
Absolutely

208
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,839
Occidental College

209
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:51,935

Disagree

211
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
Graduating in 90

212

283

213
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,335
His first job out of college was business international corporation

214
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
Enrico's

215
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:05,759
You latched onto this job

216
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
Because

217
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
77 Elliott

218
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,599
The company's founders

219
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:14,207
New York Times it is father's use the company provide for CIA agents cover

220
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,743
Between 1955 and

221
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,815
Even if we assume the information that's coming

222
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,191
Still has not approved

223
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,287
412 company into fake company

224
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:32,127
Publicnews

225
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,943
Conferences

226
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,271
During the Cold War companies that clandestine

227
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
Business

228
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,319
Many businesses

229
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
To help hide their spots

230
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
What are the reasons

231
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
Journalism

232
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,975
Publishing

233
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,815
Is it journalist ever reason to be in a foreign country that doesn't raise suspicion

234
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,911
As far as the facts go that's about as nefarious as business International

235
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
From everything I can

236
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,215
Until that is

237
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,799
The rest

238
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Provide cover

239
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,735
Doesn't doesn't mean that

240
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
Didn't stop

241
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,295
When Cold War

242
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,855
It doesn't mean that everybody who work there were CIA

243
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
Any of these

244
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
Also his

245
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Obama has

246
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
Would never work for

247
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
For a cert

248
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Classic

249
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,727
There is no

250
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
There is no limit like

251
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:38,175
Because look at conspiracy theory and trying to figure out like little things and then

252
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,807
YouTube your conspiracy theory

253
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,095
Interconnection here nope

254
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
Anyway

255
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,311
Did I miss anything

256
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
Do I miss do you miss endgame

257
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,663
No

258
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,479
That is basically just

259
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:17,087
Old automobile

260
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
On the shadow government agenda

261
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:24,767
Cars from

262
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
Lower the budget

263
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:36,287
Best-selling author Daniel Escobar

264
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,335

00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,919
Is mold formed

266
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:47,295
But the elite

267
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,855
Unimaginable in 2006

268
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
I want

269
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,167
But they were planning to

270
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,191
The price of

271
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,215
150m

272
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
We know from list

273
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,199
To Alex the show

274
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,551
That one friend Lindsey Williams

275
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,647
Is the person that Alex has told him that the globalist plan to raise the guy

276
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,463
Gas price of exact

277

Adventure

278
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:32,095
Why is now in The Obama Deception

279
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,703
Further in all of his appearances on the show Lindsey Williams

280
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:49,503
This really credible guy Lindsey Williams

281
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,807
The defense exactly what you're saying

282
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,623
Why not that's weird cuz he doesn't have

283
00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:00,511
Lindsay outside of the

284
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,303
No but he could still beat

285
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,351
William

286
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:10,239

00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,775
Placated we've got b roll

Rowlett

289
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,895
He may have been hiding and Daniel estulin

290
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,223
That's true

291
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
No it's banana

292
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,599
I know I don't want to talk about it Daniel estulin

293
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,623
Except to say that

294
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,815
The rest of the stuff Daniel estulin

295
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,863
Is just

296
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
You would

297
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
No

298
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
If you followed

299
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,775
Like none of none of it

300
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,175
150

301
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
It got up to

302
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,271
Something like that

303
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
And then with the eye

304
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
Follow trend

305
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:05,791
Like Gerald

306
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,375
If you if you had a decent awareness you would know a lot of

307
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
None of it has to come from

308
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
Secret

309
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,055
Sources from the evidence presented

310
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,359
It so far is that

311
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,175
Documentary

312
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,247
No that doesn't say what you said does

313
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,087
Yeah

314
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:37,023
Even if the thing that you were lying about was true

315
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,327
Live

316
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
You also

00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,191
Reported that after sucker in the middle class back into the stock

318
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215

Was going to inflow the subprime mortgage Market

320
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,311
And destroyed

321
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,919
New weapons

322
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,223
Oh well

323
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:05,183
How to draw things that make a prediction that you can't backup

324
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
Mortgage

325
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:19,519
Crisis

326
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:24,895
Remember that movie like it was it like

327
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,431
If you followed the new 12's

328
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,735
You would know that there were a lot of concern

329
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
You know we getting

330
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,903
From this morning

331
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
Severe damage

332
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:41,023
This is Daniel estulin sitting in a bar

333
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,327
To the camera

334
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:49,727
Jim Tucker

335
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,287
For the express purpose of

336
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,335
Public opinion

337
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,895
Come on

338
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,919
The afternoon

339
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
4 + 30

340
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,503
You're talking about

341
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,551
This is one of the American delegates

342
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,831
I wasn't

343
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:14,815
Interesting to watch Daniel estulin information that he already knows

344
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:20,447
It's sort of improvised a storyline

345
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,823
Fit2me indicates creativity there's a creative thinking process

346
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
You telling

347
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:32,991
If you was reporting from what somebody

348
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,551
Or something like that

349
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:41,951
Journalist Rick what

350
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,999
Space Commander

351
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:50,399
Like a waiter rating

352
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:59,103
Intuit

353
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:06,271
And when I get my news I want creative interpretation

354
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
Literally

355
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,367
You may be being influence

356
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,903
In part by the

357
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,207
Now that I see Daniel estulin again

358
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
He looks

359
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
It is

360
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,983
Holding his hands and could see him having a card pulp right now

361
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
Like he's a magician

362
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,799
This your new world order

363
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,903
But everything is going well so what they going to do over the next year-and-a-half

364
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,463
Backup to 1998

365
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:52,863
DVD copy of the

Navigate to Detroit economy

367
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,287
When people don't travel at least that's what they say

368
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,823
When people don't travel

369
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,871
When people don't have money they don't travel

370
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,479
Oil

371
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,879
No conversation

00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,928
Weather

373
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:23,328
Running out of

00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,960
So you have to sort

375
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,896
I bet

376
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,016
Bicycle

377
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:42,784
150

378
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,648
People double together going to be back

Those guys

382
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,504
British guy in the 50s

383
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,672
It looks

384
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:24,000
Copy of his book

Is that is the book

388
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,608
That

389
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:38,848
Able to report on future events with stunning because they know the agenda

390
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,664
The waterpark

391
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:52,160
125 of the richest and most influential individuals on the globe

392
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:00,352
When I go tanning

393
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:04,960
I had to type such mixed feel

394
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,008
Like sincerely makes me up

395
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,800
The first was missing

396
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,504
What the f***

397
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,256
God

398
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:31,072
I love it

399
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:38,496
From Istanbul Turkey Chantilly Virginia

400
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,872
Bilderberg always

401
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,456
By June of 2008

402
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,992
We'd already figured out

403
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,040
That Barack Obama

404
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,064
Choice

405
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,208
4th 2008 Democratic primary

406
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:04,352
Primary primary

407
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,680
Republican

408
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:08,960
Like

409
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
It made me

410
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
Nervous

411
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,776
Because I

412
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:16,128
Doll houses

413
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,176
This might not

414
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:23,296
Homework you might end up seeing a lot of

415
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:29,184
Come out

416
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
Even at that time

417
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
I'm scared of

418
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
Because

419
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,144
Ww's presidency was

420
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,216
Is that somehow

421
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,544
Despite the fact that people don't want a republican in there

422
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,784
Yeah it is it is

423
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:58,368
You take the rough with the smooth

424
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:03,744
Destroying the entire world

425
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,816
Just real quick

426
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,608
I need to drive home

427
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
You knew

428
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,008
Predictive or like you're a psychic

429
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,288
You knew in

430
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,592
June 2008 that Obama

431
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,736
F*** you right off

432
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:35,488
0 support ND

433
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,072
Wendy

434
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,352
He was the puppy

435
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
Good work guys

436
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,424
Congratulations

437
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,984
Gerald Celente powers

438
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,032
National media claimed

439
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,336
The during the weekend the Bilderberg Group

440
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,360
Schedule

441
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,408
Speaking

442
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,456
Set for Chicago in the Midwest

443
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,296
Classic bait-and-switch

444
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,648
To get on Obama's campaign plane

445
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,696
And the Obama would join them

446
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,488
On the flight to Chicago

447
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,768
Campaign staff

448
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,560
Then slam the door shut

449
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:13,120
The farming president Shanghai

450
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:16,192
As Obama's campaign aircraft lifted off

451
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:16,960
Without

452
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,264
Alex would laugh his ass off.

453
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:35,136
Depressed guy on the plane Target

454
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,208
Remember this

455
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,752
We had a desire

456
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
Mother's Day

457
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
Enterprise

458
00:26:59,456 --> 00:26:59,968
We set up these me

459
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,888
Score

460
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
Obama

461
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
Like

462
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:28,128
Like it was some sort of evil nefarious plan

463
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:34,528
Terrible thing

464
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,464
Eerily like

465
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:54,240
I'm sorry I got to go to the bathroom

466
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:11,136
Journalism

467
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,208
This smart

468
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,232
Sort of ockham

469
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:16,768
Explanation

470
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,560
Is that

471
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,352
Obama and Hillary

472
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:26,752
Because the primary kind of role might have

473
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,080
Any Administration that sort of thing around

474
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,408
Which I understand I think that's a little bit Shady

475
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,528
I don't think

476
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,320
Suggest that they were both

477
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,624
Rat

478
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,392
They did

479
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,208
In order for him to get to Bilderberg

480
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,232
Where was Build-A-Bear

481
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,072
How is your day

482
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:54,400
There's no evidence

483
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,728
Pictures

484
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:03,360
Who's there

485
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,896
He was there he has no

486
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
The records don't show

487
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,368
Absolutely

488
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,096
They shouldn't done but

489
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,680
I think it's just sort of like

490
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,776
Something I'm noticing right now

491
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:38,176
Is this is a terrible 20 you back not even like us

492
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:42,528
All the lies and all the b*******

493
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,088
This is a documentary

494
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:50,208
Why I hate during preparation

495
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,512
There's so many things

496
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,072
You down

497
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,608
There's so many things

498
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,168
Or just like

499
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,192
How do I prove

500
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,520
There's things like this worth

501
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:06,592
Nocuous explanation for this but you're never going to

502
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
To accept it

503
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
That's pretty funny

504
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:19,648
If he wasn't having a prefer if he was just like

505
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,768
I need a night off I'm going to go hang out with Michelle

506
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,680
Play for laughs

507
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,752
Is it afterwards he sends them like an edible

508
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,920
I wasn't going to Chicago

509
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,904
Obama's spokesman denied

510
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,208
Confirm player the former rivals

511
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,232
He also

512
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,792
Keep in mind right there it says former rival

513
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,840
The primary

514
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,888
Literally say good day max

515
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,656
Discussion

516
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,336
Trying to find out where Obama

517
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:16,736
The corporate press had to admit they had no idea

518
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:21,600
They work anymore

519
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:27,488
Embody the time that the two of them were still in the running

520
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,536
Already one

521
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,072
The denomination

522
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:34,656
And the reason for that is

523
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,216
And then the world leads to

524
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:42,080
Exactly

525
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:46,688
At the time they were chosen

526
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,552
World Cup games

527
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:58,208
Because if you Obama had already won the nomination

528
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:58,976
Beforehand

529
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,280
Choosing

530
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
He won based on the boat

531
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,912
So can you try

532
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,216
Maintain that facade throughout the

533
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
This entire document

534
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,800
Bulshit

535
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,688
Clinton and Obama aren't talking

536
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,248
Funny sources knew about this meeting

537
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,856
Told others that it was at Hillary Clinton's house with Philly

538
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,880
And it wasn't

539
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,488
Westfield Marriott Hotel

540
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
Outside

541
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:45,312
Yolanda bullhorns no matter what

542
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,592
None

543
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,128
Like like no

544
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,456
We went to this Marriott

545
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,624
Series of breadcrumbs

546
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,208
Also remember that episode in 2008

547
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:02,976
Where Alex

548
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:09,376
Was getting ready to go to

549
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,984
I want to find that episode

550
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:21,152
In Washington DC for driving to westfields Marriott tomorrow the hotels close

551
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:27,552
Throughout the week

552
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:33,952
He looks so much more healthy

553
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,512
Disgusting

554
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:40,352
He looks like he looks like a rough

555
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,120
30

556
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,144
Yes.

557
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,168
But not like

558
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,264
Yeah

559
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,824
Forget it

560
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,456
Beyond critiques of his physical

561
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
Jesus

562
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:04,160
The night time we're going to go check or whatever

563
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:12,608
355 agency CIA intelligence Mossad

564
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:16,960
Whatever

565
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,264
Forty-Eight Hours before Hotel guests

566
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
The annual meeting

567
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,920
We're no longer

568
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
Reserved

569
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,504
Pick us up tomorrow

570
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,808
Cuz of the

571
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,440
Forty-Eight Hours before

572
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
What is

573
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,072
Okay

574
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:46,912
Reserve the room at a hotel for a week

575
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,240
Like technically I suppose you could say at the end of that week

576
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
Kicked me out

577
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,312
Yeah used to do that

578
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:59,712
Login to my reservation

579
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:04,064
For the rooms

580
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,344
There's a private party

581
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,928
Kind of but

582
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:15,328
Guess you would have liked to stay longer but

583
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,888
By the way

584
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,680
This is going to happen

585
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,008
The building was Nestle

586
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
Open the heart

587
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,312
The military-industrial

588
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,968
National reconnaissance office

Looking at b roll

591
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,672
There's a nice hotel

00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:45,536
That's a pretty solid breakfast

593
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,632
Security

594
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,400

I'm not going to settle

605
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,392
I'm not saying that it's not a good idea.

606
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,608
Set up

607
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
Shut up

608
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,752
Open the door I want to hear the fire

Moana

627
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,792
The moments I'm way

628
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,376
The alarm goes off

629
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,424
It's going off right now

630
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,520
Put the shirts say

631
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:06,848
Over 100

632
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
Today

633
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,944
Total ghost

634
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,712
This is what

635
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,296
We have a security

636
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,832
Batman Legos

637
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,952
There's a shop

638
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,792
Of the artworks

639
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,632
Fire alarm

640
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
Fire alarm

641
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,032
I forgot that part.

642
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,200
Credible

643
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:51,136
Coasttocoastam

644
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,208
Ostensibly

645
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,072
Fire alarm started

646
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,352
Is the phone rang but

647
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,888
What is the we just saw there

648
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,472
Start in media res with the called fire alarm

649
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:09,312
His track record

650
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,248
When he started making the call or when

651
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,832
Is deficient number one

652
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:28,256
Number to House of fire alarm

653
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:33,120
Globalist

654
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,984
How in control are the globalist really

655
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,312
Pressure a goddamn Hotel manager

656
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:51,040
I want to the backup Hotel

657
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:53,600
No footage anywhere to be found

658
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
Weird

659
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:59,232
What kind of setup to make fire alarm

660
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:05,376
Soccer

661
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,240
He has no shortage of that

662
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,056
Security guard

663
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,128
Nope

664
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,432
Based on his own description

665
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,480
We were filming at that

666
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,112
You would think there would be a piece of cake

667
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:31,744
I know you would still have the footage of someone off camera

668
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:36,864
Credibility to your story Alex Jones

669
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,424
Needs to put that in or else

670
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
Also

671
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,312
If I rent a hotel

672
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,616
Add Alex Jones

673
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,664
Haley have him followed around

674
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:56,576
Pornos pornos like nefarious reason so much as like hey I just need people to follow you around

675
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:00,416
Because you have a long and varied history of f****** with people and

676
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,536
Could you please don't f*** with me

677
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,816
Yeah

678
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,632
My assessment

679
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:16,032
Yeah like in Prosper

680
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:21,408
Like I said nothing but because the Marriott is just a normal or not

681
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:24,736
So when he got on the phone with George Noory 02 report

682
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,040
We walked around we saw some art

683
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,064
That's about it

684
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,880
There's nothing appearance on Coast to Coast AM

685
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,440
Maybe by coincidence a fire alarm

686
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,000
Maybe one of Alex's group old

687
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:43,168
But whatever the case now Alex has the ingredients

688
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:48,544
Now we can portray himself as the brave reporters out there is life is in Peril who's also the victim

689
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
Have a grand

690
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,080
Conspiracy

691
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,128
A fire alarm

692
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,407
So now

693
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:58,271
I know the audio of the next day's episode of Coast to Coast AM

694
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:02,367
Where Alex is

695
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:05,183
Story starts to change

696
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:09,023
Paris River

697
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,911
We just heard

698
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,703
From Alex's at game

699
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,031
Obama Deception documentaries

700
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,335
What we heard is a story about a

701
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,103
1

702
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,383
Guard coming up

703
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,687
He's trying to take pictures

704
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:29,247
Furby role is trying to create

705
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,807
Is the artwork

706
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,903
Now what have you now let's hear what he says the next day on coasttocoastam

707
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,743
Eaton DC area the Bilderberg conference

708
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,791
It was supposed to get underway today

709
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:45,887
Let's check in with our own Alex Jones

710
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:52,543
George I am and thank God that you're having me on the show because we're in a lot of danger and I've never said this before even when I was detained 215

711
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:56,639
Hours in Canada

712
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:59,711
Large commercial mainstream show

713
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:06,879
A no one notice papers nothing is covering it like your radio show the 15 million listeners and then my

714
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,695
Baller News website infowars.com in prison

715
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,975
Wired.com

716
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:14,559
Is there any

717
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:17,631
Right

718
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,239
3 minutes before you went to me

719
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:26,079
Like when you called an alarm went off fire alarm

720
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:30,687
And walking up 10 minutes before

721
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:37,087
Before

722
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:41,183
Places thank you

723
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:47,583
Waiting on hold Tom call to produce their right as

724
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,863
The alarm went off

725
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:55,775
I'm thinking what's going on I didn't film Channel crew in there filming all of this

726
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,543
Happening

727
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:01,407
Fire alarm is going off everything's crazy

728
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,431
And

729
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:08,831
Earliest wildfire

730
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,791
We go downstairs working out there with over 200 people

731
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,631
We are going to f

732
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,399
You up

733
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,423
And

734
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:29,823
Then they said that goes for you Alec and you raw from under my name

735
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,967
Unknown

736
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,527
Marine coming in

737
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,879
Here therefore

738
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:51,583
We have the evolution of a

739
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,863
This narrative

740
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:59,519
Yeah something about fire alarms and security guard

741
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:03,615
1 calories in Arena security guard

742
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,407
Conspiracy

743
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,687
Which is desperate

744
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:15,647
Yeah a little bit in the beginning of the

745
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:19,999
That's not good

746
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,887
With George

747
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,191
The alarms going off

748
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,983
He finished his interview with George

749
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:35,871
Alex

750
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,431
Footage of them leaving

751
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,455
For the fire alarm

752
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:43,039
Venomous.

753
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
There's a fire truck

754
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,559
Also

755
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,935
OtterBox

756
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:08,127
Being outside

757
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:14,783
Nope

758
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,551
Is it

759
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,855
Engine so now we're on to the next morning

760
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,415
They had footage

761
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,231
Multiple cameras

762
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:29,631
It's all that is true

763
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:33,215
They would have the camera down and use the audio then

764
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,751
You can still do that

765
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:35,775
Also

766
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,567
If it is a scheduled fired

767
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,103
I don't know if it was

768
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
Fire

769
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,687
Usually doesn't

770
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:49,343
That's not really but if it is

771
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,927
Bro

772
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,231
Midnight fire drill

773
00:46:55,487 --> 00:47:00,863
Hotel

774
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:05,727
What is more like one pulled the alarm

775
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,663
Pulled the fire alarm in order to specifically

776
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,551
Because he was going to leave anyway doesn't scare any

777
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,391
Did that

778
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:30,047
All they've done is handout

779
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,327
Silver platter

780
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:37,727
To use to pretend he's a Preston evicted

781
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,055
Yeah

782
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:47,711
Rob Jacob

783
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,367
Smoking Gun

784
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,135
Back

785
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:05,631
I didn't know used to run security

786
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,775
They have checked out of the hotel and they're

787
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,055
Sing like they're running out of

788
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:20,223
Alright we paid her bill

789
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,599
What time does follow

790
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,647
If you

791
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:30,463
This is clearly a silver

792
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:35,071
Later they will pretend that it is the same thing as clearly

793
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,863
Bluish green car

794
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
I don't believe it

795
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,775
It's the same car

796
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:56,831
So far no evidence of swallowing

797
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:09,887
Alex has

798
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:15,007
Camera going in his car turns that were taken by this car

799
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,055
It is just Alex

800
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:19,615
You followed us 45 turns or whatever

801
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,583
Gotcha

802
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,847
Southwestern Grill

803
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:57,247
This isn't true everything they're being followed

804
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,855
Credible as a tail

805
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:08,511
Credible as a

806
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:13,375
Almost as if he has no idea

807
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:19,007
Seafood

808
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,055
0 man this is now

809
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:25,919
This is I was trying to create some sort of narrative

810
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,271
I believe there's a world

811
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:34,623
Where

812
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:41,535
I don't know how far away that is from the Marriott

813
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,071
If he was being followed

814
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,631
He had multiple cameras in the car

815
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,167
They would have footage of all of that

816
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:58,943
Argument

817
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,711
It blew

818
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,783
Look-back or anyting

819
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:09,183
Nope

820
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,639
The next stretch

821
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,967
This documentary

822
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:38,367
This stretch is meaningless

823
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:44,767
Covers

824
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:02,943
About 25

825
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,991
Top

826
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:27,775
Cars appearing

827
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:36,735
2.5 + 2.75

828
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:46,207
This is a meeting that happen

829
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,231
Like

830
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,767
They were in the car

831
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,839
It was like okay so I'm going to take a bullhorn out

832
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:56,191
Rob you is right there next to

833
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:02,591
You pull up are you f******

834
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:07,967
How much more powerful it is

835
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:12,319
You see how far away

836
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,111
Like

837
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:18,207
Cover that distance to 1 bullhorn a******

838
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:23,839
Still no one

839
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:26,399
Look like a Wawa

840
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:33,311
Probably interfere with each other and it makes the sound

841
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,487
Find secret service

842
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:56,607
07 Convoy

843
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:09,407
And internal sources confirm

844
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,687
1 m

845
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,455
Inside

846
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:17,855
The conference internal sources confirm that Obama and Hillary attended one

847
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,159
That's not

848
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:26,047
There's no evidence that they were there that the official

849
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:31,935
The record doesn't show that they were there is no proof they were there

850
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:35,007
He doesn't have any footage of Obama or Hillary being there

851
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,031
There's nothing

852
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,591
It's just Daniel

853
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:47,295
While the Bilderberg Group was a hundred percent successful

854
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,575
2080

855
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:51,391
H-E-B near me

856
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,327
During the event

857
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,119
Angie newworldorder protest

858
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,911
Alternative media

859
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,447
Circle bar Hotel

860
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,407

Call Asurion.

862
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:26,207
Behind the main players and we are James

863
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:32,607
Ron Paul campaign

864
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,423
I wanted to talk a lot about

865
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,191
I looked

866
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:40,543
And I'm in a lot of the claims that are made about him

867
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:44,639
Tons of money

868
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:48,735
We are

869
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:53,343
Because of the never-was charge

870
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:59,487
I don't know enough about it

871
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:06,143
So I'm going to punt on Luke rudowski

872
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,831
We're not

873
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,111
If you resign

874
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,695
Yeah you got them

875
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,999
Obama we know you're

876
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,327
I don't know who this lady is

877
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,655
Cheapest nice

878
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:47,615
Purchase a DVD copy of The Obama Deception has a scroll that keeps going under the video

879
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,895
Came from

880
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:49,919
United States

881
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,223
The main conference call

882
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,503
Close range

883
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,295
As the global power Brokers

884
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,111
And that's all

885
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:58,879
Every

886
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:03,743
This is still happening

887
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,351
This is

888
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,911
Are they

889
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:16,287
Everything that's like the people are coming together to stop them

890
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:21,919
What is a population

891
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:26,015
Policies being developed over by powerful special interest

892
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,551
The people will revolt

893
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:30,367
Detective

894
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:32,415
A picture

895
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,743
For federal official

896
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,071
World

897
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,191
Sun federal workers

898
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,471
Jim Tucker

899
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:48,287
Walking through the lobby of a hotel

900
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,127
Nasatal

901
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:07,231
Also is misrepresenting.

902
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:08,767
Every

903
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,887
Right

904
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:14,911
Show up

905
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:16,959
If they always do

906
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,799
Open Alexa

907
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
Pretending

908
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,639
Officials from other country

909
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,431
Discuss

910
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,247
Truth

911
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:38,207
This is my favorite shot

912
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,887
By the pool hat

913
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,423
Any suspenders

914
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,727
Like

915
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:53,311
Distort of young guy is in a he's the guy who's like

916
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,079
A muscle

917
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:03,807
Who's like IMDb

918
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:07,135
This Old Man

919
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,671
Telling looks like

920
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:15,327
Something out of a bad movie

921
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:21,983
Teeth movie

922
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:28,383
The silly hat on top of it like

923
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:31,711
Tucker Leonard

924
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,479
Protagonist

925
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,551
4 hours

926
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:41,695
What's important is that while there is so much metaphorically there

927
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:53,727
Some people go bowling on the weekend these guys protest

928
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,847
And every newspaper

929
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,383
Every broadcast

930
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,199
Exposed

931
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,015
Eagle Lake

932
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:12,159
You write for publication that was created

933
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:19,327
The media has their obligation obligation

934
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:22,655
12

935
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,519
Alright

936
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,543
One second

937
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:33,407
Still shot that they showed before

938
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,175
Which was

939
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:38,271
I think it was Hillary

940
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:41,343
And they had it

941
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:47,487
Hillary was looking at Obama with kind of like this

942
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,255
F*** you

943
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:51,327
The only thing I could think during that though is

944
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,375
To pull off an earring

945
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:57,727
I really think you should get an earring now that he's out of office

946
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,519
You should really f****** go for

947
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:05,919
Where the flag for a while and everyone and everyone was mad at him

948
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:08,479
Remember those times

949
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,279
Obviously

950
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:26,399
Bilderberg

951
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,471
Trilateral Commission

952
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,007
Found it

953
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,383
The Carter Administration

954
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,663
Charter

955
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,479
We're all members

956
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,807
The trilateral commission

957
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,087
Sensation public

958
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,367
Professor Griff

959
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:49,695
Davis's View

960
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,375
I truly believe

961
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:01,471
Imperialism

962
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:08,127
In order to get this interview Alex

963
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:14,527
Black nationalism

964
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,855
He was a friend of Professor Griff

965
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,911
Thought you called into the show

966
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:34,239
I don't think Alex is even there

967
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:38,847
Professor Griff

968
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:45,247
Documentary for Alex

969
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:51,647
Political opinion

970
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:58,047
Is not an integral

971
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,327
Member of

972
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:04,447
I would do it all

973
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:09,055
Listen to wrestle with

974
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:12,639
Documentary

975
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,407
The deck

976
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,783
Facelift

977
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,367
And the reason I believe

978
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,135
Simply because

979
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,231
They're trying to go into a pool that already in a

980
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,255
Yelp

981
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,047
Totally control

982
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:34,143
Oh really never heard of white people

983
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,167
23rd century

984
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,031
Did they have to go through a phase

985
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,311
Galvanized

986
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,335
The map

987
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,615
Dark skin people

988
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,151
They truly believe

989
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,175
That chain

990
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,319
People

991
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,903
For them

992
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,695
Little man on total

993
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,255
Agenda

994
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,839
Have the right tile on

995
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:07,935
Have the right smile

996
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:16,127
Prisonplanet.com

997
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:28,671
Where is Professor Griff Colonial powers

998
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:36,351
One world government or a black president the United States

999
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:40,703
Forever

1000
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:46,591
Well considering what the British

1001
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:52,991
Congo for Ivory rubber

1002
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,807
I don't think they were

1003
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,831
The concept of an a

1004
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:59,391
African Union besides possible idea

1005
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:03,487
Colonialism is already inflicted on the Cotton

1006
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,279
No

1007
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:08,095
Professor Griff

1008
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,631
Expressing a dumb idea

1009
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,471
Couple hundred

1010
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,775
I don't think he's a real

1011
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,543
Professor

1012
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,039

1013
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:30,111
Schlitz Wilford Brimley

1014
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,903
Hahaha

1015
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:42,399
Even worse nonsense then professor professorship

1016
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:45,727
Terrific of Professor

1017
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:50,335
No doubt about that

1018
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,871
But

1019
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:52,895
Professor Griff

1020
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,039
Instead we know

1021
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:06,207
Thick off hands

1022
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:09,535
It was for that sort of behavior

1023
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:13,887
Media media interview with British publication

1024
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:18,239
The white race or Caucasian race came from the Caucasus Mountain

1025
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:21,567
He was not

1026
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:27,711
The pyramid

1027
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,247
The Jews can't even build houses

1028
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,575
How the hell did they build the pyramids

1029
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:35,903
Finally

1030
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:42,559
How big is the Palestinians

1031
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,423
Not great

1032
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,959
Not great

1033
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:56,639
Problem

1034
01:06:56,895 --> 01:07:01,759
I'm not for that one

1035
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:04,831
Just killed all the Jews

1036
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,855
I don't think

1037
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,623
Be alright

1038
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,415
Don't think

1039
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:10,719
He is

1040
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,655
Everything was a okay for a bit

1041
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:24,543
Professor Griff bio writer for

Chucky

1044
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:48,863
The song Fight the Power in his movie do the right thing

1045
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,655
Add Public Enemy

1046
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,191
Commodities

1047
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:56,031
Unfortunately

1048
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:58,591
Professor Griff

1049
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:01,663
Jews are responsible for the majority of the wickedness

1050
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,199
That goes on around the globe

1051
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,759
Most people remember

1052
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:12,415
He went on a full-on antisymmetric

1053
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:18,815
Henry Ford's book The International Jew as a store

1054
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:21,375
You bet

1055
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:25,983
Little Hitman

1056
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:39,039
Concluded

1057
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,575
Because if he wasn't

1058
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:43,391
Who owns CBS

1059
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:51,071
Have stents forced him out of the group of the five Juventus to hold us back

1060
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,631
Working title

1061
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:58,751
Tired

1062
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:01,311
Minister of information

1063
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:11,295
You know what you could still be a representative in Iowa

1064
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:17,695
Twenty years later Professor Griff wrote a book called analytics failed analy

1065
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:18,719
T.i.

1066
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:22,815
Love it where you gave this rambling explanation for his Acts

1067
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:30,239
Just say the Jews are responsible for the majority of wickedness

1068
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,591
I'm not the best nowhere God

1069
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:42,783
To know who's at the Crux of all the problems in the world that's not correct

1070
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,439
I don't know

1071
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:56,351
Now you can't believe me

1072
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,943
Is the different time

1073
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:14,783
People through people

1074
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:21,183
It doesn't really matter because he pretended to be sorry and you made a visit to the Holocaust Museum kind of blow over with

1075
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,719
Exceptional

1076
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,743
For the wickedness,

1077
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:36,799
Reinstall

1078
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:40,127
LeBron James

1079
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,479
You know what

1080
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:47,295
I'm going to put that low on my list of things

1081
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:50,367
Bad about the Rock

1082
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,927
I'm not here to talk about the hall

1083
01:10:56,511 --> 01:11:02,143
That's not even in the top ten worst things about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

1084
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,167
Systemic problem

1085
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:06,495
Louis Farrakhan

1086
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:08,543
Espouses deeply auntie

1087
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,591
The archetype of a

1088
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:13,151
Black racist to Alex complaints

1089
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:22,623
Who is team right now I guess he's the one who also believes of the New World Order

1090
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:25,183
Very clearly thinks it's

1091
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:27,743
Don't want to talk about that

1092
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,815
Weddings 1964

1093
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,959
Senator Barry Goldwater said

1094
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:42,847
The trilateral commission

1095
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,639
Of the commercial and banking

1096
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,783
The trilateral commission represent

1097
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,111
Disease Control

1098
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,159
Consolidate the four centers of power

1099
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:57,951
Monitor

1100
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,231
Intellectual

1101

Trilateral Commission

1102
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:06,399
Worldwide economic power

1103
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,423
Superior

1104
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:12,799
As managers and creators of the system

1105
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,847
Future

1106
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:22,271
That they just showed what is essentially the Globe Theatre

1107
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:26,879
Goldwater

1108
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:28,927
I don't really care

1109
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:50,687
From Arizona

1110
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:57,087
Batshit crazy

1111
01:12:57,343 --> 01:13:01,183
Born the son of parents who owned a department store called cold water

1112
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:04,255
Which you would go on to take over after his father's death

1113
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:09,375
Estimated

1114
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:12,703
Million dollars a year as of 1940

1115
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:14,751
Would you be 17 billion dollars

1116
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:15,519
In present day

1117
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:18,591
Doing alright dude pretty good in the 40

1118
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:22,431
Interest

1119
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,223
Weird conservatism

1120
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:31,903
Flying airplane

1121
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,183
And that

1122
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,047
Wsn

1123
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,095
I skipped over something

1124
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:45,983
I forgot the Goldwater started a national fad

1125
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:49,823
Which were just men's underwear with big red ants

1126
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,151
Alright

1127
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,687
As of now

1128
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:00,319
I am fine with berries

1129
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:07,743
Perhaps

1130
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:23,103
Already

1131
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:26,943
Here's the new deal for that reason and had prior to

1132
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,759
Arizona

1133
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:30,527
To work state

1134
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,551
Bran Floyds didn't

1135
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:32,831
Wheelwright

1136
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:38,207
In 1963 Barry was a vociferous

1137
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:42,559
Did Barry the Republican nomination

1138
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:44,351
A president in 1964

1139
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,375
How things change

1140
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:51,775
President Eisenhower

1141
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:02,783
It is now or we would never allow this kind of behavior

1142
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:06,623
Pb2

1143
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,999
Where you said that we should be using nuclear

1144
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,047
Justice liberally

1145
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:17,631
He went on to suggest that

1146
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:22,495
Without the approval of the president

1147
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:26,847
Even with the president

1148
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,151
I love how stupid

1149
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,175
Tactical nukes

1150
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:30,943
Dislike

1151
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:40,415
Like still going to take down

1152
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:43,231
30000 miles out

1153
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,255
100

1154
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:54,495
Which is very rare we should kill terrorists

1155
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,287
We voted

1156
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:59,871
Never allow somebody who says

1157
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:06,271
He says things like that a fact magazine printed an article called

1158
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:08,063
The unconscious of a conservative

1159
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:11,135
Special issue in the

1160
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,415
Play on his book Tekonsha

1161
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:20,095
Article the writer said that personality

1162
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:26,495
The Goldwater rule

1163
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,543
Public personality

1164
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:29,567
Oh sorry

1165
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:34,943
At this point Barry Goldwater was also running a ham radio station out of

1166
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,783
So how did he lose

1167
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:50,815
And was running a ham radio station out of his house while he was at the office

1168
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:54,655
68 presidential campaign

1169
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:59,519
Like I mentioned earlier lot of Alex's other ideological ancestors

1170
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,055
Preferably on board with segregate

1171
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:06,175
I don't know what to make of Barry's involved

1172
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:11,551
But I should also tell you that in 1976 Goldwater was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame

1173
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,927
You know

1174
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:19,487
What guys like Goldwater you never hear the paws

1175
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,215
The 1968

1176
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,079
Goldwater finally retired from the Sun

1177
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:38,943
Endorsed

1178
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,479
George h.w. Bush

1179
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:43,807
For president which is another weird choice for the people in this world

1180
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:48,159
Bush's father Prescott

1181
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:50,975
Actual Nazi collaborator

1182
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:56,351
Prescott Bush

1183
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:04,031
Between him and John McCain about like

1184
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:07,871
If I was in charge you never would have been to that annoy Hilton

1185
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:11,455
You never would have never

1186
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:15,295
If I had been in charge

1187
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,831
You're right

1188
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,879
I would have been a prisoner aboard the China

1189
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,999
Nice mechanic

1190
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:31,423
93 year old man

1191
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,471
Barry Goldwater advocate

1192
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:34,751
For the creation of laws

1193
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,775
Protect homosexual

1194
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:36,799
Discrimination

1195
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:40,127
Supported the right of homosexuals to openly serve in the military

1196
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,407
All of it

1197
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,455
Because he found out his grandson

1198
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,759
Even though

1199
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,039
He had previously

1200
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:49,343
Vociferous

1201
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,135
All those sorts of things

1202
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:57,535
He encouraged Federal legislation

1203
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:13,919
The principal positions evaporate

1204
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:21,087
Me personally

1205
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,111
Would have made a

1206
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,903
Look in the 60s

1207
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:28,255
Yeah but if his if his kid was gay in the 60s

1208
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,535
While he was in office

1209
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:30,559
He still living

1210
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:34,399

1211
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,447
Call daughter.

1212
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:40,799
Colorado River

1213
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:46,687
Scattered of the Colorado

1214
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,527
The Colorado River is a Fitting Place for his ashes because I forgot to tell you that

1215
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:54,879
First person on record to ever travel.

1216
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:10,239
I'll be on that he also is like responsible for a lot of his stupid anti-communist propaganda

1217
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,944
Rest in peace Barry Goldwater

1218
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,248
You crazy sonofabitch

1219
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,808
Bilderberg issues executive decision

1220
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,832
Prime directive

1221
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,112
Do it subbed

1222
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,648
For implementation

1223
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:28,672
The trial

1224
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:35,072
He just said I don't know I didn't understand how those Vine

1225
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:37,376
Relation to each other

1226
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,656
No outside

1227
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,008
And executes its

1228
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,664
Serves as the managing Roundtable

1229
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:54,272
This is an attempt to explain

1230
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,320
Council on Foreign Relations

1231
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,880
Has dominated every Administration

1232
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,672
Since the days of f.d.r.

1233
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:04,512
Alex's

1234
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:06,560
Everybody

1235
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:07,584
In control

1236
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,144
Eva

1237
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:15,520
See that's a problem

1238
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,568
Makes it to be controlled

1239
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,920
Freeze the last real president

1240
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:28,320
Ulta

F******

1245
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:40,352
Payment office in 1932

1246
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:47,008
Implies that there was a good 11

1247

Weather

1248
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:49,568
We can't do that yet

1249
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:53,152
They came together as an evil group took him 11 years

1250
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,456
To be able to

1251
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:00,064
Test runs and then you're ready

1252
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:05,696
Catering setup

1253
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:07,744

01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:24,128

I mean I guess that's probably

1265
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:49,216
Robert is a small governor

1266
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:49,984
Conservative

1267
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:54,336
This was entirely into laissez-faire International politics

1268
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,616
Coolidge

1269
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:57,408
Set up

Calvin Coolidge laissez-faire

1277

Small government type

1279
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:40,672
Hoover wins in 1928

01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:43,744
Use federal funding to help

1281
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,072
With the increasing problem alright

1282
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:52,192
I don't know I'm just

1283
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,264
Orchestrated that

1284
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,032
The crisis

1285
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,056
It's necessary

1286
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,848
To do the s*** that they wanted

1287
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:03,456
Which was elected fpr in order to create

1288
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:10,112
40 years old

1289
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:15,232
The interest of the bankers

1290
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,256
I mean

1291
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:18,304
The reason we ended up not

1292
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,120
Financial crash

1293
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,912

I don't understand

1298
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:42,624
No the only thing that makes sense is everything that Alex says

1299
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,072
Eccentric

1300
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,096
Oligarchy

1301
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:58,240

No

1369
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,472
Weird paranoia

1370
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,664

1371
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,200

1374
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,832
And bunglers get their ass

1375
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,672

The order

1380
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,424
These orders are

1381
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,192
Wrongheaded

1382
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:14,496
To say the least there are basic

1383
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:15,264

01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:41,632
You got to drive Wall Street

1393
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,424
You have a reason

1394

Netflix

1402
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,632
That's the whole point

1403
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:17,728
The plan is to make the problem seem so insurmountable

1404
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:20,032
There's no point in doing it

1405
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:25,408
Paralyzed

1406
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:29,760
If you deal with the reality of the awfulness of it of like

1407
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:33,344
Look

1408
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,928

1409
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:38,976
We don't need to take our country back

1410
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:44,352
We should still have some influence

1411
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,376
That part of our f******

1412
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:51,776
Consistent

1413
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:02,528
Yeah it's super unsatisfying

1414
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:11,232
Sometimes

1415
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:14,048
Hey all these Bankers should have no fun

1416
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:19,936
Control over anything we should

1417
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:20,960

1418
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:21,984
Compromises

1419
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:24,800

1421
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:39,648
To work towards the greater good of everybody

1422
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:41,440
You have to say like

1423
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:43,232
I don't want to do that but

1424
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:52,960

If I can find no real evidence that he is a published author

1481
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:07,264
There is one book that looks like

1482

That's what I

1503
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:29,696

He looks like he has a normal haircut emerging from the batter

1510
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:54,784
He's really into people's appearance

1511
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:01,440
Because it's 99% audio

1512
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:03,232
I never get to criticize people

1513
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:07,072
I can see what all these assholes look like

1514
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:08,864
Fairborn

1515
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,168
Fair enough

1516
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,728
Manipulating

1517
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,264

1518
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,312
The good people of this nation

Realize that he's f***** up

But he did say

1548
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:22,592
How's that

1549
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:24,128
I shouldn't have done that we were

1550
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:26,432
We're working on the wrong kind of information

1551
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:31,808
He paraphrased John Maynard Keynes when he said about it when circumstances change

1552
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:33,856
Switch to me does

1553
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:36,160
Someone who has wrestled with

1554
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:45,120
But he was a big part of helping

1555
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:47,680
End up

1556
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:49,984
Fixing the problem

1557
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:55,104
Hero story at all

1558
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:58,176
Alright

1559
01:38:58,944 --> 01:38:59,456
You did

1560
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:00,736
After the fact

1561
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:03,296
You were a part of helping

1562
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:08,416
Look because

1563
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:13,280
Generally speaking our elected officials are not

1564
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:16,096
Intellectual

1565
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:18,912
Powerhouses that we might want them

1566
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:23,520
So there is he's got a massive

1567
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:29,408
Very very smart

1568
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:31,968
And finding the little places where he's

1569
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,272
Vulnerable and convincing him otherwise

1570
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:35,296
I get that

1571
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:37,600
Then happen

1572
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:46,048
You at the beginning of the derivatives bubble

1573
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:51,424
Thanks to people like Alex.

1574
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,704
In the Obama

1575
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:53,728
Administration

1576
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:57,824
Entire problem

1577
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:58,592
Today

1578
01:39:59,104 --> 01:39:59,872
The same people

1579
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:08,320
I don't know they seem to shift around on top of quick

1580
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:16,000
Complicated

1581
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,608
Fairly correct

1582
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:24,704
Deregulation of

1583
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:26,752
The derivatives Market

1584
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:29,312
Did he played a very big party

1585
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:30,592
And what happened

1586
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:33,408
I think that's fair

1587
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:38,528
What you think

1588
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:44,928
Regulations

1589
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:45,952
I don't really know what to say

1590
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:50,048
If a deregulated derivatives Market is the cause of all these problems

1591
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:53,120
Then wouldn't it stand to reason

1592
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:53,888
Solution

1593
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:56,448
Would you say you're not allowed

1594
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:07,200
Massive regulation I don't know more regulations

1595
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:10,016
You're not allowed to do this bylaw

1596
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:12,064
My boy

1597
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:16,928
I kind of agree with tarpleys analysis that this is a big part of the problem

1598
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:21,024
But I don't know what his solution to that problem is because

1599
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:25,120
So I don't know how much I can go on board with

1600
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:31,776
Prescribed that you can recognize a problem

1601
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:36,384
Ideologically opposed to

1602
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:38,944
But using can't prescribe

1603
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:41,248
So you can only record

1604
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,320
We have the US

1605
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:45,088
Treasury

1606
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:47,904
Protege

1607
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:53,024
Uncle Larry's glass-steagall

1608
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,584
Caught the regulation

1609
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:56,864
Prohibited

1610
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:57,888
The banks

1611
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:03,008
He was a side are you on

1612
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:04,544
New York State

1613
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:11,200
As we all know

1614
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:12,736
Federal Reserve

1615
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:14,272
Federalist

1616
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:21,184
That I don't understand

1617
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:32,704
Catchphrase the Federal Reserve Academy

1618
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:39,104
Propagandist of catchy

1619
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:40,640
Gucci Mane

1620
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:44,224
Complicated but very important to understand

1621
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,760
The nature of the Federal Reserve

1622
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:47,296
As we go forward in

1623
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:48,064
In this documentary

1624
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,232
Reserved

1625
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,024
It's not a private bank

1626
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:01,888
It's a public bank that holds private

1627
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:06,496
To understand exactly what the issue is here it's essential that we understand what the structure

1628
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,520
The Federal Bank

1629
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:09,312
Federal Reserve actually looks

1630
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:12,896
The Federal Reserve is run by their board

1631
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:16,480
Governor's each of whom is appointed by the president of the United States

1632
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:17,760
Score

1633
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:20,320
They served

1634
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:23,904
Thank you be reappointed or knots on a very basic level they're accountable to

1635
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:24,672
The government

1636
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:25,440
It's not

1637
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:26,464
A feature of

1638
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:28,000
Any private company

1639
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:28,768
In this

1640
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:31,072
Did they would have that sort of stuff

1641
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:38,752
Don't you remember how the president

1642
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:51,040
It's a it's a private business

1643
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:52,320
Confirm

1644
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:56,928
Each of the 12 Federal

1645
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:59,232
Terrible AR

1646
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:01,792
Federal reserve banks

1647
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:05,120
Commercial Bank

1648
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:06,656
Basically their stockholders

1649
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,704
Any Federal Reserve

1650
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:10,240
According to invest

1651
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:11,264
Expedia

1652
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:13,056
Distinction to make

1653
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:15,872
Is that while these member banks are considered owners of

1654
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:19,968
Member Bank

1655
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:25,088
Amir Federal Reserve

1656
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:28,160
But

1657
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,696
Investment is fixed at 6

1658
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,464
Percent

1659
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:31,488
It can't be higher than that

1660
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:33,536
Oh s*** that's a good idea

1661
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:35,328
Furthermore

1662
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:38,144
May not pledged as collateral for loan

1663
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:40,704
He specifically held there

1664
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:44,544
The Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market

1665
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:46,848
The Federal Reserve

1666
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,408
The seven people appointed by the president

1667
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,432
Confirm

1668
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:51,456
The open market

1669
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:54,272
Is made up of the same seven board members

1670
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:55,552
In five of the heads

1671
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:56,832
The 12 Federal Reserve

1672
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,368
In essence the balance

1673
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:00,672
Power always

1674
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:01,440
Governors

1675
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:02,464
Who can outvote

1676
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:03,488
The heads of the Regional Bank

1677
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:04,768
If there is a friction

1678
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:09,888
Infowars report

1679
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:18,848
Respond

1680
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:21,408
So also the Federal Reserve Bank

1681
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:22,944
Don't rely on tax dollars

1682
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:27,552
Interest interest

1683
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:28,576
Depository

1684
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,368
However

1685
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:34,464
They can't really make that much money because quote any except burning must

1686
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,232
Be transferred to

1687
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:36,000
The US Treasury

1688
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:41,376
The reserve bank's amounted to about 35.5 bill

1689
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:46,752
Billion dollars of which 31.79% was transferred

1690
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:47,776
The US Treasury

1691
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:48,800
That again

1692
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:52,640
It does not exist with any other private for

1693
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:53,408
Prophet

1694
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:55,200
Essentially

1695
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,992
It is for prop

1696
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:58,528
Yeah

1697
01:45:59,040 --> 01:45:59,552
Impress

1698
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:03,392
The 80s or 4 price

1699
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:04,416
Yes

1700
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:06,208
They can't make a profit

1701
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:06,976
Isn't

1702
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:09,792
Transfer to

1703
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:14,656
Skated why this

1704
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:16,192
Exist in the structure that it does

1705
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:27,200
Hate the fat

1706
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:33,344
Because while you're explaining to do I'm going through this and I'm like

1707
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:34,624
Okay

1708
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:35,392
Okay

1709
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:36,160
Okay

1710
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:39,488
But there's a part of me in the back of my head it's like

1711
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:45,376
I want to stop listening to you now

1712
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:48,960
This is Aiden

1713
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:51,520
Massively complicated system

1714
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:55,360
Easy to understand if you actually look at it

1715
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:59,200
It's not that hard to understand

1716
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:04,832
If you look at it through the prism of a solely private or public

1717
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:07,136
Private-public

1718
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:13,024
Business also the Federal Reserve is subject

1719
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:13,792
Exhausted

1720
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:14,560
Government over

1721
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:19,424
Is the government accountability office

1722
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,472
Conducted multiple reviews of their operations

1723
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:22,240
Every year

1724
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:27,360
And every year an outside unbiased select the office of the Inspector General

1725
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:28,640
Does an audit of all the

1726
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,944
General actually isn't

1727
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:31,712
Spectra deck right now

1728
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:32,480
That is true

1729
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:42,976
I'm trying to find a way to reference the fact that he and I both have a cross eye and I'm excited about it.

1730
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:49,376
Battery

1731
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:51,680
Picture of anything that you would ever see you in private

1732
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:52,704
Yeah it exist

1733
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:54,496
Because of the private-public

1734
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:57,056
Intersection of court

1735
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:59,360
All of this is to say that no

1736
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:00,384
The Federal Reserve

1737
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,920
Is substantially

1738
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:03,456
More Federal than Federal

1739
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:07,808
This is just a propaganda catchphrase that allows people to

1740
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,088
Impressionable people

1741
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:10,112
You don't understand.

1742
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:10,880
Complexity of

1743
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:12,928
Public-private

1744
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:13,696
The Federal Reserve

1745
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:15,744
Weight function

1746
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:18,048
If it were to be entirely private

1747
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,096
The bank would have no reason to act

1748
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:23,424
Complete

1749
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:24,448
A plunder the f***

1750
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:25,216
Country

1751
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:28,544
If it were entirely public Federal Reserve System

1752
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:35,200
Compromise way too easily by a president or political party

1753
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:38,784
Exact

1754
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:40,320
And when properly regulated

1755
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:42,624
Appropriate oversight applied

1756
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:43,392
It does work

1757
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:44,416
Pretty well

1758
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:46,208
But unfortunately

1759
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:59,776
Entirely private business

1760
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:02,592
The worry of that is that they will start acting with

1761
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:03,872
Impunity and not in the pub

1762
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:06,176
And that's what we see

1763
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:07,456
That's why

1764
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:10,528
Really negative effect

1765
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:12,320
Without

1766
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:13,344
Regulation

1767
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,368
Is essentially a

1768
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:15,136
Pirate

1769
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:17,184
Enterprise there's no reason for them not to

1770
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:22,048
Company

1771
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,352
When you when you get down to

1772
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:25,632
Unfettered

1773
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:27,424
Pure capitalism

1774
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:29,728
They will travel around the world

1775
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:32,288
And pillage and plunder

1776
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:33,824
F*** if they won't kill

1777
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:37,408
Responsible for setting like interest

1778
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:38,432
Something else like that

1779
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:40,224
It has to be a political

1780
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,784
Because otherwise it could be at the whim of

1781
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:49,952
And that's why that power has to be slightly external 2D like Treasury Department

1782
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:56,608
Say hey treasury secretary inflate the economy

1783
01:49:56,864 --> 01:50:03,008
For instance violation of

1784
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:07,872
Federal Reserve interest rate

1785
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:12,224
Is there a

1786
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,784
Fear if it were a holy

1787
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:15,808
Public

1788
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:17,088
Institution

1789
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:19,648
Like I understand why people hate

1790
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:25,024
I do

1791
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,816
Why some people are uncomfortable

1792
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,352
Because it does seem like

1793
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:34,752
Like

1794
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:37,824
Regulation and oversight

1795
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:38,848
Required

1796
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:39,616
Fortify

1797
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:40,384
Absolutely

1798
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,920
But I don't like

1799
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:44,224
The complaints that Alex Jones makes about it

1800
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:49,600
We can look into what they say and how it works

1801
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:51,136
It's not true

1802
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:52,160
Like at 8

1803
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:54,976
They're just lying about it

1804
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:56,000
To demonize it

1805
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:59,072
There are real complaints

1806
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:02,912
Complained that means to me your argument

1807
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:03,680
This week

1808
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:08,288
And it's the same reason people hate

1809
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:09,056
F******

1810
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:09,824
Calculus

1811
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:11,104
Like

1812
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:14,432
Trying to understand it makes you

1813
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:27,488
Picture that I

1814
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:34,144
Because

1815
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:40,544
Connection yourself

1816
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,664
Text

1817
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,968
And then the whole puzzle starts to come into shape

1818
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:51,296
Used apps like

1819
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:52,832
The second page of Google

1820
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:55,136
I would even argue

1821
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:58,720
Never go to the second page

1822
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:01,280
Then of course

1823
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:05,632
Cuz it's hard to understand

1824
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:17,152
Call Yaya

1825
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:23,296
Vigilant as you can

1826
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:27,136
There are so many opposing forces within our government

1827
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:28,928
How many times have we seen

1828
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:29,696
The Fed

1829
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:35,072
Regulated more and then regulated

1830
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:35,840
Send that whole thing

1831
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:38,400
To the feds

1832
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:39,936
Federal reserve's website

1833
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:45,312
I was really hoping that you would so totally surprised we was like

1834
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:46,080
By the way

1835
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,920
That was made

1836
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:54,272
Great things to say about the website

1837
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:55,552
It's really awesome

1838
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:58,624
It's navigate

1839
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:00,416
So much information

1840
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:01,952
Balance

1841
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:17,568
Literally audit yourself

1842
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:18,336
Right now

1843
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:21,152
Well I mean

1844
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:24,736
Fit Physical Therapy Colorado

1845
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:28,320
You can track trends

1846
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:33,696
From here on out here is the simplest thing

1847
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,512
Somebody says like

1848
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,536
The Fed

1849
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:39,840
You just ask

1850
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:41,376
Have you been to their website

1851
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:44,704
Whatever question you may have

1852
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:49,824
It's not sure proves they're not

1853
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:51,104
Evil

1854
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:56,480
Good or evil at this

1855
01:53:57,248 --> 01:53:58,016
I'm just asking

1856
01:53:58,272 --> 01:53:59,296
Have you been to their website

1857
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:05,696
Because if you haven't but you don't know all that information

1858
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:09,024
I have a conversation where you have

1859
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:13,120
Federal Reserve

1860
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,680
A very important service

1861
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:16,704
To arconic

1862
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,728
I mean

1863
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:20,288
Historically

1864
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:24,896
How many massive crash

1865
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:25,664
Do we have

1866
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:31,296
Right

1867
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:39,232
I go into Alex Jones

1868
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:40,768
Documentaries

1869
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:44,352
If you have an argument that

1870
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,120
Specific

1871
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:46,656
I'm willing to listen

1872
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:48,192
Lincoln Escape

1874
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:53,568
You something I can look into

1875
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:57,408
I looked into it and I thought oh my God it is entirely private

1876
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:05,344
Holyshit

1877
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:10,464
Give me head entirely private

1878
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,768
For-profit company that would interest rate

1879
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:16,096
And all the other big financial responsibilities that they have

1880
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:19,424
Do you like

1881
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:28,384
Especially since we talked

1882
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:37,344
Is not true

1883
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:39,136
Boy

1884
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:42,720
Anyway

1885
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:47,584
Everybody

1886
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:50,912
For today

1887
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:53,728
Said I believe

1888
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:55,264
I think I don't know

1889
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:57,056
Tobias

1890
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:58,592
Information

1891
01:55:58,848 --> 01:56:02,176
Always love to tell people about how Barry Goldwater created

1892
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:04,736
That's always doing this documentary

1893
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:07,552
And that was the only thing I got to tell people about

1894
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:08,832
I think it would be worth it

1895
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:09,856
Just to tell you about

1896
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:10,880
The weird

1897
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:12,928
Weird life the Barry Goldwater live

1898
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:16,512
But

1899
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:17,280
The Glimpse

1900
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,304
Just how wrong

1901
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:20,864
Alex is on a fundamental level

1902
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:22,144
Just about one of his biggest issue

1903
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:25,216
Visa V the Federal Reserve in whether or not it's

1904
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:27,008
Our private

1905
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:30,080
Should I

1906
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:32,128
Very important for us to all

1907
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:33,152
Carry with us

1908
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:36,480
When we understand that

1909
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:38,528
What is the

1910
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:40,576
Jones's beliefs

1911
01:56:41,088 --> 01:56:42,624
And when you realize that that is what's up

1912
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:44,672
It's something that is a fundamental

1913
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:46,464
Elementary misunderstanding

1914
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:49,792
Things look a little Saturday

1915
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:57,472
Back tomorrow with part 3

1916
01:56:57,728 --> 01:57:01,568
I bought that for now

1917
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:03,872
Also

Twitter tattoo

1919
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:06,944
Knowledge underscore fight we are on

1920
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:10,528
We have a group called go home and tell your mother you're brilliant

1921
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:12,576
Which is a lot of fun people post

1922
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:13,344
Stop

1923
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:15,904
Talk about nonsense and if you'd like to join

1924
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:18,464
Please. Come on over the water is okay

1925
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:21,792
Be great if you could

Your peeps

1928
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:29,216
Word-of-mouth is the best way to spread

1929
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:32,288
Recommending something

1930
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:33,312
More likely that

1931
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:34,848

01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:39,968

Let me see if I can come up

1935
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:44,320
Off the top of my head

1936
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:46,624
Someone who is not killed anybody

1937
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:48,416
I was watching Survivor series

1938
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:53,024
The other night WWE Survivor Series

1939
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:56,096
He's a big old hospital man

1940
01:57:56,352 --> 01:57:56,864
But

1941
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:57,632
He's never killed

1942
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,960
Anybody in kayfabe

1943
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:02,752
I'm certain as a human

1944
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:03,520
The guy who

1945
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:05,056
For Cricket the character

1946
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:07,360
Never killed anybody

1947
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:09,152
But there is one guy who texts

1948
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:11,200
We probably may have killed some

1949
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:12,480

1950
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:19,136
