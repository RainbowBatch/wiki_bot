Cherry cranberry

11
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,280

12
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:36,096
I don't know I don't actually know what

13
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,376
Applying the word Cola mean

14
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,960
Romania means it tastes like a Coke but with cherry cranberry flavoring

15
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,728
Okay

16
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:42,752

17
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,288

Jordan taking a swig

24
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,064
Wow

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,832
This is

26
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:57,856
F****** delay

27
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,904
Yes it is so good

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,672
This is the first

29
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,696
It's so good

30
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,232
How many drinks

31
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,536

Taste like

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,352
No idea

34
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,912
All I can experience

35
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,728
I will open mine up during our first

36
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:19,104
Clip but first let's get to an out-of-context drop of Alex Jones let me ask you a question

37
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:24,736
Oh yeah I forgot about that

38
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
Good point

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,856
Listen

40
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,880
Can we take that again

41
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,976
Is there

42
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,584
I know a lot about Alex Jones

43
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:58,528
I also

44
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,320
Riddles with

45
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,648
F****** Frodo in the dark

46
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
Weird Troll game

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
Great

48
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,888
This is the first honorary

49
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:22,592
For quite a while he sent me what may be the world's greatest female

50
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,688
Sort of lift my spirits

51
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
Whatever I feel like

52
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,808
It doesn't matter that we're doing the show

53
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,856
I can take a little look at this email

54
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,672
Alright that's very reassuring I appreciate it very much

55
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,232
To the point where I've been trying to write him back

56
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
For about 2

57
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
2 weeks

58
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
And I can't

59
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:47,168
And I feel like an a****** so publicly

60
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
And give you

61
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,728
An honorary policy walk status

62
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
Welcome aboard

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
Welcome

64
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,896
Don't need to

65
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,688
Email was so good

66
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,344
Dan apparently kept to himself and did not tell me about it which I can only assume

67
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:09,696
You talk some serious s*** about me.

68
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,232
The show is garbage and it's

69
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:15,584
Should just be dead too much we just want dance analysis

70
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,216
I know it's gorgeous I was embarrassed through so

71
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
I have to hide those things

72
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,824
Anyway thank you very much Brian

73
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
Whenever people

74
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,248
Thanks

75
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,296
About Alex

76
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,856
We're going to be in Berkeley

77
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
Part 4

78
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,464
Of my investigation into what the f*** happened to Alex Jones in 2015

79
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,536
Recovering the time fan

80
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,072
Of July

81
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,120
Through July 21st

82
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,400
2015

83
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,984
The weird road ahead

84
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
But there's a lot of stuff

85
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
It's very worth

86
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Disgusting

87
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
And I was just being

88
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
Very weird

89
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176
Very weird

90
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,480
His head space is so f***** up

91
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
And I think I started to piece

92
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
A few things together

93
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,600
I'm going to give you some of this analysis up from

94
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,160
I think

95
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,952
That Alex Jones

96
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,512
More than being just a

97
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,815
Is someone who

98
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
Tricked by Propaganda very

99
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,447
And I think

100
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:31,615
I like to play the game where there's something Supernova areas going on in Rodger stone is pulling the strings behind him

101
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,407
And that may be the case

102
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,015
But a very simple explanation

103
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,791
I'm starting brick

104
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,351
Scientists have discovered that Alex Jones is a

105
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
I'm starting

106
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
To get

107
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,471
That possibly a lot of his transformation

108
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
2015

109
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,847
That there is weaponize propaganda going around

110
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,127
And he is as much a

111
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,663
Proponent of it as he is a victim

112
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,503
And one of the things that made that click into place

113
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,343
Was I was listening very carefully to James comey's testimony

114
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
And one of the things that he was at

115
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,695
Was when do the FBI B

116
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
First aware

117
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
In Russian

118
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
Influencer camp

119
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
And his answer was

120
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
Summer of 2005

121
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,167
Which is right around

122
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
The era when we're talk

123
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
I've noticed

124
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,359
Instances of Alec believing bulshit stories

125
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,383
That were

126
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
Deliberately

127
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,247
Trace back to

128
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
Russian

129
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
I don't I don't know if we can

130
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
Definitively say that

131
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,207
We can definitely say that he believes

132
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
Complete lies

133
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
Susceptible

134
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
If

135
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
He was hack

136
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,775
There's all sorts of s*** that could be found out.

137
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799
Campaign

138
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,639
It's entirely possible

139
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,431
Someone who is trying to use

140
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,223
Influence campaign

141
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,039
You're trying to use propaganda to sway public opinion

142
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,111
One of the very obvious targets would be

143
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
He's clearly crazy

144
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
He's hiding

145
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,231
Something

146
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,047
Is

147
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,119
Control he has a lunatic fringe the volume

148
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,423
Like it would be someone who

149
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
Obviously wanted

150
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,495
A lunatic fringe dad

151
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,567
We can probably safely say

152
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Proportionally more violent

153
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Send the rest of us

154
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
Yeah

155
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
So

156
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,455
I don't know if any of this will bear route

157
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,759
But that's something that I'm starting to look at

158
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
I'm starting to

159
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,087
I feel is that he just false propaganda

160
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
Santa really easily

161
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
And we'll see a bit of it over the course

162
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Episode

163
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,695
But first

164
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,231
In July 14th

165
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,047
I looked interesting ride

166
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:03,423
On July 14th big announcement that he starts the show with

167
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215
Because I will get

168
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,239
At the end of the squid

169
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,543
I'll explain why this excites the s*** out of me

170
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,079
I think you'll know

171
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
I think

172
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,639
Beautiful

173
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:19,551
Loaded transmission

174
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,415
The first 3 hours

175
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,743
4 hours

176
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,911
Or some station

177
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:40,287
But I am looking for

178
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,615
Sometime this year

179
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,687
But making the force hour

180
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:53,087
An intense broadcast

181
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,647
We're more than 50 articles

182
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,695
Will be covered everyday

183
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
Boom boom boom

184
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,607
Comment from the people on the panel

185
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
Make a call

186
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,911
Go to the next story

187
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,447
How's it going to go with

188
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,287
So first of all

189
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,871
Emoto really

190
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:25,855
Even for you sir this much closer to John Rappaport

191
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,255
Right within the context of 3 hours

192
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
But once the fourth hour comes

193
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,071
Is there a posse

194
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,863
Ability

195
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
Episode where he does try this

196
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
And that is the beginning

197
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,799
Fourth hour on this episode on July 14th

198
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,103
Yeah Leanne McAdoo

199
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,663
I mean I mean my work talking about like the Roundtable

200
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
So like

201
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:53,247
Bro I don't think

202
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,271
He ever does that

203
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,367
You can't just just the idea of

204
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:04,255
Alex trying to coexist with three other people allowed to talk at the same time

205
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
02 I think he's been able to

206
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
Beautiful fire

207
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,375
I think the premise is he's not involved

208
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,751
I've been secretly training

209
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:21,151
Having them on air that's a good idea Naman are they don't know I'm building

210
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
Do something tonight

211
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,455
Anyway

212
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,575
Another thing he talks about is how he's going to launch a TV network

213
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
Which is important because he's

214
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,903
Lying about that

215
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
Currently

216
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:39,327
Years later you still think we're about to do is show like through

217
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,935
I think there's reasons not to get to

218
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,703
To freak out

219
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
But Alex's

220
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,031
Stated plans in 2017 of having a

221
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
TV networks

222
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
But if it does happen

223
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
Be very worried

224
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Because

225
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
Becomes the most

226
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,039
Stood TV network in history

227
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:05,439
Worries me just because I don't know if I'm ready to allow my tax dollars to go to that many

228
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,255
You remember how likespike

229
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
Big TV on

230
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
Immediately got sued

231
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
Does bike leaves like that's my name

232
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
Do not remember

233
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
I can't

234
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,055
Say this enough bring on the Rapaport

235
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
Yeah I'm excited for that to happen

236
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,407
Lee Ann McAdoo host the fourth hour in this

237
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
Episode and she is not ready

238
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,759
It's just very silly house somehow

239
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
Weave

240
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
We've developed

241
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
Weird

242
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,927
Genre

243
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:41,023

244
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,303
He's a f******

245
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,863
Miserable monsters

246
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,911
Enjoy from everyone ends

247
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,727
Vaccination

248
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
But at the same time

249
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,639
Weirdo monster that lives in a cave

250
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:04,575
That's part of it

251
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,903
The googly-eyed Muppet druid

252
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:12,511
Rapaport when he shows up here

253
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
I don't know man

254
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:24,031
The other other rounds

255
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
The greater question

256
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
The grey

257
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
Weather Gandalf

258
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
Radagast

259
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:38,879
The Lords of the Ring goose

260
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,951
So some people have sort of a religious feelings

261
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
About Lourdes

262
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
Would you agree with that

263
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,559
So take it on as a religion

264
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,095
I'm talking about nerds

265
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,167
I feel like you're leading me toward something

266
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,751
Not a smooth

267
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,055

Hawaii

270
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
He's been getting more religious

271
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,711
If you think that it's a complete thought

272
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,039
You're wrong it's like galadriel's water

273
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,511
People contabil

274
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,095
Are you getting more more religious

275
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,567
Babies wrapped in gold foil

276
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:34,687
China by the thousands

277
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:41,087
Younger

278
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:55,935
When you look at when you look at

The billionaire drug dealer

283
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,271
Even lives off us taxpayers

284
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,087
It's a joke

285
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,951
Find me a joke that's why I'm committed to fight as hard as I can

286
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,511
British Special Forces

287
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,631
Special Air Services

288
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
Fortune favors the Bold

289
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:46,623
Fortune favors the Bold

290
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,183
What's a hatchimal

291
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
But they

00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:04,287

296
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,879
We only see Errol Spence

297
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,951
Just getting the lights

298
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:02,399
Not seen ear has not heard what God the universe has in store for us

299
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
Going to let the globalist

300
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,007
Roloff reality put us in a maze race

301
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,799

We are We Are Powerful

305
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,399
The 41 others evolve

306
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,727
Alex has been getting more religious

307
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,775
Was there actually a reason in there

308
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:44,383
Yeah it was it was the closest hip-hop

309
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,455
Foxholes on YouTube

310
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:52,575
They're causing all the oceans in the hundreds of Millions

311
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
100

312
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
Billions

313
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,255
I don't know statistics

314
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:04,607
I don't know what I'd like seven and a half billion on the planet right now

315
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
Like

316
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,703
I don't know

317
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,751
100 million baby

318
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,799
And then like

319
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,567
70

320
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
So

321
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,455
If there were hundreds of millions of a borscht

322
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
That means that if

323
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527
He were to stop

324
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,319
Entirely possible

325
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
We would have

326
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
12 billion people on

327
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,231
CDC

328
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,791
Disease Control in 2013

329
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,631
660 4435 legal induced abortion

330
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
Reported

331
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,215
So that's that's in the United States

332
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:50,943
Is crazy like the babies covered in gold foil

333
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,575
We got a Willy Wonka's factory situation gone there where babies were on conveyor

334
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
Conveyor belt

335
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:05,791
There was a guy who got arrested with like some babies covered in foil like mummified babies

336
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
He was trying to transport back

337
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
To China

338
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
Philippines

339
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
I don't read the origin country

340
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
He was doing that

341
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
Because

342
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,127
I have a very interesting relationship with

343
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Fetuses

344
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,199
Especially ones that

345
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:27,039
Have died tradition around abortion where

346
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
If you get an abortion

347
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,367
Junior supposed to create a shrine to the baby

348
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
And worship

349
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
The fetus goes

350
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,951
Appease the fetus ghost

351
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,487
Look up food

352
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
And stuff like that to help it

353
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,815
The Otherworld

354
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,863
That's like that's like a box

355
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
Old Norse

356
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,215
I don't know enough

357
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,007
Speak on why someone would want to buy some

358
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,799
I have no idea

359
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:53,919
More complicated stuff going on there than Alex is really wrestling with it's not for people to

360
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
Eat them

361
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,503
The other stuff is so crazy

362
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,831
He believes in God but then he gets into

363
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,391
There's 12 Dimensions there's probably things living in

364
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
I'm out I want to get I want to just

365
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,559
Jump forward to another day's show because

366
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
Embarrassed

367
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
Playing here

368
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,703
In this clip Alex Jones talked a little bit about what he believes

369
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
About something

370
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,007
Specific to scripture

371
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,079
He's not the bad idea

372
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
He shouldn't really be

373
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
Brain scripture

374
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,967
Christianity that most people know

375
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,247
Hugo

376
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,903
I don't judge people

377
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:42,303
I can speak for God but just hit my gut level in my spirit

378
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,655
I would personally do it

379
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
Strong showing

380
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:55,103
Assisted suicide and end eugenics

381
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,151
As if it's just some choice

382
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,223
Of somebody

383
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,527
This is about devaluing human life

384
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,183
White

385
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:13,279
So he's against assisted suicide and stuff like that because he Compares it to a movie

386
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,351
Government

387
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
Control

388
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,703
They have some government girls baby

389
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:30,943
Anime if you look at the Bible 27 people who committed suicide clearly in the Bible

390
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,735
Six of them are called

391
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
Specifically Wicked

392
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
In the

393
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
Further

394
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:40,159
Job 1:21 says Naked I came from my mother's womb and naked I will depart

395
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,207
The lord gave and the Lord hath taken away

396
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:46,303
A lot of people interpret that to mean that the Lord gives you

397
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,839
Your life will and the Lord

398
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,607
Takes away

399
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,631
When your life

400
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,191
1st Corinthians 10:13

401
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,263
He will not let you be tempted by more than you can bear

402
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,335
But when you are tempted God will also give you a way to escape at 2

403
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,639
Lot of people interpret

404
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,687
To be either Temptation towards

405
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,271
Or temptation to eat God will not give you more than you can handle more than you

406
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
Compare which is

407
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,575
Clearly bolts

408
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:13,439
Further what reason to disbelieve the Bible that would be definitely

409
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,743
Further one of The Commandments

410
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,887
Strictly speaking a lot of people believe that murder is

411
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,935
Suicide is murder your murdering yourself

412
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
It would be against

413
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,287
If God has given you life you don't have the right to

414
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
To take it away

415
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,103
That's a pretty consistent theological message

416
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,175
Especially if people who have a pretty hard line on the bike

417
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,503
If you're anti-abortion than the same logic

418
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:43,135
What you think so Alex is in this weird f****** religious-based either way

419
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,183
I just wanted to bring that up cuz I think you're dumb

420
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,511
I don't know if you know this or not but when Alex is growing up

421
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
His

422
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:50,815
Actually read him

423
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,583
The Apocrypha

424
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,887
They didn't have a

425
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,655
King James

426
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,703
They had a

427
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,263
AB tattoo on his arm

428
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:05,663
Maryvale

429
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
Like 10 years ago

430
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,783
That one didn't exist

431
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:20,512
Grew up studying gnosticism smarter

432
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,840
You know what's going on with the bar balogh what's going on here

433
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,168
He was boring fan of the Week

434
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,216
He's more afraid of the ones where Jesus

435
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,752
Dragons in.

436
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,312
Who killed other kids for no reason you know the good stuff

437
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,080
CIA

438
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,432
Something really important

439
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,784
Alex is only said that he doesn't trust Trump

440
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,880
All these are things very negative

441
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
Things although

442
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,440
He does agree with his rhetoric

443
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
Las Vegas

444
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,000
Hates the hits

445
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,792
Does not think it's big

446
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,608
But let's move on

447
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,680
So on this show he has an interview with

448
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704
TV

449
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,240
Movies on TV

450
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,288
Maybe just a radio host Larry Elder

451
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
Who is

452
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
Is big

453
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,688
And I think Alex is a little bit blindsided by

454
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,040
Oh really I think he's not ready to have this interview was he not expecting

455
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:20,160
I don't know I'm not sure exactly I think he wanted just to talk about race it with a black guy

456
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,720
And accidentally got sidetracked

457
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Into

458
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
Okay

459
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,328
So what he was

460
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,632
When he was ostensibly doing is

461
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,192
Like pointing to any alike

462
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,728
He's he's got a

463
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
Global

464
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,800
Just closes his eyes and points on is like

465
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,592
Find me a black eye

466
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:42,432
And I will put them on the show so I don't feel like a horrible races

467
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,224
Cuz I'm totally horrible

468
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,576
Conversation

469
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,112
Identity politics

470
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
Largely what

471
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,440
He wants to talk about

472
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:03,680
Globalism

473
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,728
That's why they're now drilling down

474
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,592
Mom

475
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:19,552
To just kill

476
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:26,208
Alex

477
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,744
Legal aliens

478
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,864
But he soon well

479
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:37,216
Indicative of

480
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,752
Exactly what this interview is

481
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,824
Alex wants to talk about the globalist to take away identity

482
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
And s*** like that

483
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,896
Of course

484
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:48,736
Mostly influenced by

485
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
Confederate flag

486
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,696
Because of terrorist

487
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:02,560
Immediately in answering that question Larry Elder

488
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
Why would you

489
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
Like

490
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
Alex

491
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,312
Expect any of his guests

492
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,104
With no prep time

493
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,384
Apparently

494
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,272
Like this cuz you're gone Infowars you're not buying it

495
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,952
I-16 Alex does very consistently regularly

496
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,512
He has gas really hard

497
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
Because of course he does

498
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,608
I've noticed this text

499
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,400
You heard it a little bit there

500
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,568
These people are trying to outlaw

501
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
Pretty early in the interview

502
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,408
He'll repeat a false story

503
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,200
And get them to sign off on it

504
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,016
As they will know that it's a full story

505
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:58,112
But they don't want to challenge his authority on the show

506
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,160
Platform

507
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,208
And after that point they are essentially copper

508
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
Right so

509
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,280
I know that he does

510
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,304
Also I think

511
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,864
He has a big enough stable of people who are like

512
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,680
On the globalist

513
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,776
I mean yay globulus whatever but did you hear about the

514
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,592
This is the first time Larry Elder

515
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,896
Just that we don't we've not had him on an episode

516
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:27,040
I'm sure they've a pre-existing relationship where they both know that each other yells about global

517
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:30,112
So I

518
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
True

519
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
So

520
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,744
The interview goes on a little bit

521
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
And Alex prices

522
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
Still doesn't really

523
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:38,816
Who trust Trump

524
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,544
And misrepresenting what he's

525
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:57,504
Serious is going to drop out later

526
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:02,880
But regardless waterproofer world that way.

527
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,976
So that's where he's in this in the middle

528
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,512
Trump Larry Elder you still saying

529
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,792
I don't trust her

530
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,840
But what are you saying

531
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
Is true so we had

532
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Defense

533
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
Free to find it

534
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,936
Grapes

535
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,216
The logic of a lunatic

536
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,008
Larry Elder steps

537
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:25,408
I disagree

538
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:29,504
Recalling

539
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,024
Election

540
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,400
No not about it

541
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,728
Not in globalist line

542
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,520
The thing and then the word means nothing

543
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,360
Cases of legitimate rape

544
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,920
The body has a way of shutting that down

545
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,712
Right

546
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,760
And then the second

547
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,904
It's legitimate in front of rape has

548
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,184
Nothing to do

549
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
With

550
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,768
Whether or not somebody lies about

551
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,048
That wasn't

552
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,352
Entirely about all of the like

553
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
Well

554
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,424
Legitimate rape is you have

555
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
Have to be beaten up

556
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,752
You can't be cold worse

557
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,520
Right

558
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,800
Pressured on it

559
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,080
You can't give in

560
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,616
You can't

561
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,944
To do it you're like well I guess the

562
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,712
This is my fault

563
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,808
Illegitimate

564
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,344
That's not a thing

565
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,880
Then the second

566
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,672
Airport Park

567
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
Magic

568
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:45,024
He said cases of legitimate rape

569
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,792
Magic is

570
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:49,120
The body has a way of shutting that down

571
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:56,032
Larry Elders argument is that Todd Akin f*****-up I apologize

572
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:59,872
Yeah I've Trump isn't making that problem he's not

573
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,528
Probably would have done better

574
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,088
I think that's what we really learned

575
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
Again

576
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,904
Dog whistling is for losers

577
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,488
Just out now bigotry

578
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:22,144
Like earlier early episodes of the show

579
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
Trump should not have fired Flynn

580
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,008
The oldest probably wouldn't be happening

581
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,056
Put his dick on the table it was like

582
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,080
No

583
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,480
God dammit

584
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,504
How

585
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,808
Because that's also the

586
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:43,136
The last time that is really listen to anybody there either

587
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:43,904
It seems like

588
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
Yeah like

589
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,488
Hit everybody was like hey you got to get rid of Flynn this

590
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,536
This is a bad idea

591
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,096
Non-stop from there and

592
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,144
Now anytime they're like hey Trump

593
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,168
Don't do this

594
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,960
He's like

595
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,848
Exactly.

596
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,712
You think this travel ban shouldn't

597
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:13,600
Call the travel ban cuz then we

598
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,928
It was on the campaign

599
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:21,024
Eagle

600
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,864
So a little bit longer

601
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,960
Larry Elder supports Trump admits

602
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,008
Good Trump probably is just out for

603
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,552
For his overall Empire

604
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:50,976
Oh I think it's all of the above I think of Donald Trump

605
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,768
And maybe he'll make even more money

606
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:58,912
Univision

607
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:03,264
NBC

608
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,592
But he made a loser

609
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:11,456
I think overall

610
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,248
My brand be even bigger

611
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,416
The possibility that he sincere

612
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,328
He thinks our deals with the various other countries are we

613
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:31,424
Anythink

614
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,824
I'm going off the grid for this holiday

615
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,808
I guess

616
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:57,024
Underage way.

617
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,728
That pisses people off that's the first thing I wholeheartedly agree with

618
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,824
Clearly clearly with Trump in office in the other Republican

619
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,896
Still not doing anything

620
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,712
Group of West Larry Elder is

621
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,344
Absolutely

622
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,392
Conversation we're having is about

623
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,440
Probably f****** around 4

624
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:32,096
The eat to the point where Larry Elder even says let's not discount the possibility

625
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,008
And Alex because he's putting his business

626
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,800
Things on the line not realizing

627
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,872
So much for abusing Impreza

628
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
Oh man

629
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,248
To the point where all of the alike

630
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,528
They are right

631
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,320
About everything

632
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,880
Being a publicity stunt Ma

633
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,672
And an idea to make more money

634
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,976
It just so happened that he got the presidency

635
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,512
So he's using it

636
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,048
To generate more

637
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,632
Department of Justice

638
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:08,704
Is arguing that you should be allowed to take money from whoever he

639
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,568
Department of Justice in the United

640
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
Midstate

641
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
Actively arguing

642
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,664
You know that Constitution

643
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,248
Not a fan

644
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,040
Why we're on this like little Trump thing

645
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,576
I loved that moment

646
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,856
From his press conference

647
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,416
Last week where he's at the Romanian president

648
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:32,512
And there's nothing about waivers but Visa waivers where Romanian

649
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,536
He's like

650
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,352
We didn't talk about it

651
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:41,472
I brought it up what the f***

652
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,776
Just watch that clip alone

653
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,312
No not not go

654
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,848
Dick everything else away

655
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,896
Very bad

656
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,664
Not good

657
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,248
To trust

658
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,552
My brother was born in Bucharest

659
00:32:55,808 --> 00:33:00,416
So I have no relation to

660
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,696
Miserable

661
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,512
There was also back in the

662
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,352
Please do so I mean that hilarious doing a lot

663
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
Better than

664
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,144
Back then

665
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,960
Larry Elders knock

666
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,544
You've got to be involved in two more clips

667
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
That are pretty offensive

668
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:24,992
One is about Charleston and then the other ones just got race this one is wild

669
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,952
Kim

670
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:40,352
The first person who shot freezone

671
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:54,944
Yeah

672
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,016
Turning into the argument you could had a nice

673
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,320
Then I'll blah blah blah that stupid argument

674
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,088
It's a dumb

675
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,160
Is the idea that like

676
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:04,928
Okay

677
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,976
Someone there

678
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,024
Their fault cuz they didn't have a gun

679
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,048
And further its

680
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,352
Society's fault for disarming churches

681
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,424
And it's his fault

682
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,472
That these people died not the person

683
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,544
Not the white supremacist who actually did it

684
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,080
So

685
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:28,224
Interesting juxtaposition

686
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
It's because we

687
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,016
The anti-gun agenda

688
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,296
Supremacist

689
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,392
Cuz he the Charleston

690
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,672
Shooting happened

691
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
You got two weeks

692
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
Before this

693
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,000
But there's a shooting in Chattanooga

694
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,792
A couple days

695
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:44,096
After where we're at now

696
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,888
Very differently

697
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,912
You don't

698
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,960
I said that

699
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,984
Jokingly

700
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,520
And then I realized that's

701
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,544
Exactly what they believe

702
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,592
Every time somebody gets shot

703
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,872
As we say

704
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
Yep that's

705
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,712
Genuinely

706
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,344
How do we lose to these people Dan

707
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,112
I don't know

708
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,904
These are the dumbest f****** people

709
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,952
Speaking of unbelievable

710
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,072
Who's the blame for races

711
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,984
Oh no

712
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,808
Cold ones

713
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:39,136
Yeah baby you're blind all the time

714
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,416
Babywipe

715
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,464
People one of the big reasons you don't

716
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,232
Understand races

717
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,256
Because it's

718
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:49,632
Course you think racism is

719
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:53,472
In a problem because it's not a problem for you

720
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,496
Do you know really

721
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,776
Expanders

722
00:35:56,288 --> 00:36:02,432
Try and relate to other people's experiences understand just how Insidious

723
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:06,528
Look at a person and be like hey what did you tell you that you're like

724
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,808
Oh that's probably true

725
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,600
I should respect

726
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,160
Telling you

727
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,440
Your life is

728
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,208
Experience

729
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:20,608
Is wrong no cuz you tell me your life experience my response

730
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,264
For the 40

731
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,080
We we see just a little bit of softening analysis

732
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,104
Position towards Trump

733
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,640
And we move on to

734
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,408
The 15th

735
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,968
Which we're not going to cover cuz David Knight hosted

736
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,016
But something important to remember

737
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:38,784
Dave

738
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,064
July 15th

739
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,088
2015

740
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,136
Helm 15

741
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:43,904
Kicked off

742
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:49,280
They was real and then later

743
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:55,680
Do you know if you said it was real for sale we don't have audio evidence of that so let's not make

744
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:59,520
Good reason to believe

745
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:03,104
We can't prove it but we can't prove it

746
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,128
But

747
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,152
Then I

748
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,432
Will retract that

749
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,736
We will see

750
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,040
Where is Heather's that a little bit later

751
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,136
What Alex is back in studio

752
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,096
Should scare everyone

753
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:29,216
Donald Trump speech

754
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:38,432
Coming up

755
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
Spoiler alert

756
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,112
He still thinks he's a shell

757
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:50,464
Becomes a little

758
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,512
Zoe on this episode

759
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,608
Has all over the goddamn

760
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:00,448
Klusterfuk of weird narrative

761
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,728
Strange things

762
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
She says

763
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:06,592
But one of them is Mark.

764
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,384
Thank you

765
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,944
Shut up it's just him talking

766
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,504
With the clipboard

767
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,856
This one is about how Mount Rushmore is racist

768
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:23,744
Roosevelt

769
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,792
No I mean that they took

770
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:32,448
American Native Land Park

771
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,240
People who stole those American Native

772
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,568
You know what Mark Dice doesn't wrestle with

773
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:44,992
So this video and I wanted to play this clip just because it indicates again.

774
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,552
Insidious cycle that Alex Jones perpetuate

775
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,880
Wherein he has one of those reporters go out create some

776
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,440
Video that doesn't say what he pretends it says

777
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,464
Drudge links

778
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,000
To it

779
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,048
You know it gets a link up somewhere

780
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,096
And then Alex Jones repeated as new

781
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,656
He's going to say that there's a headline

782
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,192
Then the headline is

783
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,264
That people are calling for the destruction of Mount Rushmore

784
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,336
Is entirely based on marked Isis video

785
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,128
At the end of this clip

786
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:12,896
Is very short

787
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,944
But this isn't news

788
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,712
Who's up top

789
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,736
I'm in at the end

790
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,040
He says he told Mark Dice to go make this PO

791
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,904
Nonsensical

792
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,720
That's how you tell Fox News operated

793
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,024
Almost from the very beginning

794
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,120
Their trick was always to have their news

795
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,400
People say

796
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
A basic story

797
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
People would be like

798
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
This is what

799
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,568
Is really happen

800
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,128
And then the next day the news would keep

801
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,408
Keep it in the cycle by Staind

802
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,944
People are saying

803
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,016
Are commentators

804
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,552
It's just people are saying

805
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,344
We're reporting on what

806
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,368
They're saying we're not

807
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,392
Verifying a Taurus

808
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:56,928
Just so happen

809
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:59,232
The people that said it are on our Network

810
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
Where can we have a

811
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,816
Insurance that you have their thoughts

812
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,840
Senior

813
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,728
So here's our reporting on Alex Jones.

814
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:14,336
Video of Obama supporters advocate

815
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,872
Mount Rushmore

816
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,920
We told you that was coming

817
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,480
Is it

818
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:24,576
Call Bird

819
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:27,136
Rushmore

820
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,416
So I mean

821
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:32,768
Yeah that's basically him saying go ghost

822
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:39,168
Go out and try and get us evidence for whatever narrative we wanted supplies

823
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,336
It's it's quite literally fake news when he says

824
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,640
I told you this is coming

825
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,688
I told you this video was going to be released

826
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:58,112
That in much the same way he predicted the people will be calling for the American flag be banned

827
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:04,000
I made these predictions and then I told my reporters

828
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,328
To somehow justify my stupid f****** predict

829
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,352
That's why he's a hundred

830
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,376
Is that right all the time

831
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:15,264
All the time long as you make it happen

832
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,336
Call the time

833
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,360
He's Ronald

834
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
Now

835
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
This

836
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,968
Is going

837
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,992
To get

838
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:25,760
Bad

839
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,784
It's going to get Mark Dice

840
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:30,368
Something else happened in July of 2015

841
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,392
That

842
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,696
Is really

843
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,488
Funny conceptually

844
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,024
But isn't funny at all

845
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,816
Is that is that

846
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,608
The Center for Medical progress

847
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,656
And made all those behind the

848
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,680
Videos

849
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,216
About Planned Parenthood people

850
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
Selling baby parts

851
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,008
That's right

852
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,128
Right

853
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,407
15 felonies

854
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:56,991
I believe the sentencing is still to come

855
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,831
Are in big trouble

856
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:04,671
Big trouble for this and I'll explain exactly why on the other end of it

857
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,463
But I want to really point out

858
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,743
Alex Jones f******

859
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,511
Buy is it

860
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,047
He's so into it

861
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,095
He talked about it a little bit here

862
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
Mmbn

863
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,423
Tire show couple days later is all about it

864
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,983
Well that was a

865
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,079
And that was all you heard that narrative

866
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,127
To the point where Noah just like

867
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,151
Just like Obama

868
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
The secret Muslim

869
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,199
Yeah

870
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,223
Still believe

871
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:32,319
They still believe that Planned Parenthood sells baby

872
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,111
Yep

873
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:38,463
Even though the people who disseminated those videos

874
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,559
Are going to jail they're still like I know that was true there's

875
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,607
Prosecutor because powers

876
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,631
The beer whatever

877
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:50,495
The Center for Medical progress

878
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:59,455
His organization

879
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:04,319
They set up a fake biomedical research company called Biomax procurement services

880
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,855
Under the guise they poses

881
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,415
Potential buyers of aborted fetal tissue in Oregon

882
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,975
And secretly recorded Planned Parenthood officials during the

883
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:15,071
Videos

884
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,631
Which promoted is showing Planned Parenthood officials

885
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,167
Price haggling over baby

886
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:25,567
When the full unedited videos became available

887
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,335
Appliance Watts

888
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:30,431
Not make money when donating fetal tissue from abortions

889
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,711
To scientific research

890
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,527
According to the lawyer for Planned Parenthood Rogers

891
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,343
Biomax proposed sham procurement contracts

892
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
Offering

893
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,927
1600 dollars for liver Infamous fetal tissue

894
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,743
I went back and I watched all of these videos

895
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,767
They are

896
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
Hey mostly additive

897
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,327
Anyone

898
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,631
You don't have an agenda that this supports

899
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,399
Would be like

900
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,423
The f*** on

901
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,703
It's so crazy

902
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,495
And Alex is so in

903
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,079
Like I can't wait till we get to the 20

904
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,383
Cuz that's when he really tease off

905
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,735
He is so you can't wait till we can

906
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,039
Also the other thing

907
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,087
To point out

908
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:09,855
Is

909
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,135
Do you know these guys

910
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,415
Umizoomi

911
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,183
Specifics here

912
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:19,839
On March 28th 2017 this day

913
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,375
And his cohort

914
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,911
Recharge the 15 felonies in

915
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,935
In the state of California

916
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,983
One for each of the people who they had filmed it.

917
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:32,895
I am really videos where they didn't get concerned

918
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,711
Making it seem like they were committing a crime

919
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,015
And one for criminal conspiracy to invade

920
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,783
Privacy

921
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:39,807
Now

922
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,111
The thing

923
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,903
Important to note is

924
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:44,927
That

925
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,231
This is funny

926
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,303
Okay good

927
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,095
Ivory

928
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,655
Now I'm free and clear everyone

929
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,423
The Gate of their client

930
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,703
The Senate

931
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,239
The the house

932
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,287
All the state governors

933
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,823
Everyone invested

934
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,127
And everyone cleared

935
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,943
Everyone investigation

936
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,479
You know who didn't

937
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,551
Set a reminder

938
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,319
Everybody

939
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,415
But this one this one's particularly song

940
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,975
On July 30th 2015

941
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,767
Indiana Governor Mike Pence

942
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,559
The state's investigation

943
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,607
Did not find any evidence of wrongdoing

944
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,399
Planned parenthood's handling of Beetlejuice

945
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,727
If Mike

946
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,775
Pence had to say that out loud I bet her

947
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
His babies die

948
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:38,175
Yeah it's just the number of Investigations that were opened into it there likes

949
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,199
Select committees

950
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,015
The the

951
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,575
United States

952
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:50,975
Committee on oversight and government reform

953
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:59,423
Strongly against Planned Parenthood are all like Flock there's nothing here everything

954
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,959
Possible within that invest

955
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,287
So hard

956
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,311
That wasn't

957
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,663
There was even a

958
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:14,015
Slight Urban likes the entirety of the claim wasn't proven

959
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,319
Catch them on this

960
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,111
Al Capone

961
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,927
Appearing charging Planned Parent

962
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:25,791
Select Committee in the United States

963
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,583

Commerce select investigation panel on play a

965
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,215
Was formed

966
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,751
The further investigate Planned Parenthood

967
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,567
Photographer woman Marsha Blackburn serving as the chairwoman

968
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,383
September 21st

969
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,687
820 to recommend holding stemexpress

970
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:43,967
Business

971
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,247
Did research

972
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,295
Got tissue from Planned Parenthood

973
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,831
In contempt

974
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,111
Failure to comply

975
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:54,463
Subpoena the six Democratic members on the panel protest before the vote

976
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,023
The committee's final report recommended that quote

977
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,815
The National Institutes of Health.

978
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,607
Stop funding fetal tissue research

979
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,143
I'm at the huge

980
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:05,215
Health provider Planned Parenthood be stripped of us funding

981
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,495
According to science

982
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,775
Publication

983
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,079
The report contained multiple inaccuracies

984
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:15,199
Democratic members of the panel respond to or vote on the final report

985
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,735
Released an alternate report

986
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:20,319
In which they criticized the committee for relying on McCarthy era tactics

987
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:24,415
And a relying on unsourced unverified documented writing of the report

988
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,695
So

989
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:28,767
That's sort of some of the aftermath of this

990
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,095
I get that you

991
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,631

994
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,983
Are you a big fan

995
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:41,311
Sure do you want to do you want to continue not being

996
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,639
Do you know new diseases

997
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,407
Can happen

998
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,943
Stroop

00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,759
Evolve

1000
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,831
Don't you want to research this

1001
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,647
You want to learn more about it

1002
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:58,207
Not just because you know you're fine now but be

1003
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:58,975
Because maybe in the

1004
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,255
In the future there will be in

1005
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,279
Information that you want

1006
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:07,935
You're talkin Voodoo My Man Zero play God

1007

Don't blame God

1008
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,727
You can't

1009
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
You can't

1010
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,079
You can't praise us

1011
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:14,847
Spirit

1012
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,383
And keep yourself from getting

1013
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:20,479
Give them science

1014
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,783
Do you know what the other thing

1015
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,063
You know what

1016
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:24,831
Panel

1017
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,879
You don't get any side from now on

1018
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:29,695
It's a 14-member panel six of them walked out

1019
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:32,255
Your phone

1020
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,303
Got soaked

1021
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,327
You know what

1022
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,095
We dip

1023
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:38,655
Land on the moon because you're not allowed to believe

1024
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:43,263
The true comedy of it too is in this video there like this guy

1025
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,543
These high prices

1026
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,567
That they're going to

1027
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,455
Pretty much across-the-board people are like

1028
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:52,991
That's higher than

1029
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,015
Repack

1030
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,807
But they're haggling

1031
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:59,135
But it's the reverse of what you expected

1032
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,927
The person coming to high

1033
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:03,231
Cuz they're trying to make it look like there was a

1034
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:08,095
Tissue scam going on

1035
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,911
It is like $50

1036
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,447
For samples

1037
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,471
Credentialed

1038
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,519
And certified Resource Center

1039
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,591
Because Quincy

1040
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,615
Parenthood

1041
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,407
By the GOP

1042
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,687
For doing

1043
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,991
Providing women in

1044
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,039
And help and how

1045
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,063
You know that kind of

1046
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,855
Making sure that we don't get

1047
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,391
Not

1048
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,159
Disease-ridden

1049
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,183
Bright

1050
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:33,951
They hate him for that

1051
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:37,279
So Planned Parenthood is always

1052
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,583
It is always being

1053
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,119
So of course

1054
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:41,887
You go and trying

1055
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,191
They have

1056
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,215
Safeguard under

1057
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:45,983
Safeguard

1058
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:46,751
Safeguard

1059
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
We will show

1060
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:51,871
Not even the slightest bit we will give them no evidence

1061
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:54,431
Even though when they close down those

1062
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,991
At the end of the day we will have been

1063
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:57,759
In within

1064
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,527
Perfect

1065
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,063
Understanding

1066
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,087
Compliance with the law

1067
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,903
Well the other thing is

1068
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,207
It's gone for good every single one

1069
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:13,119
This is so indicative of what I talk about with propaganda and true

1070
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
Like this

1071
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,191
Still people believe

1072
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,983
It's utter horseshit

1073
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,007
Still people

1074
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:23,871
The damage is done you can explain away that like editing videos

1075
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,711
These people have all been investigated by

1076
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,991
Legitimate boards

1077
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,039
And cleared of any wrongdoing

1078
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:35,391
Most likely

1079
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,975
F****** sued real heart

1080
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,839
Now we're getting the clips of Alex

1081
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,143
Do you have a couple clips about that

1082
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,167
On this episode on this

1083
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:52,031
And what's really important to remember is all the people in the videos are women

1084
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,127
A lot of respect and dignity

1085
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,663
I'm sure that there will be

1086
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,687
0 comments

1087
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,455
It's on there

1088
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,783
I don't know there are but I'm not sure if I kept any of those in

1089
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,087
Because I actually think there's something even more important

1090
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:05,855
Because on

1091
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:10,975
Clearly using coded language to evoke class

1092
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,911
He does this a lot but it's

1093
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,703
Almost it's almost never this

1094
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,471
Clear

1095
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:26,847
Reserve judgement

1096
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:33,247
And that's the director

1097
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:37,087
One of their major directors

From baby's body parts

1109
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:24,447
They don't get their paychecks from baby's body parts but also did you see how he kept saying

Fat cat

Totally

1115
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,199
Convincing

1116
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,479
They're convincing

1117
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,271
Susceptible young women

1118
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,319
You know that's who we're really afraid of

1119
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,111
Afraid that you're going to

1120

Corrupt

1121
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,927
Women can't have you

You do that next

1123

Thing you know they'll be

Why

1272
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,119
There's such a disconnect

1273
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:21,887
Between

01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,071
Basically see it

1282
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,631
Because it's so alien

1283
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,423
To their nature

1284
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:57,983

I can't conceive of the globalist

1293
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:23,071
I think it's too crazy

1294
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:25,119
It's too far behind me because I am a

1295
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,143

1317
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,055
It's interesting

1318
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,103
It's not at all what he's talking about

1319
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:39,871
It's about

1320
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,407

But so far what it's about

1333
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,591
Is

1334
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,895
And it's about

1335
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,663
How to

1336
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,943
Technology is going to be

1337
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:17,247
Super important in terms of modernization

1338
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,039
And the world

1339
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,087
So he's off to a great

1340
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,647
And a large of the book

1341
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,439
Is talking about how

1342
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,255
Developing countries

1343
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:31,839
Markets

1344
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,655
Are going to have a really difficult time

1345
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,679
I'm keeping up with

1346
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,471
The technology

1347
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:40,031
Because in order to modernize

1348
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,055
General

1349
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:41,823
Stability

1350
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,615
That's mostly

1351
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,663
It's not saying we need to

1352
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:46,687
To keep them on

1353
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,223
Unstable so they won't develop

1354
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,759
Like what Obama said

1355
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:53,087
Expensive mama said

1356
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,367
It's more

1357
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,903
It's more lamenting

1358
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:59,999
The impossibility or the unlikelihood

1359
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:00,767
India

1360
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,303
If you look at it from the 60s

1361
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,351
They didn't look like they had a very good chance

1362
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,887
Of catching up with the rest of

1363
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,167
The world

1364
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,703
Struggling to catch up but they

1365
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,983
They're doing a lot better job of it

1366
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,287
Predicted

1367
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,503
Pretty good dude

1368
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:24,319
Navigate I haven't finished the book it could take a real hard turn

1369
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,367
It's so far

1370
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,903
I'm finding Alex

1371
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,695
Probably doesn't understand what

1372
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,999
I think it would probably

1373
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,023
Like you

1374
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,071
Even mentioned earlier this

1375
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,863
He thinks everyone

1376
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:44,799
Doesn't matter whether it's real

1377
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,591
To him though

1378
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,639
And so he's reading this book and he's like

1379
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,455
Agree the book

1380
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,271
Is the globalist

1381
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,039
Plan

1382
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,575
And I'm the one who

1383
01:04:56,831 --> 01:05:00,671
Can see it through this because everyone else

1384
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:04,767
Of the idea that he's writing about this

1385
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:05,791
This sort of

1386
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:08,607
Other weather-based technology

1387
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,447
He has to say that

1388
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:14,239
You know otherwise

1389
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,519
People would be like

1390
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:21,663
Signaling to his other globalist world

1391
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,943
Way2go

1392
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,991
Right

1393
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,807
We would even get Godzilla for another

1394
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,087
10 years or whatever

1395
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:33,695
Oh that's right it was one of the Raymond Burr

1396
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:38,303
I forgot about that that was the American remake of the

1397
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:43,423
Make it more palatable

1398
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,215
The bad guys

1399
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:45,983
That's

1400
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,007
That's the

1401
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:49,567
I apologize that was a little more extended than I intended

1402
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:53,151
But I am by reading all these texts

1403
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,175
Of like

1404
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,735
Where does he get these ideas from

1405
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,807
And finding out they don't match up with what he is rather

1406
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:01,855
The promise

1407
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:02,879
Service Podcast

1408
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,159
Is your view and I will get

1409
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:04,927
To laugh

1410
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:05,951
At Alex Jones

1411
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,487
In person

1412
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,023
We got

1413
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,815
Zbigniew Brzezinski book

1414
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:20,031
Book clubs or anything like that you just giving us a rundown

1415
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:27,711
Policy walked out there go ahead and look forward to the second half

1416
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:31,039
Zbigniew Brzezinski book report

1417
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:39,231
The next installment of the odds of that are infants

1418
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,071
I will be reporting back

1419
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:46,911
We have got to run

1420
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,215
But for now

1421
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:49,983
It's time

1422
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:52,543
To get to the results of Alex Jones's tool search

1423
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,639
Hits of a heel turn

1424
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:04,063
Prisonplanet.com

1425
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:13,023
Well they just came out and they misrepresented

1426
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:16,351
Donald Trump this weekend

1427
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:23,775
Hannah throughout the week I watched hours of Donald Trump videos on

1428
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,311
Fox News

1429
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,639
I did not

1430
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:35,551
No but I'm actually watching hours

1431
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,599
The interviews where he says kill terrorists

1432
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:41,183
Watch the videos where

1433
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:43,743
They said we should have stolen oil from countries

1434
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,791
War plunder

1435
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,815
We have to watch

1436
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,863
All of the interviews where he says

1437
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:55,263
That Putin is a great guy you know talking about how great

1438
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:58,079
By virtue of the fact that you've watched hours of those

1439
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,615
You have to be aware of those things

1440
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,663
And if you're okay with them

1441
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,431
Then

1442
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,967
You're okay with all that

1443
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,759
And that's not good for you

1444
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,343
The same

1445
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,391
It's the same opportunities I'm that gets a

1446
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,159
To where we are

1447
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,439
It is that

1448
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,231
That's that whole idea of

1449
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:15,999
I will

1450
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:19,327
Deal with well just just pulled off

1451
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:22,143
Hold on cuz we don't know where he's going

1452
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,703
This is that

1453
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,727
This is at Cigna

1454
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,031
Wait

1455
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:29,823
Are you saying he's not

1456
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,151
I don't know where he's going to

1457
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,295
Sincerely don't think it's going to go exactly the way you

1458
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,319
Willits

1459
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,087
Listen listen

1460
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:45,439
Alright

1461
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:57,727
Casinos

1462
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,895
You also said

1463
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,439
He was like

1464
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:22,303
Hold everything with Ryan

1465
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:31,519
Casinos or predators

1466
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:34,847
The basically with a name like Trump you don't get arrested with one like

1467
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:36,383
Genovese eugenics

1468
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,943
Frontman for

1469
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:42,015
Consortium on the East Coast he's not really rich

1470
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,831
Libertarian

1471
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,999
I thought was sick

1472
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,303
And knowing that I was been trumped

1473
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:08,383
Experimentation

1474
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,943
Marijuana

1475
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:15,551
That doesn't mean for marijuana

1476
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:23,487
I've done deep Research into Trump

1477
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:30,399
I think he is a selfie

1478
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:33,727
No

1479
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:38,847
He says bomb the oil

1480
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:44,223
Exclamation

1481
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:45,503
It's a proxy

1482
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,831
Saudi Arabia

1483
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:53,183
Further

1484
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:57,023
I would really support

1485
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:00,863
Call

1486
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:02,911
You should be

1487
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:09,823
Johnson

1488
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,103
We get back to Gary Johnson

1489
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,639
7 second

1490
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,431
Our problem is basically

1491
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,479
Rand Paul isn't big enough

1492
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:17,247
Depress

1493
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:20,575
Isn't crazy enough

1494
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,367
Trumpism

1495
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:28,767
Crazy enough of his position

1496
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,303
Have the whole thing

1497
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:31,327
Remember

1498
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:34,911
Couple weeks ago he was saying I'm Grandpa

1499
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,935
Maybe Ted Cruz

1500
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,959
So

1501
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:40,031
Gary Johnson

1502
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:48,991
I really disagree with his political points trying to get

1503
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:53,855
Trump's catering

1504
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,415
Trump Donald Trump

1505
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,975
Is appealing to voters

1506
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,607
Sing to me

1507
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,055
Animals amongst them

1508
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:18,431
That's what Cuba did

1509
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:22,271
Where is Eastern Europe

1510
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:29,695
Benefit of a doubt

1511
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:36,351
No loss of money and want some TV shows

1512
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:44,543
Old fashioned a patriotic Donald Trump

1513
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,383
The problem is

1514
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:59,391
Donald Trump

1515
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,183
I've warned

1516
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:07,071
But now

1517
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:09,887
Thank you for listening

1518
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:14,239
Visit

1519
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,055
That's so convoluted

1520
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:19,103
Maybe his gut was right

1521
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:20,639
Yeah

1522
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:24,991
In the wild

1523
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:28,831
But you can't play it now

1524
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:31,903
If you'd listened to our so he could do it the whole time

1525
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,207
He can play that you can be like

1526
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,255
I got I got betrayed

1527
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:42,143
I got seduced by karisma following through on those ideas

1528
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,679
I told you guys at the

1529
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,447
The beginning

1530
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:46,751
My gut told me that he was going to betray us

1531
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:52,639
Because he's a secret Democrat

1532
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,455
Is too far

1533
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:56,479
To do that

1534
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,247
Asteroid

1535
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,015
What was it

1536
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:00,831
The middle of January early February when you said I would

1537
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,855
Die for Trump

1538
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,879
Yeah that one

1539
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:05,951
I think he's gone too far he can't play that card

1540
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,511
That statement

1541
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:09,535
Bucked up

1542
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:12,351
Really like I listen to all these videos with

1543
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,887
It should have been

1544
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:14,911
This guy's nuts

1545
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,191
Instead he's like

1546
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,983
Oh he's crazy but I like

1547
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,263
Alright

1548
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,031
Look

1549
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,311
I know he's mobbed-up

1550
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:23,359
I know all this batshit about him

1551
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,175
Stop

1552
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:36,671
But I'm going to give him the benefit of

1553
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:37,951
Of the doubt

1554
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:38,719
But verify

1555
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,023
That's not a good idea

1556
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,559
You should

1557
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,327
If you

1558
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,143
Don't give

1559
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,423
It look if you don't

1560
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:53,311
Trust don't give him the benefit of the doubt

1561
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,591
Right

1562
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,639
I don't trust you in that car

1563
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,663
You seem creepy

1564
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:59,455
But you did offer me a ride

1565
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:06,111
My gut tells me you're going to murder me but I'm thinking it's not necessarily in this case

1566
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:13,023
So Alex now is it this point

1567
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,047
Where

1568
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:17,887
Keith said a whole bunch of stuff about Trump up to this point

1569
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:19,935
Now you make this Proclamation

1570
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:22,239
Annie stops talking about

1571
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,031
I think I

1572
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,055
I think that was

1573
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,615
The beginning it's the first debate whenever

1574
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:30,175
Those guys start dropping out

1575
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:32,735
Opposed

1576
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,575
The middle just sitting there

1577
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:37,855
You're a prick

1578
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,879
I hate you

1579
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:42,207
Super male vitality

1580
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:43,999
Cuz we're going to get back to it

1581
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:50,399
Deliver my heart

1582
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:53,727
Is there any other way

1583
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,007
Superman

1584
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:59,615
Is this episode of going to be going over up until July twenty

1585
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,895
First I believe it's where

1586
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:03,455
We cut off he doesn't really talk about Trump much at all

1587
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:04,735
What is

1588
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,527
We're going to get into it

1589
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,551
It seems like

1590
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,831
Especially at that time

1591
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,599
Whenever Trump

1592
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:12,927
I threw and everybody was shocked

1593
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:20,095
Interview with Jerome corsi at one point which is really boring

1594
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:22,911
Jerome corsi says maybe he's real this time

1595
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:25,727
So there's that they talk about that

1596
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,263
It doesn't matter

1597
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:32,383
Around the 19th or 20th somewhere in there

1598
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:34,687
I was when Trump made the

1599
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,967
Yeah claims about

1600
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:40,319
Do you like I like to Heroes who don't catch

1601
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:43,391
Alex is responsive that is enough

1602
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,695
Because Alex believe

1603
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,999
That

1604
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:50,815
John McCain was a trustee at the Handlery Hilton

1605
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:52,607
He makes the claim

1606
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:54,655
That John McCain was never tortured

1607
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:56,703
And in fact was given pleasure women

1608
01:16:59,007 --> 01:16:59,519
What

1609
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,287
Yeah

1610
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:04,639
He said it's mainstream news

1611
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:07,199
She saying

1612
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:12,319
Can't raise his arms above his head is he got f***** too hard

1613
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,415
F***** so hard

1614
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:18,975
He's paralyzed more light

1615
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,279
Try and look into that

1616
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,047
I can't find

1617
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,071
Any verification

1618
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,351
I did find

1619
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,655
An article on WorldNetDaily

1620
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:29,471
But didn't notice or saying no like references at all

1621
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:32,287
Ice I found one article that I don't know if I can

1622
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,311
Entrust or not

1623
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:36,127
Purported to be from somebody who was

1624
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,663
Captured along the same

1625
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,199
Time is it

1626
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:40,991
It doesn't

1627
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,527
Tortured

1628
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,551
Sayings

1629
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,855
Exaggerated

1630
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:47,135
Story

1631
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:50,719
There were a lot of people who were there and

1632
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,023
His experiences no

1633
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:59,167
More severe than any one of the other even John McCain would own up to that

1634
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:01,983
Where are the f******

1635
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,543
Yeah

1636
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:08,383
Amazon Trump

1637
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:10,431
Now this is fun

1638
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:13,503
Is immediately

1639
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,295
He has an interview with Jesse Ventura

1640
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,831
Ventura comes back

1641
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:22,463
Doesn't this clip

1642
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,999
Jesse Ventura

1643
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:27,327
Some f****** hard truth about Trump is nice

1644
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,095
And Alex

1645
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:29,631
Can't really handle

1646
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,167
Oh boy

1647
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,703
To give you the indication that

1648
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:38,847
Turn Trump into his we started to feel the need to defend but he can

1649
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,151
Jesse Ventura

1650
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,431
Ventura

1651
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,199
Makes sense

1652
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:47,039
On where you stand

1653
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:53,439
First of all you know if Mexicans come up here the illegals and get on our welfare

1654
01:18:56,255 --> 01:19:00,863
Blame the people who created the system that allows that to happen

1655
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:08,031
Which is your Democrats and Republicans

1656
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:15,711
Instead of blaming the poor person

1657
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,991
Second of all

1658
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:21,855
I'm off the grid down there I was 900 miles in Mexico

1659
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:28,255
And whenever somebody with the statute of Donald Trump takes us statements like he has

1660
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:33,119
Believe me we as Americans down there feel the repercussions of that

1661
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:36,959
All of a sudden Mexican people scare adults

1662
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:44,895
Student council start happening maybe the federales pull you over more

1663
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,431
Whatever it might be

1664
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:48,735
But it does nobody any good

1665
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:53,343
Because Donald Trump is saying does nothing but anger

1666
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,623
Mexican people

1667
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:57,951
Because you can't paint them in a broad brush

1668
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:02,815
Circle L criminals in Mexico just like there are criminals here

1669
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:09,215
We are

1670
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:15,616
We have the most criminals will Jessie

1671
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:19,200
That's not the point.

1672
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:23,296
Definitely I'll expand it all Wrestle with

1673
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,832
What appointment

1674
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:28,160
Completely f******

1675
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:28,928
That was

1676
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:34,048
No he said don't blame the immigrants

1677
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:37,888
Don't blame for trying to not be poor

1678
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:41,984
Fighting for their lives more or less

1679
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:44,544
So

1680
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,152
His response

1681
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:52,480
Here's my

1682
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:53,248
Questions

1683
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,296
How are

1684
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,576
How are we coming down on

1685
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,136
Because is Alex

1686
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,440
Understand

1687
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,976
And then deliberately Miss

1688
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:03,744
Sleeting

1689
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:08,352
Absolutely incapable of listening to another human being talk

1690
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,168
Prior

1691
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:14,240
You think so

1692
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,008
And then he just

1693
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,288
Can't allow that

1694
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:23,456
It's like there is like they have criminal there just like we have criminals here

1695
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:28,064
We incarcerate the most people in the world so therefore we have the most criminals

1696
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,856
Would you can argue with if you're out

1697
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:30,880
So he has

1698
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:31,904
To change the argument

1699
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,464
It's a classic debate

1700
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:36,256
I mean it's

1701
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,536
Minorly gaslighting

1702
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:38,816
Somebody

1703
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:43,936
Manipulative

1704
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:48,032
Agree with somebody on something they didn't say

1705
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,056
I really

1706
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,080
I hate

1707
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,128
But Jesse doesn't call him out on it

1708
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,968
Alex that he could

1709
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:56,992
He doesn't

1710
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:58,272
But he makes another great

1711
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:05,952
Diamond congress's around criticizing the TSA when they showed up and control it

1712
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:11,328
Assault weapons ban

1713
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,656
And he said

1714
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:19,264
They're not illegal

1715
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:34,624
We both do the meteors in the entertainment business

1716
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:39,232
The more entertainment copy

1717
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:46,912
Completely irrelevant

1718
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:56,384
Have I personally

1719
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:02,784
People know that I know Donald and they'll ask me and I just say look I don't answer for Donald but I think what

1720
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,344
Preposterous and stupid

1721
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:11,744
40 States

1722
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:17,120
You know to have a president that would say things like that about people of another country

1723
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:18,912
You know that's not very

1724
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,960
Call Mercy if I pictures

1725
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:28,640
Overall the problem is you

1726
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:33,504
Do you Alex

1727
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,320
I'd like

1728
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:39,904
Jessie just made some great points and also another thing that's really interesting

1729
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:46,304
Point out they don't get into is that Alex is also in the entertainment business

1730
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,120
Sign directly above Alex Jones

1731
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,960
This is about you

1732
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:57,056
Getting out of the first thing that Jesse says

1733
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:57,824
Vistaprint

1734
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:08,064
You're not experiencing the Mexico that Donald is talk

1735
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,600
Talking about right now

1736
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:12,160
Most collapse trust you

1737
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,184
Listen

1738
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,720
You're wrong on

1739
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,768
But I'm not going to say it like you're wrong

1740
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:19,840
That's almost like

1741
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:22,400
Because you don't have that

1742
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,680
Personal experience

1743
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:27,008
You perhaps don't understand the entirety of their

1744
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,288
What Jessie

1745
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:30,336
We can't conceive of the evil of global

1746
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,104
Apparently

1747
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,408
Even though he's been the governor of a state

1748
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,736
Maybe

1749
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:38,016
Kicked out by the

1750
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:41,856
There is why we still like Jesse Ventura

1751
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:42,880
Like

1752
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:43,904
Problem

1753
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,440
Jesse's not always right

1754
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:49,792
You clearly was walking around with misleading people

1755
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,864
You can't come with stuff like that

1756
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:02,080
I don't think I've ever heard somebody make that

1757
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:04,384
Very simple logical

1758
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,152
They're witches

1759
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:07,456
We imprison the most people so

1760
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,736
We have the most criminals

1761
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,784
Yeah that's that's your

1762
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,320
If you're worried about criminals

1763
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:14,624
You don't want Americans coming

1764
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:21,024
Which is always true

1765
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:30,496
We have people in prison for

1766
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:31,264
Bulshit

1767
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:34,336
Definition of what a criminal is

1768
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,104
Kind of stupid

1769
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,296
Once it's at that

1770
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,064
The brand

1771
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,088
It's not

1772
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:45,856
It's not you

1773
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:46,880
Committed a crime

1774
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:47,904
It's that you're a criminal

1775
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,440
And you're always

1776
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:51,744
Well

1777
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,024
Even if you're

1778
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,048
Even if your Escape

1779
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:57,120
Keeping your life criminal because I don't know

1780
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:57,888
One of the

1781
01:25:58,144 --> 01:25:58,656
Can cartels

1782
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:01,472
Juju and the only way to get out of there was by running

1783
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,496
Sing away otherwise they were going to

1784
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:04,544
Murder

1785
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,848
So you're always you're never entitled

1786
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:07,872
To do your best

1787
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:11,712
Not be a criminal 10 exactly

1788
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:13,504
So this next breath is really

1789
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,088
People are

1790
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:18,112
Ladies

1791
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:20,160
Insurers and hospitals are

1792
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,184
Refuse

1793
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:21,952
Treat veterans

1794
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,000
But they'll treat illegal

1795
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,072
He has a weird f******

1796
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,096
Can Siri about it

1797
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,632
That even in

1798
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:30,912
Eternally doesn't make

1799
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,472
Like even the words he's saying

1800
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:34,240
If you

1801
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:36,544
Grant that the beginning of it is true

1802
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,312
The middle

1803
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:50,368
Why is it free

1804
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:55,744
Because the Vets are already here and they're done with you

1805
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:59,072
New people because we are boarded

1806
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:03,168
50 + million of our kid

1807
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:08,544
What is social security

1808
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,080
That's true

1809
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:19,040
Lyrics of fact

1810
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:19,808
Is that

1811
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:20,576
We're

1812
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:22,880
Paying for

1813
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:26,208
Illegal immigrants babies to be born in the United States

1814
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:26,976
Because we've

1815
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:33,376
Many of our own right

1816
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:39,008
Prop up a illegal immigrant

1817
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:45,408
We've also already rated Social Security it's so convoluted

1818
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:47,712
I don't even know

1819
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:49,248
Where to like polka

1820
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,856
I know I got a few

1821
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:56,160
Veterans are not

1822
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,440
That's a big problem

1823
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,720
Certainly why are you

1824
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:00,256
Not focus on that

1825
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:03,584
Why is your what is your anger why is your ankle

1826
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,120
Like I just like food

1827
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:06,656
Sure thing it's like

1828
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,216
We have the most criminals so let's

1829
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:11,264
Boing-boing the system

1830
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,104
People don't blame the illegal immigrant

1831
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,640
Has to have her baby

1832
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:18,432
Because you can't afford it anywhere else

1833
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,456
Blame the system

1834
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,016
Keeping the veterans from getting

1835
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:24,064
Coverage for being

1836
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,344
Might be a good plan

1837
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:29,696
Why would you do that I want to take a moment to give Alex some credit because

1838
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:30,464
Even though he

1839
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,792
He does do it in Dumb ways that rely on globalist

1840
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:37,632
Speak a lot about how veterans are treated well

1841
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:39,424
And he has a he has a good point there

1842
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,960
Mount apps

1843
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:42,496
Solutely

1844
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,264
Diaz

1845
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,800
Some sort of elaborate

1846
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:46,336
Buy evil

1847
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:47,104
Is

1848
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:47,872
Stupid

1849
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:49,152
It is just

1850
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:51,968
What is it

1851
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:52,992
Veterans

1852
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:54,784
Nobody wants

1853
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,552
To pay for

1854
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:56,320
For veterans

1855
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:57,856
Right right

1856
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:00,416
Healthcare nobody wants to

1857
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,208
Right

1858
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:06,816
The budgeting is so much on the front end as opposed to the back end

1859
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:10,144
Pay for the war but we won't pay to take care of

1860
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:13,216
Globalist plot that's just

1861
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:14,240
People in Congress being

1862
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,800
Every

1863
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:18,336
That's the way every

1864
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,360
Military is all

1865
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,480
Now we want you to

1866
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:25,248
To fight we don't give a

1867
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,016
The fuk wants your

1868
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:29,856
Jordan I told you earlier that I was going to end with a curveball

1869
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:30,880
Is it going to end with

1870
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,672
Started

1871
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:33,952
The day before this

1872
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:37,024
Statements to make a bit of Jade helm

1873
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:42,144
Heathrow

1874
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:45,472
An Infiniti

1875
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:56,480
You are going to

1876
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:58,784
Elmo's not martial law

1877
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,808
Nothing happened

1878
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:03,904
Never said it was going to do that

1879
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:08,000
And I will just sit there and assault

1880
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:19,776
I can't do that cuz I'm not going back through more episodes I'm listening

1881
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:22,592
We may do that investigation sometime down the line

1882
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:25,152
Me to pinpoint when he started talking

1883
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:25,920
Sing about Jade helm

1884
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:27,456
Very very difficult

1885
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:29,504
Get the timeline on for what I can do

1886
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:30,528
Is tell you

1887
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,320
Episode

1888
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:33,600
He get the caller

1889
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:34,880
From Alabama

1890
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:39,232
We were already off to a great start

1891
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:40,000
Heat

1892
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:43,072
Random Scholars from Alabama

1893
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,096
I'm sure there's a lot of info

1894
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:47,936
Elvis very show his

1895
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:54,080
People are going to lie and say that Jade Helm I say that Jade Helm is somehow real

1896
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:56,896
And they're and they're doing that on purpose

1897
01:30:57,152 --> 01:31:00,224
To believe that

1898
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:00,992
Martial law

1899
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,528
And then whenever it's not

1900
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:03,296
This time

1901
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:04,576
They can turn me into

1902
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:06,624
To The Boy Who Cried Wolf

1903
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:08,672
That you'll be even more of a sheep

1904
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:09,440
The next

1905
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:13,024
That means you'll be ready primed whenever they're going to

1906
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:15,328
Important things

1907
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:18,656
Keep in mind for those of you who didn't keep up with Jade Helm conspiracy

1908
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:22,240
One of the big things that the internet was going wild

1909
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:27,104
Is claiming that there were a bunch of Walmarts that have been closed down and there were secrets

1910
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,640
Military

1911
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:30,432
And UN forces to go on

1912
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:37,088
Use them as like Depot points because their giant building and their inconspicuous

1913
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:40,416
Close so all of these Walmart to close down

1914
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,000
That was a big part of that stuff

1915
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:46,816
I was just one of those things that if you're a conspiracy theorist

1916
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:47,840
Seems like a

1917
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:48,608
Great plan

1918
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:50,144
You're like

1919
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:50,912
Genius

1920
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:52,704
I know how genius that is

1921
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,240
But then if you're actually

1922
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:55,776
Trying to do it legit

1923
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:56,544
Sickly you're like

1924
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,104
We have roads

1925
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,920
I just wrote I can only come out of

1926
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:03,712
In or out of the tunnels at Walmart

1927
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:08,064
At what why would we do that another reason that I bring that up as Walmart will play

1928
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:12,928
Call her

1929
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:17,024
Sinister Pointe

1930
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:22,656
Alabama

1931
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:25,728
Yeah that's what's happening in Alabama

1932
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:32,128
And it's just been

1933
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,456
I couldn't

1934
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:43,648
Working on and I saw a black

1935
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:47,488
And then I saw

1936
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,960
Open until

1937
01:32:57,216 --> 01:33:03,360
The truth on this one couldn't get a video of that car on the road

1938
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:04,384
Gas station

1939
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,408
Simple enough Alex

1940
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:06,176
You want to just

1941
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:08,992
Put up your stationary would be no problem

1942
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:09,760
Insecurities

1943
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:10,784
Blue uniforms

1944
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,576
Is the beginning of any lie

1945
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:13,600
Right

1946
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:15,392
If there's a color involved

1947
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:16,928
He's making it

1948
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:27,424
There were two older guys

1949
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,728
We are just over run

1950
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:33,824
Deshawn Walmart

1951
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:42,528
Home business

1952
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,672
I was raised on patriotic beliefs

1953
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:52,512
The Constitution with all the men in my family were in the military

1954
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:54,816
I'm in Walmart near the night down here

1955
01:33:55,072 --> 01:34:00,704
It was real close to 1 in the morning if it wasn't one morning

1956
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:06,592
I'm walking through these two guys in black suits

1957
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,128
Walmart

1958
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,408
Now hold on

1959
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:10,688
Two guys in black suits

1960
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,968
Talking to a manager

1961
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,504
Clearly something the ferry

1962
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:19,136
I'm thinking it's the man in Black

1963
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:25,024
Black suits Comin

1964
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:27,584
That's the theme for Men in Black 2

1965
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:34,240
And I want Parent Trap whatever like I try to take a picture

1966
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:35,776
You in

1967
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:37,312
Badges on their lapel

1968
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:43,456
Go to believe the same thing on their flag was on their lapels they had ID badges to Fort Rucker

1969
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,992
You in personnel

1970
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:50,624
Here in America man's they don't they don't want anybody to know as soon as I try to take a picture of the guy

1971
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,952
I was trying to the ground by what I'm assuming it's his bodyguard

1972
01:34:54,464 --> 01:35:00,608
Arrested by the city police in my phone was taking a still haven't believed you

1973
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:05,216
I want you

1974
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:08,288
I want you to scan whatever email

1975
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:14,944
And we will send reporters

1976
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,888
Russian troops training

1977
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:35,424
Secret bases

1978
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:38,496
Colorado Springs

1979
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:48,480
It's

1980
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:50,016
Freedom From War

1981
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:52,320
So I looked at up I read

1982
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:57,696
Here's the bigger question how does he know the secret

1983
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:02,816
Which

1984
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:05,888
Secret

1985
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:12,288
That's what I pursue I don't know it's

1986
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:18,176
Why throw that little bit the secret treaties which are breaking up

1987
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:22,784
You already made up enough lies Alex

1988
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,576
Show me the further compounded

1989
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:26,880
Take a break

1990
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:29,184
So I I looked up

1991
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,232
The the memorandum

1992
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,000
But he was talkin to

1993
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:33,280
About the Freedom From War

1994
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:36,864
State Department memorandum 7777

1995
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:41,984
September of 19

1996
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,008
61

1997
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,104
And it is a freedom from war the United States program for General in

1998
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,128
Complete disarmament

1999
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:49,664
Peaceful world

2000
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:52,224
So it's mostly in

2001
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:52,992
Concern

2002
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:54,784
About the rapid

2003
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:55,552
Growth

2004
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,856
Post nuclear

2005
01:36:59,136 --> 01:36:59,648
And

2006
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,928
The insanely rapid

2007
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:07,072
Behind this memorandum memorandum

2008
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:09,888
Not a not a law

2009
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:13,984
21 7727

2010
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,008
Mamo

2011
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:17,824
It's a little note for note

2012
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,872
It's not - 1777

2013
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:22,432
So this is basically

2014
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,992
Aspiring towards disarm

2015
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,064
If you crazy it looks bad

2016
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:32,160
Because it does talk about how the end goal is getting rid of army

2017
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,184
In every country

2018
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:38,304
I think it is I think it is

2019
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,864
Type 1 civilization

2020
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:46,752
Would that be better for everybody primary piece of it is nuclear

2021
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:48,544
A song about these

2022
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:49,824
Technologies that are

2023
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:51,360
Wheatley capable

2024
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,640
Destroying the entire world

2025
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:55,968
Setting us off on a trajectory that we don't even know what it would lead to

2026
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:57,760
That's the first step of it

2027
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,856
Eventually gradual disarmament

2028
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:02,880
Arby's

2029
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:04,416
And creating

2030
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:05,696
Peacekeeping organization

2031
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:07,232
That

2032
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:08,768
And I will be involved with

2033
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:11,072
Mitigating crazy is

2034
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:14,400
Conflicts between states could be hashed out as opposed to war

2035
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,192
What is idealistic is

2036
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:19,776
But the one thing that's really important about it is

2037
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:24,640
It doesn't talk about UN forces hanging out Russian secret training or anything like that

2038
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:26,944
And further

2039
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,224
Secret memo

2040
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,016
2872

2041
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,040
77

2042
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:33,088
The first part of it is not achieved

2043
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:37,184
You know what I'm saying

2044
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:40,000
So like

2045
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:42,816
Pieces of it haven't been to

2046
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:43,840
Successfully implemented

2047
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:50,240
It's like his fear that cloward and Piven plan but brings up over and over again

2048
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:56,896
You can someone wrote about some Professor wrote that if we overwhelmed some people would have to take it more

2049
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:57,664
Seriously

2050
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,432
It's it's

2051
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:01,248
Yep it's like

2052
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:03,296
It's like you said

2053
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,088
Aldous Huxley

2054
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:07,136
He's the one who knew

2055
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:09,952
I think it would save

2056
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:12,000
I think you would say that to ya

2057
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:15,840
The point is all it's all speculative

2058
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:18,400
Do that

2059
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,168
Discern

2060
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,192
What is

2061
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:21,216
Like

2062
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:24,544
Do you ever stop and think like

2063
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,336
Creative

2064
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:28,128
All of the weapons necessary

2065
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:28,896
You kill all of us

2066
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:34,784
And we just have them lying around and we have for a long time

2067
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:35,808
They're still

2068
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,600
They're still nuclear weapons

2069
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,392
Songs that use floppy disk

2070
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:41,440
We're just fine

2071
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:46,048
No problem

2072
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:47,840
Absolutely

2073
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:50,400
How is traffic

2074
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:53,728
Would be on board with just a big just like

2075
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:54,752
Hey maybe

2076
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:56,544
Let's try and get two

2077
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:58,592
Where we are not

2078
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:01,152
Age of

2079
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:02,176
Global

2080
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:09,856
I need to study this memorandum a little closer in order to have like an assessment on it but just from my my

2081
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:12,160
I read of it my my once through Reading

2082
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:16,768
I would say it is a great goal but it is way too idealistic to work

2083
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:17,792
Then reality

2084
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:20,096
But yeah or in the near

2085
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:23,168
Taking the memorandum out of it

2086
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:26,496
Why would you want to stop

2087
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:29,824
What vested interest money

2088
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,616
Do people have in war continued

2089
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:33,408
Population

2090
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:36,992
Dominance

2091
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:40,576
Call cheers versus bad cold

2092
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:45,184
Pictures Dan nationalism for any other reason

2093
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,976
Then to make their culture

2094
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:48,512
Better nationalism

2095
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:49,280
Prosperity

2096
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:53,120
Yeah that's what it's about Second Amendment

2097
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:55,424
Manhole

2098
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:59,008
Jerome corsi

2099
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,592
Also also whenever he was like

2100
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:03,616
Take

2101
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:06,688
Tips can the paperwork I was like oh we're not going to

2102
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:08,992
From this fella again I'm going to

2103
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:13,344
As of July 22nd

2104
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,368
This is not come

2105
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,928
And I guarantee it.

2106
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:21,280
But he does come back after the Jerome corsi interview

2107
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:22,816
It gets real

2108
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:35,104
Walmart

2109
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:48,160
And I

2110
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:59,424
It's incredible what else can you tell us about this what are the police squad car

2111
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:09,152
I don't know about how censorship is on your show so I'm pretty sure I can't call them for bait on butt

2112
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:15,552
They told me that I asked up by wanting to get picture happy with my iPhone and you know I told him I

2113
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:20,672
I mean I could be wrong

2114
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:23,488
Freedom of speech freedom of press

2115
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:29,376
My phone is probably no more but

2116
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:33,472
Your iPhone

2117
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:40,640
When I left the city jail they told me that I could pick my iPhone up when I pick my paperwork up

2118
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:50,624
I know the ins-and-outs of

2119
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:57,024
Supposed to get paperwork as soon as you get kicked loose whether it's do you have to pay to get out or you get a recognizance bond to property

2120
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,048
What have you

2121
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:01,120
And they give you your property back

2122
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:06,752
IPhone

2123
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:10,080
At the Walmart

2124
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:12,384
And if they won't cover it will come up there

2125
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,904
This is incredible

2126
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,720
Describe

2127
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:30,560
What do uniforms look like

2128
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:34,656
Okay that I saw in the Walmart

2129
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:39,008
The gentleman that I'm presuming or bodyguards because they're the ones that pulled

2130
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:45,408
I'm what I'm assuming a Glock 17 to that standard-issue sidearm

2131
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:51,808
Yes he has paid through down on me in Walmart while

2132
01:43:57,952 --> 01:44:04,096
Alarm in plain clothes and I'm assuming that they were protecting the two men in the suits with the badges on there

2133
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:10,496
Any harm you know who I mean

2134
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:16,384
Incorrect

2135
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:20,224
No resistance at all because I'm

2136
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,760
What else

2137
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:28,160
They detained me and help me on the groundwater Melanie and my back both my hands behind my back

2138
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:31,744
Let It Go on and in the city police arrived and they carted me off

2139
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:32,512
Jail

2140
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:36,608
And you know later on what they say where they were

2141
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,632
Espanol

2142
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:43,776
Walmart

2143
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:53,504
Robin

2144
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:57,600
This is not the behavior of someone who doesn't believe in is real

2145
01:44:58,112 --> 01:45:02,208
This is the behavior of someone who's looking for a way to believe it's real

2146
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:06,048
But knowing without concrete evidence going to be made fun of

2147
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:10,400
So he gets this hillbilly collar on the air

2148
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:13,472
Just beautifully like what I would say

2149
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:16,544
Something is missing

2150
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,824
Because the number of

2151
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:19,360
Keep going up

2152
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:20,896
Just changed a little bit

2153
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:25,760
Two guys in black suits

2154
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:28,064
Became he had bodyguards

2155
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:31,904
Then they pulled birthday cookies phone

2156
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,696
Then they pulled guns on us

2157
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:34,976
Episode it's Nancy

2158
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:37,280
I believe

2159
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:40,608
The fact that he just casually references Glock 17

2160
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:41,888
This is like no I don't

2161
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:46,752
I don't like that at all

2162
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:49,824
King something up out of whole cloth but there's some element

2163
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:50,592
The story

2164
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,872
He was high

2165
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:56,480
Well police also tell him that he couldn't bring that brown bag inside the wall

2166
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:57,504
Why the f***

2167
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:00,064
Would you be at a Walmart at 1 in the morning if you're not high

2168
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:03,648
I also I don't know any reason to go to Walmart

2169
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:07,488
Ran out of smokes

2170
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:13,376
Alabama

2171
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:16,704
Broad brush

2172
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:23,104
It's time for me to slide right into the South or Midwest

2173
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:27,968
For the 16th

2174
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:29,248
Of the shower

2175
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:34,368
Alex is on claim that he's not buying into Jade helm by buying it

2176
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:35,904
Caller

2177
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:38,976
He has been schooled by Jesse Ventura

2178
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:41,792
But he's also teased his heel turn about Trump

2179
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:45,376
It's very clear that it's only a matter of time now after July 6th

2180
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:48,192
Right until he inevitably does get in

2181
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:49,472
And is it just

2182
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:50,240
The bigotry

2183
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:56,128
Is the fact

2184
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:56,896
That

2185
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:57,920
Trump says

2186
01:46:58,176 --> 01:46:58,944
We should hate them

2187
01:46:59,200 --> 01:46:59,712
Yeah

2188
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:00,992
That's basically all he

2189
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,016
Pretty much

2190
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,064
I was going

2191
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,088
Cut it off at the sea

2192
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:06,368
16th for this episode

2193
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:07,392
Right but we

2194
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:08,416
Have to talk about

2195
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:09,952
Okay what happened

2196
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:12,000
Turn on the 17th 17th

2197
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:13,024
Is

2198
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:17,376
One of my favorite Alex Jones episodes I've ever listened to

2199
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:18,144
And I will

2200
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:24,544
I'm just going to play the beginning of the show and you'll see why

2201
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:30,944
Broadcast

2202
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:33,504
Exactly

2203
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,040
12 seconds from now

2204
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:41,696
Ready

2205
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:48,096
Because we are going

2206
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:49,888
6 oz of information

2207
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:53,984
May actually shake a large portion of the population

2208
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:56,032
Out of there

2209
01:47:57,312 --> 01:48:00,128
Is that what Jumping the Shark is I guess so

2210
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:02,688
What a Jumping the Shark what does he think it means

2211
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:06,528
Can use a little bald

2212
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,880
Unfortunately

2213
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:13,184
He has literally jumped the shark

2214
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:16,512
This episode is

2215
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:17,280
Embarrassing

2216
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:21,888
So I don't want to spoil for you what

2217
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,168
The actual

2218
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:25,472
Jumping over the shark

2219
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:27,264
I don't understand again

2220
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,568
What it is we're talking about but I'm excited to find out

2221
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:33,152
I don't know if it's going to work better if I just spell it out of town

2222
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:39,296
No I want to hear it I want to hear it split up the actual shark jump

2223
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:44,672
Preparation

2224
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:47,232
The Binding of

2225
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:51,840
Motorcycle

2226
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:53,888
That's right it is

2227
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:54,912
Yeah it is water

2228
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:03,360
Yeah but you also jump something on a motorcycle at some point

2229
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:13,344
Is held up by

2230
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:15,648
Sweet bulshit live

2231
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:19,488
One of those

2232
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:21,536
Waypoint story-telling

2233
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:24,352
We haven't really dealt with a lot of the

2234
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:27,168
2015 10th post through the waypoints

2235
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:29,984
So we get to take care of like all of them

2236
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:31,776
In one Fell Swoop

2237
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:33,824
During this jumping of the shark

2238
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,104
It's amazing

2239
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,152
Okay so here we go

2240
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:38,176
Put the first clip

2241
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:40,992
7 Minutes in a couple seconds after the last one

2242
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:48,160
Agreed

2243
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:50,464
Plus percent of the time

2244
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:54,560
Against

2245
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:55,328
Perfect

2246
01:49:55,840 --> 01:50:01,472
Stop all things.

2247
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:07,872
Some strong medicine

2248
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:09,920
T'force The Logical point

2249
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:12,224
24 Cinema

2250
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:15,040
Control

2251
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:22,208
And then the American public at a logical discussion

2252
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:27,584
This is a big announce

2253
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:32,704
How is that an announcement they done satirically

2254
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:34,240
It's done

2255
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:37,312
Etta level of logical discussion

2256
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:51,136
Depression is a kanban

2257
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:54,208
So that's the first Waypoint is it there outlawing Brown

2258
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:57,280
Seattle there not this is based on a memo

2259
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:59,328
That's a Seattle

2260
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:03,936
Elliot braunstein the chief spokesman for the Seattle office of civil rights

2261
01:51:04,192 --> 01:51:05,728
The city's public information officer

2262
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:06,752
To avoid

2263
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:07,520
Sprays

2264
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:10,336
Brown

2265
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:11,360
Or lunch and learn

2266
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:13,408
According to a memo

2267
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:16,480
Being widely misreported is an order or a van

2268
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:18,784
Now the reason that you did this

2269
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:19,552
Was

2270
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:20,832
Okay

2271
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:22,880
Issaquah

2272
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:23,648
No

2273
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:30,048
This issue came up in one of the Department's and I thought FYI for your consideration

2274
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:34,656
We often use the Expression brown bag to designate a bring your own lunch time of it

2275
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:37,216
We also use the word citizens as

2276
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:41,056
Innocuous phrases right it went on

2277
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:42,592
Not so much

2278
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:45,408
For some people

2279
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:47,968
The phrase Brown Bag calls up ugly Association

2280
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:50,016
The use of the expression brown bag

2281
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,320
People's skin color was light enough

2282
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:53,856
Have to allow admission to an event

2283
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:54,624
Or home

2284
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:56,416
Citizens is a different case

2285
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:59,232
We sometimes use it as another way of saying members of the public

2286
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:02,304
Except for all the members of the public who are actually citizen

2287
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:03,328
Come to live and work here

2288
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:05,120
It's basically

2289
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:06,656
A f****** the chief spokes

2290
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:08,192
Looking for the office of civil rights

2291
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:09,472
Issued a memo to

2292
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:10,496
City employees

2293
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:12,544
Then ask them to be more sensitive

2294
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:16,128
Because there is a history of what I've looked into it the right

2295
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:22,528
That's not made up the idea of passing anything that any reference

2296
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:24,064
To racism in America

2297
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,112
History even if I have no

2298
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:26,880
Text Shelby

2299
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:27,904
Yeah that's probably too

2300
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:28,928
I think

2301
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:31,232
That this is probably

2302
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:32,768
Stretching a little bit

2303
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:33,792
In terms of

2304
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:38,912
Big descriptors of this bag is brown

2305
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:39,936
He's just saying

2306
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:42,496
You know like

2307
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:44,032
Specifically

2308
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:46,592
With your words

2309
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:48,384
A lot of the times just

2310
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,152
Be more specific

2311
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:55,296
Is no more difficult to say it's a no less descriptive so

2312
01:52:56,576 --> 01:52:58,880
Ban it was him being like

2313
01:52:59,136 --> 01:52:59,904
Skip but it just

2314
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:01,440
The shark jaw

2315
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:02,720
Has been described

2316
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:03,488
Also

2317
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:06,560
The plan that he has

2318
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:12,192
Right is so mind-bogglingly stupid even know what exactly it is

2319
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:15,776
Plan is going to say what is what is outline

2320
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:19,616
His his idea of how this is going to work

2321
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:21,664
Is he's going to say something

2322
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,456
Intentionally

2323
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:28,320
So that the media will report on it

2324
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:29,856
But even

2325
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:32,672
Even though even though it's intentionally f*****-up

2326
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:34,464
They're going to take him out of contact

2327
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:35,232
Text

2328
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,024
Which boggles the mind

2329
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:40,864
Even further well here's what he's trying to do that will force

2330
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:41,888
Everyone

2331
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:44,704
Let's have a conversation

2332
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:47,008
About how stupid the f*****-up thing he's

2333
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:51,872
Trying to play The Mark Dice Game

2334
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:56,480
AutoPro level only work

2335
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:57,760
Because it's a closed loop

2336
01:53:58,272 --> 01:54:00,832
You don't have any Rogue actors in there like the actual me

2337
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:06,976
He's not going to play along with this the way you play along with Mark dice's reporting

2338
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:09,280
And create your circle of propaganda

2339
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:11,584
They are going to take it on its face

2340
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,352
They're going

2341
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:14,400
To deal with what you say every like

2342
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:16,192
Holyshit

2343
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:22,080
We'll get to it and even then they could just go back and listen to the first part where he said

2344
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:24,640
This is what we're going to do

2345
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:26,176
The app that is a problem

2346
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:27,968
People don't

2347
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:29,248
Tell people you're tricking

2348
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,272
Yeah

2349
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,856
Alex is dumb though

2350
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:36,672
So f****** hilarious

2351
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:37,440
Jerome corsi

2352
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:40,768
Please plan

2353
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:41,792
Okay

2354
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:42,816
This time

2355
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:46,144
We're actually going to do propaganda

2356
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:47,424
Corsi buddy

2357
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,448
Baby

2358
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:50,240
You're way past that

2359
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:55,360
Dude now

2360
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:56,640
Not a propaganda

2361
01:54:58,176 --> 01:55:00,480
He goes on

2362
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:04,064
Segmented I took a break pretty much whenever he got to one of his life

2363
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:08,160
Seattle complete misrepresentation

2364
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:09,952
As we've come to expect

2365
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,232
Here's the next one

2366
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:19,936
Girl

2367
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:23,520
As a boy or girl

2368
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:29,920
Someone else

2369
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:33,504
So is this another one of his big Waypoint

2370
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:37,344
Pictures of for one second

2371
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:40,160
Like

2372
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:40,928
Hey

2373
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:42,976
If you can't have your identity

2374
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:45,536
Because it hurts somebody else like Alex

2375
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:47,584
Yeah like maybe

2376
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:48,608
Think about it

2377
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:49,632
Think about how

2378
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:51,168
Your identity

2379
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:52,704
Has hurt somebody else

2380
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:53,984
Olaf

2381
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:57,824
Or somebody else can't have their ID

2382
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:58,592
Because

2383
01:55:59,104 --> 01:56:00,896
You don't want to feel bad

2384
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:04,736
You're on a real interesting tip that Alex is not interested in

2385
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:06,272
Grapple

2386
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:10,112
Turn it the other way

2387
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:12,672
It's not even hard

2388
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:15,232
It's super easy like if I feel

2389
01:56:16,256 --> 01:56:17,280
And I don't like

2390
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,048
That

2391
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:20,608
What if somebody else

2392
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:22,656
Who isn't me feels that way

2393
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:26,496
That's letter A

2394
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:28,032
Removes a little bit of

2395
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:35,968
How do you not just take that little step you like to learn about this point

2396
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:41,344
Alex has been a long time I don't think I've played on the show that nationally

2397
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:42,368
In school

2398
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:46,464
They're telling kids

2399
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:48,000
Yes

2400
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:49,280
And this is because

2401
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:51,584
Boys and girls are hurtful

2402
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:52,608
The trans identifying

2403
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:53,376
Student

2404
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:55,680
He's stupid

2405
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:56,704
But here's the thing

2406
01:56:57,728 --> 01:56:58,496
If you look into it

2407
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:02,592
This is based on a story out of Lincoln Nebraska specifically

2408
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:05,920
And there were some materials that were provided to

2409
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:07,968
The teachers by a group called the genders

2410
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:10,528
Which is an organization whose website States

2411
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:15,136
A goal of fostering quote gender-sensitive an inclusive environment for all children and

2412
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:17,952
So inside their materials

2413
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:19,744
Read this

2414
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:23,328
Don't use phrases such as boys and girls

2415
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:26,144
You guys ladies and gentlemen and similarly

2416
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:27,424
Expressions to get kids

2417
01:57:28,192 --> 01:57:30,752
I instruct the training documents given to Middle School teachers at the

2418
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,032
Public Schools

2419
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,848
Create a class create classroom name

2420
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:37,920
And then ask all the purple penguin's to meet on the rug

2421
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:39,712
The document also warns against

2422
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:40,992
Askance

2423
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:43,040
The lineup is boys and girls

2424
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:46,624
And suggest asking them to line up whether they prefer skateboards or bike

2425
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:47,648
Milk or juice

2426
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:48,672
Dogs or cats

2427
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:50,720
Summer winter

2428
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:55,328
Do you mean by who you are as a person as opposed to what your habits

2429
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:00,448
Will this configuration

2430
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:01,472
Creative gender

2431
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:03,008
The document app

2432
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:05,568
Smart

2433
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:07,360
Sounds

2434
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:08,128
Is really dumb

2435
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:13,504
I just mean that it's it has the Ring of like

2436
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:16,064
Like even while

2437
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:19,648
Right I mean I mean that

2438
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:22,464
That immediately have that

2439
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,256
Knee jerk reaction of like

2440
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:25,280
Dude

2441
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:28,096
You're going overboard with this let's just

2442
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:29,376
But that makes

2443
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:30,400
Albertsons in the

2444
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:31,680
Just in the form of

2445
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:33,728
Just like that idea of

2446
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:34,752
We're not

2447
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:37,824
Immediately putting you into your blue in your pee

2448
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:41,408
You're like

2449
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:44,224
A boy or a girl I am somebody

2450
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:46,016
Who enjoys that I am

2451
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:47,040
Person first

2452
01:58:47,296 --> 01:58:50,368
Feelings and I'm not

2453
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:52,160
I'm not whatever you tell me I am

2454
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:55,232
And I'm allowed on the way that I want

2455
01:58:55,488 --> 01:59:01,632
The arbitrary specific of Purple Penguin

2456
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:02,912
Little Greek

2457
01:59:03,168 --> 01:59:04,192
Yeah just create

2458
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:08,032
Do teams within the classroom

2459
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:10,080
Getting mad at Legends of the Hidden Temple

2460
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:21,088
Three pieces of monkey together no one could ever f****** do it

2461
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:25,184
TV about that when I was a kid and then

2462
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:27,488
Someone made a group about it on Facebook

2463
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:33,888
Play years and years ago I like you f****** a******. I can't complain about it

2464
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:35,680
L remember that it made me mad

2465
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:41,312
Complain about it because one of the reasons that it was

2466
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:42,336
Was so hard for them

2467
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:43,872
Because they were shooting for like

2468
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:45,408
12 or 40

2469
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:46,176
18 hours

2470
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:50,528
Another reason is both of them weren't tall enough to put the head up.

2471
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:56,928
0 people got mad people I mean

2472
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:59,744
More

2473
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:01,280
So Brenda

2474
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:07,680
Agario the Lincoln Public Schools coordinator for social workers and counselors Lincoln Journal Star

2475
02:00:08,192 --> 02:00:08,960
To gain widespread

2476
02:00:09,728 --> 02:00:12,032
The materials were provided

2477
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:14,080
Educators to better understand gender identity

2478
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:18,176
And we're not impose rules

2479
02:00:18,688 --> 02:00:19,200
Quote

2480
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:22,272
Staff member on a district equity

2481
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:25,088
We're meant only for teachers not for students or parents

2482
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:28,416
And they were not meant as rules

2483
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:30,720
Suggestion

2484
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:32,256
Teachers can make students

2485
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:34,560
Comfortable it also stresses the impact words

2486
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:35,328
Can have on others

2487
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:38,656
If there's a staff member that uninformed and unsupportive

2488
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:40,192
That can be a pretty scary

2489
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:45,056
That can be pretty scary for a family may be struggling to understand transgender issues them cell

2490
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,872
Sounds like a really good Progressive

2491
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:48,896
School District

2492
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:52,224
Do you know what it is

2493
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:54,272
Almost

2494
02:00:54,784 --> 02:00:57,344
Almost all of this always winds up boiling down

2495
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:04,000
Like I read

2496
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:06,560
I read the

2497
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:08,352
10 million times when I was growing up

2498
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:11,168
And just one of those very simple things is always

2499
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:13,728
Be mindful be thoughtful with your ex

2500
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:17,312
Yeah you just randomly or

2501
02:01:17,824 --> 02:01:20,128
Just like think about how does this

2502
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:21,920
Make somebody else feel fart

2503
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:23,456
Instead of

2504
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:25,504
I want to do it so I'm going to

2505
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:28,832
No no

2506
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:31,648
Is worse for Alex's narrative

2507
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:35,488
The Lincoln public schools superintendent Steve Joel pushed back again

2508
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,792
What he said was a misinformed reaction

2509
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:39,328
The district gender identity

2510
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,120
Binational commentators

2511
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,448
It's indeed regrettable for the last week

2512
02:01:44,704 --> 02:01:47,264
And a half we had two dedicated much staff time and resource

2513
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:48,288
To address

2514
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:56,736
In fact never once has anyone inside our school

2515
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:58,784
Ladies and gentlemen out of their interactions

2516
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:00,832
Children or interaction with adults

2517
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:02,880
Course

2518
02:02:03,648 --> 02:02:04,672
This was about adults

2519
02:02:04,928 --> 02:02:09,280
Professional Educators who care deeply about trying to re-establish relationships

2520
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:10,304
There look

2521
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:12,608
4 strategies about how to be more effective in the

2522
02:02:13,632 --> 02:02:14,656
So f*** you

2523
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:18,752
Get mad about realshit

2524
02:02:19,008 --> 02:02:19,776
What do we

2525
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:22,336
Why do they have to make things up

2526
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:23,872
About bro

2527
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:25,920
That's what I'm talking about that

2528
02:02:26,176 --> 02:02:26,944
Is Jumping the Shark

2529
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:30,016
He's accidentally doing what he's parroting

2530
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:33,600
He's going

2531
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:37,696
So this next clip

2532
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:38,720
He actually

2533
02:02:39,232 --> 02:02:42,048
Okay he does the jump that he had prepared

2534
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:45,888
Another life

2535
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,960
Programming

2536
02:02:50,496 --> 02:02:53,312
Put in my mind

2537
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:54,592
Really

2538
02:02:54,848 --> 02:02:55,616
. there's

2539
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:56,384
Way better

2540
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:10,464
Be selectively enforced

2541
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:12,000
Discriminatory

2542
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:15,584
And so are all right

2543
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:20,192
If we ever do Muslim thousands a year

2544
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:22,752
Does anywhere from

2545
02:03:31,456 --> 02:03:36,064
Name two more country Northeastern Africa like Somalia

2546
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:44,512
Against

2547
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:52,192
For the shooter in Charleston

2548
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:58,592
Been calling for all Muslim symbol

2549
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:04,736
Calling for all mosque in the United States

2550
02:04:05,504 --> 02:04:07,040
Calling for all

2551
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:09,600
Self-identifying Muslims

2552
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:11,136
To be deported

2553
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:16,000
Original country of origin

2554
02:04:16,256 --> 02:04:17,280
I want all

2555
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:18,816
Muslims deported

2556
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:26,752
Muslims to have their mosque shutdown removed

2557
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:31,616
And their symbols removed

2558
02:04:32,896 --> 02:04:34,432
I want them arrested

2559
02:04:36,224 --> 02:04:37,760
Because we've got police showing up at

2560
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:46,976
So what

2561
02:04:47,488 --> 02:04:53,632
We'll get back to that rebel flags

2562
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:02,336
Assertive dispense with why that argument is really stupid

2563
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:11,808
They're really foundational problem

2564
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,368
In order

2565
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:15,136
4

2566
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:17,440
His argument to make sense

2567
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:19,744
The Confederacy

2568
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:22,048
Worship of

2569
02:05:22,304 --> 02:05:23,328
The Confederate flag

2570
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:24,864
Would have to be

2571
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:25,888
A federally protect

2572
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:26,656
The group

2573
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:28,448
It would have to be a religion

2574
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:30,240
So he didn't

2575
02:05:30,496 --> 02:05:32,032
In a lot of ways

2576
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:36,128
In order for him to make this argument logically

2577
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:38,944
Actually it doesn't work

2578
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:40,480
It just all the promises

2579
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:44,064
Like it works as a logical

2580
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:47,904
Dumb

2581
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:50,720
Strictly work I don't understand how you think it works

2582
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:51,744
Well because

2583
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:56,096
It doesn't have to be for it to actually work logic

2584
02:05:56,352 --> 02:05:57,376
Anything

2585
02:05:57,632 --> 02:05:58,400
He's saying

2586
02:05:58,656 --> 02:05:59,168
If

2587
02:05:59,936 --> 02:06:01,984
Muslims attacking people hurt someone

2588
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:06,336
The Americorps the Confederate flag being hung hurt someone

2589
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:08,128
We take down

2590
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:10,432
Symbols of the Confederate flag

2591
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:14,016
When a Confederate person expired by the Confederate flag

2592
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:16,320
Therefore we

2593
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:19,392
Take down all symbols of Muslim people when a person

2594
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:20,416
Inspired by

2595
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:21,440
Islam

2596
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:22,208
Attack somebody

2597
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:24,000
It actually does work

2598
02:06:24,256 --> 02:06:25,280
Strictly speaking

2599
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:27,584
In terms of Aven BB vincie

2600
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:28,352
You see them.

2601
02:06:28,864 --> 02:06:31,168
But it doesn't it doesn't matter

2602
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:33,984
Is that is that why

2603
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:36,544
Okay

2604
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:38,592
I see where you're coming from

2605
02:06:38,848 --> 02:06:40,128
You're right it's just

2606
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:41,920
The premises are so

2607
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:44,480
Supremacist

2608
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:45,248
They don't

2609
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:48,832
It's the different they're not they're not a one-to-one

2610
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:55,488
Right because

2611
02:06:55,744 --> 02:06:56,512
Maid-Rite

2612
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:59,328
Sound arguments you need to have

2613
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:01,888
True premises that lead to a conclusion

2614
02:07:02,144 --> 02:07:04,960
He needs to be in the proper form and things have to be true

2615
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:06,496
You can have a valid argument

2616
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:08,032
That's not sound

2617
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:09,312
If you just have bulshit

2618
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:13,152
But as long as it's set up right

2619
02:07:13,408 --> 02:07:17,760
The falsity falsity can leave the truth

2620
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:20,576
The thing is

2621
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:24,160
Like I said the really big thing is that

2622
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:25,440
In order for

2623
02:07:26,464 --> 02:07:28,256
You to make this argument and make it work

2624
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:30,304
You have to put in something

2625
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,072
That makes

2626
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:33,376
Confederacy

2627
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:34,912
Which is

2628
02:07:35,168 --> 02:07:35,680
Is a rogue

2629
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:36,704
Failed

2630
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:39,008
Insurgency basically

2631
02:07:39,264 --> 02:07:42,080
To be exactly the same as a religion

2632
02:07:42,592 --> 02:07:44,640
And if you want to make that argument Alex

2633
02:07:44,896 --> 02:07:45,664
You can

2634
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:47,456
But then you have to say

2635
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:51,552
A bunch of stuff that I don't think he realizes

2636
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:53,600
Interesting

2637
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:55,392
I mean

2638
02:07:55,648 --> 02:07:56,160
Because if

2639
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:58,720
For a lot of people it does function as

2640
02:07:58,976 --> 02:07:59,744
Something of a religion

2641
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,536
Geology

2642
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:02,304
Well

2643
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:04,608
I mean the idea that the South will rise again

2644
02:08:05,632 --> 02:08:07,424
Very much has those religious overtime

2645
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:11,008
And then the

2646
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:13,568
Fervency of the belief in the

2647
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:14,592
Flag

2648
02:08:14,848 --> 02:08:15,616
Belfry

2649
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:16,384
End

2650
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:18,432
Very much a

2651
02:08:18,688 --> 02:08:19,968
It is a worship we worship

2652
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:20,992
Past like

2653
02:08:21,248 --> 02:08:22,528
Could you

2654
02:08:23,296 --> 02:08:24,320
Steve

2655
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:25,088
Confederacy

2656
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:27,392
Ephedra

2657
02:08:27,648 --> 02:08:28,160
Federal

2658
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:29,440
Protected religion

2659
02:08:29,696 --> 02:08:30,976
The people who believe

2660
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:32,000
Use that we should have the

2661
02:08:32,256 --> 02:08:33,280
Confederate flag hanging

2662
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:34,816
Should have to

2663
02:08:35,072 --> 02:08:35,584
Agree

2664
02:08:36,352 --> 02:08:36,864
To go to church

2665
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:38,656
No ship that

2666
02:08:39,168 --> 02:08:45,312
No I don't think so the most interesting about people trying to use logic who don't

2667
02:08:45,568 --> 02:08:46,848
Logic

2668
02:08:48,128 --> 02:08:50,688
Whenever you make arguments like the one Alex is making

2669
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:52,480
You have a bunch of

2670
02:08:54,016 --> 02:09:00,160
They're not really even assumptions but their implied promises that you don't really even realize are in there and when you make your argument

2671
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:02,720
You're actually saying a ton more than you're actually

2672
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:04,256
Getting to

2673
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:05,280
And that is one of

2674
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:07,072
And the other thing is

2675
02:09:07,328 --> 02:09:07,840
Like

2676
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:09,376
Like I said

2677
02:09:09,632 --> 02:09:10,144
Things have to be

2678
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:13,472
True people were calling

2679
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:15,008
They're used

2680
02:09:15,264 --> 02:09:18,592
Sweet naive child

2681
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:19,616
Such a beauty

2682
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:21,920
WiDi.

2683
02:09:24,992 --> 02:09:26,016
Please have to be true

2684
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:28,320
Like I said

2685
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:33,952
So he's not taking into consideration we should ban

2686
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:35,232
The Confederate flag

2687
02:09:35,488 --> 02:09:39,840
There were just a bunch of businesses that got pressure for people who didn't want them to sell it and they replied

2688
02:09:40,352 --> 02:09:41,888
The free market

2689
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:43,936
They made a decision based on what

2690
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:47,520
Consumers were saying prices like Walmart stop selling the flag.

2691
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:49,568
So I was tribute

2692
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:51,104
Well yeah but they're not bringing Pro

2693
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,664
Prosperity background

2694
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:56,480
Prosperity

2695
02:09:58,272 --> 02:09:58,784
About that battle flag

2696
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:00,064
Secondarily

2697
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:03,648
But people wanted the Confederate flag taken out of state building because

2698
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:06,208
But you're not be

2699
02:10:06,464 --> 02:10:07,488
Government building

2700
02:10:11,072 --> 02:10:12,352
So those were the real

2701
02:10:12,608 --> 02:10:15,424
North Vietnam was hanging United

2702
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:19,520
Here's the other thing

2703
02:10:22,848 --> 02:10:24,896
I agree with him if you were me

2704
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:25,664
Which is

2705
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:29,504
Actually I wouldn't agree with him if he was using terrorism as one of the foundation

2706
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:30,784
Premises

2707
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:32,064
If you

2708
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:33,088
People

2709
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:35,392
In reality are trying to ban

2710
02:10:36,672 --> 02:10:37,696
Confederate flag being

2711
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:39,232
Flown in government

2712
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:40,768
Write an

2713
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:45,632
Some people are offended by it

2714
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:48,192
Whether or not that's another question

2715
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:49,472
So the

2716
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:50,240
Islamic

2717
02:10:50,496 --> 02:10:51,008
Flags

2718
02:10:51,264 --> 02:10:52,032
Should not be flown in

2719
02:10:52,544 --> 02:10:53,568
Our government State Building

2720
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:54,848
Well yeah but they shouldn't

2721
02:10:55,104 --> 02:10:56,384
Neither should the

2722
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:59,456
Confederate white but if he's making

2723
02:10:59,712 --> 02:11:00,480
Brett

2724
02:11:00,736 --> 02:11:01,504
But he's saying

2725
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:04,576
On their own property

2726
02:11:04,832 --> 02:11:05,600
So far

2727
02:11:07,392 --> 02:11:09,696
Satirical

2728
02:11:09,952 --> 02:11:13,792
He's not literally calling for these nuts

2729
02:11:14,816 --> 02:11:16,352
Did the form he's using

2730
02:11:16,608 --> 02:11:17,376
So far

2731
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:18,400
Like you just

2732
02:11:19,424 --> 02:11:20,192
It drives me up

2733
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:21,216
The f****** wall

2734
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:25,568
I could spend half an hour about all the b*******

2735
02:11:29,408 --> 02:11:30,688
You're you're being a pet

2736
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:32,224
Israeli without

2737
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:33,248
I am I am

2738
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:36,576
Flashing into the part of myself that should have been a professional

2739
02:11:39,392 --> 02:11:39,904
I looked in

2740
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:41,440
The idea that

2741
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:43,744
People were storming

2742
02:11:45,024 --> 02:11:45,792
I'm trying to get

2743
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:47,328
Confederate flag

2744
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:52,448
Confederate flags

2745
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:56,544
Google Confederate flag

2746
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:57,312
Giraffe

2747
02:11:58,080 --> 02:11:59,872
I found was

2748
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:02,176
Couple of bad stories

2749
02:12:03,456 --> 02:12:05,504
I'll just tell you a little bit about it

2750
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:06,272
Somebody just

2751
02:12:06,528 --> 02:12:07,040
Arrested

2752
02:12:07,552 --> 02:12:08,320
Confederate flag

2753
02:12:10,624 --> 02:12:16,768
Gun at a party

2754
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:21,376
Some charges

2755
02:12:23,168 --> 02:12:25,216
Smart because it

2756
02:12:25,472 --> 02:12:27,776
Mississippi

2757
02:12:28,544 --> 02:12:29,312
Another one

2758
02:12:31,104 --> 02:12:32,896
Yeah I know what you're saying

2759
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:35,456
It seems bad but was anybody arrested

2760
02:12:35,712 --> 02:12:36,224
For selling the

2761
02:12:37,248 --> 02:12:39,552
I did find one story about

2762
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:40,832
5 police

2763
02:12:41,856 --> 02:12:42,368
Swap Market

2764
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:44,416
Meet okay

2765
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:46,720
Alright merchandise

2766
02:12:48,256 --> 02:12:51,072
County Flea Market was so offended by a vendor selling

2767
02:12:51,328 --> 02:12:53,120
Confederate memorabilia

2768
02:12:53,376 --> 02:12:55,168
The person actually called 911

2769
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:57,216
Wallingford Connecticut police

2770
02:12:57,472 --> 02:12:59,008
We're dispatch to the flea market to

2771
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:01,824
The police chief William Wright tells News 8

2772
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:05,920
The reason no one was arrested was because the items were being sold on private property

2773
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:06,944
Not to mention

2774
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:10,272
Manolo

2775
02:13:10,528 --> 02:13:12,320
We're broken

2776
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:16,416
There was a table set up with this material right says

2777
02:13:16,672 --> 02:13:17,696
According to the Journal Record

2778
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:20,768
It's not criminally illegal but obviously it offended

2779
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:23,072
Because of some people a sense of being uncomfortable

2780
02:13:23,584 --> 02:13:24,608
Certainly the owner could pray

2781
02:13:24,864 --> 02:13:25,376
Preclude this Merchant

2782
02:13:26,144 --> 02:13:26,912
He said he could

2783
02:13:27,168 --> 02:13:28,960
Owner

2784
02:13:31,264 --> 02:13:33,824
The town resident called 911 said that there were helmets

2785
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:36,896
The swastikas images of Hitler and other historical Nazi items

2786
02:13:37,152 --> 02:13:38,944
I was shaking and almost vomit

2787
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:39,712
The paper

2788
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:40,736
I had to run

2789
02:13:40,992 --> 02:13:43,040
My grandma turn on the hits

2790
02:13:43,552 --> 02:13:45,088
My Grandmother Had numbers

2791
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:49,184
He said referring to the digits Nazis would tattoo on their prisoners

2792
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:52,768
Confederate items were quoting

2793
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:54,816
Replicas of flags and weapons

2794
02:13:55,328 --> 02:13:58,144
He said the seller told him he was quotes telling so much

2795
02:13:58,400 --> 02:13:59,168
You can't keep it in stock

2796
02:14:00,192 --> 02:14:04,288
So basically what happened

2797
02:14:04,544 --> 02:14:05,056
The flea market

2798
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:08,128
Police, I couldn't find any other stories

2799
02:14:08,384 --> 02:14:10,432
The police arrested for selling

2800
02:14:10,944 --> 02:14:13,504
He's just completely making that part up.

2801
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:14,784
It's absolutely absurd

2802
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:17,088
Well I think his argument would be that

2803
02:14:17,344 --> 02:14:18,624
Liberals snowflakes

2804
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:19,904
1 people arrest

2805
02:14:20,672 --> 02:14:21,184
1st and Langley

2806
02:14:22,976 --> 02:14:25,280
I know those liberals snowflakes who survived the Holocaust

2807
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:30,656
Yeah maybe I don't even know if he would want that guy arrested

2808
02:14:30,912 --> 02:14:33,472
Calling the police

2809
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:35,520
Coming from

2810
02:14:36,032 --> 02:14:36,800
It's

2811
02:14:37,568 --> 02:14:41,152
Look I don't know I'm also I like the fact that at the end

2812
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:47,808
It wasn't even real that's just getting of Texas getting an iPhone

2813
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:49,856
That's a good stuff right there

2814
02:14:50,112 --> 02:14:53,696
Alex is not done with his

2815
02:14:54,208 --> 02:14:57,536
He has a couple more things he wants to bring in here's one of them

2816
02:14:58,048 --> 02:14:59,328
That again I didn't cut it

2817
02:14:59,584 --> 02:15:00,352
Just segments

2818
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:05,728
What I just said in contacts

2819
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:11,104
Most Muslims aren't most Muslims aren't terrorists

2820
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:12,128
The truth is

2821
02:15:12,384 --> 02:15:13,408
In general

2822
02:15:21,088 --> 02:15:24,160
You should stop there

2823
02:15:24,672 --> 02:15:28,000
I don't support blaming all Muslims for what just happened

2824
02:15:28,256 --> 02:15:29,024
But

2825
02:15:29,792 --> 02:15:32,608
Muslim groups

2826
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:36,704
Calling to remove the Confederate flag

2827
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:39,520
Getting into this whole Anglo-Saxon

2828
02:15:47,712 --> 02:15:51,808
I'm not somebody else does

2829
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:54,368
But if you want

2830
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:56,672
We know statistically

2831
02:15:56,928 --> 02:16:01,280
Overnight world

2832
02:16:01,792 --> 02:16:02,816
If carried out

2833
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:04,608
By Islamic extremists

2834
02:16:04,864 --> 02:16:07,680
Grant

2835
02:16:08,448 --> 02:16:09,728
That's not even close to true

2836
02:16:09,984 --> 02:16:10,496
Not even

2837
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:11,264
Clothes

2838
02:16:12,032 --> 02:16:15,360
It just to give you a little bit of an idea

2839
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:17,408
So in the United States

2840
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:20,992
94% of terrorist attacks

2841
02:16:22,528 --> 02:16:24,832
82 2005 word on Vine

2842
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:27,904
A lot of inward environmental groups

2843
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:30,720
Animal rights groups

2844
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:34,048
A lot of them do you know if you do a little Larson

2845
02:16:34,304 --> 02:16:39,936
The councils of terrorism Europe

2846
02:16:40,448 --> 02:16:41,216
If you do a little

2847
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:45,056
He talks about how would like all these attacks are being carried out in Europe

2848
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:50,432
There been a thousand terrorists attacks in Europe

2849
02:16:50,688 --> 02:16:52,224
In The Last 5 Years

2850
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:54,272
At Wendy's article is written

2851
02:16:54,784 --> 02:16:55,552
I am

2852
02:16:56,320 --> 02:16:57,344
Less than 2%

2853
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:58,112
We're Cary.

2854
02:16:58,368 --> 02:16:59,392
Throughout the entirety of your

2855
02:16:59,904 --> 02:17:00,416
By Muslim

2856
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:05,280
I mean if you want to go worldwide and say

2857
02:17:05,792 --> 02:17:06,304
Like

2858
02:17:07,328 --> 02:17:07,840
You know

2859
02:17:08,352 --> 02:17:10,144
Muslims fighting off art

2860
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:11,680
In other countries

2861
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:12,960
Are acts of terrorism

2862
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:15,776
Cvent get into real Berkey territory

2863
02:17:16,032 --> 02:17:17,824
What are the big problems with

2864
02:17:18,336 --> 02:17:18,848
Terrorism

2865
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:21,152
People use it as a

2866
02:17:23,456 --> 02:17:25,504
When terrorism is very specific

2867
02:17:26,272 --> 02:17:27,040
Is a group of people

2868
02:17:27,552 --> 02:17:28,064
Or I person

2869
02:17:28,832 --> 02:17:29,344
Doing a

2870
02:17:29,856 --> 02:17:31,136
Relatively small thing

2871
02:17:31,392 --> 02:17:32,672
With a B

2872
02:17:32,928 --> 02:17:33,440
Footprints

2873
02:17:33,696 --> 02:17:34,208
In order to

2874
02:17:34,464 --> 02:17:34,976
The influence

2875
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:37,792
That's what it is

2876
02:17:39,072 --> 02:17:40,608
That nn

2877
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:41,888
The Charleston

2878
02:17:42,912 --> 02:17:43,424
Was not

2879
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:44,192
Terror

2880
02:17:45,984 --> 02:17:49,312
It wasn't it was a dude I wanted to cause a race war

2881
02:17:49,568 --> 02:17:50,592
There's political implication

2882
02:17:50,848 --> 02:17:53,152
But yeah

2883
02:17:53,408 --> 02:17:53,920
The government

2884
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:58,784
White people it's this weird

2885
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:00,320
Disconnect between like

2886
02:18:01,088 --> 02:18:05,440
Political terrorism but then there is just also trying to

2887
02:18:05,696 --> 02:18:08,000
You strike fear into everybody

2888
02:18:08,256 --> 02:18:10,048
So I don't know I think

2889
02:18:12,864 --> 02:18:13,632
I agree with your

2890
02:18:13,888 --> 02:18:14,912
Point

2891
02:18:15,936 --> 02:18:16,448
Look it's

2892
02:18:16,704 --> 02:18:17,216
Silly

2893
02:18:17,472 --> 02:18:17,984
I think

2894
02:18:18,496 --> 02:18:20,288
Include

2895
02:18:21,312 --> 02:18:23,104
In your in your

2896
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:25,664
Care about

2897
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:30,016
Alex only really cares about things

2898
02:18:30,272 --> 02:18:32,832
The West United States

2899
02:18:33,088 --> 02:18:35,904
And Europe into that the attacks were done by Muslims

2900
02:18:36,928 --> 02:18:37,440
Infinity

2901
02:18:38,720 --> 02:18:39,488
Less than

2902
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,536
6% in the United States

2903
02:18:42,048 --> 02:18:43,328
Less than 2% in Europe

2904
02:18:43,584 --> 02:18:47,936
And then if you want to talk about what is actually terrorism in the rest of the world

2905
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:51,008
Australia

2906
02:18:51,776 --> 02:18:52,288
I don't know

2907
02:18:52,544 --> 02:18:53,824
There was that one guy

2908
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:58,176
I'm talking about

2909
02:18:58,688 --> 02:19:00,480
Talk about

2910
02:19:00,992 --> 02:19:01,760
He had a knife

2911
02:19:04,064 --> 02:19:04,832
I do have a knife

2912
02:19:07,648 --> 02:19:08,928
Was Paul Hogan

2913
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:14,048
Well the Crocodile Hunter

2914
02:19:14,304 --> 02:19:20,448
There's no doubt about that it's really complicated issue to discuss

2915
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:24,288
Yeah

2916
02:19:24,544 --> 02:19:27,616
He says the Flies

2917
02:19:27,872 --> 02:19:32,736
Percent of the world terrorism is all Muslims

2918
02:19:33,504 --> 02:19:36,320
And the rest of it is just people looking to get ramp

2919
02:19:37,344 --> 02:19:39,648
What's up like that's like kidnappings in Brazil

2920
02:19:40,928 --> 02:19:46,048
Even if you are saying that you're not

2921
02:19:46,304 --> 02:19:49,888
Burnin It Down

2922
02:19:54,752 --> 02:20:00,896
It's Muslims and Muslim sympathizers which as we know are big fans of the environment

2923
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:03,200
They love them

2924
02:20:03,712 --> 02:20:05,760
He said that that's all

2925
02:20:06,016 --> 02:20:07,552
Some people will try to make a caveat

2926
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:13,440
But come out mainstream news was as phony as a three-dollar bill

2927
02:20:16,256 --> 02:20:19,328
Southern Poverty Law Center

2928
02:20:19,584 --> 02:20:20,352
It's not true

2929
02:20:21,888 --> 02:20:27,264
Article in World News Daily that have no source

2930
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:33,664
Basically another Infowars doesn't have

2931
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:34,432
A cool

2932
02:20:34,688 --> 02:20:37,248
Angry Texan doing the radio show with it

2933
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:41,344
So it's we're drunk or so used to work

2934
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:42,112
Before you defect

2935
02:20:42,624 --> 02:20:43,136
Infowars

2936
02:20:43,904 --> 02:20:46,464
So great credibility

2937
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:47,744
Zerohedge

2938
02:20:48,256 --> 02:20:49,792
That world

2939
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:59,776
I found an article about it on there that had no evidence and no leg

2940
02:21:00,288 --> 02:21:00,800
Anything else

2941
02:21:01,568 --> 02:21:03,104
Are there was a claim of

2942
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:04,640
Secret FBI memo

2943
02:21:04,896 --> 02:21:05,664
But it didn't linked

2944
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:06,944
To that it didn't have

2945
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:07,968
Any

2946
02:21:08,224 --> 02:21:10,528
Secret

2947
02:21:11,552 --> 02:21:14,112
18 mm

2948
02:21:14,368 --> 02:21:14,880
The claim that it is

2949
02:21:15,136 --> 02:21:15,648
Accepted

2950
02:21:15,904 --> 02:21:18,208
The only thing I was able to find was apparently

2951
02:21:19,232 --> 02:21:19,744
The place the whites

2952
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:23,840
Timothy McVeigh was Elohim City

2953
02:21:24,352 --> 02:21:25,632
And apparently they

2954
02:21:25,888 --> 02:21:27,936
The Southern Poverty Law Center

2955
02:21:28,192 --> 02:21:28,704
Inside

2956
02:21:29,216 --> 02:21:30,752
Really

2957
02:21:31,008 --> 02:21:33,312
The group and that's how they got a lot of information about the

2958
02:21:34,336 --> 02:21:35,360
So

2959
02:21:35,616 --> 02:21:38,432
Kind of true and it is much as they had someone

2960
02:21:38,944 --> 02:21:40,224
New was doing research

2961
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:41,248
Now

2962
02:21:41,504 --> 02:21:45,856
There's no reason to believe that this person in any way influence

2963
02:21:46,112 --> 02:21:49,952
He was already prone to two-faced on statement even making

2964
02:21:50,464 --> 02:21:52,256
The last ten goddamn years before that

2965
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:56,608
There's also no reason to believe that this disposal within Elohim City

2966
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:59,168
Would have had any foreknowledge

2967
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:00,704
What Timothy McVeigh plan

2968
02:22:01,216 --> 02:22:03,264
Cuz even if you have white supremacist group

2969
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:04,032
There's no

2970
02:22:04,288 --> 02:22:10,432
Indication that you just an open meeting that seems kind of

2971
02:22:10,688 --> 02:22:12,736
Monkey you can't assume that every

2972
02:22:12,992 --> 02:22:18,112
I'm a totally cool white supremacist you guys like blowing s*** up I like bloated up

2973
02:22:18,624 --> 02:22:23,488
Let me tell you one thing I know about people who are involved in these sorts of

2974
02:22:23,744 --> 02:22:24,256
The Fringe groups

2975
02:22:25,024 --> 02:22:29,120
What are the trends that runs through all of them is a certain amount of paranoia

2976
02:22:29,632 --> 02:22:30,400
A lot of them

2977
02:22:30,656 --> 02:22:32,192
I have good reason to believe

2978
02:22:32,448 --> 02:22:35,264
Anybody in that group could it be a government mole

2979
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:36,288
Because

2980
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:39,616
It's a good idea to get

2981
02:22:40,128 --> 02:22:46,016
These are basically like

2982
02:22:48,064 --> 02:22:51,904
Alex you know how you want Intel on what a terrorist group in

2983
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:52,928
Iraq

2984
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:53,696
Is doing

2985
02:22:54,464 --> 02:22:57,024
I told you we but also on the ones

2986
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:58,560
Are sleeper cells

2987
02:22:59,072 --> 02:23:01,632
Pierre essentially which you are afraid of

2988
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:03,680
So

2989
02:23:03,936 --> 02:23:04,448
Look

2990
02:23:04,704 --> 02:23:05,472
It's so dumb

2991
02:23:05,728 --> 02:23:06,240
If it's just

2992
02:23:07,008 --> 02:23:08,032
Again it's making supper

2993
02:23:08,288 --> 02:23:09,056
Out of whole cloth

2994
02:23:09,824 --> 02:23:10,848
So I don't

2995
02:23:14,176 --> 02:23:15,200
We have one more quick

2996
02:23:17,248 --> 02:23:18,528
And if this one

2997
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:26,464
Did go on after that

2998
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:29,536
True I don't believe that

2999
02:23:30,048 --> 02:23:31,584
What I do believe is we should ban

3000
02:23:36,704 --> 02:23:39,776
Again I don't get where he

3001
02:23:40,032 --> 02:23:40,544
He thinks

3002
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:43,360
Satire in reality where the line is

3003
02:23:43,616 --> 02:23:45,408
Spectrum

3004
02:23:45,664 --> 02:23:47,968
I have no idea but I know that what

3005
02:23:49,248 --> 02:23:50,528
Is that I'm going to

3006
02:23:50,784 --> 02:23:51,808
To say that I call

3007
02:23:52,064 --> 02:23:56,928
For the Banning of the deportation of

3008
02:23:57,184 --> 02:23:59,488
And then people will take

3009
02:23:59,744 --> 02:24:02,304
They won't point out that afterwards I said

3010
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:06,912
Right I'm not saying or immediately before it I said I'm going to f***

3011
02:24:09,472 --> 02:24:10,496
There's a logical

3012
02:24:10,752 --> 02:24:11,264
Forum

3013
02:24:12,544 --> 02:24:13,312
Doves like sort of

3014
02:24:14,336 --> 02:24:15,104
Dealing with

3015
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:16,896
Do atoms 30 mm

3016
02:24:17,152 --> 02:24:18,944
That's where you take someone's argument

3017
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:21,760
And you point out an example of what their logic

3018
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:22,528
Implies

3019
02:24:22,784 --> 02:24:24,064
It turns it into

3020
02:24:25,344 --> 02:24:28,416
Italian for our Latin for reduced to absurdity

3021
02:24:28,672 --> 02:24:30,208
Yeah Alex Jones at this next

3022
02:24:30,464 --> 02:24:33,280
Flip accidentally does that to his own fake argument

3023
02:24:34,048 --> 02:24:35,584
A realtor

3024
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:36,608
Let's jump this show

3025
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:40,960
This is the logic

3026
02:24:41,472 --> 02:24:43,008
This is what they're pushing

3027
02:24:43,264 --> 02:24:44,032
And so

3028
02:24:46,592 --> 02:24:47,872
If one man

3029
02:24:51,712 --> 02:24:52,736
White person

3030
02:25:07,328 --> 02:25:08,096
Again that's Mark Dice

3031
02:25:09,376 --> 02:25:09,888
Mark Dice

3032
02:25:10,144 --> 02:25:13,216
Let's remove every symbol somebody uses in a wrong way

3033
02:25:13,728 --> 02:25:15,776
If somebody runs over somebody with a Ford truck

3034
02:25:16,288 --> 02:25:20,384
I want 4 to change a symbol that I want

3035
02:25:20,896 --> 02:25:23,456
Every Ford symbol

3036
02:25:23,712 --> 02:25:24,736
Thousand-dollar fine

3037
02:25:29,088 --> 02:25:30,112
I want

3038
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:31,392
So now

3039
02:25:31,904 --> 02:25:34,976
Location of his watch

3040
02:25:35,744 --> 02:25:37,280
He unfortunately isn't

3041
02:25:37,536 --> 02:25:39,840
It all related to the logic of people who want

3042
02:25:40,096 --> 02:25:43,168
The Confederate flag taken out of state building

3043
02:25:43,424 --> 02:25:46,496
The only thing that him making this stupid fake argument about

3044
02:25:46,752 --> 02:25:49,568
Chevy trucks

3045
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:51,616
That only hurts your fake argument

3046
02:25:51,872 --> 02:25:53,152
It only shows

3047
02:25:53,408 --> 02:25:56,480
How different that is from anything anybody else is saying

3048
02:25:58,016 --> 02:26:01,856
F****** thrown a javelin through his argument

3049
02:26:02,112 --> 02:26:05,952
Oh well somebody from

3050
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:09,024
Came over here and committed a terrorist

3051
02:26:09,536 --> 02:26:15,680
So we should ban all people from Iran from coming into the United States

3052
02:26:16,704 --> 02:26:19,520
2017

3053
02:26:19,776 --> 02:26:21,312
It turns out that might be actually like

3054
02:26:21,568 --> 02:26:23,360
All this stuff where he's claiming is Jumping the Shark

3055
02:26:24,384 --> 02:26:26,944
That way

3056
02:26:27,456 --> 02:26:30,272
Like over the neck

3057
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:31,040
Couple episodes

3058
02:26:31,296 --> 02:26:31,808
He is like

3059
02:26:32,064 --> 02:26:32,832
Now what

3060
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:41,024
It didn't work the way he wanted to

3061
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:47,424
They will be f****** talking about

3062
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:49,216
He talked about how dumb

3063
02:26:49,728 --> 02:26:51,264
Not for saying

3064
02:26:51,776 --> 02:26:54,080
We should ban all Muslims symbols

3065
02:26:54,336 --> 02:26:55,360
But for saying

3066
02:26:55,872 --> 02:26:58,176
I'm going to do this as a lie

3067
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:05,856
And then I'm going to tell you that I was like well actually knowing Media Matters operate

3068
02:27:06,112 --> 02:27:06,624
Fall for it

3069
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:09,440
I think you're I think you're

3070
02:27:09,696 --> 02:27:15,072
I feel your hand yelling at Adam Schiff they didn't talk about how he's clearly drunk

3071
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:19,424
How many episodes they aren't picking up all the

3072
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:20,960
Text or what's going on

3073
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:22,240
But they mean well.

3074
02:27:27,616 --> 02:27:32,224
It got jumped interview

3075
02:27:34,272 --> 02:27:35,296
Handsome devil gun

3076
02:27:36,576 --> 02:27:39,136
Which he actually has in studio

3077
02:27:39,392 --> 02:27:43,744
Anime episode with an interview with a pastor whose Name Escapes Me

3078
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,048
It don't matter it's just about the Confederacy

3079
02:27:46,304 --> 02:27:46,816
Pretty cool

3080
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:51,936
The pastor and this is where he loses all of its credibility

3081
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:59,104
There's never been a civilization in the history of the world that has officially

3082
02:27:59,872 --> 02:28:00,640
Embrace

3083
02:28:00,896 --> 02:28:01,920
Promoted

3084
02:28:02,176 --> 02:28:03,712
And legitimize

3085
02:28:04,224 --> 02:28:07,040
Thought that the homosexual lifestyle that has survived

3086
02:28:07,552 --> 02:28:10,112
That is simply a matter of historical record

3087
02:28:10,624 --> 02:28:12,160
Let me actually use

3088
02:28:12,416 --> 02:28:14,976
Use a reducto Adams 30mm

3089
02:28:15,232 --> 02:28:17,536
Argument against his I will do it in real time

3090
02:28:18,048 --> 02:28:23,168
No cultures that didn't have didn't have Nintendo Wiis have all that survived

3091
02:28:23,936 --> 02:28:24,448
There we go

3092
02:28:25,216 --> 02:28:25,984
It's stupid

3093
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:26,752
Pointless

3094
02:28:27,008 --> 02:28:33,152
If it doesn't mean anything you can't you can't comply causation between accepted homosexual lifestyle

3095
02:28:33,408 --> 02:28:34,688
Why did the Aztecs

3096
02:28:35,456 --> 02:28:36,480
Fade away

3097
02:28:37,248 --> 02:28:37,760
Didn't have

3098
02:28:39,552 --> 02:28:42,112
Everybody knows because we

3099
02:28:42,368 --> 02:28:42,880
Have

3100
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:46,208
Property

3101
02:28:50,304 --> 02:28:51,584
Exactly

3102
02:28:52,096 --> 02:28:53,120
That's just like saying

3103
02:28:53,376 --> 02:28:55,936
All of the cultures who aren't alive now

3104
02:28:56,192 --> 02:28:57,984
Alive Balfour

3105
02:28:59,264 --> 02:29:05,408
Yeah the other thing to do is like a buddy there a lot of civilizations that didn't formally recognized on the sexuality

3106
02:29:09,248 --> 02:29:09,760
You know

3107
02:29:10,784 --> 02:29:11,808
Spartan spot the lot

3108
02:29:12,064 --> 02:29:13,088
In the butt

3109
02:29:13,344 --> 02:29:13,856
Yep there

3110
02:29:15,648 --> 02:29:16,160
Like

3111
02:29:16,672 --> 02:29:22,816
If you you understand so well

3112
02:29:23,328 --> 02:29:29,216
Well it wasn't like we're in a loving relationship

3113
02:29:35,872 --> 02:29:39,200
That was more like if you're a teacher and pupil

3114
02:29:39,712 --> 02:29:40,224
Dafuq

3115
02:29:41,504 --> 02:29:42,784
Respect

3116
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:44,320
I don't understand

3117
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:48,416
Soldiers.

3118
02:29:48,672 --> 02:29:51,232
For so manly we're going to f***

3119
02:29:53,536 --> 02:29:55,584
F****** another dude

3120
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:57,632
Viking history about that too

3121
02:29:59,936 --> 02:30:04,032
You get a bunch of dudes together in a small and closing sooner or later

3122
02:30:04,288 --> 02:30:07,360
Forever

3123
02:30:07,616 --> 02:30:08,640
Silly bringing V like

3124
02:30:08,896 --> 02:30:11,712
Norse s*** into Exile really know all that much about it but

3125
02:30:12,224 --> 02:30:13,760
Bearded man yeah you can pick

3126
02:30:14,016 --> 02:30:14,528
Any hundred

3127
02:30:15,808 --> 02:30:18,624
Our modern culture that existed

3128
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:19,392
Well

3129
02:30:24,256 --> 02:30:24,768
Anyway

3130
02:30:27,072 --> 02:30:28,864
We are very

3131
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:29,632
Shorts

3132
02:30:29,888 --> 02:30:30,400
Way2go

3133
02:30:30,656 --> 02:30:31,680
To get through the rest of this

3134
02:30:32,704 --> 02:30:37,056
The rest of the episodes in are stretched to

3135
02:30:37,312 --> 02:30:38,080
Are terrible

3136
02:30:38,848 --> 02:30:43,456
He jumped the truck and did not get back up he crashed

3137
02:30:43,712 --> 02:30:44,480
Remote Landing

3138
02:30:44,992 --> 02:30:46,016
The 19th

3139
02:30:46,272 --> 02:30:48,064
Because the 18th is Saturday so there's no show

3140
02:30:48,576 --> 02:30:50,112
19th Sunday showed

3141
02:30:50,368 --> 02:30:52,672
Mostly about how the British nobility or not

3142
02:30:53,696 --> 02:30:58,304
Heiling Hitler came out

3143
02:31:00,096 --> 02:31:04,192
Like he's been Vindicated on everything he's always said

3144
02:31:04,448 --> 02:31:08,032
Congratulatory text for somebody who's always being Vindicated

3145
02:31:08,288 --> 02:31:11,104
You sure feels the need to say he's been Vindicated

3146
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:15,968
Really care I don't really

3147
02:31:16,224 --> 02:31:17,248
Particularly

3148
02:31:17,504 --> 02:31:20,064
All that interested in his feelings about the British nobility

3149
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:22,880
You know that they're their mess

3150
02:31:23,392 --> 02:31:23,904
But

3151
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:24,672
We get to

3152
02:31:25,696 --> 02:31:26,208
We get to month

3153
02:31:27,232 --> 02:31:27,744
Talk more about

3154
02:31:29,024 --> 02:31:29,792
Osborne

3155
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:31,072
But he does say that

3156
02:31:31,584 --> 02:31:33,376
Is one clip worth listening to here

3157
02:31:37,984 --> 02:31:40,800
Personal history

3158
02:31:55,136 --> 02:31:57,184
Shark

3159
02:31:57,952 --> 02:31:58,976
Is a jellyfish

3160
02:31:59,232 --> 02:32:00,000
Jellyfish will get you

3161
02:32:02,048 --> 02:32:03,328
He's skinny dip with the babes

3162
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:05,376
And that's what separates the boys from the men

3163
02:32:05,888 --> 02:32:07,168
His back then he wasn't

3164
02:32:07,424 --> 02:32:08,960
Afraid to Skinny Dip with the lady

3165
02:32:09,728 --> 02:32:11,264
So it's his personal history mix

3166
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:14,592
With even dumb masculine ideas

3167
02:32:16,896 --> 02:32:17,408
Not true

3168
02:32:19,712 --> 02:32:20,480
I don't think

3169
02:32:20,736 --> 02:32:21,248
Get through it all

3170
02:32:21,504 --> 02:32:22,272
I think it's true

3171
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:24,576
Okay well not his assessment but the

3172
02:32:24,832 --> 02:32:27,648
The fact of him skinny-dipping with cheerleaders

3173
02:32:27,904 --> 02:32:30,976
Pictures of him when he was younger

3174
02:32:31,232 --> 02:32:32,000
Trolls

3175
02:32:32,256 --> 02:32:34,816
Okay just built like a brick shithouse this guy

3176
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:37,632
All right he was he was

3177
02:32:38,144 --> 02:32:38,656
Fit

3178
02:32:38,912 --> 02:32:41,728
When he was younger

3179
02:32:41,984 --> 02:32:43,776
It's very disconcerting

3180
02:32:44,032 --> 02:32:46,080
He wasn't he was a bad kid

3181
02:32:50,432 --> 02:32:51,712
But also was

3182
02:32:51,968 --> 02:32:52,992
Traditionally attractive

3183
02:32:53,248 --> 02:32:54,784
So I could see him being

3184
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:56,576
One of these bad boys it goes

3185
02:32:56,832 --> 02:33:01,952
Skinny-dipping with girls like 150 girls before he's 16

3186
02:33:02,208 --> 02:33:04,768
Nobody

3187
02:33:05,024 --> 02:33:06,560
I believe

3188
02:33:06,816 --> 02:33:07,328
With a couple people

3189
02:33:09,632 --> 02:33:10,144
Unimportant

3190
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:12,960
It's more important that Alex is like

3191
02:33:13,728 --> 02:33:14,240
This is

3192
02:33:14,496 --> 02:33:16,032
What bravery is

3193
02:33:16,288 --> 02:33:17,824
Endeavor good girls on your young

3194
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:21,408
I don't give a s*** I don't think it was Brave of me

3195
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:22,432
Anyway

3196
02:33:22,688 --> 02:33:23,456
We move on to the

3197
02:33:23,712 --> 02:33:24,224
July twenty

3198
02:33:24,736 --> 02:33:26,784
First episode where we will end our investigation

3199
02:33:27,296 --> 02:33:31,392
Comes up about Trump so the actual investigations kind of over

3200
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:34,208
But he does get back into

3201
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:36,256
This whole episode mostly

3202
02:33:36,512 --> 02:33:37,280
On the 21st

3203
02:33:37,792 --> 02:33:40,608
Hey there's two narratives that he spending about it all

3204
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:42,144
All talk about

3205
02:33:45,216 --> 02:33:45,728
Serious

3206
02:33:46,496 --> 02:33:48,032
This is a big new all over again

3207
02:33:50,848 --> 02:33:53,920
That they don't let army recruiters carry guns

3208
02:33:54,432 --> 02:33:58,016
Army Recruitment and they don't have our

3209
02:33:58,272 --> 02:33:59,552
Chattanooga shooting

3210
02:33:59,808 --> 02:34:02,624
Military

3211
02:34:03,648 --> 02:34:04,672
And so Alex's

3212
02:34:04,928 --> 02:34:05,952
Extrapolating

3213
02:34:06,208 --> 02:34:06,720
So

3214
02:34:06,976 --> 02:34:08,256
Joe Biggs is on the theme

3215
02:34:08,512 --> 02:34:14,656
Just south of Austin Army Recruitment Center with Patriots with guns Garden

3216
02:34:16,192 --> 02:34:16,704
God

3217
02:34:17,472 --> 02:34:19,776
SoJO barbers

3218
02:34:20,032 --> 02:34:20,544
It basically

3219
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:26,944
Yeah so he doesn't report to Skype is terrible at breaks up over and over again

3220
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:28,224
Gamma guns

3221
02:34:28,480 --> 02:34:29,248
They're protecting people

3222
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:30,784
I have some experience

3223
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:32,832
With army recruiters cuz I

3224
02:34:33,088 --> 02:34:34,112
I don't know if it's changed

3225
02:34:34,624 --> 02:34:35,136
Certainly hope

3226
02:34:35,648 --> 02:34:38,464
But when I was in high school to recruiters were in your school

3227
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:40,000
Yeah oh they were Michael

3228
02:34:40,256 --> 02:34:44,096
They were there and their whole goal was to manipulate you into signing up

3229
02:34:46,912 --> 02:34:48,960
Cool

3230
02:34:49,216 --> 02:34:52,800
Because he was trying to get us into the army

3231
02:34:53,056 --> 02:34:55,872
YouTube James Brown

3232
02:34:56,128 --> 02:34:56,896
He was awesome

3233
02:34:57,920 --> 02:34:58,688
So cool

3234
02:34:59,200 --> 02:34:59,712
But

3235
02:34:59,968 --> 02:35:00,992
As you turtle

3236
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:03,296
What time when are you start to realize

3237
02:35:03,808 --> 02:35:06,624
What my future plans are

3238
02:35:06,880 --> 02:35:09,952
For it

3239
02:35:10,208 --> 02:35:10,976
Lemon UPS

3240
02:35:16,608 --> 02:35:17,120
So

3241
02:35:17,376 --> 02:35:18,400
I don't care

3242
02:35:18,656 --> 02:35:20,448
Call Zach much about our mirek

3243
02:35:21,472 --> 02:35:22,496
Because it isn't

3244
02:35:22,752 --> 02:35:23,520
Really

3245
02:35:23,776 --> 02:35:25,824
Benign

3246
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:28,384
You want to sign up so you go sign up

3247
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:34,784
Yeah there is a manipulative game with her playing in order to trick people into my account

3248
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:35,808
Like join the Navy

3249
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:39,392
It's absurd to think that they don't get bonuses

3250
02:35:39,648 --> 02:35:40,416
Signing people up

3251
02:35:40,928 --> 02:35:41,952
It's absurd to think that there isn't

3252
02:35:42,208 --> 02:35:42,976
Quotas

3253
02:35:43,232 --> 02:35:44,256
You're supposed to reach yet

3254
02:35:44,512 --> 02:35:45,024
So

3255
02:35:46,304 --> 02:35:47,584
Tristan kids signing away their future

3256
02:35:48,352 --> 02:35:50,400
So I don't give a s***

3257
02:35:50,656 --> 02:35:51,168
Joe Biggs

3258
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:55,264
I wish I could pull this quote

3259
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:56,288
He says

3260
02:35:56,544 --> 02:35:58,848
Joe Biggs not a man to make s*** up

3261
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:06,784
Fast forward Joe Biggs getting fired for reporting on pizzagate

3262
02:36:07,296 --> 02:36:08,832
So the other narrative

3263
02:36:09,088 --> 02:36:09,600
Of the show

3264
02:36:09,856 --> 02:36:10,624
The chicks out most of it

3265
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:13,952
He gets packed

3266
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:15,488
He says

3267
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:16,512
Sum fuk

3268
02:36:17,024 --> 02:36:17,792
Wild stuff

3269
02:36:18,304 --> 02:36:19,328
Bottom here's the first

3270
02:36:25,472 --> 02:36:27,008
So this is about

3271
02:36:27,264 --> 02:36:29,312
The demon narrative

3272
02:36:29,568 --> 02:36:31,616
Every time you're in protest

3273
02:36:31,872 --> 02:36:34,688
And show up

3274
02:36:41,344 --> 02:36:47,488
Actually

3275
02:36:47,744 --> 02:36:53,888
If something is going on

3276
02:36:54,144 --> 02:37:00,288
Restaurant I love Lamborghini

3277
02:37:02,592 --> 02:37:04,128
So there we go with more classes

3278
02:37:06,432 --> 02:37:07,968
Talkabouttd

3279
02:37:08,224 --> 02:37:09,504
Missing something it's important to bring up

3280
02:37:11,296 --> 02:37:12,064
Some of deceptive

3281
02:37:13,344 --> 02:37:15,392
Conversation

3282
02:37:17,440 --> 02:37:18,720
You setting up a relationship where

3283
02:37:18,976 --> 02:37:20,768
This Research Center could get

3284
02:37:21,024 --> 02:37:21,536
Tissue sample

3285
02:37:22,048 --> 02:37:24,096
Every single time that they talk about it

3286
02:37:24,352 --> 02:37:25,120
Text sample

3287
02:37:25,376 --> 02:37:26,144
They don't

3288
02:37:27,424 --> 02:37:31,264
The people making the video want you to believe that what they're talking about is a full baby

3289
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:33,312
Yeah that's not what they're talking about

3290
02:37:35,104 --> 02:37:36,384
Liver or an attack

3291
02:37:38,176 --> 02:37:39,968
Which is well within the legal

3292
02:37:40,224 --> 02:37:41,504
Situation

3293
02:37:43,808 --> 02:37:44,832
Like a buffalo

3294
02:37:45,088 --> 02:37:45,600
Exactly

3295
02:37:45,856 --> 02:37:47,904
The other thing is is Lamborghini

3296
02:37:48,672 --> 02:37:49,440
Who's the lady talking

3297
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:53,280
Hi and it's clearly

3298
02:37:53,792 --> 02:37:57,376
What do you want I want a Lamborghini

3299
02:37:57,632 --> 02:38:03,776
Old ladies making a lame way to live

3300
02:38:04,032 --> 02:38:04,800
Well yeah that's

3301
02:38:05,312 --> 02:38:11,456
Buying Lamborghinis based on these baby money

3302
02:38:11,712 --> 02:38:12,480
Bonita clarify

3303
02:38:12,736 --> 02:38:15,808
In preparation

3304
02:38:16,576 --> 02:38:17,088
So clear

3305
02:38:17,344 --> 02:38:18,112
The visit

3306
02:38:18,368 --> 02:38:20,672
Manipulative

3307
02:38:21,184 --> 02:38:21,952
The camera of course

3308
02:38:22,976 --> 02:38:29,120
Oh yeah

3309
02:38:30,656 --> 02:38:33,216
It's crazy

3310
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:48,064
He might have been Oscar the Grouch that's not really demonic as it as much as it is hobo or

3311
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:50,624
Sesame Street

3312
02:38:54,464 --> 02:38:59,584
Actually just

3313
02:39:02,912 --> 02:39:03,936
Your legion

3314
02:39:04,448 --> 02:39:05,728
You saw the movie times

3315
02:39:08,288 --> 02:39:10,336
Keanu Reeves

3316
02:39:19,296 --> 02:39:23,904
Coronavirus

3317
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:27,488
Glass sword starting Concrete Man

3318
02:39:33,376 --> 02:39:35,680
Liberty movies

3319
02:39:36,448 --> 02:39:36,960
Another movie

3320
02:39:40,544 --> 02:39:42,592
Wine

3321
02:39:42,848 --> 02:39:43,616
Classism

3322
02:39:48,480 --> 02:39:51,552
That sounds like a lot more fun than you do on your conscience

3323
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:56,928
I don't know I just

3324
02:39:59,744 --> 02:40:00,512
Yes,

3325
02:40:22,784 --> 02:40:24,064
And it's not what's happening

3326
02:40:24,576 --> 02:40:30,720
It's not that they're selling baby parts

3327
02:40:30,976 --> 02:40:32,256
With these evil women like

3328
02:40:32,512 --> 02:40:34,048
Well I mean based on the truth

3329
02:40:34,304 --> 02:40:34,816
Yes

3330
02:40:35,072 --> 02:40:37,376
Cuz they're not also even if they

3331
02:40:37,632 --> 02:40:38,656
Even if they were evil

3332
02:40:38,912 --> 02:40:45,056
Play sound like a lot of fun I like Chianti

3333
02:40:45,312 --> 02:40:49,408
Lamborghini

3334
02:40:50,944 --> 02:40:54,016
She's aspiring she's got ambition

3335
02:40:54,272 --> 02:40:55,552
There is a go

3336
02:40:55,808 --> 02:40:57,856
Great moment that again I didn't cut this clip

3337
02:40:58,112 --> 02:40:58,624
The time

3338
02:40:59,136 --> 02:40:59,904
But

3339
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:00,928
Alex says

3340
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:04,512
Defending Planned Parenthood when these videos come out

3341
02:41:05,024 --> 02:41:06,304
It's going to blow back

3342
02:41:07,072 --> 02:41:08,352
It's so ironic

3343
02:41:08,864 --> 02:41:10,144
Because never

3344
02:41:11,168 --> 02:41:12,960
I don't know I can't say for certain

3345
02:41:13,216 --> 02:41:13,984
We'll find out as

3346
02:41:14,240 --> 02:41:15,264
This investigation goes on

3347
02:41:15,776 --> 02:41:16,288
But I guarantee

3348
02:41:17,056 --> 02:41:17,824
He never died

3349
02:41:18,336 --> 02:41:19,872
I'm sorry that I reported this

3350
02:41:20,384 --> 02:41:22,688
I'm still

3351
02:41:22,944 --> 02:41:23,456
Portion

3352
02:41:23,712 --> 02:41:25,248
Which would be the respectable thing to do

3353
02:41:25,504 --> 02:41:27,040
If he was like I'm against abortion

3354
02:41:27,296 --> 02:41:32,928
I have principle that even up to the first trimester I don't think it's okay I believe it's a human

3355
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:34,720
If you

3356
02:41:34,976 --> 02:41:39,840
I'm sorry these videos were manipulative it would propaganda I fell for it I'm sorry

3357
02:41:40,096 --> 02:41:42,400
If you were to say that I would respect the hell out of it

3358
02:41:42,912 --> 02:41:43,936
Have you like it's okay

3359
02:41:44,192 --> 02:41:44,704
I don't think

3360
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:45,472
Annie

3361
02:41:46,496 --> 02:41:47,008
Conservative

3362
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:52,384
Certainly a lot of people in the House and Senate

3363
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:56,992
When they did investigation

3364
02:41:57,248 --> 02:41:58,784
Opinion

3365
02:41:59,296 --> 02:42:00,576
Splash news media

3366
02:42:00,832 --> 02:42:02,368
Conservative

3367
02:42:03,136 --> 02:42:03,648
Propaganda

3368
02:42:03,904 --> 02:42:04,416
She never

3369
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:07,232
Well guys we got it wrong and

3370
02:42:07,488 --> 02:42:10,304
Pretty certain that Fox News isn't reporting to

3371
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:11,584
Too much on the trial of the

3372
02:42:12,352 --> 02:42:13,376
No it much like

3373
02:42:13,632 --> 02:42:16,704
Hannity is not going to apologize for Separate Checks

3374
02:42:17,216 --> 02:42:18,752
So he gets into

3375
02:42:19,008 --> 02:42:21,824
This next clip is a bit more about the Planned Parenthood

3376
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:24,128
Important here is the video izle

3377
02:42:24,896 --> 02:42:26,688
The videos video song about our lives

3378
02:42:26,944 --> 02:42:28,992
That he's going to lie about the LIE

3379
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:31,552
He's going to end

3380
02:42:32,064 --> 02:42:34,368
Okay he's going to editorialize and

3381
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:36,672
Aren't in those videos

3382
02:42:37,184 --> 02:42:37,952
In order to

3383
02:42:38,208 --> 02:42:39,232
Grow

3384
02:42:39,488 --> 02:42:41,536
The demonic

3385
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:44,864
So even if you just reporting on the video

3386
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:46,656
That is reporting on Ally

3387
02:42:46,912 --> 02:42:48,192
This is lying about Allah

3388
02:42:48,448 --> 02:42:49,216
That's

3389
02:42:50,240 --> 02:42:53,312
That's like next level propaganda

3390
02:42:53,568 --> 02:42:55,360
Multiply -2 by negative

3391
02:42:56,640 --> 02:42:57,408
Positive for

3392
02:42:58,176 --> 02:42:58,944
That tracks

3393
02:43:07,136 --> 02:43:13,280
Pieces

3394
02:43:35,552 --> 02:43:41,696
What

3395
02:43:42,464 --> 02:43:43,744
What

3396
02:43:52,448 --> 02:43:57,568
Victor's wife terrible actor

3397
02:43:58,336 --> 02:44:00,640
Jordan I'm sorry I have to go back cuz

3398
02:44:01,408 --> 02:44:03,712
It look you're right you're right

3399
02:44:03,968 --> 02:44:10,112
A little bit of what happens after

3400
02:44:10,368 --> 02:44:11,904
Cuz it's so funny

3401
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:13,184
You so dumb

3402
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:19,584
Like first of all don't lie on the ground and acting like they're sexually

3403
02:44:19,840 --> 02:44:21,376
I don't know what it is

3404
02:44:21,632 --> 02:44:22,400
Trying

3405
02:44:23,168 --> 02:44:25,984
We've his narrative that he has built up in the past

3406
02:44:27,008 --> 02:44:33,152
Did turn them on and have some sort of the sexualized

3407
02:44:33,664 --> 02:44:37,760
It's all nonsense but he's trying to make this lie match up with his pre-existing life

3408
02:44:38,016 --> 02:44:43,136
It doesn't work if you watch the videos that doesn't match up at all also he says that they are driving Lamborghinis

3409
02:44:43,392 --> 02:44:44,672
Lady said she wants a Lambo

3410
02:44:44,928 --> 02:44:45,696
There's no indication

3411
02:44:47,232 --> 02:44:50,048
M2k

3412
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:53,120
Real Americans drink Pabst

3413
02:44:53,376 --> 02:44:55,168
I kind of agree with

3414
02:45:12,576 --> 02:45:13,856
I can't stand up

3415
02:45:16,928 --> 02:45:17,696
There even none

3416
02:45:17,952 --> 02:45:22,304
Cool there's still one cool at the end of the show

3417
02:45:22,816 --> 02:45:27,424
He has like I said he does more this go big stuff

3418
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:32,288
It says more b******* about Planned Parenthood so we've gotten all we're going to get out of that

3419
02:45:32,544 --> 02:45:33,568
Then

3420
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:34,592
He has

3421
02:45:36,128 --> 02:45:37,408
Of his twelve-year-old son

3422
02:45:37,664 --> 02:45:40,736
Rex Jones

3423
02:45:40,992 --> 02:45:41,760
He does

3424
02:45:42,016 --> 02:45:43,808
A admirable book report

3425
02:45:45,088 --> 02:45:47,648
I don't want to make fun of him again cuz he's a child

3426
02:45:48,160 --> 02:45:50,208
No it was about

3427
02:45:51,488 --> 02:45:52,000
Ouija

3428
02:45:54,304 --> 02:45:56,864
Look

3429
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:57,632
Because

3430
02:45:59,424 --> 02:46:01,984
I have sympathies for him cuz he doesn't know any better

3431
02:46:03,008 --> 02:46:04,287
I think you did a great job

3432
02:46:04,799 --> 02:46:05,823
For 12 year olds

3433
02:46:06,335 --> 02:46:06,847
Doing a news

3434
02:46:07,871 --> 02:46:09,663
I know people in high school

3435
02:46:10,175 --> 02:46:11,199
Am I broadcast products

3436
02:46:11,455 --> 02:46:13,247
Class that did way worse stories

3437
02:46:15,295 --> 02:46:16,063
Underwear

3438
02:46:16,319 --> 02:46:22,463
But he also had all the Infowars money and team behind him rash

3439
02:46:22,719 --> 02:46:25,023
I'm sure you did

3440
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:26,303
It's his dad forced

3441
02:46:27,583 --> 02:46:30,911
Really really f***** up

3442
02:46:32,959 --> 02:46:34,751
It really really really f***** up

3443
02:46:36,287 --> 02:46:36,799
Does this

3444
02:46:37,311 --> 02:46:37,823
He has

3445
02:46:38,079 --> 02:46:40,383
Exxon

3446
02:46:40,639 --> 02:46:43,199
He's going to be even greater than him in the infowar

3447
02:46:43,711 --> 02:46:46,271
And it's really putting a lot of pressure on a 12 year old

3448
02:46:49,343 --> 02:46:51,391
What what is 12

3449
02:46:51,647 --> 02:46:52,159
Sixth grade

3450
02:46:52,415 --> 02:46:55,487
That's a lot of pressure to know about global

3451
02:46:55,743 --> 02:46:56,255
Yeah well

3452
02:46:56,511 --> 02:47:00,095
If your voice hasn't even changed in your already being Prime to fight the globalists

3453
02:47:00,863 --> 02:47:01,631
You got a big head

3454
02:47:02,911 --> 02:47:03,935
Plays his report

3455
02:47:04,191 --> 02:47:10,335
Before he has him sitting in studio be like you're going to be greater than even me or sharp kid I love

3456
02:47:10,591 --> 02:47:11,103
Love you so much

3457
02:47:11,359 --> 02:47:12,383
Call Tim sweetheart

3458
02:47:12,895 --> 02:47:13,407
Very weird

3459
02:47:13,919 --> 02:47:17,503
Especially considering it now doesn't have custody

3460
02:47:22,879 --> 02:47:23,391
Again

3461
02:47:24,159 --> 02:47:26,207
Whether or not he's a good dad he's a f******

3462
02:47:26,975 --> 02:47:27,999
Before

3463
02:47:28,255 --> 02:47:29,023
Intros

3464
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:29,791
Wreck

3465
02:47:30,303 --> 02:47:31,839
He has him sitting there

3466
02:47:32,095 --> 02:47:33,119
While he doesn't add

3467
02:47:33,375 --> 02:47:39,263
No super male vitality

3468
02:47:39,519 --> 02:47:40,031
I did

3469
02:47:40,287 --> 02:47:42,591
Looking over today

3470
02:47:43,103 --> 02:47:44,127
Selling boner

3471
02:47:49,503 --> 02:47:50,271
Has to do with

3472
02:47:50,527 --> 02:47:51,295
Super vitality

3473
02:47:51,551 --> 02:47:54,879
Is he going to say something like that's how we got you Rex cuz if he does

3474
02:47:56,415 --> 02:48:00,511
I don't think I would have cut out I think I would be like

3475
02:48:00,767 --> 02:48:03,327
Know this

3476
02:48:03,583 --> 02:48:05,375
We might be the most

3477
02:48:05,631 --> 02:48:07,679
Progressive Alex Jones has ever been

3478
02:48:07,935 --> 02:48:08,447
Which

3479
02:48:08,703 --> 02:48:09,471
Is really just

3480
02:48:09,727 --> 02:48:10,239
Spell product

3481
02:48:10,495 --> 02:48:12,287
Give me a little news flash

3482
02:48:16,895 --> 02:48:18,943
Frisky goat weed has different name

3483
02:48:36,095 --> 02:48:38,399
But Brooks

3484
02:48:42,495 --> 02:48:44,287
Alex Jones

3485
02:48:44,799 --> 02:48:45,823
Welcome to the party

3486
02:48:54,271 --> 02:48:55,295
That's like

3487
02:48:56,575 --> 02:49:02,719
Male or female

3488
02:49:03,231 --> 02:49:09,375
Maybe maybe he could

3489
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:11,167
Instead let them choose what they want

3490
02:49:11,679 --> 02:49:14,239
Courtney herb

3491
02:49:14,751 --> 02:49:20,639
Horny goat weed supplements

3492
02:49:20,895 --> 02:49:24,991
Horny goat weed sold

3493
02:49:26,271 --> 02:49:28,575
It'll get you going that's why they call it horny goat weed

3494
02:49:28,831 --> 02:49:33,951
Then I guess so the end of our

3495
02:49:34,207 --> 02:49:35,743
Investigation

3496
02:49:35,999 --> 02:49:39,583
Of what happened so far we see little evolution

3497
02:49:39,839 --> 02:49:40,863
In his

3498
02:49:42,655 --> 02:49:44,447
Except

3499
02:49:45,471 --> 02:49:49,567
Hidalgo event and maybe someone told him to stop talking about his mob ties

3500
02:49:49,823 --> 02:49:53,407
I didn't speculate

3501
02:49:53,663 --> 02:49:56,223
The stuff that he was saying about Trump before this was

3502
02:49:57,247 --> 02:49:58,271
Basically vague

3503
02:49:58,783 --> 02:50:00,063
Accusations of crimes

3504
02:50:00,319 --> 02:50:03,135
You got to stop

3505
02:50:04,415 --> 02:50:09,023
Not necessarily in nefarious

3506
02:50:10,047 --> 02:50:11,839
Yeah

3507
02:50:13,375 --> 02:50:14,399
That

3508
02:50:21,311 --> 02:50:22,847
Who touched them and was like hey you got a

3509
02:50:23,103 --> 02:50:24,127
No, down on that

3510
02:50:28,479 --> 02:50:32,319
Species still says he doesn't trust him and thinks he's going to betray everyone

3511
02:50:32,575 --> 02:50:35,647
So there's no Evolution for the rest of the time

3512
02:50:38,207 --> 02:50:39,231
Jumpin Fun

3513
02:50:47,679 --> 02:50:50,751
Propaganda about Planned Parenthood

3514
02:50:51,007 --> 02:50:52,543
Abortion protesters

3515
02:50:53,055 --> 02:50:53,823
He literally

3516
02:50:54,335 --> 02:50:55,103
And not

3517
02:50:55,359 --> 02:50:57,407
Not in a figurative way like

3518
02:50:57,663 --> 02:50:58,687
Describe like Hillary Clinton

3519
02:50:59,199 --> 02:50:59,967
The demon

3520
02:51:00,991 --> 02:51:03,039
Smells like sulfur as a way of

3521
02:51:03,295 --> 02:51:03,807
Scribing

3522
02:51:04,063 --> 02:51:06,111
You know all of this

3523
02:51:06,367 --> 02:51:07,647
He's literally say

3524
02:51:08,159 --> 02:51:09,951
It is something inter-dimensional

3525
02:51:10,207 --> 02:51:11,999
And that

3526
02:51:12,255 --> 02:51:13,791
Protest

3527
02:51:14,047 --> 02:51:14,559
F******

3528
02:51:14,815 --> 02:51:15,327
Appear out

3529
02:51:15,583 --> 02:51:16,095
What is the grout

3530
02:51:16,351 --> 02:51:17,631
And if you confront them

3531
02:51:17,887 --> 02:51:18,399
They will

3532
02:51:18,655 --> 02:51:20,191
Underground

3533
02:51:20,447 --> 02:51:21,215
You staying we are lead

3534
02:51:22,751 --> 02:51:23,775
And he they are legion

3535
02:51:25,823 --> 02:51:27,103
Yeah make them throw up

3536
02:51:33,759 --> 02:51:35,807
Spell terrible

3537
02:51:36,063 --> 02:51:36,831
Is really bad

3538
02:51:39,391 --> 02:51:40,927
It's one of the few times

3539
02:51:41,183 --> 02:51:47,327
That I've been listening to the show and I legitimately like blurt last

3540
02:51:49,631 --> 02:51:52,703
C'mon man you sense memory you something

3541
02:51:55,263 --> 02:51:58,847
So if you'd like you can find us

3542
02:51:59,103 --> 02:51:59,615
Internet

3543
02:51:59,871 --> 02:52:03,711
At now it's right.com with another

3544
02:52:03,967 --> 02:52:05,247
Installment of this investigation

3545
02:52:05,503 --> 02:52:07,551
Picks up we are getting close to August

3546
02:52:07,807 --> 02:52:10,623
Where the first debate happen

3547
02:52:10,879 --> 02:52:14,207
Rodger stone is not shown up yet

3548
02:52:14,463 --> 02:52:15,743
I actually want to make this clear

3549
02:52:15,999 --> 02:52:18,047
What I remembered

3550
02:52:18,559 --> 02:52:20,351
That on our last episode

3551
02:52:21,119 --> 02:52:24,191
A little bit

3552
02:52:26,751 --> 02:52:28,031
Let me see if I can find the best way

3553
02:52:31,103 --> 02:52:33,919
Alex needs to be lied to in order to get on board with

3554
02:52:34,175 --> 02:52:35,199
Whole Hog

3555
02:52:35,455 --> 02:52:37,759
Because of the things he knows about him and the lack of trust

3556
02:52:38,015 --> 02:52:40,063
Sprat he knows about these connect

3557
02:52:41,855 --> 02:52:43,391
He knows about Russia connections

3558
02:52:43,903 --> 02:52:44,415
X y and z

3559
02:52:45,183 --> 02:52:46,207
So in order for him

3560
02:52:46,463 --> 02:52:49,791
Get on board what we said is he needs another

3561
02:52:50,047 --> 02:52:53,375
Compelling thing which we speculated would be

3562
02:52:54,655 --> 02:52:55,167
I

3563
02:52:55,423 --> 02:52:56,959
Regret that I didn't point out

3564
02:52:57,983 --> 02:52:58,495
Steve pieczenik

3565
02:52:58,751 --> 02:52:59,263

In the whole car

3567
02:53:00,799 --> 02:53:02,591
Steve pieczenik is there to give the

3568
02:53:02,847 --> 02:53:04,383
Russia didn't hack this stuff

3569
02:53:04,895 --> 02:53:05,663
It was Patriots

3570
02:53:05,919 --> 02:53:06,431
Within our government

3571
02:53:06,943 --> 02:53:10,271
Okay so Steve pieczenik is there functionally as the cover

3572
02:53:11,551 --> 02:53:13,087

02:53:19,231 --> 02:53:21,023
Everything seems everything

3577
02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:23,839
It could be nefarious but it could also just be bigot

02:53:26,655 --> 02:53:27,935

3581
02:53:32,031 --> 02:53:35,103
It's such a wild coincidence that all these people would

02:53:35,359 --> 02:53:37,919
Change their mind in exactly the same way it reacts the same

3583
02:53:41,247 --> 02:53:43,039

3596
02:54:18,879 --> 02:54:21,183
Sports magic that I give up

3597
02:54:25,535 --> 02:54:26,047
