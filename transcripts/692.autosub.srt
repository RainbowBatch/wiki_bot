1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Jordan swetik

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

6
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:08,608
Around worship at the altar of Celine and talk a little bit about to Alex Garden

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,936
Alex Jones

8
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,496
Is that how it sounds

9
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,104
So what's up

10
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,432
What what how did we free damn

11
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:25,248
Jordan Jordan what's up

12
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:31,648
What's bright spot today buddy

13
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:37,536
Brightspot it's brutal this is the least most anti-climactic Brightspot

14
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,864
So I decided to give

15
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,888
Fire Emblem

16
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,680
Three houses attract off

17
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:49,568
Tactical type game like that style of the game is different than any

18
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
Eye of the

19
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,640
The things I've messed around with in the past

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,480
I took like it's like a moth to the flame

21
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:03,392
It's a very fun super structured in the characters in the story

22
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,464
Is a lot of fun as well and I meant it

23
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
It's great

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,864
I heard there's a Dynasty Warriors version of it coming out later this month I'm so excited about that

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,728
Zombie playing at the new came over to record heading minute

26
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:23,360
10 minutes to have this game forever because

27
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,152
Scratch that itch

28
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,688
Final Fantasy Tactics

29
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
Was

30
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,784
And I was I was telling you that it's been going on for 20 years

31
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,904
And that's not a joke a few months ago whenever I talked about it on the shelves like s***

32
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,024
Play that for a while when you talked about it on the show I didn't even put two and two together

33
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,912
My response that was I've never played a game like I don't even know how to imagine

34
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:53,312
And now you do I do a lot of fun and now you're going to see yourself here in 25 years being like

35
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:59,712
Fire Emblem is like 100% legal CD image that I found

36
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,904
Final Fantasy Tactics

37
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
This is

38
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,696
So much

39
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,000
That it's so good

40
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,280
It's so good

41
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
It's a quite a well-done

42
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,656
My experience

43
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,728
I am going to get the right Tea Party

44
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,264
I was going to get a perfect

45
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,360
Score on one of the Tea Party

46
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:32,736
One of the things that you have to do or candidate

47
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:39,136
And you have three speech bubbles and you have to choose topics for conversation that you think they

48
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:44,768
Might enjoy bad personality

49
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,352
A real person

50
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:54,752
But yeah it's a lot of fun times

51
00:03:55,008 --> 00:04:01,152
It's been a long time. I think we've had same bright spots but at different times you don't like when I said Taskmaster was privately

52
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,944
Later on you know that kind of thing but this

53
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480
This is a simultaneous

54
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,040
Unequivocal Breitbart

55
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
Yep

56
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:14,208
Jordan today we have to do it Wednesday so we're off the beaten path a little bit

57
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,280
I feel like the Uvalde

58
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,839
Shooting coverage kind of came full circle

59
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,655
And we got to where we inevitably knew we were going yeah

60
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,959
And the January 6th

61
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
Commission coverage

62
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,007
Hayes hit

63
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
A dead end

64
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:32,639
Inasmuch as Alex is still out of Studio

65
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,991
He's had to fill in Harrison filled in the other day

66
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:43,391
Anderson was like as not yet unfortunately I don't know anybody

67
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,743
How do you do a dare suggest that we celebrated event

68
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,815
Yeah good got to run cover for you

69
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:55,423
And so we're left a bitten alerts of of of

70
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:59,519
What to do over I dipped in the past a little bit I need a little more time

71
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
To get the next class episode

72
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,359
Together so that that'll be forthcoming

73
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
Jim Bakker sucks

74
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:09,759
Nothing really new in Project Camelot world and we just went back there not too long ago

75
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:14,879
So I have to find something to do and something popped up and we'll get into it here in a moment

76
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,927

But this is going to be a little bit of a off-the-beaten-path

115
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
The best

116
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:18,271
Thing ever it might not be it it's not as fun as

117
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,183

Call Jonah.

130
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607

Alright

139
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:34,559
Now we're having a good time we're going to be looking at

140
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
Alex talking to Mike Tyson

141
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:46,079
God you know after the last three episodes ended with such a

142
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,359
Narrative closure

143
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,663
Almost you know like it's almost like a novel

144
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,943
You know you see this

145
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
Struggle

146
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,247
You see the hero's journey

147
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:58,367
Call Campbell

148
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:02,719
Hero's journey villains dirty

149
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
I bet

150
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,839
Ever to have it just kind of energy now you're in that same Lurch when you finish a good book

151
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,375
You know and you just kind of like

Do pick up like a magazine

Few months back I believe back in April was when

158
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:36,511
Mysteriously the episode has not appeared to have been released interesting

159
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:42,911
You can go to the podcast website there's a long list of episodes with gas like Alex's mortal enemy Piers Morgan

00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,359
Tyson has had on like anti-vax do Robert Kennedy Jr

186
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,151
He was on fairly recently

187
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,991
A self-appointed ambassador to North Korea Dennis Rodman

188
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
Well I mean

189
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,783
You know somebody

190
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
Got2go the worm

191
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
So on June 1st

192
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:10,207
Paul Joseph Watson Road in article for his blog about how the powers-that-be in big

193
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,791
I could put pressure on Mike Tyson and got him to not release the episode

194
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,447
Sounds about right as we all know Mike Tyson is notoriously a pushover and how many caves even the slightest them

195
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,519
Model pressure described him as a fighter

196
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,639
We're in the middle of his

197
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
Very last

198
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
You know

199
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:34,271
Comeback story you know Tyson's got one more fight in them

200
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:40,159
He's one day away from retirement and his best friend comes out to like you know manager him in the corner

201
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,535
I mean this movie ends with him dying obviously but that's it mean podcast form

202
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:50,399
Actually talk a whole lot about him dying

203
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,423
Good morning

204
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,775
He is not hitting have any feelings on a helmet on the question

205
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,079
It's a very bizarre

206
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,919
So I've seen a lot of these podcast we're bigger celebrities have Alex on

207
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,455
Mike Rogan or Logan Paul

208
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
A complete shitshow

209
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
Invariably gets

210
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:12,671
Wheatley wasted pretends he has some really deep insights to offer never says anything of substance

211
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,207
Heaven sometimes takes his shirt off

212
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:19,071
It's been reported by Alex that he and Tyson took mushrooms and smoke weed

213
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:24,447
Before and during the podcast so I've concocted a little theory of my own about why this episode has

214
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
Them come out

215
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,799
I really think it's probably really bad

216
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:34,175
Not like dangerous an offensive bad but like embarrassing and low-quality type of bad

217
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,759
Leaving all the other qualities of the man aside Mike Tyson

218
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
Can handle his drugs

219
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:44,671
He's pretty much high as hell all the time now and I would not be surprised if the way alok

220
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
What's active between is being

221
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
Bucked up

222
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,047
To his very transparent and over-the-top strfkr E

223
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:54,143
Made it feel like maybe they didn't want to put this out episode out to the public

224
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,679
Probably might be

225
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,727
I guess man

226
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:04,127
I don't know I would do mushrooms with Mike Tyson and put it out no matter what anybody said I would not

227
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:10,527
Not do either of those things I would do mushrooms with Mike Tyson and I wouldn't put it out

228
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Are those things either

229
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:16,671
I'm not going to pretend that I watch the full episode of Tyson's podcast but I skipped through a few of them and there

230
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
Really different

231
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,999
I've been the short clips that Alex's released

232
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,279
Of his time with Mike

233
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,375
One thing is that the guests are generally big stars themselves

234
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,191
Express admiration for Tyson in his career

235
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,983
They are tripping all over themselves

236
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
What's around him

237
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:37,151
I don't want to so over-the-top and it comes off as being very insecure and out of place

238
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
I think

239
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:44,319
If you even just watch these short clips of it they come out come out they're so different

240
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
Sand Lake

241
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,647
Mike Tyson talking to Piers Morgan

242
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,975
Has Piers Morgan is ostensibly

243
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:57,375
Considering himself to be Mike Tyson's equal in this conversation conversation about there

244
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,983
Careers share and like Mike Tyson's asking him questions about journalism right often like

245
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,007
Yeah it's

246
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
I am in an opportunity

247
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,127
44 like an actual conversation

248
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
To happen

249
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,431
I'll be at between

250
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
Piers Morgan in Mike Tyson

251
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,015
Bizarre collection I mean just

252
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
Fine yeah yeah

253
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:20,415
The other thing is that a number of these guests don't try to do drugs or drug with Mike

254
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,231
Princeton Piers Morgan wasn't taking shrooms

255
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:30,143
Remember thing we've heard about Alex's interview he tried to keep up to like show he was cool

256
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,935
Which is really stupid wow

257
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:36,287
That's what high school kids do when they're older siblings friends and it

258
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:41,407
To go wrong I mean that's though he's a freshman in college what are you doing

259
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,479
You wouldn't you do it yourself killed

260
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
Mike Tyson

261
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:53,439
Did the toad has two weeks got so much head trauma there's so much s*** going on yeah

262
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:59,071
I don't know exactly why Tyson doesn't put out this episode of the podcast

263
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,983
Maybe it'll come out sometime down the line and like this whole pretending Alex is being censored thing is just a really useful marketing scratch

264
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
Entirely possible

265
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,871
Like one way to build up anticipation for the release of something

266
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,919
To tell people they can't see that thing

267
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,479
Exploit our desire to have things were denied access

268
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,063
Release the Snyder cut of this podcast

269
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,135
I think that's a possibility and it's more

270
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,159
Likely Vitale

271
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,695
F***** up and embarrassed

272
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:32,607
Whatever the case earlier this month Alex released a half hour video on video which is titled exclusive

273
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,727
The censored Mike Tyson Alex Jones podcast info

274
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:44,127
Alex recorded the interview himself and he was releasing his side of it

275
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,919
But that's not what this video is

276
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,735
It's because almost everything it in fours involves

277
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
Clickbait

278
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:54,879
This video was an interview that Alex shot with Tyson after they did Tyson podcast

279
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,951
Behind-the-scenes stuff

280
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:02,303
From Tyson's podcast actually kind of implies that Alex does have more video

281
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
Then just

282
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,863
This little snippet

283
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:10,495
I pay some of my hunches about Alex's Behavior being embarrassing in a mess based on these

284
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,031
Space on the eclipse of him

285
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,103
Very shortly and embarrassing Mass

286
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:21,503
I want to take a little break E from the horrors of the present-day might because Alex seems to come back to work

287
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
We're going to check in

288
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,087
And see how this interview with Iron Mike Tyson

289
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,391
Let's do it

290
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
This is done it's done

291
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
Right after

292
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,487
It's not like

293
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
They just

294
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:36,351
And then like five minutes later

295
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,471
I think it's pretty briefly afterwards no s***

296
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,031
Yeah okay but actually kind of

297
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,567
Makes me think that

298
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
If they did shrooms it wasn't

299
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
March

300
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,943
Like I know that rooms are going to make you

301
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,735
Freak out necessarily or

302
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
But

303
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,319
I don't really see

304
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
That much

305
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,159
Mike f***** up at Miss going on for Malik

306
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:04,511
Gotcha like I think he's holding it together fairly well

307
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,303
Babies on the Comedown

308
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,351
Could be

309
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
Yeah I think

310
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,703
He's really f***** up on

311
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
The clipse

312
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,751
They have of

313
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Mike show

314
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,359
Which leads me to believe yeah maybe there was a longer gapless

315
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
Remember

316
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:24,735
Or Alex's faking all that s*** when he's acting all f***** up

317
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:31,135
Cuz he thinks it makes him more interesting one of the two he was smoking oregano kind of situation

318
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,695
Or it could be he wouldn't have shot

319
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,743
Long f****** shower

320
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
Yeah yeah

321
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:48,543
I know that sometimes cocaine can leveling out

322
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
One way or the other

323
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:55,455
So here's where we begin begin is Alex doing a little bit of an introduction

324
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,551
He's sitting there looking at the camera at Infowars Studios

325
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,087
And here's what he's got are at

326
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
A month-and-a-half ago

327
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
Mike Tyson

328
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,839
Then I saw his evolution

329
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
Variant

330
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
Fob remote

331
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
I've learned a lot

332
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
California

333
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,823
Podcast

334
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
It was incredible

335
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
He said Madison

336
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,199
The best interviews ever I got

337
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
Past

338
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,599
Last week

339
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
On FaceTime

340
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
He said Hayward

341
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
Going to call

342
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,279
Troy's Greg ice

343
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,911
We have a contract

344
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
Put pressure on them

345
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,127
Absolutely

346
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,407
Sure

347
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
Censorship

348
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,223
There's a conspiracy

349
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
As always

350
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
Sure some some big

351
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,599
YouTube exact was like

352
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,623
What's that

353
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,903
On Mike Tyson

354
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:18,655
Where will allow Robert Kennedy Jr. Come on in.

355
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:26,335
If if any of that is to be believed it's just addictive how toxic out

356
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:33,503
Amenable to advertisers that be king of anti-vaccination

357
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,551
More people more late

358
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,575
People know who Alex

359
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,671
Alex Jones

360
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975
So I don't

361
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,279
What are the things that I think I would really like to

362
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
The Press Alex

363
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,607
Specifically

364
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,631
What has Mike

365
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
Tyson talk

366
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
Thought you would like to know the

367
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:55,519
Give me specific

368
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:01,919
Yeah I did something about perseverance I was willing to let that one slide it hit my ears uncomfort

369
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:08,319
I was like you know what you probably could learn something from Mike Tyson I feel like maybe I'm being a little bit discount

370
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,879
Maybe I'm curious what they are

371
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,903
That is a good question

372
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,487
Life lessons

373
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,791
Yeah I don't I think Alex is all the s***

374
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,607
Actually I bet Mike Tyson was likely

375
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:22,911
Check your bag

376
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,751
Don't take a carry-on they think you you think it's going to be smart

377
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,823
So here is the Alex

378
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,847
Setting this up

379
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Really

380
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:34,943
Stand up again

381
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Really really die

382
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
Call America

383
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,599
Look it's one thing of Alex Jones

384
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
The interview

385
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
Powerful

386
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,767
Loving it

387
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
Really incredible

388
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
And we also took

389
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
Is Wile

390
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,447
Cure

391
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
With excerpts

392
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,519
You only find it right here

393
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,055
Video

394
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
So here it is

395
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
I think

396
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,895
I think

397
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,455
Actually from the context that will get of a clip

398
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,247
From Tyson's interview

399
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
I think

400
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,343
That maybe they took like a small amount of mushrooms

401
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
Before the show

402
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,208
And then Mike Tyson has a brand of edibles

403
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,536
That he refers to as like shroomies

404
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
Buckeye

405
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,400
Yeah might have thought

406
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,936
That was approved

407
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,752
Then he took on air when it was actually just a

408
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
I really don't think you're allowed to

409
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
Take shrooms on air

410
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:39,712
I don't know what the laws are now

411
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,736
That is a good point

412
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:46,880
So I don't have a whole lot to go off of but I would guess from all the available contact that this was not a powerful interview

413
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,440
I will see you in the interview that Alex release

414
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
Between Heaven Mike

415
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,048
The two of them approximately 0 chemistry and most of the top

416
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
Looks like Alvarado

417
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,912
Also I don't think it's actually censorship at all

418
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,984
If what Alex is saying is accurate then what happened is that at

419
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,336
Company decided that releasing this episode would have a negative impact on Advertising

420
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,872
So they didn't put it out

421
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,432
I don't think that's necessarily a good thing but it

422
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,224
It's not what Alex wants to make it out

423
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:18,880
Mike and his team decided that the easiest way to make this thing work was to sell Mike celebrity to a bigger company

424
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,928
Who would then on the podcast and Michael

425
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,232
This team would be paid by that company

426
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,536
The money becomes a news from advertise

427
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,096
Which is handled entirely by the company that owns

428
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
Podcast

429
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:35,008
And if they understand that having a friendly interview with Alex where the host does hallucinogens with him

430
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,336
While the Sandy Hook trial was set to be taking place

431
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,104
Cuz they recorded

432
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,176
You might end up getting some pushback

433
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,992
From your advertisement

434
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,296
And these companies that own podcast

435
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,576
Don't just sell ads

436
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,856
Podcast by podcast

437
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,392
They have a ton of shows

438
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,672
It sponsors by bulk

439
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
Add time on

440
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:59,584
Yeah this is one of the reasons that Spotify was so Keen to get Rogan on an exclusive deal and pay him so much

441
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:03,680
Having him there exclusively on their platform was theoretically going to provide

442
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
Great boost

443
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,472
Do what they could charge

444
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,080
If Ison has Alex on and they do drugs and pal around talking

445
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:14,432
While simultaneously The Grieving parents of murdered children are facing Alex

446
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:19,296
You can easily see how some companies would not want their ads to be on that show

447
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:25,440
Mike's podcast is owned by a company called multimedia and without being rude to the other shows on that Network

448
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:30,304
I don't think that advertisers are banging down the door specifically to buy there at

449
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:35,168
It's very reasonable to assume the Tyson is a large part of their ability to sell add package

450
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,704
Just for this podcast Network

451
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,496
So someone pulled out of his show they

452
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,032
Probably wouldn't stick around for the

453
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,312
The other shows on the network

454
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:46,432
People decide what their priorities are in life and their careers and then their choices reflect that

455
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:53,088
In this case Tyson's team sacrificed creative control and ownership with their own podcast in order to have someone else bigger

456
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
How to make money off their show

457
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:58,976
You can call that censorship if you want but it's really just the downside of the arrangement

458
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,536
Tyson is chosen because it's preferable for him

459
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
Yeah

460
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:08,704
Do you know remember when podcasts were a new exciting medium and then they were like what if we turned it into the old one

461
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,544
It's one of the reasons why we have very Big Ben

462
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,408
Consistent very much to never even liked open emails or Flopper enough ads

463
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,944
Like no there's not

464
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,992
It's not something we're interested in because

465
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:21,760
That does

466
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
Open the door

467
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,856
Like if you're on a network

468
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,136
But all that works

469
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
Run different

470
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,440
Obviously have

471
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,488
More of this and some have less.

472
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:35,072
Open up the possibility that they can say like we own your content

473
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,120
Yep because they generally do

474
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,912
That's part of why they buy you

475
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:45,312
Yeah do you make a bit of money on these but also ultimately at the end of the day if they say no then

476
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,848
You can't just

477
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,640
Put something out yourself

478
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:54,784
Yeah your phone your show it's going to be funny whenever like everything collapses and all of these

479
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,624
Cast networks can't afford all of their fun Studios and all that stuff

480
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
And we're going

481
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,184
Going to be like looking at people from

482
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,464
The same exact place

483
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
Smell like beef

484
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
Workout for us

485
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:08,096
And we'll never reach the heights of

486
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,632
Some of these things

487
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,424
We'll also

488
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:17,568
You know I made it the bottom falls out of podcasting and ever has to record in their home that's what we've been doing all along.

489
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:23,968
So we are prepared pretty much never does the prediction I have you'll never see Alex popping up

490
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,016
Up on the show that has to worry about Advertiser

491
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:30,368
Except for shows that rely on couch courting negative attention

492
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
In order to

493
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
To stay relevant

494
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:36,256
Those types of shows will have Alex on because their advertising model is

495
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,048
They have outraged bait

496
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,328
Gets them attention

497
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,888
And feed some sort of people

498
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,936
Talking negatively and then people fight

499
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,240
And that gives them more attention and higher rating

500
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,056
Alex is perfect as a guest for something like that

501
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,360
But other places that have different advertising bottle

502
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
Central ion

503
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,152
People not being like

504
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,432
Pissed off at them right

505
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,736
I generally don't never ever see him

506
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,528
It's hard to

507
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,320
It's hard to justify that

508
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,344
It is because

509
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:06,464
If you're one of the if you want to that like a the Red Scare or whatever one of those podcast

510
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
You know it's like

511
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
F*** it

512
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,304
The people who advertise with us

513
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,096
Are already playing with fire

514
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:15,936
Like they're already choosing to be on the edge of Decorah

515
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:20,544
So I don't know if over that it's not that big but don't know if folks like

516
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,824
Sam Tripoli you know that

517
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,848
Contempt

518
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,872
But Alex has been on

519
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:30,528
I don't know if he has ads I would assume he does probably

520
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,808
You're already on that edge

521
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,856
You know if your

522
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
If you're shows

523
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,160
Yeah Target

524
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:40,000
It doesn't want Alex on their f****** word you know like yeah okay I get it

525
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,560
Meundies

526
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,096
Has a problem with Alex

527
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,424
So anyway the interview start

528
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,984
Let's hear and you'll notice a sound effect

529
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,776
This was not added in po

530
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
The Relic

531
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480
Music

532
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,504
Listen music

533
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,464
What you doing Mom

534
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,232
The family show

535
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,352
Thank you very much sir

536
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,144
What year show

537
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,472
Are you hiding something

538
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
Bad news

539
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,056
I'm good

540
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
Jessica

541
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
See it

542
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:33,248
I think we all want to believe that were good judges of character but that can't be true for everyone know

543
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,272
I don't know Mike

544
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,064
Personally so it's hard to say but

545
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
You did work with Don King

546
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,624
Alex's

547
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,024
It's cool so my money is on his radar not being brave

548
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,120
Get a good judge of character they imagine that North Korea is pretty stoked

549
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
About that

550
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,216
Also two mics

551
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,824
If you want a better sense of what sort of trash you puts out

552
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,408
Please try to watch his show a little bit

553
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,480
You can lie to you and give you the impression that he's a good guy

554
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,016
I'm at the game

555
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,832
It is it is funny is he hiding something

556
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
No

557
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,648
He's broadcasting getting public

558
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:17,024
Look for everyone to see he's hiding something from you in person because

559
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048
Like

560
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
That's the image

561
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,608
Of the person that you wants to be

562
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,264
Eddie knows that most of these folks like to listen to Infowars

563
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,056
I bet this guy's a good guy now

564
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:35,456
Absolutely not he's just not going to go to info and most people get so goddamn bored listening to his show

565
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,504
Especially if you have things to do

566
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,088
If I have anything else to do

567
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,672
I would never be able to make it through an episode of his show

568
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:49,792
Also you notice of Michael lights up a joint immediately and you get the sense that Alex's

569
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,328
Really wanting him to pass it

570
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,120
Yeah

571
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,752
Yeah I'll tell you what lesson I didn't learn from Mike Tyson

572
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,520
Alright

573
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
Bogarting the joint

574
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,128
Puff puff pass

575
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
Just a little ironic

576
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,688
I thought I was coming

577
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,648
What

578
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,096
Here we are Mike

579
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,680
Seems like you're in your Prime right now

580
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:39,712
Seems like he's a good shape I also like it's just funny for him to have a coughing fit the joint

581
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,504
You're in the best shape of your life by

582
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,064
There's just a

583
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,464
The position that it's under a minute is great but listen to you now

584
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,840
Look at the lines on you you pulled on that joint for an hour man that's amazing

585
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,376
Yeah

586
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,424
I mean the the joint

587
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,448
Obviously a man

588
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:04,032
Rihanna whatever possible mushrooms they've taken

589
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,568
Pretty heady conversation

590
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,848
Spring deep stuff

591
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,920
What about Mike Tyson his energy

592
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,200
So positive

593
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:14,016
He's so happy with any Shea amazing things always true

594
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,320
What podcast

595
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
A

596
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:26,816
Before I forgot to it are there aliens you already bringing up we are the aliens

597
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,376
Yeah I think so I think so I think

598
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,472
Are you phylis I think I teaches a Time

599
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:38,080
And the more we dig the deeper would become and then the Movie 5

600
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,360
You know the movie Deep

601
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,896
The Moby Dick movie

602
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664
We find out about

603
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,480
Define. Maybe

604
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
Maybe like

605
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,296
Starting up

606
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
Turkey

607
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,624
My dog music other than Africa

608
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,648
We have the city

609
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,696
I'm sorry what what just happened

610
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,768
But how does that debate with Africa being the Civil War

611
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,472
Yesterday

612
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,520
Histories are lies that we agreed

613
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,800
True

614
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,824
Wow

615
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:19,552
The deeper we dig the more we learn about ourselves literally about archaeology

616
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:23,904
Yes we found a city in Turkey

617
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,184
He's literally saying

618
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,560
That if you dig deep into the Earth you're going to find old right I think it's not metaphorical

619
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:33,120
But also like definitely predates 7000

620
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,168
Even so

621
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,472
My custom information wrong here

622
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,616
So this is about a city that was discovered underground beneath derinkuyu in Turkey

623
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,664
Which was actually was rediscovered in the night

624
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,688
60 check

625
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:51,296
The complex of underground tunnels under the capadocia region

626
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,832
Present-day turkey

627
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,392
Which tries to be part of like a refugee

628
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,928
Plan where people could hide out from

629
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,952
Invading Army

630
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,280
These totals in cities are not 9 thousand years old

631
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,328
They're actually closer to 2,000

632
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
A old

633
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,144
In 2020 another complex

634
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,936
Who found under the city of Midian.

635
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,008
And it's believed that this was a place were persecuted Christians

636
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:14,080
We're able to hide in the 2nd and 3rd centuries

637
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,408
This is about as good as this interview is going to get

638
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:22,016
That's complete nonsense being thrown around the tips into the Supernatural and paranormal

639
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:26,368
Because Alex is so desperate for celebrities to like if he just agrees to anything tight

640
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:30,208
I agree medialized

641
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,744
Does history lie

642
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,816
I don't know if there's ever been a series of

643
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,864
Words that is made me just go like

644
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,632
Oh goodbye

645
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:41,472
Actually an interesting thought

646
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:46,848
Inasmuch as like history absolutely does lie at every historian knows that

647
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,640
The study of history

648
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,408
Does ink

649
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,712
Include the understanding of bias

650
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,784
Ants in in at least as it relates to

651
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,064
To like sources

652
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
But you can have

653
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:00,672
That's one of the reasons why it's a fairly complicated field of study

654
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,208
And you want to have

655
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:02,976
Contacts

656
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,792
You'll have multiple angles on a vent

657
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,816
Some things like that

658
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,400
Yeah I bet I mean inasmuch as

659
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,704
Alex's is discussing his

660
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,728
Actually

661
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:17,312
There's some truth

662
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:23,456
He just wants to say that the things that you're taught are true in order to denigrate and degrade the idea of an objective

663
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,224
Reality

664
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:29,344
That's why I don't want to listen to

665
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,184
He himself has an agenda of defeat

666
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,768
Credibly read anything about history and be like

667
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,072
I bet that guy nailed it 100%

668
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,680
Just not true I think every everybody who's serious about

669
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,704
Starting history with

670
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,104
Give you a qualified version of history is full of lies or whatever

671
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,640
In the present let alone

672
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,944
Stuff that happened several thousand years ago

673
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,344
Almost feels like several thousand years ago might be easier easier right at least it can't happen anymore it's already

674
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,136
Exactly

675
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:07,744
So we can do some philosophical talk here this is heavy

676
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,024
Show in

677
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,792
Nnn

678
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,608
Can your years on Earth what do you think the ultimate secret is

679
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,656
Start

680
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,472
I want to see notes while you were speaking

681
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,496
Earlier but

682
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,544
That being born is dying

683
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,224
Cuz once you die once your boy in the process begin

684
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,808
We Can't Stop from dying and it's so beautiful cuz if that's

685
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,600
The Kongos on in the process

686
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,624
The Bangles

687
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,416
So many Beautiful Moments

688
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,232
Lyndon Diner becomes

689
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,792
99

690
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,120
Like you're sit with Mike Tyson and sharing his tobacco with

691
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
That is a man

692
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:55,360
That was Alex's way of trying to give it to him

693
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,384
You smoke it

694
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,248
In front of me had obviously I can't have this conversation unless I'm getting higher.

695
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,296
Ridiculous is awful

696
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:09,952
I don't understand this is an annoying conversation at a house party

697
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,976
Alex Jones

698
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,328
Why am I why would I leave parties

699
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,448
I went to college

700
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,568
Actually I've been sort of Alex's position here which is somebody saying this kind of stuff

701
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:29,920
Alright whatever but they have the weed

702
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,272
I agree with you put up with

703
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:37,344
Bizarre esoteric brightness

704
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,184
Like what like when your weed dealer would would come over

705
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,720
Images

706
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:46,816
And then be like are you going to pass it and you're like no I just bought this from you

707
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:53,472
Yeah but come on man so Alex

708
00:35:54,496 --> 00:36:00,640
I think Mike wants to ground this conversation and some kind of like reality

709
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,712
Personal Alex wants to think global

710
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480
Okay

711
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,528
Married

712
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,296
I am

713
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,344
Cumming Georgia family

714
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,672
You worry about your kids

715
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,024
What's your view

716
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,632
What's currently happening with

717
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,912
Directions to choices

718
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:30,592
YouTube have no chemistry

719
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,920
I I just can't imagine like f******

720
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,224
Edward Murrow

721
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,248
Getting f******

722
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,528
Blasted

723
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,832
Hi what's up with Equifax

724
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:45,184
Ginsberg right before they did it interview and then he's like Alright

725
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,976
What's your feelings on

726
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
Vietnam

727
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,424
Also noted geopolitical scholar Mike Tyson do you think about what's going

728
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,776
My god with Russia

729
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:06,432
I wasn't comparing him to Ginsberg as much as just who it would be super productive to ask the question to

730
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,736
Probably not Mike Tyson

731
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,040
Guy who was known

732
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:11,808
4

733
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,576
Fighting

734
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,136
Prison for rape

735
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:18,208
And then now is kind of

736
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:24,608
A drug weirdo TV series

737
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
That's true yeah

738
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,168
So he's had a big career

739
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,448
Yep

740
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,776
I wonder what

741
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,080
Stoned out of his mind Mike Tyson

742
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:38,432
Some things about Russia

743
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
The conversation

744
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:46,368
Mike brings up is actually interesting one what are your feelings about like the world that we live in

745
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:50,976
Family

746
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:55,840
Mike would offer something else that get his feelings on the matter but its family

747
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,144
That's kind of a human conversation

748
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,520
List of a given taken more of just a f******

749
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,824
I will give you this answer

750
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,872
I want to know what you think about poop

751
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:08,896
TubeMate

752
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,176
Why wouldn't she

753
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,272
Yeah so yeah

754
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,344
We are thinking like oh we got to get to business

755
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,368
Yes

756
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,696
Well might be a matter of like Emily having a

757
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,720
Very short time

758
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:26,560
But Michael put up with this I have other things I need to do

759
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,888
Like record voice over for the cartoon

760
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,216
Alex actually does want to know about

761
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,544
Mike has a weird take all right

762
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,592
How does Mike Tyson

763
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,408
Almost in the

764
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,432
Korean War

765
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,736
60 years at Ocala has ended

766
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,576
Go there maybe broker preschool

767
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,600
Zelensky in

768
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,184
Imma look at

769
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,208
Like this

770
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,840
If compellent steelhawk any grab

771
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,912
It's not opinion this one that says

772
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:06,496
Robin grab the bird and I can stop them from killing that

773
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,800
I stopped him from killing a

774
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,592
Should baby died

775
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,128
So who am I

776
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,920
, right

777
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:17,504
I told my kids who used the wrong but how you

778
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,136
Something's going to die

779
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,208
I think that's a real knowledge of thinking multi-step

780
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,744
That is the real nice

781
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,768
On one level

782
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:33,632
No cuz that's what we born to do this is all born to have everything that happened right now

783
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,168
Is ordained by God

784
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,704
And then we do with it

785
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,496
85mm people

786
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:39,776
Every DLC

787
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,800
Perfect yes.

788
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,104
I'm guessing stuff

789
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,640
Wow

790
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,176
So if I understand correctly

791
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,760
If we don't

792
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,784
Allow

793
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
Putin

794
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,856
To reconstitute the ins

795
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,392
Tire USSR

796
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,672
Then

797
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,208
Hit hit

798
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,232
His kids will

799
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,280
Not be able to eat anymore sure

800
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,048
Okay

801
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:06,400
Yeah if you if you deny someone Imperial ambition right

802
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,728
Equivalent of a bird

803
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,264
Right

804
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,848
That is what do you want from Mike Tyson

805
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,640
Who like fine

806
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:23,040
But why are we doing I also think that the philosophy that he's actually espousing is a is a horrifying

807
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,320
A way to live

808
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:30,720
Complete application of responsibility to do anything 100% it's also internal

809
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,744
Convoluted in ink

810
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,512
Consistent

811
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:37,888
Because if he's saying it's humans who get in the way and everything is perfect and you just don't need to interfere

812
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,680
It should not also be true of poop

813
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:43,264
Why is he acting in somewhat isn't his action

814
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,800
Out of sync with this

815
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,848
Natural wonderful Evans

816
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,128
Inflow that he's discussing

817
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,920
You know now that you put it that way

818
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:54,528
What weather what are the limits who has moral agency

819
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,320
I feel like at a certain point

820
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,368
This is this is a conversation

821
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,416
Between a guy who I think

822
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,464
If I sat down and talked to

823
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,256
I could probably get to agree

824
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,280
To what I say

825
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:12,192
And I think you could probably do with both I mean maybe without

826
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,472
Well I mean depending on

827
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,240
What level of

828
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,008
Fury

829
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,032
But

830
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:19,360
But then Alex is just agree to whatever b i c

831
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:23,200
Says so Mike Tyson is a very seemingly easily swayable person

832
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:23,968
At this point in time

833
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,736
Maybe

834
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,808
I'm not sure I don't know enough to say but yeah it's possible

835
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,832
I think that

836
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:32,672
From the other episodes of the clips that I've watch

837
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:36,256
I don't have any really good sense of this

838
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:40,352
But I think it would be possible for you to sit down with Mike Tyson

839
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:43,424
I have a bizarre but okay conversation

840
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,544
I think you'd I think almost anybody would have more chemistry with him than out

841
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,568
Alex

842
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,919
Like everybody else that I've seen on the show I watched a bit of the Eminem

843
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,223
Piers Morgan

844
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,527
Bit of Trina course

845
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,855
Just some other ones I watched a bit of it

846
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,439
They're actually going back and forth

847
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,487
There's a little bit of interplay between them

848
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,791
Just alyx

849
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
What a weird

850
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,631
Situation also thank you so much

851
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:18,239
Can't believe the Dennis Rodman ended the Korean War

852
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,519
He did not first off

853
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,311
Until because why would he

854
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,591
Or how could he

855
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,359
For what

856
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,663
Hung out with

857
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,759
Honestly it's kind of in Dennis Rodman

858
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,831
Work personal interest to end the Korean War

859
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:36,159
He won't get to hang out with his Rich buddy anymore

860
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,975
Also here's the other thing

861
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,047
If Alex were to accept

862
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,863
Tyson's philosophy and worldview

863
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,655
He should not be fighting the globalist

864
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:51,519
Right because if he does clearly the bigger hot

865
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:57,919
It says everything is as it should be doesn't need to kill that big Hawk

866
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,991
Strong murder the week in order to feed their kids

867
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,015
It's the circle of life

868
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,295
That's why you have

869
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:09,183
To let Millions upon millions of ukrainians die honestly I do kind of think that that is

870
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
In line with

871
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,255
Like some of the stuff that I see

872
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:16,863
The spouses is like a natural hierarchy and that it is correct

873
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
Which is bizarre

874
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,959
But we'll get to that a little bit down the line

875
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:25,311
Here is a after this it goes to a clip from

876
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,103
Mike's podcast

877
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,383
Stupid Alex recorded

878
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:39,391
A little shroomy

879
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:42,207
I can actually explain this here at after this clip I think

880
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:19,327
Bookmark

881
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,631
So what

882
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:24,447
He has ears shaped edible

883
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,263
Allentown

884
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:33,151
Bury the hatchet all the way with her maybe she'll get the cut or something

885
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:37,503
Is B

886
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:41,343
Alex is grabbing the bag from him and insisting on biting it

887
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,695
Like to be a good commercial for you or whatever

888
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,975
It's sad

889
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,743
Pink

890
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,535
Maybe the ear looks

891
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:53,887
It's a little bit like a mushroom or something like that seems to be like maybe

892
00:44:54,399 --> 00:45:00,543
What are you getting at maybe they tried to put some of the hallucinatory chemicals in there maybe they don't know maybe it's got a little bit

893
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,103
It or something along those lines I don't know

894
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,639
With the little shroomy

895
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,711
Maybe I don't know it is but it's just a weed edible

896
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,759
Yeah it is a little bit like

897
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:14,623
You know I watch them getting Doug with high and ODed Benson did that

898
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,415
Show at Largo and you would have

899
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,695
Very famous people

900
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,487
Get high together on stage and then the

901
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,279
Beehive state

902
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,559
And the fun of that

903
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,375
Is the natural tension of like

904
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,167
Is somebody going to get too high

905
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,959
Who's going to get too high

906
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:34,591
Somebody does but everybody else just kind of freaks out I do not enjoy that natural tension

907
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,383
This is detention

908
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,407
Everybody's got

909
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,943
Wilbury too hot

910
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:42,527
That is the clip from the podcast that hasn't been there

911
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,319
Are you hot if that's

912
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,855
Indicative of anything

913
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,623
It's like this

914
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,487
This is just not a product you'd want to like

915
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:56,351
All right maybe we can have Alex on another time if he controls himself or something but like

916
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,143
Yeah this is just this is

917
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,727
There's a difference between like Alex

918
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:05,823
Being fun and weird on Rogan show Maybe

919
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,383
Him being kind of embarrassing with Mike Tyson

920
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,199
Know him like Rogan does

921
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,015
It comes off sad

922
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,551
Yeah I wouldn't put

923
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,855
A lot of hallucinogens in front of a person with

924
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,647
Absolutely zero impulse

925
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,415
Control

926
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,231
Teachers

927
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,023
To get back to Alex's interview

928
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,071
Seeing in the last decade or so

929
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,351
Interviews in Lagos

930
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,911
You're doing and I've learned

931
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:34,495
You said a lot of stuff cuz I know a lot of philosophy on History this

932
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,263
Original

933
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,287
What

934
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,823
You're definitely not plagiarizing

935
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,847
Suppose you're coming up with

936
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,871
Assassins

937
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,919
Plug is a zeitgeist

938
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,711
Just like you were plugging was like

939
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,807
Intellectually Eldersburg

940
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,087
Zeitgeist

941
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,367
I just followed

942
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,391
Still the fighting

943
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,719
The spirit of fighting cooking so many different arenas

944
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,815
.

945
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,631
Speedway

946
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,703
Something Clicker

947
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,383
So what do you think you're

948
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,663
What is your current fight

949
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,199
But me

950
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,271
Me and my behavior

951
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,551
Okay alright

952
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:25,951
So I think the one thing that Mike said so far the constitutes like a philosophical thought is that idea that life is

953
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,487
His innocence gradual death

954
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,535
That's not even close to a ridge

955
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,863
Let something like Arthur schopenhauer said that dude died

956
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:33,631
18:6

957
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,423
The entire School

958
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,959
Existential nihilism

959
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,751
To probably agree with Mike to its

960
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:43,615
Unique it all here just to Stone dudes.

961
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,663
What about stuff they don't really understand

962
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:48,991
But they surrounded themselves with people who are too afraid to tell them Bill like

963
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:52,063
This is high school level stuff guys

964
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,087
That's mrs.

965
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
Deep

966
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,439
Kind of

967
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,975
Telling that you think it's

968
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,767
It tells me how deep

969
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:01,791
You

970
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,815
10 to go

971
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,119
I mean

972
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,655
Okay

973
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:11,775
Just cuz you hit people while back doesn't mean you get to grow old into a guru

974
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:15,103
And I feel like a lot of people who hit people awhile back feel like they get

975
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,127
To grow into a guru

976
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,151
And you don't

977
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,175
You just don't

978
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,199
So

979
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:19,967
Bat like

980
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:25,087
Stolen Valor of somebody wearing a black belt

981
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:29,439
Who never earned it is the same as that Valor of

982
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,231
Beat pretending to be a guru

983
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,511
Philosopher philosophize

984
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,559
River of actually learning

985
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:35,839
Sure

986
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,119
Sure I mean

987
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,399
I think I

988
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,935
Don't try to think of other people who

989
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,471
Fit the mold you're talking about

990
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,543
I guess Isaac Eddie Bravo John Claude Van Damme

991
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,567
Well

992
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,103
He was

993
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,151
Quality

994
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,943
The muscles from Brussels

995
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,223
Had a lot of ideas

996
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,503
Steven Seagal

997
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,063
His name what

998
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,599
I listen to it on the dollop

999
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,879
It's Segal

1000
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:03,999
He changed it made it sound like that cuz he didn't like us sounding like he was a Jew

1001
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,791
BoBoiBoy cuz he is

1002
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,607
Alright got lucky socks

1003
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,887
Cinema in the movies

1004

He sucks

1005
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,215
Anyway

1006
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,007
Alex brings up hallucinogen

1007
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,055
This is where we

1008
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,871
First encounter the toad

1009
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:22,943
What about hallucinogens cheap big corporations now

1010
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,479
Studies at Reading

1011
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,271
Mushrooms are they dressing healthy

1012
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:27,807
Synthetic drugs

1013
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,087

As far as DMT as far as

1019
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,327

00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,175
Try to read

1029
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,063
The toad saved Mike's life

1030
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:00,831
Alright

1031
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,671
Specific time

00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,975
No it's

1033
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:10,815
From old TV shows and cartoons are people that lick toads

1034
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,351
Yes the same thing

1035
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,119
It's just that

00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:19,519
Elected totally saved his life apparently this is caught on a little bit

1037

Oh yeah yeah is this like how Ayahuasca with a huge thing like 10 years ago and everybody's like

1038
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,527
Preliminary research going on

1039
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,551
In terms of

1040
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,575
It having add

1041
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,367
Advantageous psychologic

1042

Benefits

1043

Right there are there are some indications that

1044
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,511
They like psilocybin

1045
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:44,095
Can be very helpful for your therapeutic

1046
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:50,495
Ecstasy is amazing for MDMA supposed to be

1047
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,775
Locations that are being

1048
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,543
Explored

1049
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,335
In terms of the toad you are

1050
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,615
But

1051
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,383
Keep it

1052
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,711
And like I would if I ever got me high

1053
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,735

1054
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:07,647
And I would take with me and it would be my emotional support toad so would help me there to you didn't stumble upon a toad

1055
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:13,279
Did it talk in the cartoon made

1056
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,351
Mike compares

1057
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:19,167
The toad to like ayahuasca

1058
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,191

00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:18,207
Codymen

1105
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,535
Alright okay

1106
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
This is

1107
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:25,887
You know right time when Alex Wood box

1108
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,679
The idea of people who sit around

1109
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:33,055
He would make fun of somebody who just sat around and talked about freebasing toes

1110
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,615
Velvet I

1111
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,407
Got to take that toad puss you

1112
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:40,735
Make it into a fine sand and then you Freebase it like Accra

1113
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,039
Good Lord that's that's

1114
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,831
So he described

1115
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,111
What it's like

1116
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:50,207
I understand what you saying of the effect

1117
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,487
Of it being

1118
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:54,303
Positive or possibly freeing for him

1119
00:53:54,559 --> 00:54:00,703
Exactly what he's describing could lead someone to a mental breakdown like jumping out a window

1120
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:01,983
Was like it was like

1121
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:08,383
There were a thousand knives in between each one of my fingers

1122
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:11,967
Because that is really difficult to interpret in a positive way

1123
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,527
What he's talking about is a psychological effect

1124
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,295
He had that I

1125
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,343
Think you could interpret positively

1126
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:21,695
But also it's very easy to imagine someone experiencing the exact same thing

1127
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,975
And it breaking

1128
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,791
So I don't know if I would be so

1129
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:29,375
Quick to describe this is like

1130
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:30,911
Did you say

1131
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,263
Edema

1132
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:38,591
Is Willem you experience everything that you be

1133
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:40,127
Are you afraid to tell somebody cook

1134
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,687
You have opinions about you and Ivy

1135
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,991
If you have to feel the effects

1136
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:47,295
All your troubles

1137
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,575
Naked

1138
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,647
Olivia

1139
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,975
It's just I I cannot take you later

1140
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,999
Is my prince know your

1141
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,863
Yes just letting you know this is who you are

1142
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,887
Deal with this

1143
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:06,751
You have that feeling you don't see anybody you have that feeling that

1144
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,615
Open

1145
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,407
That feeling of Freedom like that

1146
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,991
And in Philly

1147
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:17,759
Completion

1148
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:18,783
Homicidal

1149
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:19,807
Beyonce

1150
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:24,159
60 * 11

1151
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,207
What is nutmeg

1152
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:26,975
Different

1153
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,255
Yeah it's not go ahead

1154
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,119
I can handle

1155
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,655
No

1156
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,935
Don't worry about

1157
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,727
Okay

1158
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:41,311
He's done code 60 times a lot of times to do toads

1159
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:46,687
A lot of a lot of experience of

1160
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:50,527
Feeling like everybody knows all of the things you're ashamed of

1161
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,343
There is a way that you can look at that as like

1162
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,111
Well

1163
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,391
What's the big deal

1164
00:55:55,903 --> 00:56:02,047
I can I can withstand any of this is a liberating feeling that you possibly

1165
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:02,815
Could come too

1166
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:07,423
Or it could be the most intolerable feeling you've ever had in your life

1167
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:12,031
It would be the scariest idea of it to everybody knows everything about you

1168
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:17,919
I don't know I don't know how people respond different

1169
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,711
Here's what I would say to you

1170
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,991
About that exact

1171
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:21,759
Text feeling

1172
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:22,527
And who it is

1173
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,831
Spring to and who does not freaking to

1174
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,367
It is freaking to

1175
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:32,767
Celebrities who everybody already knows everything about that men make up bulshit all the time and they have to deal with it anytime

1176
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,303
Diamond anywhere they want to do any

1177
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,863
I would even bet that some celebrities who would not be

1178
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,471
I think it really comes down to like

1179
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,775
The way your mind experience

1180
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:48,127
Yeah like I don't even know if that would be

1181
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:55,295
Yeah cuz I don't know if that would be a universal experience for people to have

1182
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:02,719
What are the USDA ratings

1183
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,999
Yeah it

1184
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:06,815
It's strange to play

1185
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,839
Get Thursday like

1186
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,119
There's a

1187
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,399
Level

1188
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,679
That would be different

1189
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,959
Between different people of like

1190
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:16,031
What are the things you don't want to tell.

1191
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,055
Cuz some people

1192
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:17,823
It's kind of like

1193
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,127
Trivial stuff in for some people it's like while I killed so

1194
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,431
Well for Alex would be like well I didn't

1195
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:27,807
And everything I'm saying it's a lie and has been for almost three decades

1196
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,087
Put like

1197
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:34,463
There are differences differences in terms of self-awareness

1198
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,487
Like

1199
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:38,303
You might not have access to

1200
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,351
Things that you shouldn't feel guilty about

1201
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,399
In some cases

1202
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:47,519
And some people have too much access to things to feel guilty about things that they don't need to feel

1203
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:51,359
I all that worried about and I think they'll be difficult

1204
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,151
In the toad scape

1205
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,175
Do I

1206
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:54,943
Parcel

1207
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,223
I mean based on what

1208
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:58,271
Mike Tyson is describing I think

1209
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:01,087
Toad would absolutely kill Alec

1210
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:01,855
Alex Jones

1211
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,135
Brain-dead in an insta

1212
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:05,695
If it works the way that he says it does.

1213
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,999
He would suddenly be flooded

1214
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:08,767
With

1215
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,583
An unconscionable amount of sin

1216
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:12,863
In one mole

1217
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:17,983
So many fake plants

1218
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:23,871
The total perspective Vortex for all your good

1219
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,175
So look you asked if it's standardized

1220
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:30,271
I'm interested in Mike gets his toe.

1221
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,599
Dino's real talk

1222
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,231
Cuz obviously we're talking about surprise

1223
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,535
Shamanism

1224
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,583
He's pretty much like that

1225
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,167
The toads in the message

1226
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,591
Well

1227
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:58,687
That's amazing amazing that a shaman who does nothing but give people

1228
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,967
Toad knows about toads

1229
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,271
You got a toad shop

1230
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:05,855
The Mushroom Kingdom

1231
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,671
Not a good one that's

1232
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,607
I think I would go

1233
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,375
Yes

1234
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:24,031
Cochon might be sketchy dude

1235
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:27,871
Who calls himself instead of the toad dealer

1236
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:34,783
Well he wears different clothes that dude expected dealers that you are glowing outfit

1237
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,599
Corner

1238
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,623
You want some

1239
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,303
Baby

1240
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:54,239
Oh God I'm so out of touch with stuff that I didn't realize this was coming back as like a big hallucinogen

1241
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,031
Tell I was listening to this on my

1242
00:59:56,287 --> 01:00:01,151
Look into this I looked it up

1243
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,199
It's

1244
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:05,503
Recently become a lot more prevalent but

1245
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:07,295
It just seems so silly to me because

1246
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:13,951
It's it is the same thing as licking toads

1247
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:20,607
Yeah I like maybe one of your dumb Friends lick they not hallucinogenic toad finger

1248
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:24,191
This is funny

1249
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:28,799
Just licking toes if you just hear that's pet stores

1250
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:31,615
You're just don't want to actually lick the toad and get all the

1251
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,639
Pee on their on

1252
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,919
On top of your

1253
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,199
That's weak tea

1254
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,735
I don't like you got to

1255
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:39,807
You take the good with the bad asthma Tyson himself

1256
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:44,671
I would say is that toad is going to be able to feed its family rights like going to Laos

1257
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,463
I am going to McDonald's

1258
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:51,583
Exactly come on powerlix code

1259
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:57,471
Another clip now from Mike's podcast Alex recorded

1260
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,519
This is some deep stuff

1261
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:01,055
Stuff about geopolitics

1262
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:08,223
His back

1263
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:14,623
Show me the word the word

1264
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:25,791
What is ecology

1265
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:39,359
Family show host Alex Jones

1266
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:46,015
Giving Nancy Pelosi analingus

1267
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:52,415
Everybody was like

1268
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,303
And think it feels like they're laughing at him

1269
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:01,631
Absolutely it's not like this is a funny guy

1270
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:04,959
Look at this look at this Village

1271
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,751
I'll look that you're really got

1272
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,311
Man

1273
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:13,151
Also that's a co-host who's asking the question

1274
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,943
He didn't know that bite

1275
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:17,503
To go into Ukraine cuz I didn't

1276
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:22,111
No no no he didn't do that

1277
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:26,975
Yeah I would have been a very weird thing for a president to have done and then to put in

1278
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:28,255
Listen to the news

1279
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,535
What are you going to do

1280
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:35,935
Well you got to rely on Alex to come in and do some drugs and tell you all about it if I didn't get my pay

1281
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:41,823
Text information from somebody who just took a weed gummy ear then where am I going to get it from

1282
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:48,735
So the Pelosi talked continued

1283
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,503
I know

1284
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:11,007
Label

1285
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:22,527

What about one of our mutual friends Joe Rogan God

1289
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,999
This is annoying wow

1290
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:37,887
You know the thought occurs to me that Alex and Nancy have more in common

1291
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,911
And then Alex

1292
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,447
Or Nancy have with the rest

1293
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,215
Rest of the world

1294
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:43,007
Yeah that may be true

1295
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:48,639
People with 100 million dollars are really only relatable to people

1296
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,711
Let's see

1297
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,503
The detachment

1298
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,783
Certainly from

1299
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:55,551
For both of them

1300
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,831
Oh yeah

Tap water

1304
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:03,487
I think they're doing the right thing

1305
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:06,815
But ultimately often are are making problems worse

1306
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:11,167
Borderline sociopathic whenever faced with an actual problem

1307
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,727
Analingus

1308
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:16,799

01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,103
Yeah that's

1310
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:24,991
Look at it if this is indicative of what the conversation was like on the podcast itself

1311
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,015
I'm putting that

1312
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,039

Joe Rogan

1324
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:56,479
What do you make of all the attempts to

1325
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,295
Cancel him I didn't want any bigger

1326
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,343
How do you stink

1327
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:05,439
How do you think some people is so

1328
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,535
McGuffey Blasphemous for your soul

1329
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,327
And dignified

1330
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,351
They feel as if

1331
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:17,215
I don't want to hear that damn say that not even directed towards

1332
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,543
Eva wanted to fight other battle that don't even care

1333
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,311
Concerned

1334
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:25,407
You know that I don't know if that's the root of the world everybody wants

1335
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,431
The fight

1336
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,455
Jalalabad

1337
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,247
At the fight something

1338
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:32,319
We can't fight something fire self Achilles overdraw

1339
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,391
The state of our country

1340
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:38,207
Physical

1341
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:38,975
Altercation

1342
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:42,303
Yeah and so they see jogging Biggs they decided Angela Villa

1343
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,583
Listen

1344
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,143
Is this country must

1345
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,167
Advantage of

1346
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:58,687
Yeah that doesn't sound like somebody who thinks history started 9,000 years ago Envy one of the deadly sins

1347
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,967
Never heard of it before

1348
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:03,039
Don't covet thy neighbor's wife

1349
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,319
That's

1350
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,367
Thomas Paine

1351
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:09,951
Port on The Federalist Papers

1352
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:14,815
Sure sure

1353
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,375
I don't find this that interesting

1354
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:20,191
Thankfully things start to pick up a little bit and

1355
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:20,959
Next clip

1356
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,495
Why is America

1357
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:25,055
The most successful but also the best

1358
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,335
But also the most evil

1359
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,663
Because I'm

1360
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,199
The meaning of life

1361
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,991
Successful

1362
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,063
If this was

1363
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,111
A perfect world

1364
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,647
We live in a perfect world all the

1365
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:45,535
Group switch

1366
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,327
Kill each other baby driver

1367
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,119
And then we stop mating

1368
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,399
And then we'll all die

1369
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,447
That's what a perfect world with

1370
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,263
Imagine her having everything in the world with

1371
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,311
Button

1372
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,103
Play the war was struggle

1373
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,383
Is life in the

1374
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,199
Did happen listen this

1375
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:05,247
I never wanted to believe this

1376
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:08,575
Plus my studying life and woman

1377
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,343
What was his name

1378
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,671
Perfect

1379
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,207
People need to be

1380
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,487
Hit the bottom

1381
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,023
Cheetah dab to the top

1382
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,815
And they need

1383
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,119
Yes

1384
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,423
There's a lot going on there

1385
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,727
Perfect Society

1386
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:26,751
We would all die

1387
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:27,519
Right

1388
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,311
I don't understand

1389
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:32,127
Necessarily what basis there is

1390
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,175
Wow

1391
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:35,967
I mean

1392
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:36,991
I think

1393
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:37,759
Maybe

1394
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,063
I'm going to be real generous

1395
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:44,159
Maybe he's saying that the only way for society

1396
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,183
To be perfect

1397
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:45,951
Is 4:30

1398
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,975
Tubino Society

1399
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,743
No

1400
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,767
Do you know

1401
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,047
If everybody's dead

1402
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,839
Vince society's perfect

1403
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:58,495
Not at all if we had all of our material needs handled it taken care of

1404
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,287
We would turn into roving

1405
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,823
Communities of

1406
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,615
Fighting people who kill each other

1407
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,175
And then everyone would die because we would stop

1408
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:12,831
Reproducing or something yeah I was trying to trying to avoid we stopped reproducing even if we

1409
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,903
We were in like gangs that were killing each other

1410
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,695
People at War still f***

1411
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:18,719
No

1412
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,255
No they don't

1413
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,559
We got we'd all be too sad

1414
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,327
From having

1415
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,375
Too many of our needs matdan

1416
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,167
I mean look I don't

1417
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:29,983
Really know what to take away from that other than like

1418
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,543
Clearly there seems to be a belief that

1419
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:35,871
Aim is what makes life possible

1420
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,919
If I'm really grasping

1421
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:42,015
Poverty is essential for in an order for

1422
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,039
The world

1423
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:48,927
To continue to exist as we know from early American history life is suffer

1424
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,999
That's one of them four noble truths of the tenth

1425
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,655
I think the

1426
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,679
Bizarre

1427
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:04,287
Also the idea that god-ordained some kind of a hierarchy

1428
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:06,847
Border or whatever

1429
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:08,383
Is really dumb

1430
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,151
Because

1431
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:12,479
It's changed a lot

1432
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,039
Overtime at what point in time

1433
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,855
It is the natural pecking order at

1434
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:20,415
Is it under a monarchy system is it

1435
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,207
Under a feudal system is it

1436
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:27,327
But whatever we've got going on now in the communism

1437
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:30,655
Who's to say which is the the system that God ordained

1438
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,447
I'm going to throw this out at you

1439
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:36,543
Maybe what he's really saying is that things are going pretty good for me right now

1440
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:40,383
I get the feeling that there's a little bit of that

1441
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:44,223
Maybe I would be more interested in fighting for other people

1442
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:46,015
If my needs work mat right now

1443
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:48,831
And also I think that there's a really

1444
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,599
Troubling

1445
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,391
End result

1446
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,695
Of his thought process here which is

1447
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:57,535
This notion that everything is as it should be and you shouldn't

1448
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:00,095
Fight things and all that

1449
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:05,215
There's a little bit of a few no sort of a spiritual Detachment from

1450
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,495
Stuff that can be pause

1451
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,543
Legitimately what he

1452
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:09,823
He is advocating

1453
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:12,127
4 would have led to

1454
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,663
Civil rights never happened

1455
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,735
There is a

1456
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:20,575
There is an application of any responsibility to

1457
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:24,159
To further the amount of people who

1458
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:25,695
Alright enjoy

1459
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:28,511
Here's a here's a modicum of freedom

1460
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:30,303
Here's what I'll say based upon what he

1461
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:31,071
You saying

1462
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:36,447
I'll go the opposite direction he said that a perfect Society where everybody needs are met we all wind up dying

1463
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:40,543
I would say it's a society built around his ideas

1464
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:43,615
One with rampant income inequality

1465
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:46,431
With a ruling class

1466
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:48,991
Rapacious Lee treating the world

1467
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:51,295
It would would actually lead to

1468
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,831
To everybody killing each other and die

1469
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,623
And I'm just throwing that out there

1470
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:55,391
Based on

1471
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:56,927
Last year

1472
01:11:59,487 --> 01:11:59,999
Fight

1473
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,791
No actually not fight

1474
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:02,815
More things that don't

1475
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,351
Directly affect you

1476
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:10,751
Why does everyone care about

1477
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:17,407
Info but you're not transfer your problem is people just

1478
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:23,039
You want to fight that's all it is you just want to fight you don't care about anybody

1479
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:24,575
Bordering on

1480
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:28,159
Nihilistic worldview that find objection

1481
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:31,999
These are deeply held belief

1482
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:38,655
But he has or if they're just High kind of what I was thinking

1483
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,423
With a cam

1484
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,751
Versation going the other way you be like well obviously everybody

1485
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:46,591
They should be taken care of in trans rights are really important and I don't know I don't know

1486
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:50,175
Held beliefs

1487
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,967
Empowered

1488
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:55,295
I don't know anything about empowered by Muse

1489
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,599
I'm I'm enjoying this

1490
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,623
Life in

1491
01:12:59,135 --> 01:12:59,647
Looking forward

1492
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,671
Death as well

1493
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:04,255
Will you talk about looking forward to death my we don't want you to leave this plane

1494
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,047
Anytime soon but

1495
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,839
What you want

1496
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:08,607
When people lie

1497
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,679
You're right so your geek

1498
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:14,495
Oh absolutely

1499
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,287
That for what I

1500
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,823
What I believe death is death

1501
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,383
Def Leppard I believe

1502
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,151
That's when I really began

1503
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,479
I think

1504
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:25,247
Positive

1505
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,271
Saying about making

1506
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,807
Peace with the reality of death

1507
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:30,623
Text relizen process

1508
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:33,183
I don't really feel like I said Mike's doing

1509
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:42,143
God I can't wait to be having a lot in common in regards to like that

1510
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:44,191
You know this all this whole thing is

1511
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,471
The cast in this is all

1512
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:50,847
And everything is created as a trial and then when you die you get the good

1513
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:53,151
The difference is that Alex thinks you go to

1514
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:55,199
Space and you fly around strip

1515
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,223
And Mike thing

1516
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,015
Thanks you hang out with a toad

1517
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,807
I mean it's pretty cool too

1518
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:02,367
And if you lick it even when you're dead you get high

1519
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,391
I so that's worth it

1520
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,183
Wright's liquor

1521
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:11,071
And you think you're all alive for about it as opposed to take Internet yourself

1522
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,375
God

1523
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:16,191
Why doesn't actually walk to die that's

1524
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,471
The distinctive navigate to make

1525
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,007
But you're not

1526
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:23,359
You're not going to check out the concert

1527
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:26,175
If I want to go somewhere

1528
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:28,991
I'ma go somewhere I'm not going to have any Grammy somebody's going to

1529
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:32,063
Amelie after your kill me I'm not going through all that

1530
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,599
Please take my money I know that

1531
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,367
Crap

1532
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,135
Is just

1533
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,415
This is Alan my life

1534
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:37,695
Free

1535
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:41,279
I'd like to believe it's free but it's not as attempted

1536
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:43,839
I got to tell you

1537
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,375
Mike Tyson like

1538
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:47,679
The biggest philosopher in the world right now.

1539
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,447
Your point

1540
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,727
What other

1541
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:53,823
I'll call you I miss really awesome

1542
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,615
And even though people if

1543
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,151
Think this is stupid Nietzsche

1544
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:59,199
Psychic

1545
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:03,807
Alright

1546
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:07,647
So did he say that him and his psychic like Nietzsche if you want it

1547
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:11,743
Alright that makes a lot more sense of this whole

1548
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:12,767
Giving someone life

1549
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,815
Is giving someone death bulshit

1550
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:17,887
Also

1551
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,703
Describing there is like a really likely situation like

1552
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:24,543
A Mugger is out looking for someone to Rob and he chooses Mike Tyson

1553
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:28,127
Gigantic man with a face tattoo who's considered one of the best

1554
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:32,223
Punchers in boxing history I mean obviously you burgle into his house

1555
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:34,271
Gone what kind of idiot would Rob

1556
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:40,671
If I were like I would live my life free from the fear of that happening throughout that did not trouble me too much

1557
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,951
It would be interesting to have

1558
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,975
0 fizzy

1559
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,743
Nicole

1560
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:44,511
Like threat

1561
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,279
Ever

1562
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:50,911
Maybe you have some from a weapon or a sniper what are the odds of that are pretty low

1563
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:56,031
Also I don't want to be a dick here but the idea you may not be free but are trying

1564
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:59,359
Bfree that's nowhere near a new philosophical idea

1565
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:03,455
I think that's kind of a problem with the information space that this interview lives

1566
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:06,783
It's not grounded in any kind of education on the subject

1567
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,575
Exeter being thrown around like this is

1568
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:14,207
There's like freshman-level philosophy class ideas

1569
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,999
Literally just threw out

1570
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,023
Young and Nietzsche

1571
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,327
The thing every freshman

1572
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:24,191
What class has especially freshmen edgelord tight

1573
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:26,751
Haha

1574
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:32,639
So we're coming to the end of this interview and I would say that if the other episode is anything like this I would not want to

1575
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,919
Who put it out myself

1576
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,711
It's just not worth the hassle and the

1577
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:39,039
Quality of content makes this show look like an amateur operation

1578
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:45,951
We are an amateur operation and I would still be uncomfortable airing this is an episode of our show

1579
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:46,719
Not do it

1580
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:49,279
Alex the calculus is different though

1581
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,071
He puts up nothing but loads

1582
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:53,887
Trash and there's no real downside for him

1583
01:16:54,399 --> 01:17:00,543
The quality of content isn't important than the infowar as evidenced by The Unbelievable volume of unwatchable videos on

1584
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,567
Banned. Video

1585
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,871
For Alex the quality is irrelevant

1586
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:06,431
He was able to record a thing with a celebrity

1587
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:09,247
He knows that thing is going to drawing a lot of attention

1588
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:14,367
So that thing needs to be put out regardless of how little there is going on in it and how

1589
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:15,903
Dumbs

1590
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,183
I mean

1591
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,463
Yeah it doesn't he doesn't

1592
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,743
Want people to listen to

1593
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:20,511
Intuit

1594
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,791
This is Bonfield talk about

1595
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:26,399
Exactly he wants people he wants people on Twitter to clown on him for being such a drunk

1596
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,679
Dum dum he want

1597
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:33,567
People to be outraged or whatever he doesn't actually care if anybody listens to the podcast

1598
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:35,103
Is that people keep talking

1599
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:40,223
So are we have a couple clips left

1600
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:43,039
One of them is Mike having a interesting

1601
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,575
Take on covid

1602
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,111
I doubt

1603
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,391
Bi-Rite

1604
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,439
Grover

1605
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,487
Because of the stuff

1606
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:54,303
I never knew it what

1607
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:56,607
Covid-19

1608
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,375
I asked

1609
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,727
I don't know I don't know

1610
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,519
Politically correct for me to fit in

1611
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:07,359
Could people have died from it

1612
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:10,943
I know it's a viral disease where people died at but

1613
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,503
Me myself person I've been around thousands of people

1614
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:20,927
A couple of times I've been in the same bus twice this year

1615
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:25,791
I've been around a bunch of people hugging and kissing eating with

1616
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:27,583
People who don't have mapping

1617
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,607
I'm okay

1618
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,031
I do have

1619
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:44,991
Love and hugs

1620
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,319
Ubermensch

1621
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,231
FYE

1622
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:57,535
None up so why do you think you never got it

1623
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:02,399
I don't know but this is what I also know to

1624
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,983
A person that has a disease can.

1625
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:08,031
Psychologically faster than a

1626
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,103
I really know that

1627
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,127
I know that

1628
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:14,943
That

1629
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:15,711
You know Mike

1630
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:19,295
I have a case of like an asymptomatic case or

1631
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:21,343
Maybe a mild case that he didn't

1632
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:25,951
No really knows almost

1633
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:29,535
Text Nate if you might have gotten

1634
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,815
Vaccinated and I could have

1635
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:31,839
Taking his risk

1636
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:32,863
Significantly

1637
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:34,655
Lay down but not

1638
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:37,727
It based on what he has said so far I highly doubt

1639
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,263
But that he would want somebody to

1640
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:46,687
I think you're right

1641
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:49,503
Open triple back

1642
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,527
And I'm fine

1643
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:51,551
I'm literally

1644
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:54,111
Mike f****** Tyson what are you up to say

1645
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:55,903
Yeah I think you're probably right

1646
01:19:56,159 --> 01:20:00,255
I'm not going to get it is stupid

1647
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:02,815
And then second I don't know

1648
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:04,863
If I trust fully that he never got it

1649
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:08,703
I haven't been sick

1650
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:10,495
Very careful I wear mask

1651
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:13,311
Avoided

1652
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,080
Areas

1653
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,616
Especially indoors

1654
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:17,664
You know this.

1655
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:21,504
I don't know for sure that I haven't gotten

1656
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,832
Cuz I could have had a case that I didn't identify

1657
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:29,696
There's there's it is entirely possible if you did I didn't like neither of us have

1658
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,720
Tested positive

1659
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:36,096
That does not mean that we tested when we may have had an asymptomatic case

1660
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,912
So I mean Atlantic City odds

1661
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,192
For Tyson

1662
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:46,080
Significantly higher based on the description of his his behavior

1663
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:50,688
Wow you know what that is that is kind of a

1664
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:55,808
I don't know I suppose a childlike way of trying to view the world

1665
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:58,112
Old is kind of what I'm seeing right now is just

1666
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,136
This idea of like

1667
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:02,464
Well it whatever happens happens and if it's not happy

1668
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,744
Nothing to me it'll never happen

1669
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,560
And all of this like I don't have any

1670
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,328
Concern

1671
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,632
And while I understand that not having

1672
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,912
Concern can look like

1673
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:11,680
Like freedom

1674
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:15,264
What it really more is is Narcissus

1675
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,384
That might be another thing needs to happen, could be

1676
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,944
Sorry about my Scorpio during the Mike down for this

1677
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,736
Because I think this is actually going to give

1678
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,784
Caviar into your wheelhouse

1679
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,576
Here and

1680
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,624
I don't know I think I think

1681
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,416
You might have some things to learn from Mike

1682
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,720
I could even believe some people could even

1683
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,024
What is that

1684
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,072
Projecting something

1685
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:39,840
Can get themselves

1686
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,376
That worrying so much

1687
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,960
I confess believe that they have covid-19

1688
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:45,984
They actually get it

1689
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,008
We're themselves

1690
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,312
After

1691
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,200
Puscifer

1692
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,480
Who did was China

1693
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:59,296
That's why I became Buddha Kitty

1694
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,064
Panhandle

1695
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:04,672
Make sure you get to a Christina cell phone

1696
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,440
Afraid

1697
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,976
Delete The Saturdays

1698
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:16,704
Wow

1699
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,728
Why would indeed

1700
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:22,592
Wow indeed that is that is a wow moment for somebody to say

1701
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:28,992
Wow I was born to Wild you brought up the four noble truths earlier

1702
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:35,392
Oh just my god wow somebody who has a passing interest in Buddhism

1703
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:37,184
I have three statement

1704
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:43,840
Mike Tyson made in that last click on the Buddha scale

1705
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:44,864
Yes okay

1706
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,936
The first one is he became Buddha because he could

1707
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:49,472
Handle that people were suffering

1708
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:51,008
How true

1709
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,312
Do you assess this statement to be

1710
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,080
Well

1711
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,384
I would say

1712
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,920
Not at all true

1713
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:00,992
I mean

1714
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,272
Sidarta wasn't like

1715
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,040
Stokes

1716
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:07,904
The super-rich to really concerned can you possibly be

1717
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,720
If your solution after being super rich

1718
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,768
Is to go sit under a f****** tree

1719
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:16,608
Motivation wasn't entirely

1720
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:20,192
Like he couldn't handle the people were supper or like what the fuc

1721
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:26,080
He said there's no such thing as suffering God did not create suffering

1722
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:28,128
Oh well let's start with God

1723
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:32,480
Let's chat with for free

1724
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:33,760
What's that truth again

1725
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:34,784
Life

1726
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,808
Louvre

1727
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:38,368
Seven things that he said

1728
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:41,440
The Buddha was like there's no suffering God didn't create it

1729
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:43,232
Quite the opposite little bit off

1730
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,584
What is a it

1731
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,632
Self suffering that we suffer from

1732
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:55,008
There's a way you could kind of make that work cuz cycling is

1733
01:23:55,264 --> 01:24:01,408
What your desires are if you want to say that Detachment is equal to self suffering and that

1734
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,688
In that regard

1735
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:03,712
Stretch

1736
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:06,272
Kind of get there that like

1737
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:07,296
Yeah yeah

1738
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:08,320
It's it's

1739
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:10,112
Close to accurate is you're going to get but

1740
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:11,904
Beaten ocean that there's no such thing

1741
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,464
Real fun

1742
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,024
Is bananas also the idea that he's mixing it up with

1743
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,816
Yeah I mean

1744
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:21,120
That's kind of

1745
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,144
That makes

1746
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:25,472
It does seem like his knowledge of philosophy is just a

1747
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,240
To Jumble

1748
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,544
That pops out when it comes to branch

1749
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:33,664
He likes young man but he's not eating as much

1750
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:34,688
Sure but

1751
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:35,456
To throw that out

1752
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:37,504
That's that powerful

1753
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:42,112
It definitely deserves a wow from out only throw this out at

1754
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:43,904
How much

1755
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,952
Does history lie to a stand

1756
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:49,024
Mike know something that we don't know

1757
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,816
Yes I told him

1758
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:53,632
The Buddha actually said there's no such thing as suffer

1759
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,448
Pissed if it towed was actually I'm a Tabata

1760
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:06,944
So we come to the end of this sort of wacky when

1761
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:11,552
Some interesting

1762
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,624
I really was impressed

1763
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,160
With the most

1764
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,440
He's like

1765
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,512
Little

1766
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:22,048
Vibe there was

1767
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:22,816
Between the

1768
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,096
That was

1769
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:33,312
Eddie Bravo like there's at least an electric chemistry between them they could make something like kind of fun

1770
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,336
Fun to watch

1771
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:38,688
Flagrant 2 podcast

1772
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:40,992
Those dudes were going along with him

1773
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:43,552
Like they were taking his energy and coasting with

1774
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:47,136
Where is like this is just two dudes who like

1775
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:49,952
Are it like not incompatible.

1776
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,232
They're not like

1777
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:53,280
They're not vibing at all

1778
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,048
Question answer

1779
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,584
Answer with a pot

1780
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:58,144
Like there's no give back there's no like

1781
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,936
You know any moment where it goes

1782
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:06,336
And here's what I and then you go back and he goes back

1783
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,360
That sounds right

1784
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,896
Actually they proven that

1785
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:10,944
How many goes on to the next question

1786
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:14,528
Cuz he doesn't want to follow up with his b******* because then he's going to get into a ditch

1787
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:21,440
Anyway

1788
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:26,560
Maybe we can figure out what he wants to say about the killers

1789
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:28,864
But until then we have

1790
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:39,360
I hope you all have

1791
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:43,200
Have a wonderful and three me and

1792
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,248

Birthstone colors
